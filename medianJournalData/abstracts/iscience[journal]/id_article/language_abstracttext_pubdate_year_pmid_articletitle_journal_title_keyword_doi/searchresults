is associated with the aggregation of proteins bearing solvent-exposed hydrophobicity as a result of their misfolding and\/or proteolytic cleavage. An understanding of the cellular protein quality control mechanisms which prevent protein aggregation is fundamental to understanding the etiology of neurodegeneration. By examining the metabolism of disease-linked C-terminal fragments of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43), we found that the Bcl-2 associated athanogene 6 (BAG6) functions as a sensor of proteolytic fragments bearing exposed hydrophobicity and prevents their intracellular aggregation. In addition, BAG6 facilitates the ubiquitylation of TDP43 fragments by recruiting the Ub-ligase, Ring finger protein 126 (RNF126). Authenticating its role in preventing aggregation, we found that TDP43 fragments form intracellular aggregates in the absence of BAG6. Finally, we found that BAG6 could interact with and solubilize additional neurodegeneration-associated proteolytic fragments. Therefore, BAG6 plays a general role in preventing intracellular aggregation associated with neurodegeneration.","1":"Large offspring syndrome (LOS) and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are similar epigenetic congenital overgrowth conditions in ruminants and humans, respectively. We have reported global loss-of-imprinting, methylome epimutations, and gene misregulation in LOS. However, less than 4% of gene misregulation can be explained with short range (&lt;20kb) alterations in DNA methylation. Therefore, we hypothesized that methylome epimutations in LOS affect chromosome architecture which results in misregulation of genes located at distances &gt;20kb in cis and in trans (other chromosomes). Our analyses focused on two imprinted domains that frequently reveal misregulation in these syndromes, namely KvDMR1 and IGF2R. Using bovine fetal fibroblasts, we identified CTCF binding at IGF2R imprinting control region but not KvDMR1, and allele-specific chromosome architecture of these domains in controls. In LOS, analyses identified erroneous long-range contacts and clustering tendency in the direction of expression of misregulated genes. In conclusion, altered chromosome architecture is associated with LOS.","2":"Brain inflammation generally accelerates neurodegeneration. Alzheimer's disease (AD) triggers an innate immune response by activating a cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)\/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway. Our study investigated patients with leprosy and AD. They were treated with dapsone (4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, DDS) as a neuroinflammasome competitor and cGAS\/STING pathway inhibitor. Four groups were defined: Treatment (T) 1: DDS prescribed AD diagnosed, T 2: DDS prescribed AD undiagnosed, T 3 DDS unprescribed AD diagnosed, and T 4: DDS unprescribed AD undiagnosed. Dapsone effects on AD can be clearly distinguished according to dapsone presence or absence. T1:T3 proved that the incidence of AD was significantly reduced by dapsone. T2:T3 proved that the prevalence of AD was significantly high without dapsone. T1:T4 proved that the prevalence decreased when taking dapsone. Our study demonstrates that dapsone can prevent AD exacerbation and may represent a preventive therapeutic option for exacerbated AD.","3":"Patient heterogeneity precludes cancer treatment and drug development; hence, development of methods for finding prognostic markers for individual treatment is urgently required. Here, we present Pasmopy (Patient-Specific Modeling in Python), a computational framework for stratification of patients using in silico signaling dynamics. Pasmopy converts texts and sentences on biochemical systems into an executable mathematical model. Using this framework, we built a model of the ErbB receptor signaling network, trained in cultured cell lines, and performed in silico simulation of 377 patients with breast cancer using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) transcriptome datasets. The temporal dynamics of Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and c-Myc in each patient were able to accurately predict the difference in prognosis and sensitivity to kinase inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our model applies to any type of signaling network and facilitates the network-based use of prognostic markers and prediction of drug response.","4":"Despite their capacity to acquire and pass on an array of debilitating pathogens, research on ticks has lagged behind other arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes, largely because of challenges in applying available genetic and molecular tools. CRISPR-Cas9 is transforming non-model organism research; however, successful gene editing has not yet been reported in ticks. Technical challenges for injecting tick embryos to attempt gene editing have further slowed research progress. Currently, no embryo injection protocol exists for any chelicerate species, including ticks. Herein, we report a successful embryo injection protocol for the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and the use of this protocol for genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9. We also demonstrate that the ReMOT Control technique could be successfully used to generate genome mutations outside Insecta. Our results provide innovative tools to the tick research community that are essential for advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing pathogen transmission by tick vectors and the underlying biology of host-vector-pathogen interactions.","5":null,"6":null,"7":"Liquid phase leakage, intrinsic rigidity, and easy brittle failure are the longstanding bottlenecks of phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage, which seriously hinder their widespread applications in advanced energy-efficient systems. Emerging flexible composite PCMs that are capable of enduring certain deformation and guaranteeing superior mutual contact with integrated devices are considered as a cutting-edge effective solution. Flexible PCMs-based thermal regulation technology can reallocate thermal energy and regulate the temperature within an optimal range. Currently, tireless efforts are devoted to the development of versatile flexible PCMs-based thermal regulation devices, and a big step forward has been taken. Herein, we systematically outline fabrication techniques, flexibility evaluation strategies, advanced functions and advances of flexible composite PCMs. Furthermore, existing challenges and future perspectives are provided in terms of flexible PCMs-based thermal regulation techniques. This insightful review aims to provide an in-depth understanding and constructive guidance of engineering advanced flexible multifunctional PCMs.","8":"Viscosification of carbon dioxide by polymers can make large scale CO2 sequestration safe and efficient. We present solubility of branched hydrocarbon oligomers in CO2 and viscosification measurements at relevant subsurface conditions. Polymers of 1-decene (P1D) with about 20 repeating units are found to be effective in CO2 viscosification, increasing it by 6.5-fold at 1.8 wt% concentration at 308 K and 31 MPa. We reason that methyl groups and branching promote solubility and viscosification. Low molecular weight oligomers can have lower solubility in CO2 than higher molecular weight ones and the trend in solubility is non-monotonic at constant pressure and temperature. Analysis of solubility trend of P1D oligomers in CO2 advances our understanding of molecular structure and functionality and opens the path to engineering of oligomers effective in viscosification and widespread use of CO2.","9":"The 2021 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, for the first time, stated that CO2 removal will be necessary to meet our climate goals. However, there is a cost to accomplish CO2 removal or mitigation that varies by source. Accordingly, a sensible strategy to prevent climate change begins by mitigating emission sources requiring the least energy and capital investment per ton of CO2, such as new emitters and long-term stationary sources. The production of CO2-derived products should also start by favoring processes that bring to market high-value products with sufficient margin to tolerate a higher cost of goods.","10":null,"11":null,"12":"L3MBTL2 is a crucial component of ncPRC1.6 and has been implicated in transcriptional repression and chromatin compaction. However, the repression mechanism of L3MBTL2 and its biological functions are largely undefined. Here, we found that L3MBTL2 plays a distinct oncogenic role in tumor development. We demonstrated that L3MBTL2 repressed downstream CGA through an H2AK119ub1-dependent mechanism. Importantly, the binding of the MGA\/MAX heterodimer to the E-box on the CGA promoter enhanced the specific selective repression of CGA by L3MBTL2. CGA encodes the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones; however, we showed that CGA plays an individual tumor suppressor role in PDAC. Moreover, CGA-transcript1 (T1) was identified as the major transcript, and the tumor suppression function of CGA-T1 depends on its own glycosylation. Furthermore, glycosylated CGA-T1 inhibited PDAC, partly by repression of autophagy through multiple pathways, including PI3K\/Akt\/mTOR and TP53INP2 pathways. These findings reveal the important roles of L3MBTL2 and CGA in tumor development.","13":"With the ever-increased greenhouse effect and energy crisis, developing novel photocatalysts to realize high-efficient solar-driven chemicals\/fuel production is of great scientific and practical significance. Recently, single-atom photocatalysts (SAPs) are promising catalysts with maximized metal dispersion and tuneable coordination environments. SAPs exhibit boosted photocatalytic performance by enhancing optical response, facilitating charge carrier transfer behaviors or directly manipulating surface reaction processes. In this regard, this article systematically reviews the state-of-the-art progress in the development and application of SAPs, especially the mechanism and performance of SAPs on various reaction processes. Some future challenges and potential research directions over SAPs are outlined at the final stage.","14":"Characterizing the mechanical properties of engineered tissue constructs provides powerful insight into the function of engineered tissues for their desired application. Current methods of mechanical characterization of soft hydrogels used in tissue engineering are often destructive and ignore the effect of 3D bioprinting on the overall mechanical properties of a whole tissue construct. This work reports on using a non-destructive method of viscoelastic analysis to demonstrate the influence of bioprinting strategy on mechanical properties of hydrogel tissue scaffolds. Structure-function relationships are developed for common 3D bioprinting parameters such as printed fiber size, printed scaffold pattern, and bioink formulation. Further studies include mechanical properties analysis during degradation, real-time monitoring of crosslinking, mechanical characterization of multi-material scaffolds, and monitoring the effect of encapsulated cell growth on the mechanical strength of 3D bioprinted scaffolds. We envision this method of characterization opening a new wave of understanding and strategy in tissue engineering.","15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":"We investigated whether nonreproductive social interactions may be rewarding for colonial but not non-colonial species. We found that the colonial spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) is significantly more gregarious, more prosocial, and less aggressive than its non-colonial relative, the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus). In an immediate-early gene study, we examined oxytocin (OT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neural responses to interactions with a novel, same-sex conspecific or a novel object. The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) OT cell group was more responsive to interactions with a conspecific compared to a novel object in both species. However, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) TH cell group showed differential responses only in spiny mice. Further, PVN OT and VTA TH neural responses positively correlated in spiny mice, suggesting functional connectivity. These results suggest that colonial species may have evolved neural mechanisms associated with reward in novel, nonreproductive social contexts to promote large group-living.","19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":"Accurately evaluating the health status of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is significant to enhance the safety, efficiency, and economy of LIBs deployment. However, the complex degradation processes inside the battery make it a thorny challenge. Data-driven methods are widely used to resolve the problem without exploring the complex aging mechanisms; however, random and incomplete charging-discharging processes in actual applications make the existing methods fail to work. Here, we develop three data-driven methods to estimate battery state of health (SOH) using a short random charging segment (RCS). Four types of commercial LIBs (75 cells), cycled under different temperatures and discharging rates, are employed to validate the methods. Trained on a nominal cycling condition, our models can achieve high-precision SOH estimation under other different conditions. We prove that an RCS with a 10mV voltage window can obtain an average error of less than 5%, and the error plunges as the voltage window increases.","24":null,"25":"","26":null,"27":"The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is a potential pathway for production of fuels and chemicals that uses atmospheric carbon dioxide as a feedstock. Here, we present an analysis of the potential for carbon dioxide from point sources and via direct air capture to be utilized in electrochemical reduction under different market scenarios. We show that developing a network for production of these products at scale requires capture and utilization of significant portions of the carbon dioxide that is currently emitted from large stationary point sources. Because carbon dioxide point sources are spatially and compositionally variable, their use for carbon dioxide reduction depends on electricity prices, capture cost, and location. If the power sector in the United States is decarbonized, carbon dioxide supply decreases significantly, increasing the importance of utilizing other carbon dioxide streams, and increasing the likelihood that direct air capture plays a role in supplying carbon dioxide feedstocks.","28":"Rab proteins are well known regulators of intracellular trafficking; however, more and more studies point to their function also in other cellular processes, including cell migration. In this work, we have performed an siRNA screen to identify Rab proteins that influence cell migration. The screen revealed Rab33b as the strongest candidate that affected cell motility. Rab33b has been previously reported to localize at the Golgi apparatus to regulate Golgi-to-ER retrograde trafficking and Golgi homeostasis. We revealed that Rab33b also mediates post-Golgi transport to the plasma membrane. We further identified Exoc6, a subunit of the exocyst complex, as an interactor of Rab33b. Moreover, our data indicate that Rab33b regulates focal adhesion dynamics by modulating the delivery of cargo such as integrins to focal adhesions. Altogether, our results demonstrate a role for Rab33b in cell migration by regulating the delivery of integrins to focal adhesions through the interaction with Exoc6.","29":null,"30":"The interpretation of single-molecule experiments is frequently aided by computational modeling of biomolecular dynamics. The growth of computing power and ongoing validation of computational models suggest that it soon may be possible to replace some experiments outright with computational mimics. Here, we offer a blueprint for performing single-molecule studies in silico using a DNA-binding protein as a test bed. We demonstrate how atomistic simulations, typically limited to sub-millisecond durations and zeptoliter volumes, can guide development of a coarse-grained model for use in simulations that mimic single-molecule experiments. We apply the model to recapitulate, in silico, force-extension characterization of protein binding to single-stranded DNA and protein and DNA replacement assays, providing a detailed portrait of the underlying mechanics. Finally, we use the model to simulate the trombone loop of a replication fork, a large complex of proteins and DNA.","31":"Many flying animals parse visual information to control their landing, whereby they can decelerate smoothly by flying at a constant radial optic expansion rate. Here, we studied how bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) use optic expansion information to control their landing, by analyzing 10,005 landing maneuvers on vertical platforms with various optic information, and at three dim light conditions. We showed that bumblebees both decelerate and accelerate during these landings. Bumblebees decelerate by flying at a constant optic expansion rate, but they mostly accelerate toward the surface each time they switched to a new, often higher, optic expansion rate set-point. These transient acceleration phases allow bumblebees to increase their approach speed, and thereby land rapidly and robustly, even in dim twilight conditions. This helps explain why bumblebees are such robust foragers in challenging environmental conditions. The here-proposed sensorimotor landing control system can serve as bio-inspiration for landing control in unmanned aerial vehicles.","32":"Stem\/progenitor cells, because of their self-renewal and multiple cell type differentiation abilities, have good potential in regenerative medicine. We previously reported a lung epithelial cell population that expressed the stem cell marker SSEA-1 was abundant in neonatal but scarce in adult mice. In the current study, neonatal and adult mouse-derived pulmonary SSEA-1+ cells were isolated for further characterization. The results showed that neonatal-derived pulmonary SSEA-1+ cells highly expressed lung development-associated genes and had enhanced organoid generation ability compared with the adult cells. Neonatal pulmonary SSEA-1+ cells generated airway-like and alveolar-like organoids, suggesting multilineage cell differentiation ability. Organoid generation of neonatal but not adult pulmonary SSEA-1+ cells was enhanced by fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF 7). Furthermore, neonatal pulmonary SSEA-1+ cells colonized and developed in decellularized and injured lungs. These results suggest the potential of lung-derived neonatal-stage SSEA-1+ cells with enhanced stem\/progenitor activity and shed light on future lung engineering applications.","33":"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a metabolically active organ that contributes to the thermogenic response to cold exposure. In addition, other thermogenic cells termed beige adipocytes are generated in white adipose tissue (WAT) by cold exposure. Although activation of brown\/beige adipose tissue is associated with mobilization of both glucose and lipids, few studies have focused on the role of glycolytic enzymes in regulating adipose tissue function. We generated mouse models with specific deletion of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) from adipose tissue. Deletion of Pgam1 from both BAT and WAT promoted whitening of BAT with beiging of visceral WAT, whereas deletion of Pgam1 from BAT alone led to whitening of BAT without beiging of WAT. Our results demonstrate a potential role of glycolytic enzymes in beiging of visceral WAT and suggest that PGAM1 would be a novel therapeutic target in obesity and diabetes.","34":"Flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through perivascular spaces (PVSs) in the brain delivers nutrients, clears metabolic waste, and causes edema formation. Brain-wide imaging cannot resolve PVSs, and high-resolution methods cannot access deep tissue. However, theoretical models provide valuable insight. We model the CSF pathway as a network of hydraulic resistances, using published parameter values. A few parameters (permeability of PVSs and the parenchyma, and dimensions of PVSs and astrocyte endfoot gaps) have wide uncertainties, so we focus on the limits of their ranges by analyzing different parametric scenarios. We identify low-resistance PVSs and high-resistance parenchyma as the only scenario that satisfies three essential criteria: that the flow be driven by a small pressure drop, exhibit good CSF perfusion throughout the cortex, and exhibit a substantial increase in flow during sleep. Our results point to the most important parameters, such as astrocyte endfoot gap dimensions, to be measured in future experiments.","35":"Plasmodium sporozoites invade hepatocytes and transform into liver stages within a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The parasites then grow and replicate their genome to form exoerythrocytic merozoites that infect red blood cells. We report that the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) expresses a C-type ATP-binding cassette transporter, Pf ABCC2, which marks the transition from invasive sporozoite to intrahepatocytic early liver stage. Using a humanized mouse infection model, we show that Pf ABCC2 localizes to the parasite plasma membrane in early and mid-liver stage parasites but is not detectable in late liver stages. Pf abcc2 - sporozoites invade hepatocytes, form a PV, and transform into liver stage trophozoites but cannot transition to exoerythrocytic schizogony and fail to transition to blood stage infection. Thus, Pf ABCC2 is an expression marker for early phases of parasite liver infection and plays an essential role in the successful initiation of liver stage replication.","36":"A straightforward and practical strategy for pyridylation of inert N-heterocycles, enabled by ammonium cation and electrochemical, has been described. This protocol gives access to various N-fused heterocycles and bidentate nitrogen ligand compounds, through dual-proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) and radical cross-coupling in the absence of exogenous metal and redox reagent. It features broad substrate scope, wide functional group tolerance, and easy gram-scale synthesis. Various experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculation results show the mechanism of dual PCET followed by radical cross-coupling is the preferred pathway. Moreover, ammonium salt plays the dual role of protonation reagent and electrolyte in this conversion, and the resulting product 9-(pyridin-4-yl)acridine compound can be used for fluorescence recognition of Fe2+ and Pd2+ with high sensitivity.","37":"We compared 3 hospitalized patient cohorts and did mechanistic studies to determine if lipotoxicity worsens COVID-19. Cohort-1 (n=30) compared COVID-19 patients dismissed home to those requiring intensive-care unit (ICU) transfer. Cohort-2 (n=116) compared critically ill ICU patients with and without COVID-19. Cohort-3 (n=3969) studied hypoalbuminemia and hypocalcemia's impact on COVID-19 mortality. Patients requiring ICU transfer had higher serum albumin unbound linoleic acid (LA). Unbound fatty acids and LA were elevated in ICU transfers, COVID-19 ICU patients and ICU non-survivors. COVID-19 ICU patients (cohort-2) had greater serum lipase, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), cytokines, hypocalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, organ failure and thrombotic events. Hypocalcemia and hypoalbuminemia independently associated with COVID-19 mortality in cohort-3. Experimentally, LA reacted with albumin, calcium and induced hypocalcemia, hypoalbuminemia in mice. Endothelial cells took up unbound LA, which depolarized their mitochondria. In mice, unbound LA increased DAMPs, cytokines, causing endothelial injury, organ failure and thrombosis. Therefore, excessive unbound LA in the circulation may worsen COVID-19 outcomes.","38":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in viral infections, but their associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Here, we detected 85 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) from 2,336 known and 361 novel miRNAs that were identified in 233 plasma samples from 61 healthy controls and 116 patients with COVID-19 using the high-throughput sequencing and computational analysis. These DE-miRNAs were associated with SASR-CoV-2 infection, disease severity, and viral persistence in the patients with COVID-19, respectively. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses of the DE-miRNAs revealed their connections to viral infections, immune responses, and lung diseases. Finally, we established a machine learning model using the DE-miRNAs between various groups for classification of COVID-19 cases with different clinical presentations. Our findings may help understand the contribution of miRNAs to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and identify potential biomarkers and molecular targets for diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","39":null,"40":null,"41":null,"42":"Oxytocin modulates mammalian social behavior; however, behavioral responses to intranasal oxytocin can vary across species and contexts. The complexity of social interactions increases with group dynamics, and the impacts of oxytocin on both within- and between-group contexts are unknown. We tested the effects of intranasal administration of oxytocin on social and non-social behaviors within in-group and out-group contexts in African lions. We hypothesized that, post intranasal oxytocin administration, lions would be in closer proximity with fellow group members, whereas out-group stimuli could either produce a heightened vigilance response or an attenuated one. Compared to control trials, post oxytocin administration, lions increased their time spent in close proximity (reducing their distance to the nearest neighbor) and decreased vigilance toward out-group intruders (reducing their vocalizations following a roar-playback). These results not only have important implications for understanding the evolution of social circuitry but may also have practical applications for conservation efforts.","43":"What happens when a researcher finds out that research very similar to their own is already being conducted? What if they find out that the said research is also very close to being published? First, there is probably anxiety and panic. Maybe, there are frantic calls to collaborators. Perhaps Twitter rants about the phenomenon of scooping that plagues all researchers, especially those early-career researchers who often feel they are in a race to get their best work out to the world.","44":"Since the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the late past century, cancer research has been overwhelmingly focused on the genetics and biology of tumor cells and hence has addressed mostly cell-autonomous processes with emphasis on traditional driver\/passenger genetic models. Nevertheless, over that same period, multiple seminal observations have accumulated highlighting the role of non-cell autonomous effectors in tumor growth and metastasis. However, given that cell autonomous and non-autonomous events are observed together at the time of diagnosis, it is in fact impossible to know whether the malignant transformation is initiated by cell autonomous oncogenic events or by non-cell autonomous conditions generated by alterations of the tissue-body ecosystem. This review aims at addressing this issue by taking the option of defining malignancy as a complex genetic trait incorporating genetically determined reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and tissue-body ecosystem.","45":"The TORC1 (Target of Rapamycin Complex 1) kinase complex plays a pivotal role in controlling cell growth in probably all eukaryotic species. The signals and mechanisms regulating TORC1 have been intensely studied in mammals but those of fungi and plants are much less known. We have previously reported that the yeast plasma membrane H+-ATPase Pma1 promotes TORC1 activation when stimulated by cytosolic acidification or nutrient-uptake-coupled H+ influx. Furthermore, a homologous plant H+-ATPase can substitute for yeast Pma1 to promote this H+-elicited TORC1 activation. We here report that TORC1 activity in Nicotiana tabacum BY-2 cells is also strongly influenced by the activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPases. In particular, stimulation of H+-ATPases by fusicoccin activates TORC1, and this response is also observed in cells transferred to a nutrient-free and auxin-free medium. Our results suggest that plant H+-ATPases, known to be regulated by practically all factors controlling cell growth, contribute to TOR signaling.","46":"Emerging evidence shows that metabolic regulation may be a critical mechanism in B cell activation and function. As targets of several most widely used immunosuppressants, Ca2+ signaling and calcineurin may play an important role in regulating B cell metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that IP3R-mediated Ca2+ signaling and calcineurin regulate B cell proliferation and survival by activating metabolic reprogramming in response to B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation. Both IP3R-triple-knockout (IP3R-TKO) and calcineurin inhibition dramatically suppress the metabolic switch in oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis of stimulated B cells through regulation of glucose uptake, glycolytic enzyme expression, and mitochondrial remodeling, leading to impaired cell-cycle entry and survival. In addition, IP3R-Ca2+ acts as a master regulator of the calcineurin-MEF2C-Myc pathway in driving B cell metabolic adaptations. As genetic defects of IP3Rs were recently identified as a new class of inborn errors of immunity, these results have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of such diseases.","47":null,"48":"Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of primates play a key role in combining monocular inputs to form a binocular response. Although much has been gleaned from studying how V1 responds to discrepant (dichoptic) images, equally important is to understand how V1 responds to concordant (dioptic) images in the two eyes. Here, we investigated the extent to which concordant, balanced, zero-disparity binocular stimulation modifies V1 responses to varying stimulus contrast using intracranial multielectrode arrays. On average, binocular stimuli evoked stronger V1 activity than their monocular counterparts. This binocular facilitation scaled most proportionately with contrast during the initial transient. As V1 responses evolved, additional contrast-mediated dynamics emerged. Specifically, responses exhibited longer maintenance of facilitation for lower contrast and binocular suppression at high contrast. These results suggest that V1 processes concordant stimulation of both eyes in at least two sequential steps: initial response enhancement followed by contrast-dependent control of excitation.","49":null,"50":null,"51":"Nucleotide repeat expansions are a hallmark of over 40 neurodegenerative diseases and cause RNA toxicity and multisystemic symptoms that worsen with age. Through an unclear mechanism, RNA toxicity can trigger severe disease manifestation in infants if the repeats are inherited from their mother. Here we use Caenorhabditis elegans bearing expanded CUG repeats to show that this asymmetric intergenerational inheritance of toxicity contributes to disease pathogenesis. In addition, we show that this mechanism is dependent on small RNA pathways with maternal repeat-derived small RNAs causing transcriptomic changes in the offspring, reduced motility, and shortened lifespan. We rescued the toxicity phenotypes in the offspring by perturbing the RNAi machinery in the affected hermaphrodites. This points to a novel mechanism linking maternal bias and the RNAi machinery and suggests that toxic RNA is transmitted to offspring, causing disease phenotypes through intergenerational epigenetic inheritance.","52":null,"53":"Insulin signaling promotes anabolic metabolism to regulate cell growth through multi-omic interactions. To obtain a comprehensive view of the cellular responses to insulin, we constructed a trans-omic network of insulin action in Drosophila cells that involves the integration of multi-omic data sets. In this network, 14 transcription factors, including Myc, coordinately upregulate the gene expression of anabolic processes such as nucleotide synthesis, transcription, and translation, consistent with decreases in metabolites such as nucleotide triphosphates and proteinogenic amino acids required for transcription and translation. Next, as cell growth is required for cell proliferation and insulin can stimulate proliferation in a context-dependent manner, we integrated the trans-omic network with results from a CRISPR functional screen for cell proliferation. This analysis validates the role of a Myc-mediated subnetwork that coordinates the activation of genes involved in anabolic processes required for cell growth.","54":"Dorsal striatum is important for movement control and motor skill learning. However, it remains unclear how the spatially and temporally distributed striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) activity in the direct and indirect pathways (D1 and D2 MSNs, respectively) encodes motor skill learning. Combining miniature fluorescence microscopy with an accelerating rotarod procedure, we identified two distinct MSN subpopulations involved in accelerating rotarod learning. In both D1 and D2 MSNs, we observed neurons that displayed activity tuned to acceleration during early stages of trials, as well as movement speed during late stages of trials. We found a distinct evolution trajectory for early-stage neurons during motor skill learning, with the evolution of D1 MSNs correlating strongly with performance improvement. Importantly, optogenetic inhibition of the early-stage neural activity in D1 MSNs, but not D2 MSNs, impaired accelerating rotarod learning. Together, this study provides insight into striatal D1 and D2 MSNs encoding motor skill learning.","55":"Oncogenic mutations in the EGFR gene account for 15-20% of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cases. However, the mechanism for EGFR driven tumor development and growth is not fully understood. Here, using an mRNA expression profiling-based approach we identified betacellulin (BTC) as one the gene upregulated by oncogenic EGFR in an MAP kinase-dependent manner. BTC protein expression was markedly increased in LUAD patient samples compared to normal lung tissue, with higher expression in EGFR-mutant LUAD. BTC was sufficient to transform immortalized mouse cells, initiate tumor development in mice, and promote the survival of immortalized human lung epithelial cells. Conversely, knockdown of BTC inhibited the growth of EGFR-mutant human LUAD cells in culture and their tumor-forming ability in mice. Mechanistically, BTC knockdown resulted in attenuated EGFR signaling and apoptosis induction. Collectively, these results demonstrate a key role of BTC in EGFR-mutant LUAD, with potential therapeutic implications in LUAD and other EGFR-mutant cancers.","56":null,"57":null,"58":"Rain-on-snow (ROS) events are commonly linked to large historic floods in the United States. Projected increases in the frequency and magnitude of ROS multiply existing uncertainties and risks in operational decision making. Here, we introduce a framework for quality-controlling hourly snow water content, snow depth, precipitation, and temperature data to guide the development of an empirically based snowpack runoff decision support framework at the Central Sierra Snow Laboratory for water years 2006-2019. This framework considers the potential for terrestrial water input from the snowpack through decision tree classification of rain-on-snow and warm day melt events to aid in pattern recognition of prominent weather and antecedent snowpack conditions capable of producing snowpack runoff. Our work demonstrates how (1) present weather and (2) antecedent snowpack risk can be \"learned\" from hourly data to support eventual development of basin-specific snowpack runoff decision support systems aimed at providing real-time guidance for water resource management.","59":"This review presents bioprinting methods, biomaterials, and printing strategies that may be used for composite tissue constructs for musculoskeletal applications. The printing methods discussed include those that are suitable for acellular and cellular components, and the biomaterials include soft and rigid components that are suitable for soft and\/or hard tissues. We also present strategies that focus on the integration of cell-laden soft and acellular rigid components under a single printing platform. Given the structural and functional complexity of native musculoskeletal tissue, we envision that hybrid bioprinting, referred to as hybprinting, could provide unprecedented potential by combining different materials and bioprinting techniques to engineer and assemble modular tissues.","60":"Understanding the regulation of normal and malignant human hematopoiesis requires comprehensive cell atlas of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulatory microenvironment. Here, we develop a tailored bioinformatic pipeline to integrate public and proprietary single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. As a result, we robustly identify for the first time 14 intermediate cell states and 11 stages of differentiation in the endothelial and mesenchymal BM compartments, respectively. Our data provide the most comprehensive description to date of the murine HSC-regulatory microenvironment and suggest a higher level of specialization of the cellular circuits than previously anticipated. Furthermore, this deep characterization allows inferring conserved features in human, suggesting that the layers of microenvironmental regulation of hematopoiesis may also be shared between species. Our resource and methodology is a stepping-stone toward a comprehensive cell atlas of the BM microenvironment.","61":null,"62":"With the aggravation of environmental pollution and energy crisis, lithium-ion batteries are widely regarded as promising. However, the current distribution in the parallel battery pack branches is highly heterogeneous. Charging strategies based on the models can be adopted to prevent side reactions that may lead to severe degradation or even thermal runaway under various ambient temperatures. In this study, a battery model for a single cell is established by coupling a single particle model with electrolyte, degradation model, and thermal model. Besides, considering the contact resistance and wire resistance, the circuit model of a battery pack is established. A charging strategy based on minimum Li plating overpotential control is then adopted, and the effectiveness under high C-rate and low temperature to reduce capacity loss is verified by simulation. This study provides a low-loss charging strategy that can reduce the safety risk of battery packs with better performance under various ambient temperatures.","63":"In Drosophila melanogaster, olfactory projection neurons (PNs) convey odor information from the antenna lobe to higher brain regions. Recent transcriptomic studies reveal a large diversity of transcription factors, cell-surface molecules, neurotransmitter-coding, and neuropeptide-coding genes in PNs; however, their structural diversity remains unknown. Herein, we achieved a volumetric reconstruction of 89 PN boutons under Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM) and quantitatively analyzed the internal presynaptic active zones (PAZs) and dense-core vesicles (DCVs). The ultrastructure-based cluster analysis reveals three morphological distinct bouton subtypes: complex boutons, unilobed boutons, and simple boutons. The complex boutons contain the most PAZs and DCVs, which suggests that they are of the highest capability of releasing neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. By labeling a subset of boutons under FIB-SEM, we found that DCVs are preferentially distributed in certain GH146-positive subtypes. Our study demonstrates that PN boutons display distinct morphology, which may determine their capacity of releasing neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.","64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":"Unstable carotid stenosis is an important cause of ischemic stroke, yet the basis of disease pathophysiology remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that integrated analyses of symptomatic carotid stenosis patients at increased stroke risk stratified by clinical scores, CAR and ABCD2, with transcriptomic and clinical data could improve identification of molecular pathways and targets for instability. We show that high CAR score reflects plaque instability processes related to intra-plaque hemorrhage, angiogenesis, inflammation, and foam cell differentiation, whereas ABCD2 associates with neutrophil-mediated immunity, foam cell differentiation, cholesterol transport, and coagulation. Repressed processes in plaques from high-risk patients were ossification, chondrocyte differentiation, SMC migration, and ECM organization. ABCB5 gene was found as the top upregulated in high-risk patient's plaques, localized to macrophages in areas with neovascularization and intra-plaque hemorrhage. The link between ABCB5 and intra-plaque hemorrhage suggests its key role for plaque instability that warrants further exploration.","68":null,"69":"Aging research is unparalleled in the breadth of disciplines it encompasses, from evolutionary studies examining the forces that shape aging to molecular studies uncovering the underlying mechanisms of age-related functional decline. Despite a common focus to advance our understanding of aging, these disciplines have proceeded along distinct paths with little cross-talk. We propose that the concept of resilience can bridge this gap. Resilience describes the ability of a system to respond to perturbations by returning to its original state. Although resilience has been applied in a few individual disciplines in aging research such as frailty and cognitive decline, it has not been explored as a unifying conceptual framework that is able to connect distinct research fields. We argue that because a resilience-based framework can cross broad physiological levels and time scales it can provide the missing links that connect these diverse disciplines. The resulting framework will facilitate predictive modeling and validation and influence targets and directions in research on the biology of aging.","70":"Sounds reach the ears as a mixture of energy generated by different sources. Listeners extract cues that distinguish different sources from one another, including how similar sounds arrive at the two ears, the interaural coherence (IAC). Here, we find listeners cannot reliably distinguish two completely interaurally coherent sounds from a single sound with reduced IAC. Pairs of sounds heard toward the front were readily confused with single sounds with high IAC, whereas those heard to the sides were confused with single sounds with low IAC. Sounds that hold supra-ethological spatial cues are perceived as more diffuse than can be accounted for by their IAC, and this is accounted for by a computational model comprising a restricted, and sound-frequency dependent, distribution of auditory-spatial detectors. We observed elevated cortical hemodynamic responses for sounds with low IAC, suggesting that the ambiguity elicited by sounds with low interaural similarity imposes elevated cortical load.","71":"Trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is a marker of active promoters. Broad H3K4me3 promoter domains have been associated with cell type identity, but H3K4me3 dynamics upon cellular stress have not been well characterized. We assessed this by exposing endometrial stromal cells to hypoxia, which is a major cellular stress condition. We observed that hypoxia modifies the existing H3K4me3 marks and that promoter H3K4me3 breadth rather than height correlates with transcription. Broad H3K4me3 domains mark genes for endometrial core functions and are maintained or selectively extended upon hypoxia. Hypoxic extension of H3K4me3 breadth associates with stress adaptation genes relevant for the survival of endometrial cells including transcription factor KLF4, for which we found increased protein expression in the stroma of endometriosis lesions. These results substantiate the view on broad H3K4me3 as a marker of cell identity genes and reveal participation of H3K4me3 extension in cellular stress adaptation.","72":"Epilepsy is a circuit-level brain disorder characterized by hyperexcitatory seizures with unclear mechanisms. Here, we investigated the causal roles of calretinin (CR) neurons in the posterior intralaminar thalamic nucleus (PIL) in hippocampal seizures. Using c-fos mapping and calcium fiber photometry, we found that PIL CR neurons were activated during hippocampal seizures in a kindling model. Optogenetic activation of PIL CR neurons accelerated seizure development, whereas inhibition retarded seizure development. Further, viral-based circuit tracing verified that PIL CR neurons were long-range glutamatergic neurons, projecting toward various downstream regions. Interestingly, selective inhibition of PIL-lateral amygdala CR circuit attenuated seizure progression, whereas inhibition of PIL-zona incerta CR circuit presented an opposite effect. These results indicated that CR neurons in the PIL play separate roles in hippocampal seizures via distinct downstream circuits, which complements the pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy and provides new insight for the precise medicine of epilepsy.","73":"Discovering loci under balancing selection in humans can identify loci with alleles that affect response to the environment and disease. Genome variation data have identified the 5' region of the DMBT1 gene as undergoing balancing selection in humans. DMBT1 encodes the pattern-recognition glycoprotein DMBT1, also known as SALSA, gp340, or salivary agglutinin. DMBT1 binds to a variety of pathogens through a tandemly arranged scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain, with the number of domains polymorphic in humans. We show that the signal of balancing selection is driven by one haplotype usually carrying a shorter SRCR repeat and another usually carrying a longer SRCR repeat. DMBT1 encoded by a shorter SRCR repeat allele does not bind a cariogenic and invasive Streptococcus mutans strain, in contrast to the long SRCR allele that shows binding. Our results suggest that balancing selection at DMBT1 is due to host-microbe interactions of encoded SRCR tandem repeat alleles.","74":"The fast-growing global cooling demand due to income growth in tropical countries necessitates substantial investments in new generation capacity. Despite the synergy between the temporal behavior of cooling demand and solar PV production, it is not clear whether the increased cooling demand will make solar PV more cost-effective or less so. We use a capacity expansion model to investigate the cost-effectiveness of investing in solar PV to meet the electricity demand linked to cooling for seven different regions under various CO2 emission targets. Solar PV plays a dominant role in meeting the additional electricity demand for cooling, and the share of solar PV in the additional generation capacity ranges from 64% to 135%. Additionally, powering electric cooling with mainly solar PV is cheaper than powering the rest of the demand. These results suggest that solar PV may comprise the backbone of electricity supply for cooling in the future electricity system.","75":"Engineering a versatile platform that enables to separate both oil\/water and oil\/oil mixtures and remove dye from water is not easy. To address this challenge, we have developed an Ag\/polydopamine-coated textile (Ag\/PDA@textile) by chemically depositing Ag particles on the textile surface using polydopamine as the binder layer. The obtained Ag\/PDA@textile attracts water but repels oil in the air, underwater, and when immersed into the oil. Exploiting its water-attracting and oil resistance, the Ag\/PDA@textile is acted as a separation membrane to separate oil\/water mixtures with enhanced separation efficiency. The Ag\/PDA@textile also possesses opposite wetting behavior to oils with different polarities, allowing it to separate oil\/oil mixtures efficiently. Thanks to the catalytic performance of the Ag particle, organic dyes can be decomposed effectively by our Ag\/PDA@textile under UV illustration or in the presence of NaBH4. Our Ag\/PDA@textile may be valuable for applications in water purification and oil sewage treatment.","76":"The development of low-cost and sustainable grid energy storage is urgently needed to accommodate the growing proportion of intermittent renewables in the global energy mix. Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are promising candidates to provide grid storage due to their inherent safety, scalability, and economic viability. Organic cathode materials are especially advantageous for use in zinc-ion batteries as they can be synthesized using scalable processes from inexpensive starting materials and have potential for biodegradation at their end of life. Strategies for designing organic cathode materials for rechargeable zinc-ion batteries targeting grid applications will be discussed in detail. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of cost analysis, synthetic simplicity, end-of-life scenarios, areal loading of active material, and long-term stability to materials design. We highlight the strengths and challenges of present zinc-organic research in the context of our design principles, and provide opportunities and considerations for future electrode design.","77":"In the era of antiretroviral therapy, inflammation is a central factor in numerous HIV-associated comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric disorders. This highlights the value of developing therapeutics that both reduce HIV-associated inflammation and treat associated comorbidities. Previous research on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) suggests this class of drugs has anti-inflammatory properties in addition to neuropsychiatric effects. Therefore, we examined the impact of deprenyl, an MAOI, on SIV-associated inflammation during acute SIV infection using the rhesus macaque model of HIV infection. Our results show deprenyl decreased both peripheral and CNS inflammation but had no effect on viral load in either the periphery or CNS. These data show that the MAOI deprenyl may have broad anti-inflammatory effects when given during the acute stage of SIV infection, suggesting more research into the anti-inflammatory effects of this drug could result in a beneficial adjuvant for antiretroviral therapy.","78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":"Emerging evidence suggests that dysfunction of the visual cortex may be involved in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We previously established that combined magnetic stimulation system treatment (c-MSST) resulted in an antidepressant effect in mice. In the present study, we found that V1-targeted c-MSST induced significant antidepressant effects in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. Proteomic screening investigation and repeatable validation revealed that expression of the V1 neuronal ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA1) was downregulated in CUMS mice, an effect that was normalized by c-MSST. Neuron-specific knockdown of ABCA1 in V1 blocked c-MSST's antidepressant effects. Mechanistically, CUMS reduced dendritic spine density and long-term plasticity in V1, and these deficits were reversed by c-MSST. V1-targeted c-MSST was found to induce rapid antidepressant effects that are mediated by alterations in synaptic plasticity via the ABCA1\/ApoA1 signaling pathway in V1.","85":null,"86":null,"87":"BAG1 is a family of polypeptides with a conserved C-terminal BAG domain that functions as a nucleotide exchange factor for the molecular chaperone HSP70. BAG1 proteins also control several signaling processes including proteostasis, apoptosis, and transcription. The largest isoform, BAG1L, controls the activity of the androgen receptor (AR) and is upregulated in prostate cancer. Here, we show that BAG1L regulates AR dynamics in the nucleus and its ablation attenuates AR target gene expression especially those involved in oxidative stress and metabolism. We show that a small molecule, A4B17, that targets the BAG domain downregulates AR target genes similar to a complete BAG1L knockout and upregulates the expression of oxidative stress-induced genes involved in cell death. Furthermore, A4B17 outperformed the clinically approved antagonist enzalutamide in inhibiting cell proliferation and prostate tumor development in a mouse xenograft model. BAG1 inhibitors therefore offer unique opportunities for antagonizing AR action and prostate cancer growth.","88":null,"89":null,"90":"Glioblastoma is a complex disease that is difficult to treat. Network and data science offer alternative approaches to classical bioinformatics pipelines to study gene expression patterns from single-cell datasets, helping to distinguish genes associated with the control of differentiation and aggression. To identify the key molecular regulators of the networks driving glioblastoma\/GSC and predict their cell fate dynamics, we applied a host of data theoretic techniques to gene expression patterns from pediatric and adult glioblastoma, and adult glioma-derived stem cells (GSCs). We identified eight transcription factors (OLIG1\/2, TAZ, GATA2, FOXG1, SOX6, SATB2, and YY1) and four signaling genes (ATL3, MTSS1, EMP1, and TPT1) as coordinators of cell state transitions and, thus, clinically targetable putative factors differentiating pediatric and adult glioblastomas from adult GSCs. Our study provides strong evidence of complex systems approaches for inferring complex dynamics from reverse-engineering gene networks, bolstering the search for new clinically relevant targets in glioblastoma.","91":"Inflammatory responses of the intestinal epithelial barrier in patients with Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are associated with gut microbial alterations. At a community level, there is scarce mechanistic evidence on the effects of gut microbial alterations on host mucosal barrier responses. We used a computational microbe-host interaction prediction framework based on network diffusion and systems biology to integrate publicly available paired gut microbial and intestinal gene expression datasets. The ileal signaling network potentially modulated by the microbiota was enriched with immune-related pathways such as those associated with IL-4, IL-2, IL-13, NFkB, and toll-like receptors. We identified bacterial proteins eliciting post-translational modifications on host receptors, resulting in the de-repression of pro-inflammatory cytokines via critical hub proteins such as NFkB. The signaling networks were over-represented with CD associated genes and CD drug targets. Using datasets generated from our validation cohorts, we confirmed some of the results.","92":null,"93":"Electronic textiles (e-textiles) are fabrics that can perform electronic functions such as sensing, computation, display, and communication. They can enhance the functionality of clothing in a variety of convenient and unobtrusive ways, thus have garnered significant research and commercial interest in applications ranging from fashion to healthcare. Recent advances in materials science and electronics have given rise to variety of e-textile components, including sensors, energy harvesters, batteries, and antennas on flexible and breathable textiles substrates. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the development of e-textiles for energy, sensing, and communication. In addition, we investigate challenges in the integration of components to realize e-textile systems, and highlight opportunities enabled by innovations in materials science, engineering, and data science.","94":"Sex differences in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases because of differential immune responses between females and males have been well-documented for multiple pathogens. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed sex differences in influenza virus infection remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a network-based approach to characterize the blood transcriptome collected over the course of infection with influenza A virus from female and male ferrets to dissect sex-biased gene expression. We identified significant differences in the temporal dynamics and regulation of immune responses between females and males. Our results elucidate sex-differentiated pathways involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses, including a female-biased IRE1\/XBP1 activation and male-biased crosstalk between metabolic reprogramming and IL-1 and AP-1 pathways. Overall, our study provides molecular insights into sex differences in transcriptional regulation of immune responses and contributes to a better understanding of sex biases in influenza pathogenesis.","95":null,"96":"Archaeological and paleontological records offer tremendous yet often untapped potential for examining long-term biodiversity trends and the impact of climate change and human activity on ecosystems. Yet, zooarchaeological and fossil remains suffer various limitations, including that they are often highly fragmented and morphologically unidentifiable, preventing them from being optimally leveraged for addressing fundamental research questions in archaeology, paleontology, and conservation paleobiology. Here, we explore the potential of palaeoproteomics-the study of ancient proteins-to serve as a critical tool for creating richer, more informative datasets about biodiversity change that can be leveraged to generate more realistic, constructive, and effective conservation and restoration strategies into the future.","97":"Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) is primarily colonized in the oral cavity. Recently, Fn has been closely associated with the tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we showed that the relative level of Fn DNA was increased in the saliva of the CRC group compared with the normal colonoscopy, hyperplastic polyp, and adenoma groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis illustrated that Fn DNA was superior to carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in CRC diagnosis. Moreover, levels of Fn DNA were associated with the overall survival and disease-free survival of CRC patients, which was an independent factor for prognostic prediction. Transcriptome sequencing identified 1,287 differentially expressed mRNAs in tumor tissues between CRC patients with high-Fn and low-Fn infection. Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis showed that ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion were the top two significant pathways. Overall, salivary Fn DNA may be a noninvasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for CRC patients.","98":"The designed confocal elliptical core-shell structure can realize the omnidirectional camouflage effect without disturbing temperature and electric potential profiles as the directions of heat flux and electric current change. Based on the anisotropy of the confocal ellipse, the anisotropic effective parameters of the confocal elliptical core-shell structure are derived under different heat flux and electric current launching. Then, the matrix material should be anisotropic as the effective parameters to satisfy the omnidirectional camouflage effect, which is demonstrated numerically. In addition, we present a composite structure to realize the anisotropic matrix. The experimental results show that the camouflage device embedded in the composite structure can eliminate the scattering caused by the elliptical core under different directions of heat flux and electric current, thus achieving the omnidirectional thermal-electric camouflage effect experimentally. The omnidirectional camouflage effect in thermal and electric fields can greatly widen the application fields of this device with anisotropic geometry.","99":"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and type 2 (DM2) are common forms of adult onset muscular dystrophy. Pathogenesis in both diseases is largely driven by production of toxic-expanded repeat RNAs that sequester MBNL RNA-binding proteins, causing mis-splicing. Given this shared pathogenesis, we hypothesized that diamidines, small molecules that rescue mis-splicing in DM1 models, could also rescue mis-splicing in DM2 models. While several DM1 cell models exist, few are available for DM2 limiting research and therapeutic development. Here, we characterize DM1 and DM2 patient-derived fibroblasts for use in small molecule screens and therapeutic studies. We identify mis-splicing events unique to DM2 fibroblasts and common events shared with DM1 fibroblasts. We show that diamidines can partially rescue molecular phenotypes in both DM1 and DM2 fibroblasts. This study demonstrates the potential of fibroblasts as models for DM1 and DM2, which will help meet an important need for well-characterized DM2 cell models.","100":"Patients with cancer with different molecular characterization and subtypes result in different response to anticancer therapeutics and survival. To identify features that are associated with prognosis is essential to precision medicine by providing clues for target identification, drug discovery. Here, we developed a tumor online prognostic analysis platform (ToPP) which integrated eight multi-omics features and clinical data from 68 cancer projects. It provides multiple approaches for customized prognostic studies, including 1) Prognostic analysis based on multi-omics features and clinical characteristics; 2) Automatic construction of prognostic model; 3) Pancancer prognostic analysis in multi-omics data; 4) Explore the impact of different levels of feature combinations on patient prognosis; 5) More sophisticated prognostic analysis according to regulatory network. ToPP provides a comprehensive source and easy-to-use interface for tumor prognosis research, with one-stop service of multi-omics, subtyping, and online prognostic modeling.

Monitoring the structural and aerodynamic state of the wing is challenging because deformations are passive, and the flow fields are unsteady; it requires distributed mechanosensors that respond to local airflow and strain on the wing. Without a complete map of the sensor arrays, it is impossible to model control strategies underpinned by them. Here, we present the first systematic characterization of mechanosensors on the dragonfly's wings: morphology, distribution, and wiring. By combining a cross-species survey of sensor distribution with quantitative neuroanatomy and a high-fidelity finite element analysis, we show that the mechanosensors are well placed to perceive features of the wing dynamics relevant to flight. This work describes the wing sensory apparatus in its entirety and advances our understanding of the sensorimotor loop that facilitates exquisite flight control in animals with highly deformable wings.","104":null,"105":"Transcription factors (TFs) influence gene expression by binding to DNA, yet experimental data suggests that they also frequently bind regulatory DNA indirectly by interacting with other DNA-bound proteins. Here, we used a data modeling approach to test if such indirect binding by TFs plays a significant role in gene regulation. We first incorporated regulatory function of indirectly bound TFs into a thermodynamics-based model for predicting enhancer-driven expression from its sequence. We then fit the new model to a rich data set comprising hundreds of enhancers and their regulatory activities during mesoderm specification in Drosophila embryogenesis and showed that the newly incorporated mechanism results in significantly better agreement with data. In the process, we derived the first sequence-level model of this extensively characterized regulatory program. We further showed that allowing indirect binding of a TF explains its localization at enhancers more accurately than with direct binding only. Our model also provided a simple explanation of how a TF may switch between activating and repressive roles depending on context.","106":"miRNAs are versatile regulators of smooth muscle cell (SMC) fate and behavior in vascular development and disease. Targeted loss-of-function studies have established the relevance of specific miRNAs in controlling SMC differentiation or mediating phenotypic modulation. Our goal was to characterize SMC miRNAome and its contribution to transcriptome changes during phenotypic modulation. Small RNA sequencing revealed that dedifferentiation led to the differential expression of over 50 miRNAs in cultured SMC. miRNA\/mRNA comparison predicted that over a third of SMC transcript expression was regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs. Our screen identified the miR-200 cluster as highly downregulated during dedifferentiation. miR-200 maintains SMC quiescence and represses proliferation, migration, and neointima formation, in part by targeting Quaking, a central SMC phenotypic switching mediator. Our study unraveled the substantial contribution of miRNAs in regulating the SMC transcriptome and identified the miR-200 cluster as a pro-quiescence mechanism and a potential inhibitor of vascular restenosis.","107":"Achieving human-level performance on some of the machine reading comprehension (MRC) datasets is no longer challenging with the help of powerful pre-trained language models (PLMs). However, the internal mechanism of these artifacts remains unclear, placing an obstacle to further understand these models. This paper focuses on conducting a series of analytical experiments to examine the relations between the multi-head self-attention and the final MRC system performance, revealing the potential explainability in PLM-based MRC models. To ensure the robustness of the analyses, we perform our experiments in a multilingual way on top of various PLMs. We discover that passage-to-question and passage understanding attentions are the most important ones in the question answering process, showing strong correlations to the final performance than other parts. Through comprehensive visualizations and case studies, we also observe several general findings on the attention maps, which can be helpful to understand how these models solve the questions.","108":"The priority of developing countries in the clean energy transition is to attain industrialization primarily with low-carbon energy sources; this presents challenges that industrialized nations did not experience. Developing economies need to grapple with the question: \"Should sustainable human development be achieved at the price of economic growth?\" Therefore, this article brings perspective to the theme of clean energy transition for development. We highlight three peculiarities of developing economies which will strongly influence their approach to the clean transition: low grid capacity and inefficiency, lower rates of urbanization, and youth demographics. Owing to these, effective low-cost technologies and novel pathways that can facilitate clean transition in a sustainable socio-economic framework are needed. In particular, we propose that mature dispatchable low-carbon energy sources should be prioritized as a strategy to harness local natural resources, and maximize existing indigenous skilled labor. The perspective also highlights several recommendations to help researchers and policy makers look more critically into possible solutions for the Global South's timely participation in the clean energy transition without sacrificing economic growth potentials.","109":"Evolution has found countless ways to transport material across cells and cellular compartments separated by membranes. Protein assemblies are the cornerstone for the formation of channels and pores that enable this regulated passage of molecules in and out of cells, contributing to maintaining most of the fundamental processes that sustain living organisms. As in several other occasions, we have borrowed from the natural properties of these biological systems to push technology forward and have been able to hijack these nano-scale proteinaceous pores to learn about the physical and chemical features of molecules passing through them. Today, a large repertoire of biological pores is exploited as molecular sensors for characterizing biomolecules that are relevant for the advancement of life sciences and application to medicine. Although the technology has quickly matured to enable nucleic acid sensing with transformative implications for genomics, biological pores stand as some of the most promising candidates to drive the next developments in single-molecule proteomics.","110":"Pediatric renal cell carcinomas (RCC) differ from their adult counterparts not only in histologic subtypes but also in clinical characteristics and outcome. However, the underlying biology is still largely unclear. For this reason, we performed whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing analyses on a cohort of 25 pediatric RCC patients with various histologic subtypes, including 10 MiT family translocation (MiT) and 10 papillary RCCs. In this cohort of pediatric RCC, we find only limited genomic overlap with adult RCC, even within the same histologic subtype. Recurrent somatic mutations in genes not previously reported in RCC were detected, such as in CCDC168, PLEKHA1, VWF, and MAP3K9. Our papillary pediatric RCCs, which represent the largest cohort to date with comprehensive molecular profiling in this age group, appeared as a distinct genomic subtype differing in terms of gene mutations and gene expression patterns not only from MiT-RCC but also from their adult counterparts.","111":null,"112":"Olefin metathesis reactions of diverse polyfunctional substrates were conducted in water emulsions using two hydrophobic ruthenium catalysts in the presence of air. Instead of using surfactants to increase the efficiency of the metathesis reaction in water, ultrasound and microwave techniques were tested on a small-scale reaction, whereas conventional heating and mechanical stirring were effective enough to provide high conversion and selectivity on a larger scale. The developed conditions extend known protocols for the aqueous metathesis methodology, utilizing relatively low catalyst loadings and allowing for simple product isolation and purification. The established synthetic protocol was successfully adopted in the large-scale synthesis of a pharmaceutically related product - sildenafil (Viagra) derivative.","113":"In nature, many organisms (e.g., chameleons) protect themselves by changing their colors in response to environmental changes. Inspired by these organisms, we present a multi-responsive, flexible, and structurally colored hydrogel film with a one-dimensional (1D) ordered periodic groove structure. The groove structure endows the film with bright, highly angle-dependent structural colors, which can be reversibly tuned by stretching and releasing. In addition, because of the thermosensitive properties of the hydrogel, the film can be switched between colored state and opaque white state with temperature. In addition, the optical state of the film is sensitive to solvent and can be reversibly changed between colored state and transparent state with soaking and evaporation of the solvent. This reversible, multi-responsive, flexible, and structurally colored hydrogel film has great potential to be used in the fields of color display, sensors, anti-counterfeiting, and so on because of its flexible and diverse tuning methods, excellent optical performance, and convenient preparation process.","114":"Despite great progress in battery safety modeling, accurately predicting the evolution of multiphysics systems is extremely challenging. The question on how to ensure safety of billions of automotive batteries during their lifetime remains unanswered. In this study, we overcome the challenge by developing machine learning techniques based on the recorded data that are uploaded to the cloud. Using charging voltage and temperature curves from early cycles that are yet to exhibit symptoms of battery failure, we apply data-driven models to both predict and classify the sample data by health condition based on the observational, empirical, physical, and statistical understanding of the multiscale systems. The best well-integrated machine learning models achieve a verified classification accuracy of 96.3% (exhibiting an increase of 20.4% from initial model) and an average misclassification test error of 7.7%. Our findings highlight the need for cloud-based artificial intelligence technology tailored to robustly and accurately predict battery failure in real-world applications.","115":"The increased prevalence of obesity and metabolic diseases has heightened interest in adipose tissue biology and its potential as a therapeutic target. To better understand cellular heterogeneity and complexity of white adipose tissue (WAT), we employed cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to characterize immune and stromal cells in visceral and subcutaneous WAT depots under normal and high-fat diet feeding, by quantifying the expression levels of 32 surface marker proteins. We observed comparable proportions of immune cells in two WAT depots under steady state, but depot-distinct subtypes of adipose precursor cells (APC), suggesting differences in their adipogenic and fibrogenic potential. Furthermore, in addition to pro-inflammatory immune cell shifts, significant pro-fibrotic changes were observed in APCs under high-fat diet, suggesting that APCs are early responders to dietary challenges. We propose CyTOF as a complementary and alternative tool to current high-throughput single-cell transcriptomic analyses to better understand the function and plasticity of adipose tissue.","116":"A flexible sensor that can be attached to the body to collect vital data wirelessly enables real-time human healthcare management. One potential application for home-use healthcare devices is monitoring of sleep conditions to diagnose sleep apnea syndrome. Such data are not readily gathered using conventional tools, owing to the bulk and cost of instrumentation. In order to monitor respiration at home, it is necessary to improve sensing performance and long-term stability of the sensors without sacrificing wearability and comfortability. To build a platform for wireless home-use respiration monitoring, this study develops a mask-borne flexible humidity sensor using ZnIn2S4 nanosheets as a humidity-sensitive material with high sensitivity and stability for more than 150 h. As proof-of-concept, long-term wireless respiration monitoring is demonstrated during sleep to identify symptoms of sleep apnea in wearers.","117":null,"118":"The excessive CO2 emission has resulted in climate changes, which has threatened human existence. Photocatalytic and electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, driven by wind electricity and solar energy, are feasible ways of tackling carbon dioxide emission, as both energies are clean and renewable. Single-atom catalyst (SAC) is a candidate owing to excellent electrocatalytic and photocatalytic performance. Methods for preparing an SAC by using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as support or precursors are summarized. Also, applications in energy conversion are exhibited. However, the real challenge is to improve the selectivity of catalytic reactions to yield higher value products, which is to be discussed.","119":"Metasurfaces provide a promising route for structuring light and generating holograms with designed amplitude, phase, and polarization profiles, leading to a versatile platform for integrating and constructing optical components beyond the conventional ones. At the same time, incorporating coincidence in imaging allows a high signal-to-noise ratio for imaging in very low light levels. As beneficial from the recent development in both metasurfaces and single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) cameras, we combine the polarization-sensitive capability of metasurfaces with Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM)-type interference in generating images with tailor-made two-photon interference and polarization coincidence signatures. By using orthogonal linear-polarized photons as incidence, correlated, anticorrelated, and uncorrelated polarization coincidence features can be observed within the same image from the pairwise second-order coherence statistics across different pixels of the image. Our work adds polarization to the demonstrated amplitude and phase sensitivity in the domain of \"HOM microscopy\" and can be useful for biological and security applications.","120":null,"121":"Astrocytic GLT-1 is the main glutamate transporter involved in glutamate buffering in the brain, pivotal for glutamate removal at excitatory synapses to terminate neurotransmission and for preventing excitotoxicity. We show here that the surface expression and function of GLT-1 can be rapidly modulated through the interaction of its N-terminus with the nonadrenergic imidazoline-1 receptor protein, Nischarin. The phox domain of Nischarin is critical for interaction and internalization of surface GLT-1. Using live super-resolution imaging, we found that glutamate accelerated Nischarin-GLT-1 internalization into endosomal structures. The surface GLT-1 level increased in Nischarin knockout astrocytes, and this correlated with a significant increase in transporter uptake current. In addition, Nischarin knockout in astrocytes is neuroprotective against glutamate excitotoxicity. These data provide new molecular insights into regulation of GLT-1 surface level and function and suggest new drug targets for the treatment of neurological disorders.","122":null,"123":"Wind and solar photovoltaic generators are projected to play important roles in achieving a net-zero-carbon electricity system that meets current and future energy needs. Here, we show potential advantages of long-term site planning of wind and solar power plants in deeply decarbonized electricity systems using a macro-scale energy model. With weak carbon emission constraints and substantial amounts of flexible electricity sources on the grid (e.g., dispatchable power), relatively high value is placed on sites with high capacity factors because the added wind or solar capacity can efficiently substitute for running natural gas power plants. With strict carbon emission constraints, relatively high value is placed on sites with high correlation with residual demand because resource complementarity can efficiently compensate for lower system flexibility. Our results suggest that decisions regarding long-term wind and solar farm siting may benefit from consideration of the spatial and temporal evolution of mismatches in electricity demand and generation capacity.","124":null,"125":null,"126":"Alloying is a successful strategy for tuning the phases and properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). To accelerate the synthesis of TMDC alloys, we present a method for generating temperature-composition equilibrium phase diagrams by combining first-principles total-energy calculations with thermodynamic solution models. This method is applied to three representative 2D TMDC alloys: an isostructural alloy, MoS2(1-x)Te2x , and two heterostructural alloys, Mo1-x W x Te2 and WS2(1-x)Te2x . Using density-functional theory and special quasi-random structures, we show that the mixing enthalpy of these binary alloys can be reliably represented using a sub-regular solution model fitted to the total energies of relatively few compositions. The cubic sub-regular solution model captures 3-body effects that are important in TMDC alloys. By comparing phase diagrams generated with this method to those calculated with previous methods, we demonstrate that this method can be used to rapidly design phase diagrams of TMDC alloys and related 2D materials.","127":"Feeding the world's growing population requires continuously increasing crop yields with less fertilizers and agrochemicals on limited land. Focusing on plant belowground traits, especially root-soil-microbe interactions, holds a great promise for overcoming this challenge. The belowground root-soil-microbe interactions are complex and involve a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence nutrient-use efficiency, plant growth and health. Understanding, predicting, and manipulating these rhizosphere processes will enable us to harness the relevant interactions to improve plant productivity and nutrient-use efficiency. Here, we review the recent progress and challenges in root-soil-microbe interactions. We also highlight how root-soil-microbe interactions could be manipulated to ensure food security and resource sustainability in a changing global climate, with an emphasis on reducing our dependence on fertilizers and agrochemicals.","128":"Mitochondria are essential for steroidogenesis. In steroidogenic cells, the initiation of steroidogenesis from cholesterol occurs on the matrix side of the inner mitochondrial membrane by the enzyme P450scc. This requires cholesterol import from the cytoplasm through the outer mitochondrial membrane, facilitated by the StAR protein. The subsequent steps leading to P450scc remain elusive. Here we report that the male transgenic mice that expressed a mutant form of a mitochondrial protein prohibitin-1 (PHB1Tyr114Phe) from the Fabp-4 gene promoter displayed smaller testes, higher testosterone, and lower gonadotropin levels compared with PHB1-expressing and wild-type mice. A subsequent analysis of the testis and Leydig cells from the mice revealed that PHB1 played a previously unknown regulatory role in Leydig cell steroidogenesis. This includes a role in coordinating cell signaling, cholesterol homeostasis, and mitochondrial biology pertaining to steroidogenesis. The implications of our finding are broad as the initial stages of steroidogenesis are indistinguishable across steroidogenic cells.","129":"Cells elaborate transcriptional programs in response to external signals. In the peripheral nerves, Schwann cells (SC) sort axons of given caliber and start the process of wrapping their membrane around them. We identify Actin-like protein 6a (ACTL6a), part of SWI\/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, as critical for the integration of axonal caliber recognition with the transcriptional program of myelination. Nuclear levels of ACTL6A in SC are increased by contact with large caliber axons or nanofibers, and result in the eviction of repressive histone marks to facilitate myelination. Without Actl6a the SC are unable to coordinate caliber recognition and myelin production. Peripheral nerves in knockout mice display defective radial sorting, hypo-myelination of large caliber axons, and redundant myelin around small caliber axons, resulting in a clinical motor phenotype. Overall, this suggests that ACTL6A is a key component of the machinery integrating external signals for proper myelination of the peripheral nerve.","130":null,"131":"We estimate the effect of heightened temperature sensitivity on electricity demand in Texas during the February 2021 blackout event. Using 20 years of hourly data, we estimate the relationship between temperature and electricity demand; finding demand has become more responsive to cold temperatures over time. This is consistent with the fact electric heating has similarly increased over the past 20 years in Texas. We find during the February 2021 event, average electricity demand was 8% higher, and approximately 10,000 MW higher during the peak hour, than it would have been had temperature sensitivity remained unchanged at early 2000s levels. Our results highlight that Texas's increased sensitivity to cold weather extremes is not limited to the supply side, but the demand side as well. These findings have implications to other regions that are seeking to reduce carbon emissions through the electrification of heating.","132":"A key feature of the brain is the ability to handle novelty. Anything that is new will stimulate curiosity and trigger exploration. Novelty preference has been proposed to predict increased sensitivity to cocaine. Different brain circuits are activated by novelty, but three specific brain regions are critical for exploring a novel environment: the noradrenergic neurons originating from the locus coeruleus (LC), the dopaminergic neurons from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and the hippocampus. However, how exploring a novel environment can interfere with the reward system and control cocaine impact on VTA dopamine neuron plasticity is unclear. Here, we first investigated the effects of exposure to a novel environment on the tonic electrophysiological properties of VTA dopamine neurons. Then, we explored how exposure to a novel environment controls cocaine-evoked plasticity in dopamine neurons. Our findings indicate that LC controls VTA dopamine neurons under physiological conditions but also after cocaine.","133":null,"134":null,"135":"Methionine addiction, found in all types of cancer investigated, is because of the overuse of methionine by cancer cells for excess transmethylation reactions. In the present study, we compared the histone H3 lysine-methylation status and degree of malignancy between methionine-addicted cancer cells and their isogenic methionine-independent revertants, selected by their growth in low concentration of methionine. The methionine-independent revertans can grow on low levels of methionine or independently of exogenous methionine using methionine precursors, as do normal cells. In the methionine-independent revertants, the excess levels of trimethylated histone H3 lysine marks found in the methionine-addicted parental cancer cells were reduced or lost, and their tumorigenicity and experimental metastatic potential in nude mice were also highly reduced. Methionine addiction of cancer is linked with malignancy and hypermethylation of histone H3 lysines. The results of the present study thus provide a unique framework to further understand a fundamental basis of malignancy.","136":null,"137":"Complex mechanisms govern the sorting of membrane (cargo) proteins at endosomes to ensure that protein localization to the post-Golgi endomembrane system is accurately maintained. Endosomal retrieval complexes mediate sorting by recognizing specific motifs and signals in the cytoplasmic domains of cargo proteins transiting through endosomes. In this review, the recent progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of how the retromer complex, in conjunction with sorting nexin (SNX) proteins, operates in cargo recognition and sorting is discussed. New data revealing the importance of different SNX proteins and detailing how post-translational modifications can modulate cargo sorting to respond to changes in the environment are highlighted along with the key role that endosomal protein sorting plays in SARS-CoV-2 infection.","138":"The respective value of clinical data and CT examinations in predicting COVID-19 progression is unclear, because the CT scans and clinical data previously used are not synchronized in time. To address this issue, we collected 119 COVID-19 patients with 341 longitudinal CT scans and paired clinical data, and we developed an AI system for the prediction of COVID-19 deterioration. By combining features extracted from CT and clinical data with our system, we can predict whether a patient will develop severe symptoms during hospitalization. Complementary to clinical data, CT examinations show significant add-on values for the prediction of COVID-19 progression in the early stage of COVID-19, especially in the 6th to 8th day after the symptom onset, indicating that this is the ideal time window for the introduction of CT examinations. We release our AI system to provide clinicians with additional assistance to optimize CT usage in the clinical workflow.","139":null,"140":"Developing strategies against the SARS-CoV-2 is currently a main research subject. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to human ACE2 receptors. Both, virus and ACE2, are highly glycosylated, and exploiting glycans of the SARS-CoV-2 envelope as binding sites for ACE2 represents a virus strategy for attacking the human host. We report here that a family of mannose-binding synthetic carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection, showing broad neutralizing activity vs. several variants of the spike protein. Preliminary tests indicated that the investigated CBAs interact with the spike protein rather than with ACE2. For a lead compound (IDS060), which has been selected among others for its lack of cytotoxicity, evidence of binding to the RBD of the spike protein has been found by NMR experiments, while competitive binding assays in the presence of IDS060 showed inhibition of binding of RBD to hACE2, although neutralizing activity was also observed with variants showing reduced or depleted binding.","141":null,"142":null,"143":null,"144":"","145":"At its current rate, the rise of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections is predicted to paralyze our industries and healthcare facilities while becoming the leading global cause of loss of human life. With limited new antibiotics on the horizon, we need to invest in alternative solutions. Bacteriophages (phages)-viruses targeting bacteria-offer a powerful alternative approach to tackle bacterial infections. Despite recent advances in using phages to treat recalcitrant AMR infections, the field lacks systematic development of phage therapies scalable to different applications. We propose a Phage Foundry framework to establish metrics for phage characterization and to fill the knowledge and technological gaps in phage therapeutics. Coordinated investment in AMR surveillance, sampling, characterization, and data sharing procedures will enable rational exploitation of phages for treatments. A fully realized Phage Foundry will enhance the sharing of knowledge, technology, and viral reagents in an equitable manner and will accelerate the biobased economy.","146":"Double homeobox 4 (DUX4) is expressed at the early pre-implantation stage in human embryos. Here we show that induced human DUX4 expression substantially alters the chromatin accessibility of non-coding DNA and activates thousands of newly identified transcribed enhancer-like regions, preferentially located within ERVL-MaLR repeat elements. CRISPR activation of transcribed enhancers by C-terminal DUX4 motifs results in the increased expression of target embryonic genome activation (EGA) genes ZSCAN4 and KHDC1P1. We show that DUX4 is markedly enriched in human zygotes, followed by intense nuclear DUX4 localization preceding and coinciding with minor EGA. DUX4 knockdown in human zygotes led to changes in the EGA transcriptome but did not terminate the embryos. We also show that the DUX4 protein interacts with the Mediator complex via the C-terminal KIX binding motif. Our findings contribute to the understanding of DUX4 as a regulator of the non-coding genome.","147":null,"148":"The Iron Age period occupies an important place in French history because the Gauls are regularly presented as the direct ancestors of the extant French population. We documented here the genomic diversity of Iron Age communities originating from six French regions. The 49 acquired genomes permitted us to highlight an absence of discontinuity between Bronze Age and Iron Age groups in France, lending support to a cultural transition linked to progressive local economic changes rather than to a massive influx of allochthone groups. Genomic analyses revealed strong genetic homogeneity among the regional groups associated with distinct archaeological cultures. This genomic homogenization appears to be linked to individuals' mobility between regions and gene flow with neighbouring groups from England and Spain. Thus, the results globally support a common genomic legacy for the Iron Age population of modern-day France that could be linked to recurrent gene flow between culturally differentiated communities.","149":null,"150":"Much of the current research into immune escape from cancer is focused on molecular and cellular biology, an area of biophysics that is easily overlooked. A large number of immune drugs entering the clinic are not effective for all patients. Apart from the molecular heterogeneity of tumors, the biggest reason for this may be that knowledge of biophysics has not been considered, and therefore an exploration of biophysics may help to address this challenge. To help researchers better investigate the relationship between tumor immune escape and biophysics, this paper provides a brief overview on recent advances and challenges of the biophysical factors and strategies by which tumors acquire immune escape and a comprehensive analysis of the relevant forces acting on tumor cells during immune escape. These include tumor and stromal stiffness, fluid interstitial pressure, shear stress, and viscoelasticity. In addition, advances in biophysics cannot be made without the development of detection tools, and this paper also provides a comprehensive summary of the important detection tools available at this stage in the field of biophysics.","151":"Pediatric osteosarcomas (OS) exhibit extensive genomic instability that has complicated the identification of new targeted therapies. We found the vast majority of 108 patient tumor samples and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), which display an unusually dilated endoplasmic reticulum (ER), have reduced expression of four COPII vesicle components that trigger aberrant accumulation of procollagen-I protein within the ER. CRISPR activation technology was used to increase the expression of two of these, SAR1A and SEC24D, to physiological levels. This was sufficient to resolve the dilated ER morphology, restore collagen-I secretion, and enhance secretion of some extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. However, orthotopic xenograft growth was not adversely affected by restoration of only SAR1A and SEC24D. Our studies reveal the mechanism responsible for the dilated ER that is a hallmark characteristic of OS and identify a highly conserved molecular signature for this genetically unstable tumor. Possible relationships of this phenotype to tumorigenesis are discussed.","152":null,"153":"Energy burden directly influences households' health and safety. Amid a growing literature on energy, poverty and gender remains relatively understudied. We evaluate socioeconomic, geographic, and health factors as multidimensions of concentrated disadvantage that magnify energy burden in the United States over time. We show that the energy burden is more pronounced in disadvantaged counties with larger elderly, impoverished, disabled people, and racialized populations where people do not have health insurance. Neighborhoods with households headed by women of color (especially Black women) are more likely to face a high energy burden, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although energy costs are often regarded as an individual responsibility, these findings illustrate the feminization of energy poverty and indicate the need for an intersectional and interdisciplinary framework in devising energy policy directed to households with the most severe energy burden.","154":"The innate immune system is an immediate defense against infectious pathogens by the production of inflammatory cytokines and other mediators. Deficiencies of epigenetic regulatory enzymes, such as Tet1 and Dnmt1, cause dysregulation of cytokine expression. However, it is unclear if DNA methylation at a single CpG dinucleotide in a specific gene locus can regulate gene expression. In this study, we demonstrated that CpG+286 and CpG+348 in exon 2 of the Il6 gene are similar in various primary mouse cells. In lipopolysaccharide-stimulated condition, hypomethylated CpG+286 promoted Il6 expression whereas deletion of CpG+348 led to a reduction in Il6 expression associated with enhanced CTCF binding to the Il6 locus. Moreover, hypomethylation at CpG+286 in alveolar macrophages from aged mice led to higher Il6 expression in response to LPS compared with young mice. Thus, DNA methylation at specific CpG dinucleotides plays an important regulatory role in Il6 expression.","155":null,"156":null,"157":"The human gut microbiota is considered an adjunct metabolic organ owing to its health impact. Recent studies have shown correlations between gut phage composition and host health. Whereas phage therapy has popularized virulent phages as antimicrobials, both virulent and temperate phages have a natural ecological relationship with their cognate bacteria. Characterization of this evolutionary coadaptation has led to other emergent therapeutic phage applications that do not necessarily rely on bacterial eradication or target pathogens. Here, we present an overview of the tripartite relationship between phages, bacteria, and the mammalian host, and highlight applications of the wildtype and genetically engineered phage for gut microbiome remodeling. In light of new and varied strategies, we propose to categorize phage applications aiming to modulate bacterial composition or function as \"phage rehabilitation.\" By delineating phage rehab from phage therapy, we believe it will enable greater nuance and understanding of these new phage-based technologies.","158":"Broadly effective antiviral therapies must be developed to be ready for clinical trials, which should begin soon after the emergence of new life-threatening viruses. Here, we pave the way towards this goal by reviewing conserved druggable virus-host interactions, mechanisms of action, immunomodulatory properties of available broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs), routes of BSA delivery, and interactions of BSAs with other antivirals. Based on the review, we concluded that the range of indications of BSAs can be expanded, and new pan- and cross-viral mono- and combinational therapies can be developed. We have also developed a new scoring algorithm that can help identify the most promising few of the thousands of potential BSAs and BSA-containing drug cocktails (BCCs) to prioritize their development during the critical period between the identification of a new virus and the development of virus-specific vaccines, drugs, and therapeutic antibodies.","159":null,"160":null,"161":null,"162":"Numerosity perception is a key ability to guide behavior. However, current models propose that number units encode an abstract representation of numerosity regardless of the non-numerical attributes of the stimuli, suggesting rather coarse environmental tuning. Here we investigated whether numerosity systems spontaneously adapt to all visible items, or to subsets segregated by salient attributes such as color or pitch. We measured perceived numerosity after participants adapted to highly numerous stimuli with color either matched to or different from the test. Matched colors caused a 25% underestimation of numerosity, while different colors had virtually no effect. This was true both for physically different colors, and for the same colors perceived as different, via a color-assimilation illusion. A similar result occurred in the acoustic domain, where adaptation magnitude was halved when the adaptor and test differed in pitch. Taken together, our results support the idea that numerosity perception is selectively tuned to salient environmental attributes.","163":null,"164":"Precise gene expression reflects the molecular response of deep-sea organisms to their harsh living environments. However, changes in environmental factors during lifting samples from the deep sea to a research vessel can also affect gene expression. By using the transcriptomic approach, we compared the gene expression profiles of the onboard fixed with the in situ fixed samples of the deep-sea limpet Bathyacmaea lactea. Our results revealed that the concomitant stress during conventional deep-sea sampling without RNA in situ fixation greatly influenced the gene expression. Various biological activities, such as cell and tissue structure, lysosomal activity, fluid balance, and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, were perturbed, suggesting that the sampling stress has exerted systemic impacts on the life of the limpets. These findings clearly illustrate that deep-sea samples without RNA in situ fixation can easily lead to biased results in gene expression analysis, which requires to be appropriately addressed in future studies.","165":null,"166":"Whereas prematurity is a major cause of neonatal mortality, morbidity, and lifelong impairment, the degree of prematurity is usually defined by the gestational age (GA) at delivery rather than by neonatal morbidity. Here we propose a multi-task deep neural network model that simultaneously predicts twelve neonatal morbidities, as the basis for a new data-driven approach to define prematurity. Maternal demographics, medical history, obstetrical complications, and prenatal fetal findings were obtained from linked birth certificates and maternal\/infant hospitalization records for 11,594,786 livebirths in California from 1991 to 2012. Overall, our model outperformed traditional models to assess prematurity which are based on GA and\/or birthweight (area under the precision-recall curve was 0.326 for our model, 0.229 for GA, and 0.156 for small for GA). These findings highlight the potential of using machine learning techniques to predict multiple prematurity phenotypes and inform clinical decisions to prevent, diagnose and treat neonatal morbidities.","167":"To decarbonize the economy, many governments have set targets for the use of renewable energy sources. These are often formulated as relative shares of electricity demand or supply. Implementing respective constraints in energy models is a surprisingly delicate issue. They may cause a modeling artifact of excessive electricity storage use. We introduce this phenomenon as \"unintended storage cycling\", which can be detected in case of simultaneous storage charging and discharging. In this paper, we provide an analytical representation of different approaches for implementing minimum renewable share constraints in energy models, and show how these may lead to unintended storage cycling. Using a parsimonious optimization model, we quantify related distortions of optimal dispatch and investment decisions as well as market prices, and identify important drivers of the phenomenon. Finally, we provide recommendations on how to avoid the distorting effects of unintended storage cycling in energy modeling.","168":null,"169":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19-associated critical illness, due to their immunomodulatory properties. Here, we hypothesized that viral mimic-priming improves MSCs' abilities to rebalance the dysregulated immune responses in COVID-19. Transcriptome analysis of poly(I:C)-primed MSCs (pIC-MSCs) showed upregulation of pathways in antiviral and immunomodulatory responses. Together with increased expression of antiviral proteins such as MX1, IFITM3, and OAS1, these changes translated to greater effector functions in regulating monocytes and granulocytes while further enhancing MSCs' ability to block SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry into epithelial cells. Most importantly, the addition of pIC-MSCs to COVID-19 patient whole blood significantly reduced inflammatory neutrophils and increased M2 monocytes while enhancing their phagocytic effector function. We reveal for the first time that MSCs can be primed by Toll-like receptor 3 agonist to improve their ability to rebalance the dysregulated immune responses seen in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.","170":"Meiotic crossover (CO) recombination between homologous chromosomes regulates chromosome segregation and promotes genetic diversity. Human females have different CO patterns than males, and some of these features contribute to the high frequency of chromosome segregation errors. In this study, we show that CO covariation is transmitted to progenies without detectable selection in both human males and females. Further investigations show that chromosome pairs with longer axes tend to have stronger axis length covariation and a stronger correlation between axis length and CO number, and the consequence of these two effects would be the stronger CO covariation as observed in females. These findings reveal a previously unsuspected feature for chromosome organization: long chromosome axes are more coordinately regulated than short ones. Additionally, the stronger CO covariation may work with human female-specific CO maturation inefficiency to confer female germlines the ability to adapt to changing environments on evolution.","171":"The laryngeal echolocation is regarded as one of the conspicuous traits that play major roles in flourishing bats. Whether the laryngeal echolocation in bats originated once, however, is still controversial. We here address this question by performing molecular convergence analyses between ancestral branches of bats and toothed whales. Compared with controls, the molecular convergences were enriched in hearing-related genes for the last common ancestor of bats (LCAB) and extant echolocating bats, but not for the LCA of Old World fruit bats (LCAP). And the convergent hearing gene prestin of the LCAB and the extant echolocating bats functionally converged. More importantly, the high-frequency hearing of the LCAP-prestin knock-in mice decreased with lower cochlear outer hair cell function compared with the LCAB-prestin knock-in mice. Together, our findings provide multiple lines of evidence suggesting a single origin of laryngeal echolocation in the LCAB and the subsequent loss in the LCAP.","172":"Public goods are biomolecules that benefit cellular populations, such as by providing access to previously unutilized resources. Public good production is energetically costly. To reduce this cost, populations control public good biosynthesis, for example using density-dependent regulation accomplished by quorum sensing. Fitness costs and benefits of public good production must be balanced, similar to optimal investment decisions used in economics. We explore the regulation of a public good that increases the carrying capacity, through experimental measurements of growth in Escherichia coli and analysis using a modified logistic growth model. The timing of public good production showed a sharply peaked optimum in population fitness. The cell density associated with maximum public good benefits was determined by the trade-off between the cost of public good production, in terms of reduced growth rate, and benefits received from public goods, in the form of increased carrying capacity.","173":null,"174":"The multisensory integration of signals from different senses is crucial to develop an unambiguous percept of the environment and our body. Losing a limb causes drastic changes in the body, sometimes causing pain and distorted phantom limb perception. Despite the debate over why these phenomena arise, some researchers suggested that they might be linked to an impairment of multisensory signals inflow and integration. Therefore, reestablishing optimally integrated sensory feedback could be crucial. The related benefits on sensory performance and body self-representation are still to be demonstrated, particularly in lower-limb amputees. We present a multisensory framework combining Virtual reality and electro-cutaneous stimulation that allows the optimal integration of visuo-tactile stimuli in lower-limb amputees even if nonspatially matching. We also showed that this multisensory stimulation allowed faster sensory processing, higher embodiment, and reductions in phantom limb distortions. Our findings support the development of multisensory rehabilitation approaches, restoring a correct body representation.","175":"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a betaherpesvirus that can cause severe birth defects including vision and hearing loss, microcephaly, and seizures. Currently, no approved treatment options exist for in utero infections. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of HCMV infection on the transcriptome of developing neurons in an organoid model system. Cell populations isolated from organoids based on a marker for infection and transcriptomes were defined. We uncovered downregulation in key cortical, neurodevelopmental, and functional gene pathways which occurred regardless of the degree of infection. To test the contributions of specific HCMV immediate early proteins known to disrupt neural differentiation, we infected NPCs using a recombinant virus harboring a destabilization domain. Despite suppressing their expression, HCMV-mediated transcriptional downregulation still occurred. Together, our studies have revealed that HCMV infection causes a profound downregulation of neurodevelopmental genes and suggest a role for other viral factors in this process.","176":null,"177":"Compared with conventional von Neumann's architecture-based processors, neuromorphic systems provide energy-saving in-memory computing. We present here a 3D neuromorphic humanoid hand designed for providing an artificial unconscious response based on training. The neuromorphic humanoid hand system mimics the reflex arc for a quick response by managing complex spatiotemporal information. A 3D structural humanoid hand is first integrated with 3D-printed pressure sensors and a portable neuromorphic device that was fabricated by the multi-axis robot 3D printing technology. The 3D neuromorphic robot hand provides bioinspired signal perception, including detection, signal transmission, and signal processing, together with the biomimetic reflex arc function, allowing it to hold an unknown object with an automatically increased gripping force without a conventional controlling processor. The proposed system offers a new approach for realizing an unconscious response with an artificially intelligent robot.","178":null,"179":null,"180":null,"181":null,"182":null,"183":"Solar photovoltaics, with sufficient power generation potential, low-carbon footprint, and rapidly declining costs, could supplant fossil fuels and help produce lower-cost net-zero emissions energy systems. Here we used an idealized linear optimization model, including free lossless transmission, to study the response of electricity systems to increasing prescribed amounts of solar power. Our results show that there are initially great benefits when providing solar power to the system, especially under deep decarbonization scenarios. The marginal value of additional solar power decreases substantially with increasing cumulative solar capacities. At costs near today's levels, the modeled zero-emission electricity system with free solar generation equaling twice the annual mean demand is more costly than a carbon-emitting natural-gas-based system supplying the same electricity demand with no solar. Taking full advantage of low-cost solar will depend on developing and deploying low-cost approaches to temporally shift either energy supply (e.g., storage) or electricity loads (e.g., load-shifting).","184":null,"185":"Sensing of external mineral nutrient concentrations is essential for plants to colonize environments with a large spectrum of nutrient availability. Here, we analyzed transporter networks in computational cell biology simulations to understand better the initial steps of this sensing process. The networks analyzed were capable of translating the information of changing external nutrient concentrations into cytosolic H+ and Ca2+ signals, two of the most ubiquitous cellular second messengers. The concept emerging from the computational simulations was confirmed in wet-lab experiments. We document in guard cells that alterations in the external KCl concentration were translated into cytosolic H+ and Ca2+ transients as predicted. We show that transporter networks do not only serve their primary task of transport, but can also take on the role of a receptor without requiring conformational changes of a transporter protein. Such transceptor-like phenomena may be quite common in plants.","186":"Photo-thermal reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide into methane, methanol, and carbon monoxide under mild conditions over suitable (photo)catalysts is a feasible pathway for the production of fuels and platform chemicals with minimal involvement of fossil fuels. In this perspective, we showcase transition metal nanoparticles (Ni, Cu, and Ru) dispersed over oxide semiconductors and their ability to act as photo catalysts in reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS), methane dry reforming, methanol synthesis, and Sabatier reactions. By using a combination of light and thermal energy for activation, reactions can be sustained at much lower temperatures compared to thermally driven reactions and light can be used to leverage reaction selectivity between methanol, methane, and CO. In addition to influencing the reaction mechanism and decreasing the apparent activation energies, accelerating reaction rates and boosting selectivity beyond thermodynamic limitations is possible. We also provide future directions for research to advance the current state of the art in photo-thermal CO2 conversion.","187":null,"188":"Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a partly intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that plays a major role as the downstream element of the Hippo pathway. Although the structures of the complex between TEA domain transcription factors (TEADs) and the TEAD-binding domain of YAP are already well characterized, its apo state and the binding mechanism with TEADs are still not clearly defined. Here we characterize via a combination of different NMR approaches with site-directed mutagenesis and affinity measurements the intrinsically disordered solution state of apo YAP. Our results provide evidence that the apo state of YAP adopts several compact conformations that may facilitate the formation of the YAP:TEAD complex. The interplay between local secondary structure element preformation and long-range co-stabilization of these structured elements precedes the encounter complex formation with TEAD and we, therefore, propose that TEAD binding proceeds largely via conformational selection of the preformed compact substates displaying at least nanosecond lifetimes.","189":null,"190":"Despite the common poison and mucous glands, some amphibian groups have differentiated glands associated with reproduction and usually present on the male ventral surface. Known as breeding glands or sexually dimorphic skin glands (SDSGs), they are related to intraspecific chemical communication during mating. Until recently, reproduction associated with skin glands was recognized only in salamanders and caecilians and remained unexplored among anurans. The Brazilian microhylid Dermatonotus muelleri (Muller's termite frog) is known for its very toxic skin secretion. Despite the slippery body, the male adheres to the female back during reproduction, as they have differentiated ventral glands. In this paper, we have gathered data proposing an integrative approach correlated with the species' biology and biochemical properties of their skin secretions. Furthermore, we suggest that the adhesion phenomenon is related to arm shortening and rounded body that make amplexus inefficient, although constituting important adaptive factors to life underground.","191":"Hepatic lipid accumulation is closely associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Adipose-triglyceride-lipase (ATGL) regulates triglyceride hydrolysis and maintains energy homeostasis in hepatocytes. Identifying key factors in the regulation of ATGL will help tackle hepatic lipid accumulation and related metabolic diseases. Herein, we demonstrate that syntaxin11 (STX11), a member of the SNARE family, generally expressed in immune cells, mediates lipid metabolism by binding to ATGL and inhibiting lipid droplet degradation and lipid autophagy in hepatocytes. Our data show that the C-terminal of STX11 and the patatin domain-containing segment of ATGL have direct physical interactions. Thus, STX11 overexpression prevents spatial translocation of ATGL onto LDs by recruitment of ATGL to the ER. Conversely, STX11 deficiency in hepatocytes promotes lipid hydrolysis, and the ATGL-SIRT1 signaling pathway enhances lipophagy. Overall, this study uncovered that the regulation of lipolysis and lipophagy is achieved by STX11 through the attenuation of ATGL action in hepatocytes.","192":"Classical malaria parasite genetic crosses involve isolation, genotyping, and phenotyping of progeny parasites, which is time consuming and laborious. We tested a rapid alternative approach-bulk segregant analysis (BSA)-that utilizes sequencing of bulk progeny populations with and without drug selection for rapid identification of drug resistance loci. We used dihydroartemisinin (DHA) selection in two genetic crosses and investigated how synchronization, cryopreservation, and the drug selection regimen impacted BSA success. We detected a robust quantitative trait locus (QTL) at kelch13 in both crosses but did not detect QTLs at four other candidate loci. QTLs were detected using synchronized, but not unsynchronized progeny pools, consistent with the stage-specific action of DHA. We also successfully applied BSA to cryopreserved progeny pools, expanding the utility of this approach. We conclude that BSA provides a powerful approach for investigating the genetic architecture of drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum.","193":"FBXO41 is a neuron-specific E3 ligase subunit implicated in epileptic encephalopathies. Fbxo41 null mutant (KO) mice show behavioral deficits and early lethality. Here, we report that loss of FBXO41 causes defects in synaptic transmission and brain development. Cultured Fbxo41 KO neurons had normal morphology and showed no signs of degeneration. Single-cell electrophysiology showed a lower synaptic vesicle release probability in excitatory neurons. Inhibitory neurons exhibited reduced synaptophysin expression, a smaller readily releasable pool, and decreased charge transfer during repetitive stimulation. In Fbxo41 KO hippocampal slices at postnatal day 6, the dentate gyrus was smaller with fewer radial-glial-like cells and immature neurons. In addition, neuronal migration was delayed. Two-photon calcium imaging showed a delayed increase in network activity and synchronicity. Together, our findings point toward a role for FBXO41 in synaptic transmission and postnatal brain development, before behavioral deficits are detected in Fbxo41 KO mice.","194":"The effects of UV light on the skin have been extensively investigated. However, systematic information about how the exposure to ultraviolet-A (UVA) light, the least energetic but the most abundant UV radiation reaching the Earth, shapes the subcellular organization of proteins is lacking. Using subcellular fractionation, mass-spectrometry-based proteomics, machine learning algorithms, immunofluorescence, and functional assays, we mapped the subcellular reorganization of the proteome of human keratinocytes in response to UVA light. Our workflow quantified and assigned subcellular localization for over 1,600 proteins, of which about 200 were found to redistribute upon UVA exposure. Reorganization of the proteome affected modulators of signaling pathways, cellular metabolism, and DNA damage response. Strikingly, mitochondria were identified as one of the main targets of UVA-induced stress. Further investigation demonstrated that UVA induces mitochondrial fragmentation, up-regulates redox-responsive proteins, and attenuates respiratory rates. These observations emphasize the role of this radiation as a potent metabolic stressor in the skin.","195":"High-resolution spatial transcriptomics enables mapping of RNA expression directly from intact tissue sections; however, its utility for the elucidation of disease processes and therapeutically actionable pathways remains unexplored. We applied Slide-seqV2 to mouse and human kidneys, in healthy and distinct disease paradigms. First, we established the feasibility of Slide-seqV2 in tissue from nine distinct human kidneys, which revealed a cell neighborhood centered around a population of LYVE1+ macrophages. Second, in a mouse model of diabetic kidney disease, we detected changes in the cellular organization of the spatially restricted kidney filter and blood-flow-regulating apparatus. Third, in a mouse model of a toxic proteinopathy, we identified previously unknown, disease-specific cell neighborhoods centered around macrophages. In a spatially restricted subpopulation of epithelial cells, we discovered perturbations in 77 genes associated with the unfolded protein response. Our studies illustrate and experimentally validate the utility of Slide-seqV2 for the discovery of disease-specific cell neighborhoods.","196":"In all polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), the domain size is critical for device performance. In highly crystalline polymer blends, however, precisely adjusting the domain size remains a significant challenge because of the simultaneous crystallization of both components. Herein, a strategy that promotes acceptor and donor to crystallize separately was proposed. Take PBDB-T\/N2200 blends for instance; the solution state and confined crystallization were combined, which induced the crystallization of N2200, and PBDB-T occurred during the film-forming process and at thermal annealing stage. This separated crystallization process lowers the driving force of phase separation without affecting the degree of crystallinity of the blends. Thus, an interpenetrating network with high crystallinity and proper domain size was obtained, which boosted the power conversion efficiency to 7.59%. Importantly, the relation between pre-aggregation and domain size was established, which may be a guide to precisely adjust the active layer's domain size in all-PSCs.","197":"Human disease prediction from microbiome data has broad implications in metagenomics. It is rare for the existing methods to consider abundance profiles from both known and unknown microbial organisms, or capture the taxonomic relationships among microbial taxa, leading to significant information loss. On the other hand, deep learning has shown unprecedented advantages in classification tasks for its feature-learning ability. However, it encounters the opposite situation in metagenome-based disease prediction since high-dimensional low-sample-size metagenomic datasets can lead to severe overfitting; and black-box model fails in providing biological explanations. To circumvent the related problems, we developed MetaDR, a comprehensive machine learning-based framework that integrates various information and deep learning to predict human diseases. Experimental results indicate that MetaDR achieves competitive prediction performance with a reduction in running time, and effectively discovers the informative features with biological insights.","198":"In recent decades, research on somatosensory perception has led to two important observations. First, self-generated touches that are predicted by voluntary movements become attenuated compared with externally generated touches of the same intensity (attenuation). Second, externally generated touches feel weaker and are more difficult to detect during movement than at rest (gating). At present, researchers often consider gating and attenuation the same suppression process; however, this assumption is unwarranted because, despite more than 40 years of research, no study has combined them in a single paradigm. We quantified how people perceive self-generated and externally generated touches during movement and rest. We show that whereas voluntary movement gates the precision of both self-generated and externally generated touch, the amplitude of self-generated touch is robustly attenuated compared with externally generated touch. Furthermore, attenuation and gating do not interact and are not correlated, and we conclude that they represent distinct perceptual phenomena.","199":null,"200":null,"201":null,"202":null,"203":null,"204":null,"205":null,"206":null,"207":"India is the third largest CO2 emitter worldwide, and its electricity demand, which is primarily supplied by coal-fired generation, is expected to increase almost threefold over the next twenty years. Here, we simulate 40 scenarios for the 2040 Indian electricity sector, considering uncertainty in future natural gas prices and costs for batteries and variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies, under different CO2 emissions limits and renewable portfolio standard (RPS) targets. We find a large-scale expansion of VRE, particularly, solar PV, in most scenarios. Furthermore, energy storage competes with natural gas and coal to provide flexibility to integrate VRE. Given a set of technology assumptions, policies that explicitly limit CO2 emissions are more cost-effective at reducing emissions than RPS policies. The former are also more effective at reducing air pollution than RPS policies by explicitly penalizing CO2 emissions, thereby reducing coal generation more substantially than RPS policies.","208":"Weak interfacial activity and poor wettability between fiber and matrix are known to be the two main factors that restrict the mechanical properties of carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRCs). Herein, inspired by high strength and toughness characteristics of wing feathers of Black Kite (Milvus migrans), natural hook-groove microstructure system (HGMS) and underlying mechanical interlocking mechanism were carefully investigated. Biomimetic HGMS based on dopamine-functionalized carbon fibers and ZnO nanorods were constructed successfully by a two-step modification method to enhance interfacial adhesion. Further, CFRCs featured with biomimetic HGMS were prepared by a vacuum-assisted contact molding method. Experimental results confirmed that flexural strength and interlaminar shear strength of the bioinspired CFRCs were effectively improved by 40.02 and 101.63%, respectively. The proposed bioinspired design strategy was proved to be flexible and effective and it was anticipated to provide a promising design approach and facile fabrication method for desirable CFRCs with excellent mechanical properties.","209":"In many mammalian species, both sexes may take leadership role, but different traits may play a role in determining variation within species. Here we examine the effect of sex on leadership. We present three complementary datasets derived from a well-studied population of wild rock hyrax (Procavia capensis). The findings demonstrated that male and female rock hyraxes take on different leadership positions, depending on the context. When risk is moderate, more likely to lead are younger resident males, which experience high cortisol and lower testosterone levels. However, during acute predation scenarios, more likely to lead are males with lower centrality status. We suggest that hyrax males exhibit risky behaviors that may reflect their need for self-advertisement. In contrast, leadership among group females is more equally distributed. Females have little to gain from risky actions due to the lack of competition among them, but nonetheless take leadership positions.","210":"Histone methylation, particularly at the H3K4 position, is thought to contribute to the specification of photoreceptor cell fate; however, the mechanisms linking histone methylation with transcription factor transactivation and photoreceptor gene expression have not yet been determined. Here, we demonstrate that MLL5 is abundantly expressed in the mouse retina. Mll5 deficiency impaired electroretinogram responses, alongside attenuated expression of a number of retina genes. Mechanistic studies revealed that MLL5 interacts with the retina-specific transcription factor, CRX, contributing to its binding to photoreceptor-specific gene promoters. Moreover, depletion of MLL5 impairs H3K4 methylation and H3K79 methylation, which subsequently compromises CRX-CBP assembly and H3 acetylation on photoreceptor promoters. Our data support a scenario in which recognition of H3K4 methylation by MLL5 is required for photoreceptor-specific gene transcription through maintaining a permissive chromatin state and proper CRX-CBP recruitment at promoter sites.","211":"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is one of the major sites for reactive oxygen species generation (ROS). Physiological ROS, lower than the threshold concentration, is beneficial for human physiology to preserve gut functional integrity. However, ROS generated in large quantities in presence of external stimuli overwhelms the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism and results in oxidative damage and associated physiological disorder. Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are a class of carbon-based nanomaterials that have attracted tremendous attention not only for their tunable optical properties but also for their broad-spectrum antioxidant properties. In this report we have shown that GQDs are highly efficient in scavenging ROS and suppressing stress-induced gastric ulcers by targeting the MMP-9 pathway and reducing the inflammatory burden by suppressing excessive oxidative stress by inducing high caspase activity, overproduction of Bax, and downregulation of BCL2.","212":null,"213":"Members of the taxane class of chemotherapies, staples of cancer treatment since the 1990s, can induce chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), a potentially irreversible outcome related to cumulative exposure. Switching between taxanes is often clinically necessary; however, different taxanes have different efficacies, toxicities, and dosing strategies, necessitating an evidence-based schema focused on toxicity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on docetaxel and paclitaxel, extracting cumulative dose, rates of CIPN, and subject demographics, thereby establishing their dose-toxo-equivalence relationship through a Bayesian meta-analysis model, calculating doses of the two drugs that are expected to have comparable rates of CIPN, along with credible intervals. Our final model, based on 169 studies, produces credible interval widths that provide guidance within one treatment cycle. In practice, this model provides a framework under which oncologists can make treatment switching and dosing decisions, hopefully reducing patient risk of CIPN.","214":"Mathematical models have many applications in infectious diseases: epidemiologists use them to forecast outbreaks and design containment strategies; systems biologists use them to study complex processes sustaining pathogens, from the metabolic networks empowering microbial cells to ecological networks in the microbiome that protects its host. Here, we (1) review important models relevant to infectious diseases, (2) draw parallels among models ranging widely in scale. We end by discussing a minimal set of information for a model to promote its use by others and to enable predictions that help us better fight pathogens and the diseases they cause.","215":"Full-length transcript reconstruction has a pivotal role in RNA-seq data analysis. In this research, we present a new genome-guided transcriptome assembly algorithm, namely Tiglon, which integrates multiple alignments of different mapping tools and builds the labeled splice graphs, followed by a label-based dynamic path-searching strategy to reconstruct the transcripts. We evaluate Tiglon on a simulated dataset and 12 real datasets under the Hisat2 and Star mappings. The results indicate that the integrating techniques of Tiglon exhibit great superiority over the state-of-the-art assemblers, including StringTie2 and Scallop, depending on Hisat2 alignments, Star alignments, or the merged alignments of both. Especially, Tiglon is significantly powerful in recovering lowly expressed transcripts.","216":"Based on our prior experiences we form social expectations and anticipate another person's response. Under certain conditions, these expectations can be so strong that they lead to illusory perception of another person who is actually not there (i.e., seeing a Bayesian ghost). We used EEG to investigate the neural correlates of such illusory social perception. Our results showed that activation of the premotor cortex predicted the occurrence of the Bayesian ghost, whereas its actual appearance was later accompanied by activation in sensorimotor and adjacent parietal regions. These findings confirm that our perception of others is so strongly affected by prior expectations, in such a way they can prompt illusory social perceptions associated with activity change in brain regions relevant for action perception. They also contribute to a better understanding of social interaction in healthy individuals as well as persons with mental illnesses, which can be characterized by illusory perception and social interaction difficulties.","217":null,"218":null,"219":"In this article we use high-throughput epigenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data to construct fine-graded models of the \"protein-coding units\" gathering all transcript isoforms and chromatin accessibility peaks associated with more than 4000 genes in humans. Each protein-coding unit has the structure of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and can be represented as a Bayesian network. The factorization of the joint probability distribution induced by the DAGs imposes a number of conditional independence relationships among the variables forming a protein-coding unit, corresponding to the missing edges in the DAGs. We show that a large fraction of these conditional independencies are indeed verified by the data. Factors driving this verification appear to be the structural and functional annotation of the transcript isoforms, as well as a notion of structural balance (or frustration-free) of the corresponding sample correlation graph, which naturally leads to reduction of correlation (and hence to independence) upon conditioning.","220":"We propose and demonstrate a metamaterial design by integrating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) electrothermal actuator (ETA) platform and a cross-shaped metamaterial (CSM) to perform opto-logic function characteristics. Reconfigurable and stretchable mechanisms of CSM are achieved by driving different DC bias voltages on ETA to improve the limitations induced by the conventional use of the flexible substrate. The optical responses of CSM are tunable by the electrical signals inputs. By driving a DC bias voltage of 0.20 V, a tuning range of CSM is 0.54 THz is obtained and it and provides perfect zero-transmission characteristics. In addition, the \"XNOR\" logic gate function of CSM is realized at 1.20 THz, which plays a key role in the all opto-logic network communication system. The proposed MEMS-based CSM exhibits potential applications in logical operation, signal modulation, optical switching, THz imaging, and so on.","221":"The photoreceptor rhodopsin (Rho) becomes active when a tethered inverse agonist ligand (11CR) is photoconverted to an agonist (ATR). The ligand-binding pocket of inactive rhodopsin is completely enclosed, whereas active rhodopsin displays pores accessible from the lipid bilayer. Stabilization of active rhodopsin impedes 11CR binding and photoreceptor dark adaptation. Here, we used genetic code expansion and bioorthogonal labeling to engineer Rho mutants that serve as FRET sensors for measuring 11CR binding kinetics and energetics. We found that mutations that alter a channel between transmembrane helices 5 and 6 (TM5\/6) dramatically affect 11CR binding kinetics but not agonist release kinetics. Our data provide direct experimental evidence for 11CR entry between TM5\/6 in Rho that involves dynamic allosteric control of the ligand entry channel. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding the function of G protein-coupled receptors with hydrophobic ligands that are hypothesized to enter their binding pockets through transmembrane pores.","222":null,"223":null,"224":null,"225":"High ambient temperatures have adverse impacts on crop yields. Although a few plant thermosensors have been reported, these sensors directly or indirectly impact PIF4-controlled transcriptional regulation. Moreover, high temperatures also trigger a number of post-transcriptional alternative splicing events in plants and even in animals. Here, we show that LAMMER kinase AFC2 in Arabidopsis controls high-temperature-triggered alternative splicing. Plants without AFC2 exhibited distorted splicing patterns at a high ambient temperature. Further investigations revealed that high temperatures triggered alternative splicing in the majority of PIF4 target genes as a means of desensitizing PIF4 signaling. Consistently, the afc2 mutants exhibited more exaggerated high ambient temperature responses in a PIF4-dependent manner. AFC2 directly phosphorylated the serine\/arginine-rich protein splicing factor RSZ21, and AFC2 kinase activity decreased with increasing temperature, indicating that the AFC2 itself may sense temperature changes. In summary, we report that alternative splicing is a safe-guard mechanism when plants encounter high temperature.","226":null,"227":"Past decades have witnessed the emergence and increasing expansion of parity-time ( P T  )-symmetric systems in diverse physical fields and beyond as they manifest entirely all-real spectra, although being non-Hermitian. Nonlinear waves in low-dimensional P T  -symmetric non-Hermitian systems have recently been explored broadly; however, understanding these systems in higher dimensions remains abstruse and has yet to be revealed. We survey, theoretically and numerically, matter-wave nonlinear gap modes of Bose-Einstein condensates with repulsive interparticle interactions in three-dimensional P T  optical lattices with emphasis on multidimensional gap solitons and vortices. Utilizing direct perturbed simulations, we address the stability and instability areas of both localized modes in the underlying linear band gap spectra. Our study provides deep and consistent understandings of the formation, structural property, and dynamics of coherent localized matter waves supported by P T  optical lattices in multidimensional space, thus opening a way for exploring and stabilizing three-dimensional localized gap modes in non-Hermitian systems.","228":"The biophysical microenvironment of the cell is being increasingly used to control cell signaling and to direct cell function. Herein, engineered 3D tuneable biomimetic scaffolds are used to control the cell microenvironment of Adipose-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (AMSC), which exhibit a collagen density-specific profile for early and late stage bone cell lineage status. Cell potency was enhanced when AMSCs were cultured within low collagen density environments in hypoxic conditions. A transitional culture containing varied collagen densities in hypoxic conditions directed differential cell fate responses. The early skeletal progenitor identity (PDPN+CD146-CD73+CD164+) was rescued in the cells which migrated into low collagen density gels, with cells continuously exposed to the high collagen density gels displaying a transitioned bone-cartilage-stromal phenotype (PDPN+CD146+CD73-CD164-). This study uncovers the significant contributions of the physical and physiological cell environment and highlights a chemically independent methodology for reprogramming and isolating skeletal progenitor cells from an adipose-derived cell population.","229":null,"230":"(1) In contrast to mammals and birds, reptiles have been considered as indeterminate growers, whose growth reflects differential allocation of resources to growth versus other energetically demanding processes such as reproduction. (2) We monitored the growth and activity of bone growth plates, hormonal profiles, and reproductive activity in males and females of the male-larger gecko Paroedura picta. We show that growth plates fuse in this species in a sex-specific manner. The more abrupt epiphyseal closure and more pronounced growth deceleration in females coincide with the increased activity of their reproductive organs. (3) We conclude that at least some lizards are determinate growers whose sexual size dimorphism is potentially driven by ovarian hormones. The major difference in growth between endothermic and ectothermic amniotes appears to be in the magnitude of growth before and after the first reproduction, not in the mechanistic processes such as senescence of growth plate cells.","231":"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is incurable and remains a significant worldwide challenge (Oakes and Papa, 2015). Matched untargeted multi-level omic datasets may reveal biological changes driving CRPC, identifying novel biomarkers and\/or therapeutic targets. Untargeted RNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics were performed on xenografts derived from three independent sets of hormone naive and matched CRPC human cell line models of local, lymph node, and bone metastasis grown as murine orthografts. Collectively, we tested the feasibility of muti-omics analysis on models of CRPC in revealing pathways of interest for future validation investigation. Untargeted metabolomics revealed NAA and NAAG commonly accumulating in CRPC across three independent models and proteomics showed upregulation of related enzymes, namely N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidases (FOLH1\/NAALADL2). Based on pathway analysis integrating multiple omic levels, we hypothesize that increased NAA in CRPC may be due to upregulation of NAAG hydrolysis via NAALADLases providing a pool of acetyl Co-A for upregulated sphingolipid metabolism and a pool of glutamate and aspartate for nucleotide synthesis during tumor growth.","232":"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a pivotal role in neuronal growth and differentiation, neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory. Using CRISPR\/Cas9 technology, we generated a vital Bdnf null mutant line in zebrafish and carried out its molecular and behavioral characterization. Although no defects are evident on a morphological inspection, 66% of coding genes and 37% of microRNAs turned out to be differentially expressed in bdnf -\/- compared with wild type sibling embryos. We deeply investigated the circadian clock pathway and confirmed changes in the rhythmic expression of clock (arntl1a, clock1a and clock2) and clock-controlled (aanat2) genes. The modulatory role of Bdnf on the zebrafish circadian clock was then validated by behavioral tests highlighting the absence of circadian activity rhythms in bdnf -\/- larvae. The circadian behavior was partially rescued by pharmacological treatment. The bdnf -\/- zebrafish line presented here is the first valuable and stable vertebrate model for the study of BDNF-related neurodevelopmental diseases.","233":null,"234":"Tackling climate change is one of the undoubtedly most important challenges at the present time. This review deals mainly with the chemical aspects of the current status for converting the greenhouse gas CO2 via electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multicarbon alcohols as valuable products. Feasible reaction routes are presented, as well as catalyst synthesis methods such as electrodeposition, precipitation, or sputtering. In addition, a comprehensive overview of the currently achievable selectivities for multicarbon alcohols in CO2RR is given. It is also outlined to what extent, for example, modifications of the catalyst surfaces or the use of bifunctional compounds the product distribution is shifted. In addition, the influence of varying electrolyte, temperature, and pressure is described and discussed.","235":null,"236":null,"237":null,"238":"Nuclear hybrid energy systems (NHES) are a viable option to provide clean power by combining renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. This study analyzes two types of NHES that use small modular reactors (SMR) and wind turbines to produce clean energy and water. The first system uses freeze desalination (FD) and the second system uses reverse osmosis (RO) to produce clean water. Both systems are optimized using net present value at two case locations. The FD system can better meet the energy demand using the stored thermal energy to boost the power during peak hours, which allows less capital investment on its design compared to the RO system. However, the results from the two cases reveal that the RO system can be more economic when water price is more than $1.50\/m3. A sensitivity analysis also identified the critical system parameters on the net present value of the systems.","239":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are ubiquitously secreted by almost all tissues and carry many cargoes, including proteins, RNAs, and lipids, which are related to various biological processes. EVs are shed from tissues into the blood and expected to be used as biomarkers for diseases. Here, we isolated EVs from EDTA plasma and serum of six healthy subjects by an affinity capture isolation method, and a total of 4,079 proteins were successfully identified by comprehensive EV proteomics. Our reliable and detailed catalog of the differential expression profiles of EV proteins in plasma and serum between healthy individuals could be useful as a reference for biomarker discovery. Furthermore, tissue-specific protein groups co-regulated between blood EVs from healthy individuals were identified. These EV proteins are expected to be used for more specific and sensitive enrichment of tissue-specific EVs and for screening and monitoring of disease without diagnostic imaging in patient blood in the future.","240":null,"241":null,"242":null,"243":null,"244":null,"245":"In the terahertz (THz) electromagnetic wave regime, which has recently received great attention in the fields of communication and security, shielding of THz waves is a significant issue. Therefore, carbon-based nanostructures or polymer-carbon nanocomposites have been widely explored. Herein, significantly enhanced THz shielding efficiency is reported for silver nanowires coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and nanoscale THz metamaterials, as compared to the cases without nanoscale metamaterials. Using a nanoslot-patterned metamaterial with strong resonances at certain frequencies, THz transmission in intensity is enhanced up to three orders of magnitude. Enhanced transmission by nanopatterns substantially increases the shielding performance to the external THz waves, even for ultrathin films (several tens of nanometers) produced by a simple spray of rGO (a few nm of flakes) on a complex random nanowire network. Excellent shielding performance is presented and the shielding mechanism is investigated by the nanoprobing configuration at the same time.","246":"For the efficient electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemical feedstocks, a well-coordinated interaction of all electrolyzer compartments is required. In addition to the catalyst, whose role is described in detail in the part \"Electrochemical CO2 Reduction toward Multicarbon Alcohols - The Microscopic World of Catalysts &amp; Process Conditions\" of this divided review, the general cell setups, design and manufacture of the electrodes, membranes used, and process parameters must be optimally matched. The authors' goal is to provide a comprehensive review of the current literature on how these aspects affect the overall performance of CO2 electrolysis. To be economically competitive as an overall process, the framework conditions, i.e., CO2 supply and reaction product treatment must also be considered. If the key indicators for current density, selectivity, cell voltage, and lifetime of a CO2 electrolyzer mentioned in the techno-economic consideration of this review are met, electrochemical CO2 reduction can make a valuable contribution to the creation of closed carbon cycles and to a sustainable energy economy.","247":null,"248":null,"249":null,"250":"Retinal dystrophies (RDs) lead to irreversible vision impairment with no radical treatment. Although photoreceptor cells (PRCs) differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are essential for the study of RDs as a scalable source, current differentiation methods for PRCs require multiple steps. To address these issues, we developed a method to generate PRCs from human iPSCs by introducing the transcription factors, CRX and NEUROD1. This approach enabled us to generate induced photoreceptor-like cells (iPRCs) expressing PRC markers. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the transcriptome of iPRCs in which the genes associated with phototransduction were expressed. Generated iPRCs exhibited their functional properties in calcium imaging. Furthermore, light-induced damage on iPRCs was inhibited by an antioxidant compound. This simple approach would facilitate the availability of materials for PRC-related research and provide a useful application for disease modeling and drug discovery.","251":null,"252":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in intercellular communication and contribute to the angiogenesis. However, the understanding of the mechanisms underlying EVs secretion by neurons and their action on the vascular system of the central nervous system (CNS) remain rudimentary. Here, we show that vacuolar protein sorting 28 (Vps28) is essential for the sprouting of brain central arteries (CtAs) and for the integrity of blood-brain barrier (BBB) in zebrafish. Disruption of neuron-enriched Vps28 significantly decreased EVs secretion by regulating the formation of intracellular multivesicular bodies (MVBs). EVs derived from zebrafish embryos or mouse cortical neurons partially rescued the brain vasculature defect and brain leakage. Further investigations revealed that neuronal EVs containing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) are key regulators in neurovascular communication. Our results indicate that Vps28 acts as an intercellular endosomal regulator mediating the secretion of neuronal EVs, which in turn communicate with endothelial cells to mediate angiogenesis through VEGF-A trafficking.","253":"Abnormal interactions between skin cells play an important role in the dysregulation of diabetic wound recovery. Exosomes are cell-derived lipid nanoparticles that transport messages between cells, and isolating and identifying potential therapeutic noncoding RNAs from exosomes is very important. We demonstrated that treatment with Exos from high glucose-pretreated immortalized human epidermal (HaCaT) cells (HG-Exos) could delay the wound healing process in diabetic mice. Further analysis indicated the Exo-mediated uptake of LINC01435 in recipient human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) changes the subcellular localization of the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and cooperates with YY1 to upregulate the expression of histone deacetylases (HDACs)8, resulting in decreased tube formation and ability of HUVECs to migrate, thus angiogenesis was inhibited. These results suggest that LINC01435\/YY1\/HDAC8 may be an important signaling pathway affecting the recovery of diabetic wounds, which makes it a potential target for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.","254":"There are 9,000+ per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in existence, which makes studying and regulating PFAS individually, or even as small mixtures, infeasible. Multiple PFAS definitions based on structure have been proposed, yet these definitions do not consider the implications for the full suite of organofluorine chemicals. For example, organofluorine pharmaceuticals, whose use may be essential and are found in human serum and wastewater, are not uniformly identified across all definitions. Using nine definitions prepared by various stakeholders, we screened the 360 organofluorine pharmaceuticals approved and used globally between 1954 and 2021. Definitions ranged in their inclusion of organofluorine pharmaceuticals (1%-100%). The most inclusive definitions include several top prescribed pharmaceuticals, e.g., Prozac and Lipitor. This analysis provides a framework against which organizations can make decisions about how best to proceed when defining PFAS.","255":null,"256":"Biological rhythms pervade physiology and pathophysiology across multiple timescales. Because of the limited sensing and algorithm capabilities of neuromodulation device technology to-date, insight into the influence of these rhythms on the efficacy of bioelectronic medicine has been infeasible. As the development of new devices begins to mitigate previous technology limitations, we propose that future devices should integrate chronobiological considerations in their control structures to maximize the benefits of neuromodulation therapy. We motivate this proposition with preliminary longitudinal data recorded from patients with Parkinson's disease and epilepsy during deep brain stimulation therapy, where periodic symptom biomarkers are synchronized to sub-daily, daily, and longer timescale rhythms. We suggest a physiological control structure for future bioelectronic devices that incorporates time-based adaptation of stimulation control, locked to patient-specific biological rhythms, as an adjunct to classical control methods and illustrate the concept with initial results from three of our recent case studies using chronotherapy-enabled prototypes.","257":"Fluorescent biosensors are powerful tools allowing the concentration of metabolites and small molecules, and other properties such as pH and molecular crowding to be measured inside live single cells. The technology has been hampered by lack of simple software to identify cells and quantify biosensor signals in single cells. We have developed a new software package, FRETzel, to address this gap and demonstrate its use by measuring insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in individual fat cells of varying sizes for the first time. Our results support the long-standing hypothesis that larger fat cells are less sensitive to insulin than smaller ones, a finding that has important implications for the battle against type 2 diabetes. FRETzel has been optimized using the messy and crowded environment of cultured adipocytes, demonstrating its utility for quantification of FRET biosensors in a wide range of other cell types, including fibroblasts and yeast via a simple user-friendly quantitative interface.","258":null,"259":"Mutations in the gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) are the most common cause of clonal hematopoiesis and are among the most common initiating events of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Studies in germline and somatic Dnmt3a knockout mice have identified focal, canonical hypomethylation phenotypes in hematopoietic cells; however, the kinetics of methylation loss following acquired DNMT3A inactivation in hematopoietic cells is essentially unknown. Therefore, we evaluated a somatic, inducible model of hematopoietic Dnmt3a loss, and show that inactivation of Dnmt3a in murine hematopoietic cells results in a relatively slow loss of methylation at canonical sites throughout the genome; in contrast, remethylation of Dnmt3a deficient genomes in hematopoietic cells occurs much more quickly. This data suggests that slow methylation loss may contribute, at least in part, to the long latent period that characterizes clonal expansion and leukemia development in individuals with acquired DNMT3A mutations in hematopoietic stem cells.","260":"The gut microbiota can affect how animals respond to ingested toxins, such as ethanol, which is prevalent in the diets of diverse animals and often leads to negative health outcomes in humans. Ethanol is a complex dietary factor because it acts as a toxin, behavioral manipulator, and nutritional source, with both direct effects on the host as well as indirect ones through the microbiome. Here, we developed a model for chronic, non-intoxicating ethanol ingestion in the adult fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and paired this with the tractability of the fly gut microbiota, which can be experimentally removed. We linked numerous physiological, behavioral, and transcriptional variables to fly fitness, including a combination of intestinal barrier integrity, stored triglyceride levels, feeding behavior, and the immunodeficiency pathway. Our results reveal a complex tradeoff between lifespan and fecundity that is microbiome-dependent and modulated by dietary ethanol and feeding behavior.","261":null,"262":"Commercial poultry operations produce and crowd billions of birds every year, which is a source of inexpensive animal protein. Commercial poultry is intensely bred for desirable production traits, and currently presents very low variability at the major histocompatibility complex. This situation dampens the advantages conferred by the MHC's high genetic variability, and crowding generates immunosuppressive stress. We address the proteins of influenza A viruses directly and indirectly involved in host specificities. We discuss how mutants with increased virulence and\/or altered host specificity may arise if few class I alleles are the sole selective pressure on avian viruses circulating in immunocompromised poultry. This hypothesis is testable with peptidomics of MHC ligands. Breeding strategies for commercial poultry can easily and inexpensively include high variability of MHC as a trait of interest, to help save billions of dollars as a disease burden caused by influenza and decrease the risk of selecting highly virulent strains.","263":"Nutrients are scarce and valuable resources, so plants developed sophisticated mechanisms to optimize nutrient use efficiency. A crucial part of this is monitoring external and internal nutrient levels to adjust processes such as uptake, redistribution, and cellular compartmentation. Measurement of nutrient levels is carried out by primary sensors that typically involve either transceptors or transcription factors. Primary sensors are only now starting to be identified in plants for some nutrients. In particular, for nitrate, there is detailed insight concerning how the external nitrate status is sensed by members of the nitrate transporter 1 (NRT1) family. Potential sensors for other macronutrients such as potassium and sodium have also been identified recently, whereas for micronutrients such as zinc and iron, transcription factor type sensors have been reported. This review provides an overview that interprets and evaluates our current understanding of how plants sense macro and micronutrients in the rhizosphere and root symplast.","264":null,"265":"DNA strands with unique secondary structures can catalyze various chemical reactions and mimic natural enzymes with the assistance of cofactors, which have attracted much research attention. At the same time, the emerging DNA nanotechnology provides an efficient platform to organize functional components of the enzymatic systems and regulate their catalytic performances. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of DNA-based enzymatic systems. First, DNAzymes (Dzs) are introduced, and their versatile utilities are summarized. Then, G-quadruplex\/hemin (G4\/hemin) Dzs with unique oxidase\/peroxidase-mimicking activities and representative examples where these Dzs served as biosensors are explicitly elaborated. Next, the DNA-based enzymatic cascade systems fabricated by the structural DNA nanotechnology are depicted. In addition, the applications of catalytic DNA nanostructures in biosensing and biomedicine are included. At last, the challenges and the perspectives of the DNA-based enzymatic systems for practical applications are also discussed.","266":"Many light-based technologies have been developed to manipulate micro\/nanoscale objects such as colloidal particles and biological cells for basic research and practical applications. While most approaches such as optical tweezers are best suited for manipulation of objects in fluidic environments, optical manipulation on solid substrates has recently gained research interest for its advantages in constructing, reconfiguring, or powering solid-state devices consisting of colloidal particles as building blocks. Here, we review recent progress in optical technologies that enable versatile manipulation and assembly of micro\/nanoscale objects on solid substrates. Diverse technologies based on distinct physical mechanisms, including photophoresis, photochemical isomerization, optothermal phase transition, optothermally induced surface acoustic waves, and optothermal expansion, are discussed. We conclude this review with our perspectives on the opportunities, challenges, and future directions in optical manipulation and assembly on solid substrates.","267":null,"268":null,"269":"Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is widely used for quantifying the mechanical properties of soft materials such as cells. AFM force-indentation curves are conventionally fitted with a Hertzian model to extract elastic properties. These properties solely are, however, insufficient to describe the mechanical properties of cells. Here, we expand the analysis capabilities to describe the viscoelastic behavior while using the same force-indentation curves. Our model gives an explicit relation of force and indentation and extracts physically meaningful mechanical parameters. We first validated the model on simulated force-indentation curves. Then, we applied the fitting model to the force-indentation curves of two hydrogels with different crosslinking mechanisms. Finally, we characterized HeLa cells in two cell cycle phases, interphase and mitosis, and showed that mitotic cells have a higher apparent elasticity and a lower apparent viscosity. Our study provides a simple method, which can be directly integrated into the standard AFM framework for extracting the viscoelastic properties of materials.","270":"Internet of Things (IoT) and recently Internet of Nano Things (IoNT) bear the promise of new devices able to communicate and assist our daily lives toward wearable technologies which demand a versatile integration such as in wireless body networks (WBN), sensing, and health monitorization. These must comply with stringent constraints on energy usage. Dimensions and complexity intensify the need for small and maintenance-free power sources. Environment energy harvesting and storage is an important approach to sustain operation for a long time. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) arise as a strong and promising solution to power the new field of outcoming self-sustainable devices, implantable, and wearable devices. They can transform mechanical energy in different modes, have simple structures, and use vulgar and sustainable materials. This paper makes a review about TENGs technology, construction, materials, operation, and focus on strategies for harvesting circuits. Main challenges like efficiency, reliability, energy storage, and sustainability are discussed.","271":"Accurate state-of-health (SOH) prediction of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) plays an important role in improving the performance and assuring the safe operation of the battery energy storage system (BESS). Deep extreme learning machine (DELM) optimized by the improved sparrow search algorithm (ISSA) is developed to predict the SOH of LIBs under random load conditions in the paper. Firstly, two indirect health indicators are extracted from the random partial discharging voltage and current data, which are chosen as the inputs of DELM by the Pearson correlation analysis. Then, ISSA is presented by combining the elite opposition-based learning (EOBL) and the Cauchy-Gaussian mutation strategy to increase the diversity of sparrow populations and prevent them from falling into the local optimization. Finally, the ISSA-DELM model is utilized to estimate the battery SOH. Experimental results illustrate the high accuracy and strong robustness of the proposed approach compared with other methods.","272":"Meiotic prophase I is a prolonged G2 phase that ensures the completion of numerous meiosis-specific chromosome events. During meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosomes undergo synapsis to facilitate meiotic recombination yielding crossovers. It remains largely elusive how homolog synapsis is temporally maintained and destabilized during meiotic prophase I. Here we show that FBXO47 is the stabilizer of the synaptonemal complex during male meiotic prophase I. Disruption of FBXO47 shows severe impact on homologous chromosome synapsis, meiotic recombination, and XY body formation, leading to male infertility. Notably, in the absence of FBXO47, although once homologous chromosomes are synapsed, the synaptonemal complex is precociously disassembled before progressing beyond pachytene. Remarkably, Fbxo47 KO spermatocytes remain in an earlier stage of meiotic prophase I and lack crossovers, despite apparently exhibiting diplotene-like chromosome morphology. We propose that FBXO47 plays a crucial role in preventing the synaptonemal complex from premature disassembly during cell cycle progression of meiotic prophase I.","273":null,"274":null,"275":"Homeostasis of gut microbiota is crucial in maintaining human health. Alterations, or \"dysbiosis,\" are increasingly implicated in human diseases, such as cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, and, more recently, neurological disorders. In ischemic stroke patients, gut microbial profiles are markedly different compared to healthy controls, whereas manipulation of microbiota in animal models of stroke modulates outcome, further implicating microbiota in stroke pathobiology. Despite this, evidence for the involvement of specific microbes or microbial products and microbial signatures have yet to be identified, likely owing to differences in methodology, data analysis, and confounding variables between different studies. Here, we provide a set of guidelines to enable researchers to conduct high-quality, reproducible, and transparent microbiota studies, focusing on 16S rRNA sequencing in the emerging subfield of the stroke-microbiota. In doing so, we aim to facilitate novel and reproducible associations between the microbiota and brain diseases, including stroke, and translation into clinical practice.","276":null,"277":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression via mRNA targeting, playing important roles in the pancreatic islets. We aimed to identify molecular pathways and genomic regulatory regions associated with altered miRNA expression due to glycemic status, which could contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). To this end, miRNAs were identified by a combination of differential miRNA expression and correlation analysis in human islet samples from donors with normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Analysis and clustering of highly correlated, experimentally validated gene targets of these miRNAs revealed two islet-specific clusters, which were associated with key aspects of islet functions and included a high number of T2D-related genes. Finally, cis-eQTLs and public GWAS data integration uncovered suggestive genomic signals of association with insulin secretion and T2D. The miRNA-driven network-based approach presented in this study contributes to a better understanding of impaired insulin secretion in T2D pathogenesis.","278":"Coupled resonant cavities can enable strong photon energy confinement to facilitate the miniaturization of functional photonic devices for applications in designs of sensors, modulators, couplers, waveguides, color filters etc. Typically, the resonances in subwavelength plasmonic cavities rely on the excitation of surface plasmons at specific phase-matching conditions, usually determined by the lattice parameters and constituent material properties. Contrary to this notion, we experimentally demonstrate the control and manipulation of cavity resonances via suitably modifying the split ring resonator geometry in hybrid plasmonic-metasurface (dipole cavity-SRR) configuration without altering the lattice parameters. This results to the excitation of dual resonance peaks. Such dual channel characteristics demonstrate high quality (Q) factor, multi-band resonances, not permissible with typical (unhybridized) plasmonic dipole cavities. We envisage such hybrid meta-cavity designs can become important ingredients for futuristic terahertz devices that can hold the key for sixth generation (6G) communications, designer filters, dual channel sensors etc.","279":null,"280":null,"281":"Several studies suggest that rodents show empathic responses and helping behavior toward others. We examined whether prairie voles would help conspecifics who were soaked in water by opening a door to a safe area. Door-opening latency decreased as task sessions progressed. Female and male voles stayed close to the soaked voles' side at equal rates and opened the door with similar latencies. When the conspecific was not soaked in water, the door-opening latency did not decrease. This suggests that the distress of the conspecific is necessary for learning to open the door and that the door-opening performed by prairie voles corresponds to helping behavior. Additionally, we examined the helping behavior in prairie voles in which oxytocin receptors were genetically knocked out. Oxytocin receptor knockout voles demonstrated less learning of the door-opening behavior and less interest in soaked conspecifics. This suggests that oxytocin is important for the emergence of helping behavior.","282":null,"283":"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a most common chronic liver disease that is manifested by steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue damage. Hepatocytes produce giant mitochondria termed megamitochondria in patients with NASH. It has been shown that gene knockout of OPA1, a mitochondrial dynamin-related GTPase that mediates mitochondrial fusion, prevents megamitochondria formation and liver damage in a NASH mouse model induced by a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet. However, it is unknown whether blocking mitochondrial fusion mitigates NASH pathologies. Here, we acutely depleted OPA1 using antisense oligonucleotides in the NASH mouse model before or after megamitochondria formation. When OPA1 ASOs were applied at the disease onset, they effectively prevented megamitochondria formation and liver pathologies in the MCD model. Notably, even when applied after mice robustly developed NASH pathologies, OPA1 targeting effectively regressed megamitochondria and the disease phenotypes. Thus, our data show the efficacy of mitochondrial dynamics as a unique therapy for megamitochondria-associated liver disease.","284":null,"285":"The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) suggests the use of chemotherapy as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and concomitant to surgery and radiotherapy for the treatment of oral carcinoma by depending on the cancer stage. The usual drug of choice belongs to the platinum compounds. In this context, the evaluation of the cancer behavior associated with the administration of standard or emerging cisplatin compounds supports the establishment of optimal cancer management. Here, we have assessed and compared the performance of cisplatin alone and contained in biodegradable nanocapsules on standardized chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) tumor models. The vascularized environment and optimized grafting procedure allowed the establishment of solid tumors. The treatments showed antitumor and anti-angiogenic activities together with deregulation of pivotal genes responsible of treatment resistance and tumor aggressiveness. This study further supports the significance of CAM tumor models in oncological research for the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor treatment response.","286":null,"287":null,"288":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved state-of-the-art performance in medical imaging. However, most algorithms focused exclusively on improving the accuracy of classification while neglecting the major challenges in a real-world application. The opacity of algorithms prevents users from knowing when the algorithms might fail. And the natural gap between training datasets and the in-reality data may lead to unexpected AI system malfunction. Knowing the underlying uncertainty is essential for improving system reliability. Therefore, we developed a COVID-19 AI system, utilizing a Bayesian neural network to calculate uncertainties in classification and reliability intervals of datasets. Validated with four multi-region datasets simulating different scenarios, our approach was proved to be effective to suggest the system failing possibility and give the decision power to human experts in time. Leveraging on the complementary strengths of AI and health professionals, our present method has the potential to improve the practicability of AI systems in clinical application.","289":"The exposome concept encourages holistic consideration of the non-genetic factors (environmental exposures including lifestyle) that influence an individual's health over their life course. However, disconnect between the concept and practical application has promoted divergent interpretations of the exposome across disciplines and reinforced separation of the environmental (emphasizing exposures) and biological (emphasizing responses) research communities. In particular, while knowledge of biological responses can help to distinguish actual (i.e. experienced) from potential exposures, the inclusion of endogenous processes has generated confusion about the position of the exposome in a multi-omics systems biology context. We propose a reattribution of \"exposome\" to exclusively represent the totality of contact with external factors that a biological entity experiences, and introduce the term \"functional exposomics\" to denote the systematic study of exposure-phenotype interaction. This reoriented definition of the exposome allows a more readily integrable dataset for multi-omics and systems biology research.","290":null,"291":"The Mammary gland undergoes complicated epithelial remodeling to form lobuloalveoli during pregnancy, in which basal epithelial cells remarkably increase to form a basket-like architecture. However, it remains largely unknown how dormant mammary basal stem\/progenitor cells involve in lobuloalveolar development. Here, we show that Nfatc1 expression marks a rare population of mammary epithelial cells with the majority being basal epithelial cells. Nfatc1 reporter-marked basal epithelial cells are relatively dormant mammary stem\/progenitor cells. Although Nfatc1 reporter-marked basal epithelial cells have limited contribution to the homeostasis of mammary epithelium, they divide rapidly during pregnancy and contribute to lobuloalveolar development. Furthermore, Nfatc1 reporter-marked basal epithelial cells are preferentially used for multiple pregnancies. Using single-cell RNA-seq analysis, we identify multiple functionally distinct clusters within the Nfatc1 reporter-marked cell-derived progeny cells during pregnancy. Taken together, our findings underscore Nfatc1 reporter-marked basal cells as dormant stem\/progenitor cells that contribute to mammary lobuloalveolar development during pregnancy.","292":null,"293":null,"294":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.103463.].","295":null,"296":"The success of small molecule therapeutics that promotes degradation of critical cancer targets has fueled an intense effort to mimic this activity with bispecific molecules called PROTACs (proteolysis targeting chimeras). The simultaneous binding of PROTACs to a ligase and target can induce proximity-driven ubiquitination and degradation. VHL and CRBN are the two best characterized PROTAC ligases, but the rules governing their cellular activities remain unclear. To establish these requirements and extend them to new ligases, we screened a panel of 56 cell lines with two potent PROTACs that utilized VHL, MZ1, or CRBN, dBET1 to induce degradation of BRD4. With notable exceptions, MZ1 was broadly active in the panel whereas dBET1 was frequently inactive. A search for predictive biomarkers of PROTAC activity found that expression and mutation of VHL and CRBN were themselves predictors of PROTAC activity in the cell line panel.","297":"The major clinical consequences of atherosclerosis such as myocardial infarction or stroke are because of thrombotic events associated with acute rupture or erosion of an unstable plaque. Here, we identify an lncRNA Noncoding Repressor of NFAT (Nron) as a critical regulator of atherosclerotic plaque stability. Nron overexpression (OE) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) induces a highly characteristic architecture of more-vulnerable plaques, while Nron knockdown (KD) suppresses the development of atherosclerosis and favors plaque stability. Mechanistically, Nron specifically binds to and negatively regulates NFATc3, thus inhibiting the proliferation and promoting the apoptosis of VSMCs. Moreover, we also provide evidence that Nron increases the production and secretion of VEGFA from VSMCs, which functions as a paracrine factor to enhance intra-plaque angiogenesis. All of these effects contribute to plaque instability. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Nron may have potential for future therapy of atherosclerosis.","298":"COVID-19 has killed over 6 million people worldwide. Currently available methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 are limited by their cost and need for multistep sample preparation and trained personnel. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop fast, inexpensive, and scalable point-of-care diagnostics that can be used for mass testing. Between January and March 2021, we obtained 321 anterior nare swab samples from individuals in Philadelphia (PA, USA). For the Real-time Accurate Portable Impedimetric Detection prototype 1.0 (RAPID) test, anterior nare samples were tested via an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) approach. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of RAPID in this cohort study were 80.6%, 89.0%, and 88.2%, respectively. We present a rapid, accurate, inexpensive (&lt;$5.00 per unit), and scalable test for diagnosing COVID-19 at the point-of-care. We anticipate that further iterations of this approach will enable widespread deployment, large-scale testing, and population-level surveillance.","299":"With the rapid emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants, development of vaccines with broad and potent protectivity has become a global priority. Here, we designed a lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated, nucleoside-unmodified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) vaccine encoding the trimerized receptor-binding domain (RBD trimer) and showed its robust capability in inducing broad and protective immune responses against wild-type and major variants of concern (VOCs) in the mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The protectivity was correlated with RBD-specific B cell responses especially the long-lived plasma B cells in bone marrow, strong ability in triggering BCR clustering, and downstream signaling. Monoclonal antibodies isolated from vaccinated animals demonstrated broad and potent neutralizing activity against VOCs tested. Structure analysis of one representative antibody identified a novel epitope with a high degree of conservation among different variants. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the RBD trimer mRNA vaccine serves as a promising vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2 variants and beyond.","300":null,"301":null,"302":null,"303":null,"304":null,"305":null,"306":"In the intelligent transportation system (ITS), speed prediction plays a significant role in supporting vehicle routing and traffic guidance.

However, a systematic review of speed prediction in and between different levels is still missing. In this article, existing research is comprehensively analyzed and divided into three levels, i.e. macro traffic, micro vehicles, and meso lane. In addition, this article summarizes the influencing factors and reviews the prediction methods based on how those methods utilize the available information to meet the challenges of the prediction at different levels. This is followed by a summary of evaluation metrics, public datasets, and open-source codes. Finally, future directions in this field are discussed to inspire and guide readers. This article aims to draw a complete picture of speed prediction and promote the development of ITS.","307":"Myocardial inflammation contributes to cardiomyopathy in diabetic patients through incompletely defined underlying mechanisms. In both human and time-course experimental samples, diabetic hearts exhibited abnormal ER, with a maladaptive shift over time in rodents. Furthermore, as a cardiac ER dysfunction model, mice with cardiac-specific p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) deletion exhibited heightened myocardial inflammatory response in diabetes. Mechanistically, maladaptive ER stress-induced CCAAT\/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) is a novel transcriptional regulator of cardiac high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1). Cardiac stress-induced release of HMGB1 facilitates M1 macrophage polarization, aggravating myocardial inflammation. Therapeutically, sequestering the extracellular HMGB1 using glycyrrhizin conferred cardioprotection through its anti-inflammatory action. Our findings also indicated that an intact cardiac ER function and protective effects of the antidiabetic drug interdependently attenuated the cardiac inflammation-induced dysfunction. Collectively, we introduce an ER stress-mediated cardiomyocyte-macrophage link, altering the macrophage response, thereby providing insight into therapeutic prospects for diabetes-associated cardiac dysfunction.","308":"The non-symmorphic crystal symmetry protection in the layered topological semimetal Nb3SiTe6 can generate exotic band crossings. Herein, high-quality Nb3SiTe6 single crystal was synthesized via chemical vapor transport. The lattice structure of Nb3SiTe6 was characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, core-level photoemission, and Raman spectroscopies. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy was used to reveal its topological properties by presenting band structures along different high-symmetry directions. Our data show that nontrivial band features coexist in Nb3SiTe6, including an hourglass-type dispersion formed by two bands along the S-R high-symmetry line, two node lines along the S-X path and the S-R-U path, respectively. These results provide a context for the understanding and exploration of the exotic topological properties of Nb3SiTe6.","309":null,"310":"To identify cellular mechanisms responsible for pressure overload triggered heart failure, we isolated cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts as most abundant cell types from mouse hearts in the subacute and chronic stages after transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and performed RNA-sequencing. We detected highly cell-type specific transcriptional responses with characteristic time courses and active intercellular communication. Cardiomyocytes after TAC exerted an early and sustained upregulation of inflammatory and matrix genes and a concomitant suppression of metabolic and ion channel genes. Fibroblasts, in contrast, showed transient early upregulation of inflammatory and matrix genes and downregulation of angiogenesis genes, but sustained induction of cell cycle and ion channel genes during TAC. Endothelial cells transiently induced cell cycle and extracellular matrix genes early after TAC, but exerted a long-lasting upregulation of inflammatory genes. As we found that matrix production by multiple cell types triggers pathological cellular responses, it might serve as a future therapeutic target.","311":"The bioeffects of terahertz (THz) radiation received growing attention because of its influence on the interactions between biomolecules. Our work aimed to investigate the effects of THz irradiation on cell membrane, especially cell membrane permeability. We found that 0.1 THz irradiation promoted the endocytosis of FM4-64-labeled cells and the inhibition of dynamin attenuated but did not fully abolish the THz promoted endocytosis. Moreover, 0.1 THz irradiation also promoted the transmembrane of the rhodamine, as well as the chemical compounds GDC0941 and H89, evidenced by the confocal microscope observation and the western blotting analysis, respectively. These findings demonstrated 0.1 THz irradiation facilitated the transmembrane transport of small molecules by promoting both the cellular endocytosis and the diffusion process. Our study provided direct evidence that THz could affect the cell membrane permeability, broadened the THz affected cellular physiological processes, and implied its potential application in regulating the cell membrane functions.","312":null,"313":null,"314":null,"315":"MYCT1 has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in various tumors, but its role in metabolism has never been reported. Here, we showed that global inactivation of Myct1 in mice led to progressive accumulation of glycogen in the liver, which was accompanied by aberrant changes in intermediates of the glycogen metabolic pathway. Mechanistically, MYCT1 appeared to promote translation efficiency of PGM1, UGP2 and GSK3A in hepatic cells in a RACK1-dependent manner. Consequently, upregulation of the three enzymes enhanced the glycogen shunt. Our data reveal a critical role of MYCT1 as a switch for the glycogen shunt in tumor cells.","316":"Cancer is among the world's leading causes of death. A critical challenge for public health is to develop a noninvasive, inexpensive, and efficient tool for early cancer detection. Cancer cells are characterized by an altered metabolism, producing unique patterns of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be used as cancer biomarkers. Dogs can detect VOCs via olfactory associative learning, but training dogs is costly and time-consuming. Insects, such as ants, have a refined sense of smell and can be rapidly trained. We show that individual ants need only a few training trials to learn, memorize, and reliably detect the odor of human cancer cells. These performances rely on specific VOC patterns, as shown by gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry. Our findings suggest that using ants as living tools to detect biomarkers of human cancer is feasible, fast, and less laborious than using other animals.","317":"Babies are born young, largely independent of the age of their mothers. Mother-daughter age asymmetry in yeast is achieved, in part, by inheritance of higher-functioning mitochondria by buds and retention of some high-functioning mitochondria in mother cells. The mitochondrial F box protein, Mfb1p, tethers mitochondria at both poles in a cell cycle-regulated manner: it localizes to and anchors mitochondria at the mother cell tip throughout the cell cycle and at the bud tip before cytokinesis. Here, we report that cell polarity and polarized localization of Mfb1p decline with age in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, deletion of genes (BUD1, BUD2, and BUD5) that mediate symmetry breaking during establishment of cell polarity and asymmetric yeast cell division cause depolarized Mfb1p localization and defects in mitochondrial distribution and quality control. Our results support a role for the polarity machinery in lifespan through modulating Mfb1 function in asymmetric inheritance of mitochondria during yeast cell division.","318":"Understanding and visualizing the heterogeneous structure of immiscible semicrystalline polymer systems is critical for optimizing their morphology and microstructure. We demonstrate a cryogenic 4D-STEM technique using a combination of amorphous radial profile mapping and correlative crystalline growth processing methods to map both the crystalline and amorphous phase distribution in an isotactic polypropylene (iPP)\/ethylene-octene copolymer (EO) multilayer film with 5-nm step size. The resulting map shows a very sharp interface between the amorphous iPP and EO with no preferential crystalline structure near or at the interface, reinforcing the expected incompatibility and immiscibility of iPP and EO, which is a short-chain branched polyethylene. This technique provides a method for direct observation of interfacial structure in an unstained semicrystalline complex multicomponent system with a single cryogenic 4D-STEM dataset.","319":"With continued levodopa treatment, most patients with Parkinson disease (PD) develop levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs)-abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) characterized primarily by chorea. Clinically, LIDs depend on nigrostriatal degeneration and sensitization to repeated levodopa doses. However, the degree of dopamine denervation is correlated with levodopa-induced changes in striatal dopamine. Therefore, pulsatile dopamine release may induce AIMs independently of nigrostriatal degeneration. We optogenetically stimulated dopamine neurons in healthy rats as they engaged in skilled reaching. Repeated stimulation induced progressive AIMs whose severity was modified by behavioral context. AIMs were milder with stimulation during reaches, and more severe if stimulation occurred between reaches. Despite gradual induction, AIMs recurred immediately with subsequent dopamine neuron stimulation. Thus, nigrostriatal denervation is not necessary for fluctuating striatal dopamine to induce AIMs, and behavioral context modulates AIM expression. Furthermore, pulsatile dopamine release induces persistent changes in motor circuits that are revealed by subsequent dopamine neuron activation in appropriate contexts.","320":"Quantum entanglement has shown distinguished features beyond any classical state. Many methods have been presented to verify unknown entanglement with the complete information about the density matrices by quantum state tomography. In this work, we aim to identify unknown entanglement with only partial information of the state space. The witness consists of a generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like paradox expressed by Pauli observables, and a nonlinear entanglement witness expressed by density matrix elements. First, we verify unknown bipartite entanglement and study the robustness of entanglement witnesses against the white noise. Second, we generalize such verification to partially unknown multipartite entangled states, including the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type and W-type states. Third, we give a quantum-information application related to the quantum zero-knowledge proof. It further provides a useful method in blindly verifying universal quantum computation resources. These results may be interesting in entanglement theories, quantum communication, and quantum networks.","321":"Extreme flammability of polylactide (PLA) has restricted its real-world applications. Traditional research only focuses on developing new effective fire retardants for PLA without considering the effect of melt viscosity on its fire performances. To fill the knowledge gap, a series of PLA matrices of varied melt flow index (MFI) with and without fire retardants are chosen to examine how melt viscosity affects its fire performances. Our results show that the MFI has a governing impact on fire performances of pure PLA and its fire-retardant systems if the samples are placed vertically during fire testing. PLA with higher MFI values achieves higher limiting oxygen index (LOI) values, and a lower loading level of fire retardants is required for PLA to pass a UL-94 V-0 rating. This work unveils the correlation between melt viscosity and their fire performance and offers a practical guidance for creating flame retardant PLA to extend its applications.","322":"The coronavirus disease of 2019 (Covid-19) causes deadly lung infections (pneumonia). Accurate clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 is essential for guiding treatment. Covid-19 RNA test does not reflect clinical features and severity of the disease. Pneumonia in Covid-19 patients could be caused by non-Covid-19 organisms and distinguishing Covid-19 pneumonia from non-Covid-19 pneumonia is critical. Chest X-ray detects pneumonia, but a high diagnostic accuracy is difficult to achieve. We develop an artificial intelligence-based (AI) deep learning method with a high diagnostic accuracy for Covid-19 pneumonia. We analyzed 10,182 chest X-ray images of healthy individuals, bacterial pneumonia. and viral pneumonia (Covid-19 and non-Covid-19) to build and test AI models. Among viral pneumonia, diagnostic accuracy for Covid-19 reaches 99.95%. High diagnostic accuracy is also achieved for distinguishing Covid-19 pneumonia from bacterial pneumonia (99.85% accuracy) or normal lung images (100% accuracy). Our AI models are accurate for clinical diagnosis of Covid-19 pneumonia by reading solely chest X-ray images.","323":"The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) intracellular signaling pathway mediates numerous biological processes, including antimicrobial immune response by inducing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) production. Although MAPK signaling cascade proteins have been identified in penaeid shrimp, their modulation via the MKK4-p38-c-Jun cascade and effect on AMPs production is unknown. Here, we show that hemocyanin (PvHMC), antimicrobial peptides (anti-lipopolysaccharide factor, crustin, and penaeidins), and MKK4-p38-c-Jun cascade proteins are simultaneously induced by pathogens (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and white spot syndrome virus) in Penaeus vannamei. Intriguingly, knockdown of PvHMC with or without pathogen challenge attenuated the expression of MKK4-p38-c-Jun cascade proteins and their phosphorylation level, which consequently decreased AMPs expression. Further analysis revealed that PvHMC interacts via its armadillo (ARM) repeat domain with PvMKK4 to modulate the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. Thus, the ARM repeat domain enables penaeid shrimp hemocyanin to modulate AMPs expression during antimicrobial response by activating the p38 MAPK signaling pathway.","324":"To date, there has been no multi-omic analysis characterizing the intricate relationships between the intragastric microbiome and gastric mucosal gene expression in gastric carcinogenesis. Using multi-omic approaches, we provide a comprehensive view of the connections between the microbiome and host gene expression in distinct stages of gastric carcinogenesis (i.e., healthy, gastritis, cancer). Our integrative analysis uncovers various associations specific to disease states. For example, uniquely in gastritis, Helicobacteraceae is highly correlated with the expression of FAM3D, which has been previously implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation. In addition, in gastric cancer but not in adjacent gastritis, Lachnospiraceae is highly correlated with the expression of UBD, which regulates mitosis and cell cycle time. Furthermore, lower abundances of B cell signatures in gastric cancer compared to gastritis may suggest a previously unidentified immune evasion process in gastric carcinogenesis. Our study provides the most comprehensive description of microbial, host transcriptomic, and immune cell factors of the gastric carcinogenesis pathway.","325":null,"326":null,"327":null,"328":"Very few drugs in clinical practice feature the chemical diversity, narrow therapeutic window, unique route of administration, and reversible cognitive effects of volatile anesthetics. The correlation between their hydrophobicity and their potency and the increasing amount of evidence suggesting that anesthetics exert their action on transmembrane proteins, justifies the investigation of their effects on phospholipid bilayers at the molecular level, given the strong functional and structural link between transmembrane proteins and the surrounding lipid matrix. Molecular dynamics simulations of a model lipid bilayer in the presence of ethylene, desflurane, methoxyflurane, and the nonimmobilizer 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane (also called F6 or 2N) at different concentrations highlight the structural consequences of VA partitioning in the lipid phase, with a decrease of lipid order and bilayer thickness, an increase in overall lipid lateral mobility and area-per-lipid, and a marked reduction in the mechanical stiffness of the membrane, that strongly correlates with the compounds' hydrophobicity.","329":"Cavernomas are multi-lumen and blood-filled vascular malformations which form in the brain and the spinal cord. They lead to hemorrhage, epileptic seizures, neurological deficits, and paresthesia. An effective medical treatment is still lacking, and the available murine models for cavernomas have several limitations for preclinical studies. These include disease phenotypes that differ from human diseases, such as restriction of the lesions to the cerebellum, and absence of acute hemorrhage. Additional limitations of current murine models include rapid development of lesions, which are lethal before the first month of age. Here, we have characterized a murine model that recapitulates features of the human disease: lesions develop after weaning throughout the entire CNS, including the spinal cord, and undergo acute hemorrhage. This provides a preclinical model to develop new drugs for treatment of acute hemorrhage in the brain and spinal cord, as an unmet medical emergency for patients with cavernomas.","330":null,"331":"Maintenance of energy balance is essential for overall organismal health. Mammals have evolved complex regulatory mechanisms that control energy intake and expenditure. Traditionally, studies have focused on understanding the role of macronutrient physiology in energy balance. In the present study, we examined the role of the essential micronutrient iron in regulating energy balance. We found that a short course of dietary iron caused a negative energy balance resulting in a severe whole body wasting phenotype. This disruption in energy balance was because of impaired intestinal nutrient absorption. In response to dietary iron-induced negative energy balance, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) was necessary for wasting of subcutaneous white adipose tissue and lipid mobilization. Fat-specific ATGL deficiency protected mice from fat wasting, but caused a severe cachectic response in mice when fed iron. Our work reveals a mechanism for micronutrient control of lipolysis that is necessary for regulating mammalian energy balance.","332":"Many experimental studies have examined behavioral and electrophysiological responses of mosquitoes to odors. However, the differences across studies in data collection, processing, and reporting make it difficult to perform large-scale analyses combining data from multiple studies. Here we extract and standardize data for 12 mosquito species, along with Drosophila melanogaster for comparison, from over 170 studies and curate the Mosquito Olfactory Response Ensemble (MORE), publicly available at https:\/\/neuralsystems.github.io\/MORE. We demonstrate the ability of MORE in generating biological insights by finding patterns across studies. Our analyses reveal that ORs are tuned to specific ranges of several physicochemical properties of odorants; the empty-neuron recording technique for measuring OR responses is more sensitive than the Xenopus oocyte technique; there are systematic differences in the behavioral preferences reported by different types of assays; and odorants tend to become less attractive or more aversive at higher concentrations.","333":null,"334":null,"335":"Drug resistance and metastasis-the major complications in cancer-both entail adaptation of cancer cells to stress, whether a drug or a lethal new environment. Intriguingly, these adaptive processes share similar features that cannot be explained by a pure Darwinian scheme, including dormancy, increased heterogeneity, and stress-induced plasticity. Here, we propose that learning theory offers a framework to explain these features and may shed light on these two intricate processes. In this framework, learning is performed at the single-cell level, by stress-driven exploratory trial-and-error. Such a process is not contingent on pre-existing pathways but on a random search for a state that diminishes the stress. We review underlying mechanisms that may support this search, and show by using a learning model that such exploratory learning is feasible in a high-dimensional system as the cell. At the population level, we view the tissue as a network of exploring agents that communicate, restraining cancer formation in health. In this view, disease results from the breakdown of homeostasis between cellular exploratory drive and tissue homeostasis.","336":"The European research community, via European Space Agency (ESA) spaceflight opportunities, has significantly contributed toward our current understanding of spaceflight biology. Recent molecular biology experiments include \"omic\" analysis, which provides a holistic and systems level understanding of the mechanisms underlying phenotypic adaptation. Despite vast interest in, and the immense quantity of biological information gained from space omics research, the knowledge of ESA-related space omics works as a collective remains poorly defined due to the recent exponential application of omics approaches in space and the limited search capabilities of pre-existing records. Thus, a review of such contributions is necessary to clarify and promote the development of space omics among ESA and ESA state members. To address this gap, in this review, we i) identified and summarized omics works led by European researchers, ii) geographically described these omics works, and iii) highlighted potential caveats in complex funding scenarios among ESA member states.","337":"In the arousal process, the brain restores its integrative activity from the synchronized state of slow wave activity (SWA). The mechanisms underpinning this state transition remain, however, to be elucidated. Here we simultaneously probed neuronal assemblies throughout the whole cortex with micro-electrocorticographic recordings in mice. We investigated the progressive shaping of propagating SWA at different levels of isoflurane. We found a form of memory of the wavefront shapes at deep anesthesia, tightly alternating posterior-anterior-posterior patterns. At low isoflurane, metastable patterns propagated in more directions, reflecting an increased complexity. The wandering across these mesostates progressively increased its randomness, as predicted by simulations of a network of spiking neurons, and confirmed in our experimental data. The complexity increase is explained by the elevated excitability of local assemblies with no modifications of the network connectivity. These results shed new light on the functional reorganization of the cortical network as anesthesia fades out.","338":"Natural biological materials provide a rich source of inspiration for building high-performance materials with extensive applications. By mimicking their chemical compositions and hierarchical architectures, the past decades have witnessed the rapid development of bioinspired materials. As a very promising biosourced raw material, silk is drawing increasing attention due to excellent mechanical properties, favorable versatility, and good biocompatibility. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent progress in silk-based bioinspired structural and functional materials. We first give a brief introduction of silk, covering its sources, features, extraction, and forms. We then summarize the preparation and application of silk-based materials mimicking four typical biological materials including bone, nacre, skin, and polar bear hair. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and future prospects of this field.","339":"The consensus for the precise mechanism of action of general anesthetics is through allosteric interactions with GABA receptors in neurons. However, it has been speculated that these anesthetics may also interact with the plasma membrane on some level. Owing to the small size of anesthetics, direct visualization of these interactions is difficult to achieve. We demonstrate the ability to directly visualize a deuterated analog of propofol in living cells using stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy. Our findings support the theory that propofol is highly concentrated and interacts primarily through non-specific binding to the plasma membrane of neurons. Additionally, we show that SRS microscopy can be used to monitor the dynamics of propofol binding using real-time, live-cell imaging. The strategy used to visualize propofol can be applied to other small molecule drugs that have been previously invisible to traditional imaging techniques.","340":"Heart failure (HF) is the ultimate outcome of a variety of heart diseases, including restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and valvular heart disease (VHD). To date, accumulating evidence has suggested an important role of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) in HF. We performed RNA-sequencing studies with myocardial mRNAs\/lncRNAs\/circRNAs\/miRNAs from non-failing hearts (donor heart tissue from heart transplantation) and three groups of patients with HF (RCM, IHD, and VHD). HF-related gene regulatory networks and gene co-expression networks were constructed based on the interaction relationship and expression profiles of differentially expressed mRNAs\/ncRNAs. Our results indicated that HF with different etiologies is regulated by complex lncRNA\/circRNA\/miRNA\/mRNA regulatory networks, comprising common pathways that are shared by all HF types as well as distinct pathways that are enriched in specific HF types. In addition, the HF biomarkers identified in our study have an important clinical application value in HF staging and HF type diagnosis.","341":"Deep learning models have become increasingly used for image-based classification. In critical applications such as medical imaging, it is important to convey the reasoning behind the models' decisions in human-understandable forms. In this work, we propose Pyramid Localization Network (PYLON), a deep learning model that delivers precise location explanation by increasing the resolution of heatmaps produced by class activation map (CAM). PYLON substantially improves the quality of CAM's heatmaps in both general image and medical image domains and excels at pinpointing the locations of small objects. Most importantly, PYLON does not require expert annotation of the object location but instead can be trained using only image-level label. This capability is especially important for domain where expert annotation is often unavailable or costly to obtain. We also demonstrate an effective transfer learning approach for applying PYLON on small datasets and summarize technical guidelines that would facilitate wider adoption of the technique.","342":null,"343":"Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing do not provide full characterization of tissue spatial diversity in cancer samples, and currently available in situ techniques (multiplex immunohistochemistry and imaging mass cytometry) allow for only limited analysis of a small number of targets. The current study represents the first comprehensive approach to spatial transcriptomics of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma using intact tumor tissue. We selected a small cohort of patients with highly annotated high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, categorized them by response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (poor or excellent), and analyzed pre-treatment tumor tissue specimens. Our study uncovered extensive differences in tumor composition between the poor responders and excellent responders to chemotherapy, related to cell cluster organization and localization. This in-depth characterization of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma tumor tissue from poor and excellent responders showed that spatial interactions between cell clusters may influence chemo-responsiveness more than cluster composition alone.","344":"Plasticity in the brain is ubiquitous. How do neurons and networks encode new information and simultaneously maintain homeostasis in the face of such ubiquitous plasticity? Here, we unveil a form of neuronal plasticity in rat hippocampal granule cells, which is mediated by conjunctive changes in HCN, inward-rectifier potassium, and persistent sodium channels induced by theta-modulated burst firing, a behaviorally relevant activity pattern. Cooperation and competition among these simultaneous changes resulted in a unique physiological signature: sub-threshold excitability and temporal summation were reduced without significant changes in action potential firing, together indicating a concurrent enhancement of supra-threshold excitability. This form of intrinsic plasticity was dependent on calcium influx through L-type calcium channels and inositol trisphosphate receptors. These observations demonstrate that although brain plasticity is ubiquitous, strong systemic constraints govern simultaneous plasticity in multiple components-referred here as plasticity manifolds-thereby providing a cellular substrate for concomitant encoding and homeostasis in engram cells.","345":null,"346":"Collective cell migration is associated with cancer metastasis. Cancer fingers are formed when groups of migrating cancer cells follow the leader cells in the front. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process of cancer metastasis. However, the role of EMT in cancer finger formation remains unclear. In this work, we investigated the EMT-associated mechanical properties and gene expression at single-cell levels in non-small lung cancer fingers. We found that leader cells were more elastic and less sticky than follower cells. Spatial EMT-related gene expression profiling in cancer fingers revealed cellular heterogeneity. Particularly, SNAIL and VIM were found to be two key genes that positively correlated with leader cell phenotypes and controlled cancer finger formation. Silencing either SNAIL or VIM, decreased cancer cell elasticity, cancer finger formation and migration, and increased adhesiveness. These findings indicated that SNAIL and VIM are two driver genes for cancer finger formation.","347":null,"348":"Policy led decisions aiming at decarbonizing the economy may well exacerbate existing regional economic imbalances. These effects are seldom recognized in spatially aggregated, top-down, and techno-economic decarbonization strategies. Here, we present a spatial economic framework that quantifies the gross value added associated with low carbon hydrogen investments while accounting for region-specific factors, such as the industrial specialization of regions, their relative size, and their economic interdependencies. In our case study, which uses low carbon hydrogen produced via autothermal reforming combined with carbon capture and storage to decarbonize the energy intensive industries in Europe and in the UK, we demonstrate that interregional economic interdependencies drive the overall economic benefits of the decarbonization. Policies intended to concurrently transition to net zero and address existing regional imbalances, as in the case of the UK Industrial Decarbonization Challenge, should take these local factors into account.","349":"Decarbonizing the building sector depends on choices made at the household level, which are heterogeneous. Agent-based models are tools used to describe heterogeneous choices but require data-intensive calibration. This study analyzes a novel, cross-country European household-level survey, including sociodemographic characteristics, energy-saving habits, energy-saving investments, and metered household electricity consumption, to enhance the empirical grounding of an agent-based residential energy choice model. Applying cluster analysis to the data shows that energy consumption is not straightforwardly explained by sociodemographic classes, preferences, or attitudes, but some patterns emerge. Income consistently has the largest effect on demand, dwelling efficiency, and energy-saving investments, and the potential to improve a dwellings' energy use affects the efficiency investments made. Including the various sources of heterogeneity found to characterize the model agents affects the timing and speed of the transition. The results reinforce the need for grounding agent-based models in empirical data, to better understand energy transition dynamics.","350":null,"351":"We encounter the world as a continuous flow and effortlessly segment sequences of events into episodes. This process of event segmentation engages working memory (WM) for tracking the flow of events and impacts subsequent memory accuracy. WM is limited in how much information (i.e., WM capacity) and for how long the information is retained (i.e., forgetting rate). In this study, across multiple tasks, we estimated participants' WM capacity and forgetting rate in a dynamic context and evaluated their relationship to event segmentation. A U-shaped relationship across tasks shows that individuals who segmented the movie more finely or coarsely than the average have a faster WM forgetting rate. A separate task assessing long-term memory retrieval revealed that the coarse-segmenters have better recognition of temporal order of events compared to the fine-segmenters. These findings show that event segmentation employs dissociable memory strategies and correlates with how long information is retained in WM.","352":"Matrin-3 (MATR3) is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and distal myopathy. Here, we report the development of a yeast model of MATR3 proteotoxicity and aggregation. MATR3 is toxic and forms dynamic shell-like nuclear condensates in yeast. Disease-associated mutations in MATR3 impair condensate dynamics and disrupt condensate morphology. MATR3 toxicity is largely driven by its RNA-recognitions motifs (RRMs). Further, deletion of one or both RRMs drives coalescence of these condensates. Aberrant phase separation of several different RBPs underpins ALS\/FTD, and we have engineered Hsp104 variants to reverse this misfolding. Here, we demonstrate that these same variants also counter MATR3 toxicity. We suggest that these Hsp104 variants which rescue MATR3, TDP-43, and FUS toxicity might be employed against a range of ALS\/FTD-associated proteins. We anticipate that our yeast model could be a useful platform to screen for modulators of MATR3 misfolding.","353":null,"354":null,"355":null,"356":"Smooth muscle guides the morphogenesis of several epithelia during organogenesis, including the mammalian airways. However, it remains unclear how airway smooth muscle differentiation is spatiotemporally patterned and whether it originates from transcriptionally distinct mesenchymal progenitors. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing of embryonic mouse lungs, we show that the pulmonary mesenchyme contains a continuum of cell identities, but no transcriptionally distinct progenitors. Transcriptional variability correlates with spatially distinct sub-epithelial and sub-mesothelial mesenchymal compartments that are regulated by Wnt signaling. Live-imaging and tension-sensors reveal compartment-specific migratory behaviors and cortical forces and show that sub-epithelial mesenchyme contributes to airway smooth muscle. Reconstructing differentiation trajectories reveals early activation of cytoskeletal and Wnt signaling genes. Consistently, Wnt activation induces the earliest stages of smooth muscle differentiation and local accumulation of mesenchymal F-actin, which influences epithelial morphology. Our single-cell approach uncovers the principles of pulmonary mesenchymal patterning and identifies a morphogenetically active mesenchymal layer that sculpts the airway epithelium.","357":"The physical closing of schools because of COVID-19 has disrupted both student learning and family logistics. There is significant pressure for in-person learning to remain open for all children. However, as is expected with outbreaks of novel infections, vaccines and other pharmaceutical therapeutics may not be instantly available. This raises serious public health questions about the risks to children and society at large. The best protective measures for keeping young children in school focus on behaviors that limit transmission. It is therefore critical to understand how we can engage children in age-appropriate ways that will best support their ability to adhere to protocols effectively. Here, we synthesize published studies with new results to investigate the earliest ages at which children form an understanding of infection risk and when they can translate that understanding effectively to protective action.","358":null,"359":"DNA methylation is an essential form of epigenetic regulation responsible for cellular identity. In muscle stem cells, termed satellite cells, DNA methylation patterns are tightly regulated during differentiation. However, it is unclear how these DNA methylation patterns affect the function of satellite cells. We demonstrate that a key epigenetic regulator, ubiquitin like with PHD and RING finger domains 1 (Uhrf1), is activated in proliferating myogenic cells but not expressed in quiescent satellite cells or differentiated myogenic cells in mice. Ablation of Uhrf1 in mouse satellite cells impairs their proliferation and differentiation, leading to failed muscle regeneration. Uhrf1-deficient myogenic cells exhibited aberrant upregulation of transcripts, including Sox9, with the reduction of DNA methylation level of their promoter and enhancer region. These findings show that Uhrf1 is a critical epigenetic regulator of proliferation and differentiation in satellite cells, by controlling cell-type-specific gene expression via maintenance of DNA methylation.","360":null,"361":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102878.].","362":"Emissions factors are widely used to estimate how various interventions would influence emissions from the electric sector. Both of the most commonly used metrics, however, neglect how changes in electricity demand can influence the structural evolution of the grid (the building and retiring of capital assets, such as generators). This omission can be significant when the factors are intended to comprehensively reflect the consequences of an intervention. In this work we evaluate a lesser known metric-the long-run marginal emission rate (LRMER)-which incorporates both the operational and structural implication of changes in electricity demand. We apply a modeling framework to compare the LRMER to the two near-ubiquitous metrics, and show that the LRMER can outperform the other two metrics at anticipating the emissions induced by a range of interventions. This suggests that adopting the LRMER could improve decision-making, particularly by better capturing the projected role of renewable generators in the evolution of the power sector.","363":"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) bind to PIWI proteins to assemble the piRISC, which represses germline transposons. Maelstrom (Mael) is necessary for piRISC biogenesis in germ cells, but its function remains unclear. Here, we show that Mael interconnects Spindle-E (Spn-E), a key piRISC biogenesis factor, with unloaded Siwi, one of two silkworm PIWI members. Mael also assembles a subset of nuage, a non-membranous organelle involved in piRISC biogenesis. Loss of Mael abrogated the Spn-E-Siwi interaction and Ago3-piRISC biogenesis, but Siwi-piRISC was produced. Bioinformatic analysis showed that Siwi-bound piRNAs in Mael-lacking cells were rich in transposon-targeting piRNAs as in normal cells but were biased toward transposons that are marginally controlled by Siwi-piRISC. This explains the impairment in Ago3-piRISC production because transposon mRNAs cleaved by Siwi are the origin of Ago3-loaded piRNAs. We argue that Mael plays a role in the production of primary Siwi-piRISC capable of regulating transposon expression in germ cells.","364":null,"365":null,"366":null,"367":null,"368":"Cells transmit their genomes vertically to daughter cells during cell divisions. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence and extent of horizontal mitochondrial (mt)DNA acquisition between cells that are not in a parent-offspring relationship. Extensive single-cell sequencing from various tissues and organs of adult chimeric mice composed of cells carrying distinct mtDNA haplotypes showed that a substantial fraction of individual cardiomyocytes, neurons, glia, intestinal, and spleen cells captured donor mtDNA at high levels. In addition, chimeras composed of cells with wild-type and mutant mtDNA exhibited increased trafficking of wild-type mtDNA to mutant cells, suggesting that horizontal mtDNA transfer may be a compensatory mechanism to restore compromised mitochondrial function. These findings establish the groundwork for further investigations to identify mtDNA donor cells and mechanisms of transfer that could be critical to the development of novel gene therapies.","369":null,"370":null,"371":null,"372":null,"373":"Parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons which are often associated with the specific extracellular matrix perineuronal net (PNN) play a critical role in the alteration of brain activity and memory performance in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The integrity of these neurons is crucial for normal functioning of the hippocampal subfield CA2, and hence, social memory formation. Here, we find that social memory deficits of mouse models of AD are associated with decreased presence of PNN around PV cells and long-term synaptic plasticity in area CA2. Furthermore, single local injection of the growth factor neuregulin-1 (NRG1) is sufficient to restore both PV\/PNN levels and social memory performance of these mice. Thus, the PV\/PNN disruption in area CA2 could play a causal role in social memory deficits of AD mice, and activating PV cell pro-maturation pathways may be sufficient to restore social memory.","374":null,"375":null,"376":"Multi-step organic syntheses of various drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and other pharmaceutically and agriculturally important compounds have already been reported using flow synthesis. Compared to batch, hazardous and reactive reagents can be handled safely in flow. This review discusses the pros and cons of flow chemistry in today's scenario and recent developments in flow devices. The review majorly emphasizes on the recent developments in the flow synthesis of pharmaceutically important products in last five years including flibanserin, imatinib, buclizine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, meclizine, ribociclib, celecoxib, SC-560 and mavacoxib, efavirenz, fluconazole, melitracen HCl, rasagiline, tamsulosin, valsartan, and hydroxychloroquine. Critical steps and new development in the flow synthesis of selected compounds are also discussed.","377":null,"378":null,"379":"Dispersal is a fundamental community assembly process that maintains soil microbial biodiversity across spatial and temporal scales, yet the impact of dispersal on ecosystem function is largely unpredictable. Dispersal is unique in that it contributes to both ecological and evolutionary processes and is shaped by both deterministic and stochastic forces. The ecosystem-level ramifications of dispersal outcomes are further compounded by microbial dormancy dynamics and environmental selection. Here we review the knowledge gaps and challenges that remain in defining how dispersal, environmental filtering, and microbial dormancy interact to influence the relationship between microbial community structure and function in soils. We propose the classification of microbial dispersal into three categories, through vegetative or active cells, through dormant cells, and through acellular dispersal, each with unique spatiotemporal dynamics and microbial trait associations. This conceptual framework should improve the integration of dispersal in defining soil microbial community structure-function relationships.","380":null,"381":"The pantry moth Plodia interpunctella is a worldwide pest of stored food products and a promising laboratory model system for lepidopteran functional genomics. Here we describe efficient methods for precise genome editing in this insect. A spontaneous recessive white-eyed phenotype maps to a frameshift deletion (c.737delC) in the white gene. CRISPR NHEJ mutagenesis of white replicates this phenotype with high rates of somatic biallelic knockout. G0 individuals with mutant clones on both eyes produced 100% mutant progeny, making white an ideal marker for co-conversion when targeting other genes. CRISPR HDR experiments corrected c.737delC and reverted white eyes to a pigmented state in 37% of G0 mosaic adults. These repaired alleles showed practical rates of germline transmission in backcrosses, demonstrating the potential of the technique for precise genome editing. Plodia offers a promising avenue for research in this taxon because of its lab-ready features, egg injectability, and editability.","382":"Advances in regenerative medicine have led to the construction of many types of organoids, which reproduce important aspects of endogenous organs but may be limited or disorganized in nature. While their usefulness for restoring function remains unclear, they have undoubted usefulness in research, diagnostics, and toxicology. In toxicology, there is an urgent need for better models for human kidneys. We used human iPS-cell (hiPSC)-derived renal organoids to identify HMOX1 as a useful marker of toxic stress via the oxidative stress pathway, and then constructed an HMOX1 reporter in hiPSCs. We used two forms of hiPSC-derived HMOX1-reporter renal organoids to probe their ability to detect nephrotoxicants in a panel of blind-coded compounds. Our results highlight the potential usefulness, and some limitations, of HMOX1-reporter renal organoids as screening tools. The results may guide development of similar stress-reporting organoid assays for other stem-cell-derived organs and tissues.","383":null,"384":null,"385":"Bacteria regulate their cellular resource allocation to enable fast growth-adaptation to a variety of environmental niches. We studied the ribosomal allocation, growth, and expression profiles of two sets of fast-growing mutants of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655. Mutants with only three of the seven copies of ribosomal RNA operons grew faster than the wild-type strain in minimal media and show similar phenotype to previously studied fast-growing rpoB mutants. Comparing these two different regulatory perturbations (rRNA promoters or rpoB mutations), we show how they reshape the proteome for growth with a concomitant fitness cost. The fast-growing mutants shared downregulation of hedging functions and upregulated growth functions. They showed longer diauxic shifts and reduced activity of gluconeogenic promoters during glucose-acetate shifts, suggesting reduced availability of the RNA polymerase for expressing hedging proteome. These results show that the regulation of ribosomal allocation underlies the growth\/hedging phenotypes obtained from laboratory evolution experiments.","386":null,"387":"Malectins from the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of animal cells are involved in ER quality control and contribute to the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). Malectins are not found in plant cells, but malectin-like domains (MLDs) are constituents of many membrane-bound receptors. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the MLD-containing receptor IOS1 promotes successful infection by filamentous plant pathogens. We show that the MLD of its exodomain retains IOS1 in the ER of plant cells and attenuates the infection-induced UPR. Expression of the MLD in the ios1-1 knockout background is sufficient to complement infection-related phenotypes of the mutant, such as increased UPR and reduced disease susceptibility. IOS1 interacts with the ER membrane-associated ribophorin HAP6 from the OST complex, and hap6 mutants show decreased pathogen-responsive UPR and increased disease susceptibility. Altogether, this study revealed a previously uncharacterized role of a plant receptor domain in the regulation of ER stress during infection.","388":"The cytoskeletal protein NDE1 plays an important role in chromosome segregation, neural precursor differentiation, and neuronal migration. Clinical studies have shown that NDE1 deficiency is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism. Here, we generated nde1 homologous deficiency zebrafish (nde1 -\/- ) to elucidate the cellular molecular mechanisms behind it. nde1 -\/- exhibit increased neurological apoptotic responses at early infancy, enlarged ventricles, and shrank valvula cerebelli in adult brain tissue. Behavioral analysis revealed that nde1 -\/- displayed autism-like behavior traits such as increased locomotor activity and repetitive stereotype behaviors and impaired social and kin recognition behaviors. Furthermore, nde1 mRNA injection rescued apoptosis in early development, and minocycline treatment rescued impaired social behavior and overactive motor activity by inhibiting inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we revealed that nde1 homozygous deletion leads to abnormal neurological development with autism-related behavioral phenotypes and that inflammatory responses in the brain are an important molecular basis behind it.","389":"Cancer incidence and survival are different between men and women. Indeed, females have a lesser risk and a better prognosis than males in many tumors unrelated to reproductive functions. Although the reasons for these disparities are still unknown, they constitute an important starting point for the development of personalized cancer therapies. One of the mechanisms that fuels carcinogenesis is the accumulation of defects in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, a complex signaling cascade that senses DNA lesions and, depending on the severity, coordinates transient cell-cycle arrest, DNA replication, repair, apoptosis, and senescence, preventing genomic instability and cancer. Recently, evidence of sexual dimorphisms is emerging in these pathways, therefore providing new opportunities for precision medicine. Here, we will discuss current knowledge about sexual disparities in the DDR, their role in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, and the importance of considering sex contribution in both research and cancer therapies.","390":null,"391":"Neural oscillations are mainly regulated by molecular mechanisms and network connectivity of neurons. Large-scale simulations of neuronal networks have driven the population-level understanding of neural oscillations. However, cell-intrinsic mechanisms, especially a design principle, of neural oscillations remain largely elusive. Herein, we developed a minimal, Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of groups of neurons to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying spindle oscillation, which is synchronized oscillatory activity predominantly observed during mammalian sleep. We discovered that slowly inactivating potassium channels played an essential role in characterizing the firing pattern. The detailed analysis of the minimal model revealed that leak sodium and potassium channels, which controlled passive properties of the fast variable (i.e., membrane potential), competitively regulated the base value and time constant of the slow variable (i.e., cytosolic calcium concentration). Consequently, we propose a theoretical design principle of spindle oscillations that may explain intracellular mechanisms behind the flexible control over oscillation density and calcium setpoint.","392":null,"393":"The EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase activates signaling pathways with different, and sometimes opposite, effects in cancer and other pathologies. Thus, highly specific and potent biased ligands that differentially control EphA2 signaling responses could be therapeutically valuable. Here, we use EphA2-specific monomeric peptides to engineer dimeric ligands with three different geometric configurations to combine a potential ability to differentially modulate EphA2 signaling responses with the high potency and prolonged receptor residence time characteristic of dimeric ligands. The different dimeric peptides readily induce EphA2 clustering, autophosphorylation and signaling, the best with sub-nanomolar potency. Yet, there are differences in two EphA2 signaling responses induced by peptides with different configurations, which exhibit distinct potency and efficacy. The peptides bias signaling when compared with the ephrinA1-Fc ligand and do so via different mechanisms. These findings provide insights into Eph receptor signaling, and proof-of-principle that different Eph signaling responses can be distinctly modulated.","394":null,"395":"Behavior is context-dependent and often modulated by an animal's internal state. In particular, different social contexts can alter anxiety levels and modulate social behavior. The vertebrate-specific neuropeptide parathyroid hormone 2 (pth2) is regulated by the presence of conspecifics in zebrafish. As its cognate receptor, the parathyroid hormone 2 receptor (pth2r), is widely expressed across the brain, we tested fish lacking the functional Pth2 peptide in several anxiety-related and social behavior paradigms. Here, we show that the propensity to react to sudden stimuli with an escape response was increased in pth2 -\/- zebrafish, consistent with an elevated anxiety level. While overall social preference for conspecifics was maintained in pth2 -\/- fish until the early juvenile stage, we found that both social preference and shoaling were altered later in development. The data presented suggest that the neuropeptide Pth2 modulates several conserved behaviors and may thus enable the animal to react appropriately in different social contexts.","396":null,"397":"Reciprocal regulation of genome topology and function is a fundamental and enduring puzzle in biology. The wealth of data provided by Hi-C libraries offers the opportunity to unravel this relationship. However, there is a need for a comprehensive theoretical framework in order to extract topological information for genome characterization and comparison. Here, we develop a toolbox for topological analysis based on Circuit Topology, allowing for the quantification of inter- and intracellular genomic heterogeneity, at various levels of fold complexity: pairwise contact arrangement, higher-order contact arrangement, and topological fractal dimension. Single-cell Hi-C data were analyzed and characterized based on topological content, revealing not only a strong multiscale heterogeneity but also highly conserved features such as a characteristic topological length scale and topological signature motifs in the genome. We propose that these motifs inform on the topological state of the nucleus and indicate the presence of active loop extrusion.","398":null,"399":"Bio-inspired surfaces enabling wet adhesion management are of significant interest for applications in the field of biomedicine, as components of bionic robots and as wearable devices.

First, remaining challenges associated with the understanding and the design of biological and artificial wet adhesive systems as well as strategies to supply adhesive liquids to their contact surfaces are reviewed. Then, future directions to construct wet adhesive surfaces with liquids are discussed in detail. Finally, a model of wet adhesion management with liquids is suggested, which might help the design of next-generation bio-inspired wet adhesive surfaces.","400":"Formation of a decent solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is recognized as an approach to improve the performance of lithium-ion batteries. SEI is a passivation layer generated on the anode during the initial cycles. Characteristics of the graphite SEI depend on the operational parameters, state of the anode, and the content of the electrolyte. Introducing reduction-type additives to the carbonate electrolytes has been one of the most practiced methods to generate an effective SEI on carbonous anodes. To track the role of additives in SEI evolution, first, we have presented a general review on what is currently understood about the SEI formation processes and the impacting parameters. In the second step, the most reported methods to study and analyze the functionality of the SEI-forming additives are classified. As the third part, different reduction-type additives are categorized, and their performances are comparatively reviewed.","401":null,"402":"Visual perceptual learning (VPL) is a behavioral manifestation of brain neuroplasticity. However, its practical effectiveness is limited because improvements are often specific to the trained conditions and require significant time and effort. It is critical to understand the conditions that promote learning and transfer. Covert endogenous (voluntary) and exogenous (involuntary) spatial attention help overcome VPL location specificity in neurotypical adults, but whether they also do so for people with atypical visual development is unknown. This study investigates the role of exogenous attention during VPL in adults with amblyopia, an ideal population given their asymmetrically developed, but highly plastic, visual cortex. Here we show that training on a discrimination task leads to improvements in foveal contrast sensitivity, acuity, and stereoacuity. Notably, exogenous attention helps generalize learning beyond trained spatial locations. Future large-scale studies can verify the extent to which attention enhances the effectiveness of perceptual learning during rehabilitation of visual disorders.","403":"Ultrathin III-V semiconductors have been receiving tremendous research interest over the past few years. Owing to their exotic structures, excellent physical and chemical properties, ultrathin III-V semiconductors are widely applied in the field of electronics, optoelectronics, and solar energy. However, the strong chemical bonds in layers are the bottleneck of the two-dimensionalization preparation process, which hinders the further development of ultrathin III-V semiconductors. Some effective methods to synthesize ultrathin III-V semiconductors have been reported recently. In this perspective, we briefly introduce the structures and properties of ultrathin III-V semiconductors firstly. Then, we comprehensively summarize the synthetic strategies of ultrathin III-V semiconductors, mainly focusing on space confinement, atomic substitution, adhesion energy regulation, and epitaxial growth. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and propose the development directions of ultrathin III-V semiconductors in the future.","404":null,"405":"Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is extensively used to produce large-area two-dimensional (2D) materials. Current research is aimed at understanding mechanisms underlying the nucleation and growth of various 2D materials, such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS2\/WSe2). Herein, we survey the vast literature regarding modeling and simulation of the CVD growth of 2D materials and their heterostructures. We also focus on newer materials, such as silicene, phosphorene, and borophene. We discuss how density functional theory, kinetic Monte Carlo, and reactive molecular dynamics simulations can shed light on the thermodynamics and kinetics of vapor-phase synthesis. We explain how machine learning can be used to develop insights into growth mechanisms and outcomes, as well as outline the open knowledge gaps in the literature. Our work provides consolidated theoretical insights into the CVD growth of 2D materials and presents opportunities for further understanding and improving such processes.","406":"The thermal transfer between individual body and the surroundings occurs by several paths such as radiation, evaporation, conduction, and convection. Thermal management is related with the heat transfer between the human body and the surroundings, which aims to keep the body temperature in the comfort range either via preserving or via emitting the body heat. The essential duty of clothing is to contribute to the thermal balance of the human body by regulating the heat and moisture transfer. In the case of poorly controlled body heat, health problems such as hyperthermia and heatstroke along with environmental problems due to higher energy consumption can occur. Recently, research has been focused on advanced textiles with novel approaches on materials synthesis and structure design, which can provide thermal comfort together with energy saving. This review article focuses on the innovative strategies basically on the passive textile models for improved thermal conductivity. We will discuss both the fabrication techniques and the inclusion of carbon-based and boron-based fillers to form nano-hybrid textile solutions, which are used to improve the thermal conductivity of the materials.","407":null,"408":"Microbial inoculations contribute to reducing agricultural systems' environmental footprint by supporting sustainable production and regulating climate change. However, the indirect and cascading effects of microbial inoculants through the reshaping of soil microbiome are largely overlooked. By discussing the underlying mechanisms of plant- and soil-based microbial inoculants, we suggest that a key challenge in microbial inoculation is to understand their legacy on indigenous microbial communities and the corresponding impacts on agroecosystem functions and services relevant to climate change. We explain how these legacy effects on the soil microbiome can be understood by building on the mechanisms driving microbial invasions and placing inoculation into the context of ecological succession and community assembly. Overall, we advocate that generalizing field trials to systematically test inoculants' effectiveness and developing knowledge anchored in the scientific field of biological\/microbial invasion are two essential requirements for applying microbial inoculants in agricultural ecosystems to tackle climate change challenges.","409":"Bacterial survival is often challenged by nutrient-depleted conditions. Here, we show that Escherichia coli regrowth from prolonged stationary phase is heterogeneous. Some cells rejuvenated immediately, even after extended starvation, but others only restarted growth after a delay or not at all. The proportion of nongrowing cells increased with time spent in stationary phase, rather than time-dependent medium changes. Delayed regrowth was correlated with the dissolution of polar phase-bright foci likely representing damaged protein aggregates, and a deep learning algorithm distinguished cellular fates based on single images. Delayed regrowth initiated after upregulation of chaperones and DNA-repair enzymes, and deletion of a chaperone compromised stationary-phase morphology and increased the nongrowing cell proportion. Mathematical modeling of damage accumulation and division-mediated partitioning quantitatively predicted all rejuvenation statistics. Cells regrew immediately after starving in the absence of respiration. These findings reinforce the importance of intracellular damage control when nutrients are sparse, and repair when nutrients are plentiful.","410":"The mammalian temporal cortex can be functionally segregated into regions that encode spatial information and others that are predominantly responsible for object recognition. In the present study, we report comparable functional segregation in the avian brain. Using Japanese quail, we find that bilateral lesions of the hippocampus (Hp) produce robust deficits in performance in a foraging array (FA) spatial memory task, while sparing spontaneous object recognition (SOR). In contrast, lesions to the adjacent area parahippocampalis (APH) compromise both SOR and FA. These observations demonstrate a functional dissociation between Hp and APH that is comparable to the distinctions seen in mammals between the hippocampus and surrounding temporal cortex.","411":null,"412":"In many behaviors such walking and swimming, animals need to coordinate their left and right limbs. In Drosophila, wing grooming can be induced by activation of sensory organs called campaniform sensilla. Flies usually clean one wing at a time, coordinating their left and right hind legs to sweep the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the wing. Here, we identify a pair of interneurons located in the ventral nerve cord that we name wing projection neurons 1 (wPN1) whose optogenetic activation induces wing grooming. Inhibition of wPN1 activity reduces wing grooming. They receive synaptic input from ipsilateral wing campaniform sensilla and wing mechanosensory bristle neurons, and they extend axonal arbors to the hind leg neuropils. Although they project contralaterally, their activation induces ipsilateral wing grooming. Anatomical and behavioral data support a role for wPN1 as command neurons coordinating both hind legs to work together to clean the stimulated wing.","413":"Upon tissue injury, cytokine expression reprogramming transiently remodels the inflammatory immune microenvironment to activate repair processes and subsequently return to homeostasis. However, chronic inflammation induces permanent changes in cytokine production which exacerbate tissue damage and may even favor tumor development. Here, we address the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation, by the RNA-binding protein CPEB4, to intestinal immune homeostasis and its role in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and colorectal cancer (CRC) development. We found that intestinal damage induces CPEB4 expression in adaptive and innate immune cells, which is required for the translation of cytokine mRNA(s) such as the one encoding interleukin-22. Accordingly, CPEB4 is required for the development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and to maintain intestinal immune homeostasis, mediating repair and remodeling after acute inflammatory tissue damage and promoting the resolution of intestinal inflammation. CPEB4 is chronically overexpressed in inflammatory cells in patients with IBD and in CRC, favoring tumor development.","414":null,"415":null,"416":"As the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants brings the global pandemic to new levels, the performance of current rapid antigen tests against variants of concern and interest (VOC\/I) is of significant public health concern. Here, we report assessment of the Abbot BinaxNOW COVID-19 Antigen Self-Test. Using genetically sequenced remnant clinical samples collected from individuals positive for SARS-CoV-2, we assessed the performance of BinaxNOW against the variants that currently pose public health threats. We measured the limit of detection of BinaxNOW against various VOC\/I in a blinded manner. BinaxNOW successfully detected the Omicron (B.1.1.529), Mu (B.1.621), Delta (B.1.617.2), Lambda (C.37), Gamma (P.1), Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Eta (B.1.525), and P.2 variants and at low viral concentrations. BinaxNOW also detected the Omicron variant in individual remnant clinical samples. Overall, these data indicate that this inexpensive and simple-to-use, FDA-authorized and broadly distributed rapid test can reliably detect Omicron, Delta, and other VOC\/I.","417":"The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the world has caused millions of death, while the dynamics of host responses and the underlying regulation mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well depicted. Lung tissues from a mouse model sensitized to SARS-CoV-2 infection were serially collected at different time points for evaluation of transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We showed the ebb and flow of several host responses in the lung across the viral infection. The signaling pathways and kinases regulating networks were alternated at different phases of infection. This multiplex evaluation also revealed that many kinases of the CDK and MAPK family were interactive and served as functional hubs in mediating the signal transduction during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study not only revealed the dynamics of lung pathophysiology and their underlying molecular mechanisms during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but also highlighted some molecules and signaling pathways that might guide future investigations on COVID-19 therapies.","418":"The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 engages with human ACE 2 to facilitate infection. Here, we describe an alpaca-derived heavy chain antibody fragment (VHH), saRBD-1, that disrupts this interaction by competitively binding to the spike protein receptor-binding domain. We further generated an engineered bivalent nanobody construct engineered by a flexible linker and a dimeric Fc conjugated nanobody construct. Both multivalent nanobodies blocked infection at picomolar concentrations and demonstrated no loss of potency against emerging variants of concern including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Epsilon (B.1.427\/429), and Delta (B.1.617.2). saRBD-1 tolerates elevated temperature, freeze-drying, and nebulization, making it an excellent candidate for further development into a therapeutic approach for COVID-19.","419":"Preexisting immunity against SARS-CoV-2 may have critical implications for our understanding of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The presence and clinical relevance of a preexisting B cell immunity remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the B cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed individuals. To this end, we extensively investigated SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity in 150 adults sampled pre-pandemically. Comprehensive screening of donor plasma and purified IgG samples for binding and neutralization in various functional assays revealed no substantial activity against SARS-CoV-2 but broad reactivity to endemic betacoronaviruses. Moreover, we analyzed antibody sequences of 8,174 putatively SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells at a single cell level and generated and tested 158 monoclonal antibodies. None of these antibodies displayed relevant binding or neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, our results show no evidence of competent preexisting antibody and B cell immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed adults.","420":null,"421":"ETV6 transcriptional activity is critical for proper blood cell development in the bone marrow. Despite the accumulating body of evidence linking ETV6 malfunction to hematological malignancies, its regulatory network remains unclear. To uncover genes that modulate ETV6 repressive transcriptional activity, we performed a specifically designed, unbiased genome-wide shRNA screen in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Following an extensive validation process, we identified 13 shRNAs inducing overexpression of ETV6 transcriptional target genes. We showed that the silencing of AKIRIN1, COMMD9, DYRK4, JUNB, and SRP72 led to an abrogation of ETV6 repressive activity. We identified critical modulators of the ETV6 function which could participate in cellular transformation through the ETV6 transcriptional network.","422":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer with a high rate of metastasis. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis remain unclear. We combined single-cell transcriptomic, proteomic, and chromatin accessibility data to investigate how heterogeneous phenotypes contribute to metastatic potential in five HCC cell lines. We confirmed that the prevalence of a mesenchymal state and levels of cell proliferation are linked to the metastatic potential. We also identified a rare hypoxic subtype that has a higher capacity for glycolysis and exhibits dormant, invasive, and malignant characteristics. This subtype has increased metastatic potential. We further identified a robust 14-gene panel representing this hypoxia signature and this hypoxia signature could serve as a prognostic index. Our data provide a valuable data resource, facilitate a deeper understanding of metastatic mechanisms, and may help diagnosis of metastatic potential in individual patients, thus supporting personalized medicine.","423":"Temporally clustered precipitation extremes can have catastrophic impacts. Therefore, understanding their drivers is paramount for risk assessment in current and future climates. Here, we model for each season 3-week extreme precipitation event counts with Poisson Generalized Linear Models and nine major modes of climate variability as covariates. Model goodness-of-fit is highest in the tropics, particularly over the equatorial Pacific, the Maritime Continent, and East Africa, where ENSO, the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and the MJO are the major drivers of sub-seasonal temporal clustering of extreme precipitation. The IOD and MJO also matter over Southwest Asia during boreal fall and winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the North Atlantic Oscillation impacts clustering west of the Iberian Peninsula and over Scandinavia and Greenland, and the Pacific North American pattern matters over the central\/northern Pacific Ocean. Finally, our models show very little skill in the Southern Hemisphere, where temporal clustering is also less frequent.","424":"In this paper, we review, compare, and analyze previous studies on vibration energy harvesting and related technologies. First, the paper introduces the basic aspects of vibration energy acquisition in the railway environment, including vibration frequency, train speed, energy flow in the train, and vibration energy harvesting potential. Generally, the methods for scavenging vibration energy caused by passing trains can be divided into four categories: electromagnetic harvesters, piezoelectric harvesters, triboelectric harvesters, and hydraulic harvesters. The structure, output performance, merits, and disadvantages of different energy harvesting strategies are summarized and compared. The application of vibration energy harvesters is explained as supplying power to monitoring sensors on the line side and the vehicle side. Finally, the paper addresses the challenges and difficulties that have not been completely resolved in the current research literature, including system stability, durability, and economy. Some recommendations to fill these research gaps are put forward for further investigation.","425":"In clinical trials, oral supplementation with nicotinamide riboside (NR) fails to increase muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and insulin sensitivity but also does not increase muscle NAD+ levels. This study tests the feasibility of chronically elevating skeletal muscle NAD+ in mice and investigates the putative effects on mitochondrial respiratory capacity, insulin sensitivity, and gene expression. Accordingly, to improve bioavailability to skeletal muscle, we developed an experimental model for administering NR repeatedly through a jugular vein catheter. Mice on a Western diet were treated with various combinations of NR, pterostilbene (PT), and voluntary wheel running, but the metabolic effects of NR and PT treatment were modest. We conclude that the chronic elevation of skeletal muscle NAD+ by the intravenous injection of NR is possible but does not affect muscle respiratory capacity or insulin sensitivity in either sedentary or physically active mice. Our data have implications for NAD+ precursor supplementation regimens.","426":"ZRSR2 is a splicing factor involved in recognition of 3'-intron splice sites that is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies and several tumors; however, the role of mutations of Zrsr2 in other tissues has not been analyzed. To explore the biological role of ZRSR2, we generated three Zrsr2 mutant mouse lines. All Zrsr2 mutant lines exhibited blood cell anomalies, and in two lines, oogenesis was blocked at the secondary follicle stage. RNA-seq of Zrsr2 mu secondary follicles showed aberrations in gene expression and showed altered alternative splicing (AS) events involving enrichment of U12-type intron retention (IR), supporting the functional Zrsr2 action in minor spliceosomes. IR events were preferentially associated with centriole replication, protein phosphorylation, and DNA damage checkpoint. Notably, we found alterations in AS events of 50 meiotic genes. These results indicate that ZRSR2 mutations alter splicing mainly in U12-type introns, which may affect peripheral blood cells, and impede oogenesis and female fertility.","427":null,"428":"Extracellular electron transfer (EET) from microorganisms to inorganic electrodes is a unique ability of electrochemically active bacteria. Despite rigorous genetic and biochemical screening of the c-type cytochromes that make up the EET network, the individual electron transfer steps over the cell membrane remain mostly unresolved. As such, attempts to transplant entire EET chains from native into non-native exoelectrogens have resulted in inferior electron transfer rates. In this study we investigate how nanostructured electrodes can interface with Shewanella oneidensis to establish an alternative EET pathway. Improved biocompatibility was observed for densely packed nanostructured surfaces with a low cell-nanowire load distribution during applied external forces. External gravitational forces were needed to establish a bioelectrochemical cell-nanorod interface. Bioelectrochemical analysis showed evidence of nanorod penetration beyond the outer cell membrane of a deletion mutant lacking all outer membrane cytochrome encoding genes that was only electroactive on a nanostructured surface and under external force.","429":"Cells can achieve internal organization by exploiting liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. Here we focus on the surface properties of condensates composed of two multivalent associative polymers held together by one-to-one \"sticker\" bonds. Using coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations, we study the influence of component stoichiometry on condensate surface properties. We find that unequal stoichiometry results in enrichment of the majority species at the interface and a sharp reduction of surface tension. To relate these two effects, we show that the reduction in surface tension scales linearly with the excess concentration of free binding sites at the interface. Our results imply that each excess free site contributes an approximately fixed additional energy and entropy to the interface, with the latter dominating such that enrichment of free majority sites lowers the surface tension. Our work provides insight into novel physical mechanisms by which cells can regulate condensate surface properties.","430":"Visual performance has striking polar performance asymmetries: At a fixed eccentricity, it is better along the horizontal than vertical meridian and the lower than upper vertical meridian. These asymmetries are not alleviated by covert exogenous or endogenous attention, but have been studied exclusively during eye fixation. However, a major driver of everyday attentional orienting is saccade preparation, during which attention automatically shifts to the future eye fixation. This presaccadic attention shift is considered strong and compulsory, and relies on different neural computations and substrates than covert attention. Thus, we asked: Can presaccadic attention compensate for the ubiquitous performance asymmetries observed during eye fixation? Our data replicate polar performance asymmetries during fixation and document the same asymmetries during saccade preparation. Crucially, however, presaccadic attention enhanced contrast sensitivity at the horizontal and lower vertical meridian, but not at the upper vertical meridian. Thus, instead of attenuating performance asymmetries, presaccadic attention exacerbates them.","431":null,"432":null,"433":"The physiological importance of biomolecular condensates is widely recognized, but how it is controlled in time and space during development is largely unknown. Here, we show that a tight junction protein ZO-1 forms cytoplasmic condensates in the trophectoderm (TE) of the mouse embryo before E4.0. These disappear via dissolution, and ZO-1 accumulates at the cell junction as the blastocyst cavity grows and internal pressure on TE cells increases. In contrast, this dissolution was less evident in TE cells attached to the inner cell mass because they receive weaker tensile forces. Furthermore, analyses using MDCK cells demonstrated that the ZO-1 condensates are generated and maintained by liquid-liquid phase separation. Our study also highlights that the dynamics of these condensates depends on the physical environment via an interaction between ZO-1 and F-actin. We propose that the force-dependent regulation of ZO-1 condensation contributes to the establishment of robust cell-cell adhesion during early development.","434":"Cancer cells experience mechanical confining forces during metastasis and, consequently, can alter their migratory mechanisms. Localization of numerous mRNAs to cell protrusions contributes to cell polarization and migration and is controlled by proteins that can bind RNA and\/or cytoskeletal elements, such as the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Here, we demonstrate that peripheral localization of APC-dependent RNAs in cells within confined microchannels is cell type dependent. This varying phenotype is determined by the levels of a detyrosinated tubulin network. We show that this network is regulated by mechanoactivity and that cells with mechanosensitive ion channels and increased myosin II activity direct peripheral localization of the RAB13 APC-dependent RNA. Through specific mislocalization of the RAB13 RNA, we show that peripheral RNA localization contributes to confined cell migration. Our results indicate that a cell's mechanical activity determines its ability to peripherally target RNAs and utilize them for movement in confinement.","435":"The existence of overlapping genes (OLGs) with significant coding overlaps revolutionizes our understanding of genomic complexity. We report two exceptionally long (957 nt and 1536 nt), evolutionarily novel, translated antisense open reading frames (ORFs) embedded within annotated genes in the pathogenic Gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both OLG pairs show sequence features consistent with being genes and transcriptional signals in RNA sequencing. Translation of both OLGs was confirmed by ribosome profiling and mass spectrometry. Quantitative proteomics of samples taken during different phases of growth revealed regulation of protein abundances, implying biological functionality. Both OLGs are taxonomically restricted, and likely arose by overprinting within the genus. Evidence for purifying selection further supports functionality. The OLGs reported here, designated olg1 and olg2, are the longest yet proposed in prokaryotes and are among the best attested in terms of translation and evolutionary constraint. These results highlight a potentially large unexplored dimension of prokaryotic genomes.","436":"Enveloped viruses pose constant threat to hosts from ocean to land. Virion particle release from cell surface is a critical step in the viral life cycle for most enveloped viruses, making it a common antiviral target for the host defense system. Here we report that host factor TMEM106A inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from the cell surface. TMEM106A is a type II transmembrane protein localized on the plasma membrane and can be incorporated into HIV-1 virion particles. Through intermolecular interactions of its C-terminal domains on virion particle and plasma membrane, TMEM106A traps virion particles to the cell surface. HIV-1 Env interacts with TMEM106A to interfere with the intermolecular interactions and partially suppresses its antiviral activity. TMEM106A orthologs from various species displayed potent antiviral activity against multiple enveloped viruses. These results suggest that TMEM106A is an evolutionarily conserved antiviral factor that inhibits the release of enveloped viruses from the cell surface.","437":null,"438":"Frontal EEG alpha band asymmetries have been linked to affective processing in healthy individuals and affective disorders. As stress provides a strong source of negative affect, the present study investigated how acute stress affects frontal EEG alpha asymmetries. Continuous EEG data were acquired from 51 healthy adult participants during stress induction with the Trier Social Stress Test. EEG data were also collected during a non-stressful control condition. Furthermore, EEG resting state data were acquired after both conditions. Under stress, participants showed stronger left hemispheric activation over frontal electrodes as well as reduced left-hemispheric activation over occipital electrodes compared to the control condition. Our results are in line with predictions of the asymmetric inhibition model which postulates that the left prefrontal cortex inhibits negative distractors. Moreover, the results support the capability model of emotional regulation which states that frontal asymmetries during emotional challenge are more pronounced compared to asymmetries during rest.","439":"With the consensus on carbon peak and neutrality around the globe, renewables, especially wind and solar PV will grow fast. Correspondingly, the batteries for renewables would be scheduled to meet the requirements of performance, lifetime, cost, safety, and environment. Rechargeable zinc-air battery is a promising candidate for energy storage. However, the lifetime and power density of zinc-air batteries remain unresolved. Here we propose a concept of magnetic zinc-air batteries to achieve the demand of the next generation energy storage. Firstly, an external magnetic field can effectively inhibit dendrite growth of the zinc depositing layer and expel H2 or O2 bubbles away from the electrode's surface, extending the battery life. Secondly, magnetic fields can promote electrons, ions, and O2 transfer, enhancing power density of zinc-air batteries. Lastly, four schemes to generate magnetic fields for zinc-air batteries are exhibited to fulfill battery energy storage demand of high performance and long service life.","440":"Proteomics analysis of skeletal muscle has recently progressed from whole muscle tissue to single myofibers. Here, we further focus on a specific myofiber domain crucial for force transmission from muscle to tendon, the myotendinous junction (MTJ). To overcome the anatomical constraints preventing the isolation of pure MTJs, we performed in-depth analysis of the MTJ by progressive removal of the muscle component in semitendinosus muscle-tendon samples. Using detergents with increasing stringency, we quantified &gt;3000 proteins across all samples, and identified 112 significantly enriched MTJ proteins, including 24 known MTJ-enriched proteins. Of the 88 novel MTJ markers, immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the presence of tetraspanin-24 (CD151), kindlin-2 (FERMT2), cartilage intermediate layer protein 1 (CILP), and integrin-alpha10 (ITGA10), at the human MTJ. Together, these human data constitute the first detailed MTJ proteomics resource that will contribute to advance understanding of the biology of the MTJ and its failure in pathological conditions.","441":null,"442":"Semiconductor nanocrystals have become ubiquitous both in scientific research and in applied technologies related to light. When a nanocrystal absorbs a photon an electron-hole pair is created whose fate dictates whether the nanocrystal will be suitable for a particular application. Ultrafast spectroscopy provides a real-time window to monitor the evolution of the electron-hole pair. In this review, we focus on CdSe nanocrystals, the most-studied nanocrystal system to date, and also highlight ultrasmall nanocrystals, \"standard nanocrystals\" of different binary composition, alloyed nanocrystals, and core\/shell nanocrystals and nanorods. We focus on four time-resolved spectroscopies used to interrogate nanocrystals: pump-probe, fluorescence upconversion, time-correlated single photon counting, and non-linear spectroscopies. The basics of the nanocrystals and the spectroscopies are presented, followed by a detailed synopsis of ultrafast spectroscopy studies performed on the various semiconductor nanocrystal systems.","443":null,"444":null,"445":null,"446":null,"447":"MED13L syndrome is a haploinsufficiency developmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability, heart malformation, and hypotonia. MED13L controls transcription by tethering the cyclin C-Cdk8 kinase module (CKM) to the Mediator complex. In addition, cyclin C has CKM-independent roles in the cytoplasm directing stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and regulated cell death. Unstressed MED13L S1497 F\/fs patient fibroblasts exhibited aberrant cytoplasmic cyclin C localization, mitochondrial fragmentation, and a 6-fold reduction in respiration. In addition, the fibroblasts exhibited reduced mtDNA copy number, reduction in mitochondrial membrane integrity, and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress. Finally, transcriptional analysis of MED13L mutant fibroblasts revealed reduced mRNA levels for several genes necessary for normal mitochondrial function. Pharmacological or genetic approaches preventing cyclin C-mitochondrial localization corrected the fragmented mitochondrial phenotype and partially restored organelle function. In conclusion, this study found that mitochondrial dysfunction is an underlying defect in cells harboring the MED13L S1497 F\/fs allele and identified cyclin C mis-localization as the likely cause. These results provide a new avenue for understanding this disorder.","448":"Age-related fibrosis in the left ventricle (LV) has been mainly studied in animals by assessing collagen content. Using second-harmonic generation microscopy and image processing, we evaluated amount, aggregation and spatial distribution of LV collagen in young to old pigs, and middle-age and elder living donors. All collagen features increased when comparing adult and old pigs with young ones, but not when comparing adult with old pigs or middle-age with elder individuals. Remarkably, all collagen parameters strongly correlated with lipofuscin, a biological age marker, in humans. By building patient-specific models of human ventricular tissue electrophysiology, we confirmed that amount and organization of fibrosis modulated arrhythmia vulnerability, and that distribution should be accounted for arrhythmia risk assessment. In conclusion, we characterize the age-associated changes in LV collagen and its potential implications for ventricular arrhythmia development. Consistency between pig and human results substantiate the pig as a relevant model of age-related LV collagen dynamics.","449":"Recognition of rotated images can challenge visual systems. Humans often diminish the load of cognitive tasks employing bodily actions (cognitive offloading). To investigate these phenomena from a comparative perspective, we trained eight dogs (Canis familiaris) to discriminate between bidimensional shapes. We then tested the dogs with rotated versions of the same shapes, while measuring their accuracy and head tilts. Although generalization to rotated stimuli challenged dogs (overall accuracy: 55%), three dogs performed differently from chance level with rotated stimuli. The amplitude of stimulus rotation did not influence dogs' performance. Interestingly, dogs tilted their head following the direction and amplitude of rotated stimuli. These small head movements did not influence their performance. Hence, we show that dogs might be capable of recognizing rotated 2D objects, but they do not use a cognitive offloading strategy in this task. This work paves the way to further investigation of cognitive offloading in non-human species.","450":"Uncovering the number of stem cells necessary for organ growth has been challenging in vertebrate systems. Here, we developed a mathematical model characterizing stem cells in the fish gill, an organ displaying non-exhaustive growth. We employ a Markov model, stochastically simulated via an adapted Gillespie algorithm, and further improved through probability theory. The stochastic algorithm produces a simulated dataset for comparison with experimental clonal data by inspecting quantifiable properties. The analytical approach skips the step of artificial data generation and goes directly to the quantification, being more abstract and efficient. We report that a reduced number of stem cells actively contribute to growing and maintaining the gills. The model also highlights a functional heterogeneity among the stem cells involved, where activation and quiescence phases determine their relative growth contribution. Overall, our work presents a method for inferring the number and properties of stem cells required in a lifelong growing system.","451":"The discovery of carbon dots (CDs) for environmental remediation has gained awareness because of the diverse economically viable and environmental friendly green precursors generated from biowastes and biomass compared to the toxic inorganic quantum dots and CDs prepared from chemical precursors. This review presents the recent progress in green CDs, including their synthesis methods and sensing applications for the detection of heavy metal ions such as Iron (III), Mercury (II), Copper (II), Chromium (VI), Lead (II), Arsenic (III), Cobalt (II), Aluminum (III), Silver (I), and Gold (III) which are prominent environmental pollutants. The comparison based on selectivity, sensitivity, quantum yield, detection limit, linear concentration range, and sensing mechanisms are also reported. This review also covers the performance of doped green CDs using heteroatoms, toward the detection of heavy metal ions. Apart from the future perspectives, this review provides a general guide to use such environmental friendly CDs to detect harmful pollutants.","452":"In rodents and humans, the basolateral amygdala (BLA), essential for emotional behaviors, is profoundly reorganized during adolescence. We compared in both sexes the morphology, neuronal, and synaptic properties of BLA neurons in rats at puberty and adulthood. BLA neurons were more excitable in males than in females at adulthood. At pubescence, male action potentials were smaller and shorter than females' while fast afterhyperpolarizations were larger in males. During postnatal maturation, spine length increased and decreased in females and males, respectively, while there was a reduction in spine head size in females. Excitatory synaptic properties, estimated from stimuli-response relationships, spontaneous post-synaptic currents, and AMPA\/NMDA ratio also displayed sex-specific maturational differences. Finally, the developmental courses of long-term potentiation and depression were sexually dimorphic. These data reveal divergent maturational trajectories in the BLA of male and female rats and suggest sex-specific substrates to the BLA linked behaviors at adolescence and adulthood.","453":"Proper gene regulation is critical for both neuronal development and maintenance as the brain matures. We previously demonstrated that Akirin2, an essential nuclear protein that interacts with transcription factors and chromatin remodeling complexes, is required for the embryonic formation of the cerebral cortex. Here we show that Akirin2 plays a mechanistically distinct role in maintaining healthy neurons during cortical maturation. Restricting Akirin2 loss to excitatory cortical neurons resulted in progressive neurodegeneration via necroptosis and severe cortical atrophy with age. Comparing transcriptomes from Akirin2-null postnatal neurons and cortical progenitors revealed that targets of the tumor suppressor p53, a regulator of both proliferation and cell death encoded by Trp53, were consistently upregulated. Reduction of Trp53 rescued neurodegeneration in Akirin2-null neurons. These data: (1) implicate Akirin2 as a critical neuronal maintenance protein, (2) identify p53 pathways as mediators of Akirin2 functions, and (3) suggest Akirin2 dysfunction may be relevant to neurodegenerative diseases.","454":"Most tumor cells reactivate telomerase to ensure unlimited proliferation, whereas the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is tightly regulated and rate-limiting for telomerase activity maintenance. Several general transcription factors (TFs) have been found in regulating hTERT transcription; however, a systematic study is lacking. Here we performed an inducible CRISPR\/Cas9 KO screen using an hTERT core promoter-driven reporter. We identified numerous positive regulators including an E3 ligase DTX2. In telomerase-positive cancer cells, DTX2 depletion downregulated hTERT transcription and telomerase activity, contributing to progressive telomere shortening, growth arrest, and increased apoptosis. Utilizing BioID, we characterized multiple TFs as DTX2 proximal proteins, among which NFIC functioned corporately with DTX2 in promoting hTERT transcription. Further analysis demonstrated that DTX2 mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of NFIC, which facilitated NFIC binding to the hTERT promoter and enhanced hTERT expression. These findings highlight a new hTERT regulatory pathway that may be exploited for potential cancer therapeutics.","455":"SARM1 is an NAD(P) glycohydrolase and TLR adapter with an essential, prodegenerative role in programmed axon death (Wallerian degeneration). Like other NAD(P)ases, it catalyzes multiple reactions that need to be fully investigated. Here, we compare these multiple activities for recombinant human SARM1, human CD38, and Aplysia californica ADP ribosyl cyclase. SARM1 has the highest transglycosidation (base exchange) activity at neutral pH and with some bases this dominates NAD(P) hydrolysis and cyclization. All SARM1 activities, including base exchange at neutral pH, are activated by an increased NMN:NAD ratio, at physiological levels of both metabolites. SARM1 base exchange occurs also in DRG neurons and is thus a very likely physiological source of calcium-mobilizing agent NaADP. Finally, we identify regulation by free pyridines, NADP, and nicotinic acid riboside (NaR) on SARM1, all of therapeutic interest. Understanding which specific SARM1 function(s) is responsible for axon degeneration is essential for its targeting in disease.","456":"p73 belongs to the p53 tumor suppressor family and is involved in the suppression of metastasis. However, its specific mechanism of action remains to be elucidated. Long non-coding RNAs portray a crucial role in tumor suppression. We have identified lncRNA FER1L4 as a p73 transcriptional target. The binding of p73 to FER1L4 promoter was established by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter, and ChIP assays. Both FER1L4 and p73 knockdown enhanced the migration and invasion rate of colorectal cancer cells. FER1L4 also plays a critical role in p73-mediated cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. FER1L4 sponged the expression of miR-1273g-3p, which, in turn, increased PTEN expression, leading to cell-cycle arrest. RNA in situ hybridization revealed the down-regulation of both p73 and FER1L4 expression in a metastatic colon cancer tissue as compared with non-metastatic tissue. Collectively, we impart conclusive proof that p73 exerts its anti-metastatic properties by inducing lncRNA FER1L4 in response to genotoxic stress.","457":null,"458":null,"459":null,"460":null,"461":"Dynamic profiling of changes in gene expression in response to stressors in specific microenvironments without requiring cellular destruction remains challenging. Current methodologies that seek to interrogate gene expression at a molecular level require sampling of cellular transcriptome and therefore lysis of the cell, preventing serial analysis of cellular transcriptome. To address this area of unmet need, we have recently developed a technology allowing transcriptomic analysis over time without cellular destruction. Our method, TRACE-seq (TRanscriptomic Analysis Captured in Extracellular vesicles using sequencing), is characterized by a cell-type specific transgene expression. It provides data on the transcriptome inside extracellular vesicles that provides an accurate representation of stress-responsive cellular transcriptomic changes. Thus, the transcriptome of cells expressing TRACE can be followed over time without destroying the source cell, which is a powerful tool for many fields of fundamental and translational biology research.","462":null,"463":"Epistemetrics, a discipline concerning measuring knowledge qualitative and quantitatively, is an under developed area of research. A primary reason for the current status is a perceived lack of a formal structure of knowledge. In particular, a number of fundamental questions about knowledge remain to be answered: What is the basic unit of knowledge? How many types of knowledge are there? How do they relate to each other? And what are the hierarchies of knowledge? To address these questions, we proposed a knowledge categorization system, the EApc framework. The present work collects further evidence, from theories and practices of several diverse research disciplines, to argue for, to refine, and to expand the EApc framework. This framework can provide new perspectives in understanding scientific processes and in assessing values and impacts of research proposals and products. It may also shed light on the mechanisms of human cognition and information processing.","464":"Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic in over 90 countries. The disease has two main pathologies; cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) that generally self-heals, and visceral leishmaniasis (VL) that is fatal if untreated. The majority of VL cases, concentrated on the Indian subcontinent (ISC) and East Africa, are caused by Leishmania donovani. However, recent foci of CL on the ISC have been attributed as an atypical phenotype of L. donovani including a recent outbreak in Himachal Pradesh, India. Whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was undertaken to investigate the origins and genetic factors leading to this pathology atypical of L. donovani. Here we demonstrate the isolate from Himachal Pradesh is derived from a genetic hybridization between two independent L. donovani parents from the 'Yeti' ISC1 divergent clade of parasites, identified in the Nepalese highlands. This reveals that intraspecies L. donovani hybrids can give rise to a novel strain associated with CL.","465":"Terahertz (THz) electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 0.1THz to 10THz has become critical for sixth generation (6G) applications, such as high-speed communication, fingerprint chemical sensing, non-destructive biosensing, and bioimaging. However, the limited response of naturally existing materials THz waves has induced a gap in the electromagnetic spectrum, where a lack of THz functional devices using natural materials has occurred in this gap. Metamaterials, artificially composed structures that can engineer the electromagnetic properties to manipulate the waves, have enabled the development of many THz devices, known as \"metadevices\". Besides, the tunability of THz metadevices can be achieved by tunable structures using microelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies, as well as tunable materials including phase change materials (PCMs), electro-optical materials (EOMs), and thermo-optical materials (TOMs). Leveraging various tuning mechanisms together with metamaterials, tremendous research works have demonstrated reconfigurable functional THz devices, playing an important role to fill the THz gap toward the 6G applications. This review introduces reconfigurable metadevices from fundamental principles of metamaterial resonant system to the design mechanisms of functional THz metamaterial devices and their related applications. Moreover, we provide perspectives on the future development of THz photonic devices for state-of-the-art applications.","466":null,"467":"How changes in brain scaling relate to altered behavior is an important question in neurodevelopmental disorder research. Mice with germline Pten haploinsufficiency (Pten +\/-) closely mirror the abnormal brain scaling and behavioral deficits seen in humans with macrocephaly\/autism syndrome, which is caused by PTEN mutations. We explored whether deviation from normal patterns of growth can predict behavioral abnormalities. Brain regions associated with sensory processing (e.g., pons and inferior colliculus) had the biggest deviations from expected volume. While Pten +\/- mice showed little or no abnormal behavior on most assays, both sexes showed sensory deficits, including impaired sensorimotor gating and hyporeactivity to high-intensity stimuli. Developmental analysis of this phenotype showed sexual dimorphism for hyporeactivity. Mapping behavioral phenotypes of Pten +\/- mice onto relevant brain regions suggested abnormal behavior is likely when associated with relatively enlarged brain regions, while unchanged or relatively decreased brain regions have little predictive value.","468":"Most biomolecules are biologically active only in water; hence, it is worth investigating whether THz spectra of biomolecules are affected by the combination of water molecules and biomolecules. In this report, by combining the sample cell with the THz-TDS system, the THz spectra of L-Arginine crystal as well as its hydrate and aqueous solution are measured. The experimental results show that L-Arginine crystal and its hydrate share the same three absorption peaks at 0.99, 1.46, and 1.7 THz, respectively. But the trend of characteristic absorption spectrum of L-arginine solution is almost identical to that of free water. Because the contents of free water and hydrated water are different in many diseased and normal tissues, the diseased tissues can be detected according to the difference in THz spectral information. The proposed approach provides a reliable means for the detection of pathological changes of active molecules and tissues.","469":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants necessitates rational assessment of their impact on the recognition and neutralization of the virus by the host cell. We present a comparative analysis of the interactions of Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta variants with cognate molecules (ACE2 and\/or furin), neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) using in silico methods, in addition to Nb-binding assays. Our study elucidates the molecular origin of the ability of Beta and Delta variants to evade selected antibodies, such as REGN10933, LY-CoV555, B38, C105, or H11-H4, while being insensitive to others including REGN10987. Experiments confirm that nanobody Nb20 retains neutralizing activity against the Delta variant. The substitutions T478K and L452R in the Delta variant enhance associations with ACE2, whereas P681R promotes recognition by proteases, thus facilitating viral entry. The Ab-specific responses of variants highlight how full-atomic structure and dynamics analyses are required for assessing the response to newly emerging variants.","470":null,"471":"The on-going COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdowns cast significant impacts on global economy in the short run. Their impact on stability of global electric vehicles (EVs) supply chain and thus our climate ambition in the long run, however, remains hitherto largely unexplored. We aim to address this gap based on an integrated model framework, including assessing supply risks of 17 selected core commodities throughout the EV supply chain and further applying the supply constraints to project future EV sales until 2030. Our model results under three pandemic development scenarios indicate that if the pandemic is effectively contained before 2024, the global EV industry will recover without fundamentally scathed and thus can maintain the same growth trend as in the no-pandemic scenario by 2030. We suggest that fiscal stimulus in the postpandemic era should be directed more toward upgrading the quality of battery products, rather than expanding the production capacity.","472":"Multi-omics data analysis is an important aspect of cancer molecular biology studies and has led to ground-breaking discoveries. Many efforts have been made to develop machine learning methods that automatically integrate omics data. Here, we review machine learning tools categorized as either general-purpose or task-specific, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning for integrative analysis of multi-omics data. We benchmark the performance of five machine learning approaches using data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, reporting accuracy on cancer type classification and mean absolute error on drug response prediction, and evaluating runtime efficiency. This review provides recommendations to researchers regarding suitable machine learning method selection for their specific applications. It should also promote the development of novel machine learning methodologies for data integration, which will be essential for drug discovery, clinical trial design, and personalized treatments.","473":"Zebrafish regenerate fin rays following amputation through epimorphic regeneration, a process that has been proposed to involve the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to elucidate osteoblastic transcriptional programs during zebrafish caudal fin regeneration. We show that osteoprogenitors are enriched with components associated with EMT and its reverse, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), and provide evidence that the EMT markers cdh11 and twist2 are co-expressed in dedifferentiating cells at the amputation stump at 1 dpa, and in differentiating osteoblastic cells in the regenerate, the latter of which are enriched in EMT signatures. We also show that esrp1, a regulator of alternative splicing in epithelial cells that is associated with MET, is expressed in a subset of osteoprogenitors during outgrowth. This study provides a single cell resource for the study of osteoblastic cells during zebrafish fin regeneration, and supports the contribution of MET- and EMT-associated components to this process.","474":null,"475":null,"476":"Optical neuronal imaging often shows ultrafine structures, such as a nerve fiber, coexisting with ultrabright structures, such as a soma with a substantially higher fluorescence-protein concentration. Owing to experimental and environmental factors, a laser-scanning multiphoton optical microscope (MPM) often encounters a high-frequency background noise that might contaminate such weak-intensity ultrafine neuronal structures. A straightforward contrast enhancement often leads to the saturation of the brighter ones, and might further amplify the high-frequency background noise. We report a digital approach called rapid denoised contrast enhancement (DCE), which digitally mimics a hardware-based adaptive\/controlled illumination technique by means of digitally optimizing the signal strengths and hence the visibility of such weak-intensity structures while mostly preventing the saturation of the brightest ones. With large field-of-view (FOV) two-photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) neuronal imaging, we validate the effectiveness of DCE over state-of-the-art digital image processing algorithms. With compute-unified-device-architecture (CUDA)-acceleration, a real-time DCE is further enabled with a reduced time complexity.","477":"There is a dearth of information on COVID-19 disease dynamics in Africa. To fill this gap, we investigated the epidemiology and genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 lineages circulating in the continent. We retrieved 5229 complete genomes collected in 33 African countries from the GISAID database. We investigated the circulating diversity, reconstructed the viral evolutionary divergence and history, and studied the case and death trends in the continent. Almost a fifth (144\/782, 18.4%) of Pango lineages found worldwide circulated in Africa, with five different lineages dominating over time. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that African viruses cluster more closely with those from Europe. We also identified two motifs that could function as integrin-binding sites and N-glycosylation domains. These results shed light on the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of the circulating viral diversity in Africa. They also emphasize the need to expand surveillance efforts in Africa to help inform and implement better public health measures.","478":"","479":null,"480":null,"481":null,"482":null,"483":"Paper substrate has many advantages, such as low cost, bendable, foldable, printable, and environmentally friendly recycling. Nowadays, paper has been further extended as a flexible platform to deliver electronic information with the integration of organic optoelectronic devices, such as organic thin-film transistor, organic solar cell, organic electrochromic device, and organic light-emitting device. It has great potential to become the new generation of flexible substrate. Given rough surface and porous of paper, many efforts have been underway in recent years to enable the compatibility between optoelectronics and paper substrate. In this review, we present the development history of paper and its physicochemical properties, and summarize the current development of paper-based organic optoelectronic devices. We also discuss the challenges that need to be addressed before practical uses of paper-based organic optoelectronic devices.","484":"Thermal switches are advanced heat-management devices that represent a new opportunity to improve the energy efficiency and power density of caloric devices. In this study we have developed a numerical model to analyze the operation and the performance of static thermal switches in caloric refrigeration. The investigation comprises a parametric analysis of a realistic ferrofluidic thermal switch in terms of the maximum temperature span, cooling power, and coefficient of performance. The highest achieved temperature span between the heat source and the heat sink was 1.12 K for a single embodiment, which could be further developed into a regenerative system to increase the temperature span. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to correlate the relationship between the input parameters and the results. We show that thermal switches can be used in caloric devices even when switching ratios are small, which greatly extends the possibilities to implement different types of thermal switches.","485":null,"486":"The analysis and interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments are compromised by the presence of poor-quality cells. For meaningful analyses, such poor-quality cells should be excluded as they introduce noise in the data. We introduce SkewC, a quality-assessment tool, to identify skewed cells in scRNA-seq experiments. The tool's methodology is based on the assessment of gene coverage for each cell, and its skewness as a quality measure; the gene body coverage is a unique characteristic for each protocol, and different protocols yield highly different coverage profiles. This tool is designed to avoid misclustering or false clusters by identifying, isolating, and removing cells with skewed gene body coverage profiles. SkewC is capable of processing any type of scRNA-seq dataset, regardless of the protocol. We envision SkewC as a distinctive QC method to be incorporated into scRNA-seq QC processing to preclude the possibility of scRNA-seq data misinterpretation.","487":null,"488":"Understanding the sets of inter- and intraspecies interactions in microbial communities is a fundamental goal of microbial ecology. However, the study and quantification of microbial interactions pose several challenges owing to their complexity, dynamic nature, and the sheer number of unique interactions within a typical community. To overcome such challenges, microbial ecologists must rely on various approaches to distill the system of study to a functional and conceptualizable level, allowing for a practical understanding of microbial interactions in both simplified and complex systems. This review broadly addresses the role of several conceptual approaches available for the microbial ecologist's arsenal, examines specific tools used to accomplish such approaches, and describes how the assumptions, expectations, and philosophies underlying these tools change across scales of complexity.","489":"Human analysis of research data is slow and inefficient. In recent years, machine learning tools have advanced our capability to perform tasks normally carried out by humans, such as image segmentation and classification. In this work, we seek to further improve binary classification models for high-throughput identification of different microstructural morphologies. We utilize a dataset with limited observations (133 dendritic structures, 444 non-dendritic) and employ data augmentation via rotation and translation to enhance the dataset six-fold. Then, transfer learning is carried out using pre-trained networks VGG16, InceptionV3, and Xception achieving only moderate F1 scores (0.801-0.822). We hypothesize that feature engineering could yield better results than transfer learning alone. To test this, we employ a new nature-inspired feature optimization algorithm, the Binary Red Deer Algorithm (BRDA), to carry out binary classification and observe F1 scores in the range of 0.96.","490":null,"491":"The number of man-made chemicals has increased exponentially recently, and exposure to some of them can induce fetal malformations. Because complex and precisely programmed signaling pathways play important roles in developmental processes, their disruption by external chemicals often triggers developmental toxicity. However, highly accurate and high-throughput screening assays for potential developmental toxicants are currently lacking. In this study, we propose a reporter assay that utilizes human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to detect changes in fibroblast growth factor signaling, which is essential for limb morphogenesis. The dynamics of this signaling after exposure to a chemical were integrated to estimate the degree of signaling disruption, which afforded a good prediction of the capacity of chemicals listed in the ECVAM International Validation Study that induce limb malformations. This study presents an initial report of a human iPSC-based signaling disruption assay, which could be useful for the screening of potential developmental toxicants.","492":"In view of the continuous debates on the environmental impact of blockchain technologies, in particular, cryptocurrency mining, accompanied by severe carbon dioxide emissions, a technical solution has been considered assuming direct monetization of associated petroleum gas currently being flared. The proposed approach is based on the technology of low-temperature steam reforming of hydrocarbons, which allows flare gas conditioning toward the requirements for fuel for gas piston and gas turbine power plants. The generation of electricity directly at the oil field and its use for on-site cryptocurrency mining transform the process of wasteful flaring of valuable hydrocarbons into an economically attractive integrated processing of natural resources. The process is not carbon neutral and is not intended to compete with zero-emission technologies, but its combination with technologies for carbon dioxide capture and re-injection into the oil reservoir can both enhance the oil recovery and reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. The produced gas can be used for local transport needs, while the generated heat and electricity can be utilized for on-site food production and biological carbon dioxide capture in vertical greenhouse farms. The suggested approach allows a significant decrease in the carbon dioxide emissions at oil fields and, although it may seem paradoxically, on-site cryptocurrency mining actually may lead to a decrease in the carbon footprint. The amount of captured CO2 could be transformed into CO2 emission quotas, which can be spent for the production of virtually \"blue\" hydrogen by steam reforming of natural gas in locations where the CO2 capture is technically impossible and\/or unprofitable.","493":"Many neural networks for medical imaging generalize poorly to data unseen during training. Such behavior can be caused by overfitting easy-to-learn features while disregarding other potentially informative features. A recent implicit bias mitigation technique called spectral decoupling provably encourages neural networks to learn more features by regularizing the networks' unnormalized prediction scores with an L2 penalty. We show that spectral decoupling increases the networks' robustness for data distribution shifts and prevents overfitting on easy-to-learn features in medical images. To validate our findings, we train networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer on tissue slides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral decoupling achieve up to 9.5 percent point higher performance on external datasets. Spectral decoupling alleviates generalization issues associated with neural networks and can be used to complement or replace computationally expensive explicit bias mitigation methods, such as stain normalization in histological images.","494":null,"495":"Symbioses between angiosperms and rhizobia or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are controlled through a conserved signaling pathway. Microbe-derived, chitin-based elicitors activate plant cell surface receptors and trigger nuclear calcium oscillations, which are decoded by a calcium\/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) and its target transcription factor interacting protein of DMI3 (IPD3). Genes encoding CCaMK and IPD3 have been lost in multiple non-mycorrhizal plant lineages yet retained among non-mycorrhizal mosses. Here, we demonstrated that the moss Physcomitrium is equipped with a bona fide CCaMK that can functionally complement a Medicago loss-of-function mutant. Conservation of regulatory phosphosites allowed us to generate predicted hyperactive forms of Physcomitrium CCaMK and IPD3. Overexpression of synthetically activated CCaMK or IPD3 in Physcomitrium led to abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation and ectopic development of brood cells, which are asexual propagules that facilitate escape from local abiotic stresses. We therefore propose a functional role for Physcomitrium CCaMK-IPD3 in stress-associated developmental reprogramming.","496":"Renewable energy is poised to play a major role in achieving China's carbon neutrality goal by 2060; however, reliability and flexibility is a big concern of a renewable-dominant power system. Various strategies of enhancing flexibility are under discussion to ensure the reliability of such a system, but no detailed quantitative analysis has been reported yet in China. We combine the advantages of a capacity expansion model, SWITCH-China, with a production simulation model, PLEXOS, and analyze flexibility options under different scenarios of a renewable-dominant power system in China. We find that a larger balancing area offers direct flexibility benefits. Regional balancing could reduce the renewable curtailment rate by 5-7%, compared with a provincial balancing strategy. National balancing could further reduce the power cost by about 16%. However, retrofitting coal power plants for flexible operation would only improve the system flexibility marginally.","497":"Demand response (DR) is rapidly gaining attention as a solution to enhance the grid reliability with deep renewable energy penetration. Although studies have demonstrated the benefits of DR in mitigating price volatility, there is limited work considering the choice of locations for DR for maximal impact. We reveal that very small load reductions at a handful of targeted locations can lead to a significant decrease in price volatility and grid congestion levels based on a synthetic Texas grid model. We achieve this through exploiting the highly nonlinear nature of congestion dynamics and by strategically selecting DR locations. We demonstrate that we can similarly place energy storage to achieve an equivalent impact. Our findings suggest that targeted DR at specific locations, rather than across-the-board DR, can have substantial benefits to the grid. These findings can inform energy policy makers and grid operators how to target DR initiatives for improving grid reliability.","498":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.103203.].","499":"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is an essential therapy in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but nearly 20% of patients with APL are resistant to ATRA. As there are no biomarkers for ATRA resistance that yet exist, we investigated whether cell mechanics could be associated with this pathological phenotype. Using mechano-node-pore sensing, a single-cell mechanical phenotyping platform, and patient-derived APL cell lines, we discovered that ATRA-resistant APL cells are less mechanically pliable. By investigating how different subcellular components of APL cells contribute to whole-cell mechanical phenotype, we determined that nuclear mechanics strongly influence an APL cell's mechanical response. Moreover, decondensing chromatin with trichostatin A is especially effective in softening ATRA-resistant APL cells. RNA-seq allowed us to compare the transcriptomic differences between ATRA-resistant and ATRA-responsive APL cells and highlighted gene expression changes that could be associated with mechanical changes. Overall, we have demonstrated the potential of \"physical\" biomarkers in identifying APL resistance.","500":null,"501":"Infiltration of arterial intima by foamy macrophages is a hallmark of early atherosclerotic lesions. Here, we investigated the potential role of Ser\/Thr phosphatase PHLPP1 in foam cell development. PHLPP1 levels were elevated in OxLDL-exposed macrophages and high-fat diet (HFD)-fed zebrafish larvae. Using overexpression and knockdown approaches, we show that PHLPP1 promotes the accumulation of neutral lipids, and augments cellular total cholesterol and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. RNA-Seq analysis uncovered PHLPP1 role in lipid metabolism pathways. PHLPP1 interacted with and modestly increased ChREBP recruitment to Fasn promoter. PHLPP1-mediated lipid accumulation was attenuated by AMPK activation. Pharmacological inhibition or CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated disruption of PHLPP1 resulted in lower lipid accumulation in the intersegmental vessels of HFD-fed zebrafish larvae along with a reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Deficiency of phlp-2, C. elegans PHLPP1\/2 ortholog, abolished lipid accumulation in high cholesterol-fed worms. We conclude that PHLPP1 exerts a significant effect on lipid buildup.","502":null,"503":"The metabolic activity of microbial communities plays a primary role in the flow of essential nutrients throughout the biosphere. Molecular genetics has revealed the metabolic pathways that model organisms utilize to generate energy and biomass, but we understand little about how the metabolism of diverse, natural communities emerges from the collective action of its constituents. We propose that quantifying and mapping metabolic fluxes to sequencing measurements of genomic, taxonomic, or transcriptional variation across an ensemble of diverse communities, either in the laboratory or in the wild, can reveal low-dimensional descriptions of community structure that can explain or predict their emergent metabolic activity. We survey the types of communities for which this approach might be best suited, review the analytical techniques available for quantifying metabolite fluxes in communities, and discuss what types of data analysis approaches might be lucrative for learning the structure-function mapping in communities from these data.","504":"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have broad-ranging therapeutic properties, including the ability to inhibit bacterial growth and resolve infection. However, the genetic mechanisms regulating these antibacterial properties in MSCs are largely unknown. Here, we utilized a systems-based approach to compare MSCs from different genetic backgrounds that displayed differences in antibacterial activity. Although both MSCs satisfied traditional MSC-defining criteria, comparative transcriptomics and quantitative membrane proteomics revealed two unique molecular profiles. The antibacterial MSCs responded rapidly to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and had elevated levels of the LPS co-receptor CD14. CRISPR-mediated overexpression of endogenous CD14 in MSCs resulted in faster LPS response and enhanced antibacterial activity. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CD14-upregulated MSCs revealed a shift in transcriptional ground state and a more uniform LPS-induced response. Our results highlight the impact of genetic background on MSC phenotypic diversity and demonstrate that overexpression of CD14 can prime these cells to be more responsive to bacterial challenge.","505":null,"506":"Increasing variable renewable energy (VRE) is one of the main approaches for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. However, we find a GHG increase risk associated with increasing VRE: VRE crowds out nuclear power (VRECON) but cannot fully obtain the left market share, which is obtained by fossil energy. We developed an integrated dispatch-and-investment model to estimate the VRECON GHG-boosting effect in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. In the above two markets, VRECON could increase the annual GHG emission by up to 136 MTCO2eq totally. Furthermore, we find that the VRECON GHG-boosting effect can be mitigated by combining wind and solar power. We argue that, for GHG abatement, policymakers should require the proper mix of wind and solar power in renewable portfolio standards and control nuclear power's retirement pace to match the progress of VRE growth.","507":null,"508":"Unsatisfied kinetochore-microtubule attachment activates the spindle assembly checkpoint to inhibit the metaphase-anaphase transition. However, some cells eventually override mitotic arrest by mitotic slippage. Here, we show that inactivation of TORC1 kinase elicits mitotic slippage in budding yeast and human cells. Yeast mitotic slippage was accompanied with aberrant aspects, such as degradation of the nucleolar protein Net1, release of phosphatase Cdc14, and anaphase-promoting complex\/cyclosome (APC\/C)-Cdh1-dependent degradation of securin and cyclin B in metaphase. This mitotic slippage caused chromosome instability. In human cells, mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) inactivation also invoked mitotic slippage, indicating that TORC1 inactivation-induced mitotic slippage is conserved from yeast to mammalian cells. However, the invoked mitotic slippage in human cells was not dependent on APC\/C-Cdh1. This study revealed an unexpected involvement of TORC1 in mitosis and provides information on undesirable side effects of the use of TORC1 inhibitors as immunosuppressants and anti-tumor drugs.","509":null,"510":null,"511":null,"512":"Unique performance of the hybrid organic-inorganic halide perovskites (HOIPs) has attracted great attention because of their continuous exploration and breakthrough in a multitude of energy-related applications.

To find a solution, a series of two-dimensional HOIPs (2D HOIPs) are investigated to prolong the device lifetime with highly efficient photoelectric conversion and energy storage. Herein, the recent advances of 2D HOIPs and their structural derivatives for the energy realms are summarized and discussed.

However, the causality and underlying mechanisms linking 12q24.31 microdeletions to ASD\/ID remain undetermined. Here we show Kdm2b, one gene located in chromosomal 12q24.31, plays a critical role in maintaining neural stem cells (NSCs) in the mouse brain. Loss of the CxxC-ZF domain of KDM2B impairs its function in recruiting Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to chromatin, resulting in de-repression of genes involved in cell apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, NSC senescence, and loss of NSC populations in the brain. Of importance, the Kdm2b mutation is sufficient to induce ASD\/ID-like behavioral and memory deficits. Thus, our study reveals a critical role of KDM2B in normal brain development, a causality between the Kdm2b mutation and ASD\/ID-like phenotypes in mice, and potential molecular mechanisms linking the function of KDM2B-PRC1 in transcriptional regulation to the 12q24.31 microdeletion-associated ASD\/ID.","515":"Elimination of cancerous cells by the immune system is an important mechanism of protection from cancer, however, its effectiveness can be reduced owing to development of resistance and evasion. To understand the systemic immune response in advanced untreated primary colorectal cancer, we analyze immune subtypes and immune evasion via neoantigen-related mechanisms. We identify a distinctive cancer subtype characterized by immune evasion and very poor overall survival. This subtype has less clonal highly expressed neoantigens and high chromosomal instability, resulting in adaptive immune resistance mediated by the immune checkpoint molecules and neoantigen presentation disorders. We also observe that neoantigen depletion caused by immunoediting and high clonal neoantigen load are correlated with a good overall survival. Our results indicate that the status of the tumor microenvironment and neoantigen composition are promising new prognostic biomarkers with potential relevance for treatment plan decisions in advanced CRC.","516":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach can broadly and specifically evaluate the individual cells with minimum detection bias. To explore the individual compositional and transcriptional alteration of intestinal leukocytes in the Dual Specificity Phosphatase six knockout (D6KO) mice, we performed a scRNA-seq followed by the cell type annotation based on ImmGen database. Composition assessments found that D6KO-derived intestinal leukocytes tend to stay inactivate or immature status. The enrichment analysis showed that D6KO-derived intestinal leukocytes are less sensitive to microbes. The mod PhEA phenotypic analysis showed that the D6KO leukocytes may link to not only immune-associated but also diverse previously non-immune-related diseases. Integrating our dataset with the published dataset GSE124880 generated a comprehensive dataset for exploring intestinal immunity. Down-regulation of Ccl17 gene was found in the D6KO-derived dendritic cells. Our results demonstrated the advantage of applying scRNA-seq for dissecting the individual alteration of intestinal leukocytes, particularly in the D6KO mice at a naive state.","517":null,"518":null,"519":"Many steps of the MHC class I antigen processing pathway can be predicted using computational methods. Here we show that epitope predictions can be further improved by considering abundance levels of peptides' source proteins. We utilized biophysical principles and existing MHC binding prediction tools in concert with abundance estimates of source proteins to derive a function that estimates the likelihood of a peptide to be an MHC class I ligand. We found that this combination improved predictions for both naturally eluted ligands and cancer neoantigen epitopes. We compared the use of different measures of antigen abundance, including mRNA expression by RNA-Seq, gene translation by Ribo-Seq, and protein abundance by proteomics on a dataset of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. Epitope predictions were improved above binding predictions alone in all cases and gave the highest performance when using proteomic data. Our results highlight the value of incorporating antigen abundance levels to improve epitope predictions.","520":null,"521":"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic disorder, in which an abnormal and toxic protein called progerin, accumulates in cell nuclei, leading to major cellular defects. Among them, chromatin remodeling drives gene expression changes, including miRNA dysregulation. In our study, we evaluated miRNA expression profiles in HGPS and control fibroblasts. We identified an enrichment of overexpressed miRNAs belonging to the 14q32.2-14q32.3 miRNA cluster. Using 3D FISH, we demonstrated that overexpression of these miRNAs is associated with chromatin remodeling at this specific locus in HGPS fibroblasts. We then focused on miR-376b-3p and miR-376a-3p, both overexpressed in HGPS fibroblasts. We demonstrated that their induced overexpression in control fibroblasts decreases cell proliferation and increases senescence, whereas their inhibition in HGPS fibroblasts rescues proliferation defects and senescence and decreases progerin accumulation. By targeting these major processes linked to premature aging, these two miRNAs may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of HGPS.","522":"In recent years, optically pumped magnetometer (OPM)-based magnetoencephalography (MEG) has shown potential for analyzing brain activity. It has a flexible sensor configuration and comparable sensitivity to conventional SQUID-MEG. We constructed a 32-channel OPM-MEG system and used it to measure cortical responses to median and ulnar nerve stimulations. Traditional magnetic source imaging methods tend to blur the spatial extent of sources. Accurate estimation of the spatial size of the source is important for studying the organization of brain somatotopy and for pre-surgical functional mapping. We proposed a new method called variational free energy-based spatial smoothing estimation (FESSE) to enhance the accuracy of mapping somatosensory cortex responses. A series of computer simulations based on the OPM-MEG showed better performance than the three types of competing methods under different levels of signal-to-noise ratios, source patch sizes, and co-registration errors. FESSE was then applied to the source imaging of the OPM-MEG experimental data.","523":null,"524":"When a biased electric\/light field is applied to centrosymmetric crystals like silicon, the broken symmetry creates even-order harmonics radiation which can reveal key insights into the material. Recently, the second harmonic has been generated by THz-induced symmetry breaking, but the observation of higher-order radiation remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate picosecond-level ultrafast, nondestructive symmetry manipulation of silicon crystal by using a 500 kV\/cm intense terahertz (THz) electric field. The THz-induced fourth harmonic of the infrared probe is also observed and characterized for the first time. In addition, we find that the even-order harmonics show no dependence on the THz field direction thus it allows for sub-cycle symmetry manipulations. Our study paves the way toward ultrafast all-optical crystal symmetry control in the future high-speed electronics and photonics.","525":"Self-powered wearable devices, with the energy harvester as a source of energy that can scavenge the energy from ambient sources present in our surroundings to cater to the energy needs of portable wearable electronics, are becoming more widespread because of their miniaturization and multifunctional characteristics. Triboelectric and piezoelectric nanogenerators are being explored to harvest electrical energy from the mechanical vibrations. Integration of these two effects to fabricate a hybrid nanogenerator can further enhance the output efficiency of the nanogenerator. Here, we have discussed the importance of 2D materials which plays an important role in the fabrication of nanogenerators because of their distinct characteristics, such as, flexibility, mechanical stability, nontoxicity, and biodegradability. This review mainly emphasizes the piezoelectric, triboelectric, and hybrid nanogenerator based on the 2D materials and their van der Waals heterostructure, as well as the effect of polymer-2D composite on the output performance of the nanogenerator.","526":null,"527":"Monoclonal IgG antibodies are the fastest growing class of biologics, but large differences exist in their plasma half-life in humans. Thus, to design IgG antibodies with favorable pharmacokinetics, it is crucial to identify the determinants of such differences. Here, we demonstrate that the variable region sequences of IgG antibodies greatly affect cellular uptake and subsequent recycling and rescue from intracellular degradation by endothelial cells. When the variable sequences are masked by the cognate antigen, it influences both their transport behavior and binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), a key regulator of IgG plasma half-life. Furthermore, we show how charge patch differences in the variable domains modulate both binding and transport properties and that a short plasma half-life, due to unfavorable charge patches, may partly be overcome by Fc-engineering for improved FcRn binding.","528":"Tuberculosis (TB) treatment involves a multidrug regimen for six months, and until two months, it is unclear if treatment is effective. This delay can lead to the evolution of drug resistance, lung damage, disease spread, and transmission. We identify a blood-based 9-gene signature using a computational pipeline that constructs and interrogates a genome-wide transcriptome-integrated protein-interaction network. The identified signature is able to determine treatment response at week 1-2 in three independent public datasets. Signature-based R9-score correctly detected treatment response at individual timepoints (204 samples) from a newly developed South Indian longitudinal cohort involving 32 patients with pulmonary TB. These results are consistent with conventional clinical metrics and can discriminate good from poor treatment responders at week 2 (AUC 0.93(0.81-1.00)). In this work, we provide proof of concept that the R9-score can determine treatment effectiveness, making a case for designing a larger clinical study.","529":"Utilizing hot electrons generated from localized surface plasmon resonance is of widespread interest in the photocatalysis of metallic nanoparticles. However, hot holes, especially generated from interband transitions, have not been fully explored for photocatalysis yet. In this study, a photocatalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using mesoporous Pd nanoparticle photocatalyst served as a model to study the role of hot holes. Quantum yields of the photocatalysts increase under shorter wavelength excitations and correlate to \"deeper\" energy of the holes from the Fermi level. This work suggests that deeper holes in the d-band catalyze the oxidative addition of aryl halide R-X onto Pd0 at the nanoparticles' surface to form R-PdII-X complex, thus accelerating the rate-determining step of the catalytic cycle. The hot electrons do not play a decisive role. In the future, catalytic mechanisms induced by deep holes should deserve as much attention as the well-known hot electron transfer mechanism.","530":null,"531":"The mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) is a promising pharmacological target for aging and age-related diseases. However, the integrative analysis of the impact of UPRmt activation on different signaling layers in animals with different genetic backgrounds is lacking. Here, we applied systems approaches to investigate the effect of UPRmt induced by doxycycline (Dox) on transcriptome, proteome, and lipidome in two genetically divergent worm strains, named N2 and CB4856. From the integrated omics datasets, we found that Dox prolongs lifespan of both worm strains through shared and strain-specific mechanisms. Specifically, Dox strongly impacts mitochondria, upregulates defense response, and lipid metabolism, while decreasing triglycerides. We further validated that lipid genes acs-2\/20 and fat-7\/6 were required for Dox-induced UPRmt and longevity in N2 and CB4856 worms, respectively. Our data have translational value as they indicate that the beneficial effects of Dox-induced UPRmt on lifespan are consistent across different genetic backgrounds through different regulators.","532":null,"533":null,"534":"In balanced exponential growth, bacteria maintain many properties statistically stable for a long time: cell size, cell cycle time, and more. As these are strongly coupled variables, it is not a-priori obvious which are directly regulated and which are stabilized through interactions. Here, we address this problem by separating timescales in bacterial single-cell dynamics. Disentangling homeostatic set points from fluctuations around them reveals that some variables, such as growth-rate, cell size and cycle time, are \"sloppy\" with highly volatile set points. Quantifying the relative contribution of environmental and internal sources, we find that sloppiness is primarily driven by the environment. Other variables such as fold-change define \"stiff\" combinations of coupled variables with robust set points. These results are manifested geometrically as a control manifold in the space of variables: set points span a wide range of values within the manifold, whereas out-of-manifold deviations are constrained. Our work offers a generalizable data-driven approach for identifying control variables in a multidimensional system.","535":"Arm acceleration data have been used to measure sleep-wake rhythmicity. Although several methods have been developed for the accurate classification of sleep-wake episodes, a method with both high sensitivity and specificity has not been fully established. In this study, we developed an algorithm, named ACceleration-based Classification and Estimation of Long-term sleep-wake cycles (ACCEL) that classifies sleep and wake episodes using only raw accelerometer data, without relying on device-specific functions. The algorithm uses a derivative of triaxial acceleration (jerk), which can reduce individual differences in the variability of acceleration data. Applying a machine learning algorithm to the jerk data achieved sleep-wake classification with a high sensitivity (&gt;90%) and specificity (&gt;80%). A jerk-based analysis also succeeded in recording periodic activities consistent with pulse waves. Therefore, the ACCEL algorithm will be a useful method for large-scale sleep measurement using simple accelerometers in real-world settings.","536":null,"537":null,"538":"Vitamin C (VC) distribution in our body requires VC transporters. However, mammalian VC exporters are yet to be identified. Herein, to unravel this long-standing mystery, we focused on the pathways whereby VC moves from blood to the brain, which should require a VC entrance and exit system composed of an importer and a latent exporter. Via cell-based transport analyses of VC efflux and using knockout mice generated via the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we identified GLUT12\/SLC2A12 as a physiologically important VC efflux protein expressed in the choroid plexus; Glut12\/Slc2a12 knockout halved the cerebral VC levels, markedly increased VC accumulation in the choroid plexus, and reduced the cerebrospinal fluid VC levels. These findings facilitate our understanding of VC regulation and the physiological impact of VC in our body.","539":"Chitosan (CS) and graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposites have received wide attention in biomedical fields due to the synergistic effect between CS which has excellent biological characteristics and GO which owns great physicochemical, mechanical, and optical properties. Nanocomposites based on CS and GO can be fabricated into a variety of forms, such as nanoparticles, hydrogels, scaffolds, films, and nanofibers. Thanks to the ease of functionalization, the performance of these nanocomposites in different forms can be further improved by introducing other functional polymers, nanoparticles, or growth factors. With this background, the current review summarizes the latest developments of CS-GO nanocomposites in different forms and compositions in biomedical applications including drug and biomacromolecules delivery, wound healing, bone tissue engineering, and biosensors. Future improving directions and challenges for clinical practice are proposed as well.","540":"Thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is known to be crucial for dynamically modulating sensory processing. Recently, the functional role of TRN in itch and pain sensation processing has drawn much attention. We found that ventrobasal thalamus (VB) neurons exhibited scratching behavior-related and nociceptive behavior-related neuronal activity changes, and most of VB neurons responsive to pruritic stimulus were also activated by nociceptive stimulus. Inhibition of VB could relieve itch-induced scratching behaviors and pathological pain without affecting basal nociceptive thresholds, and activation of VB could facilitate scratching behaviors. Tracing and electrophysiology recording results showed that VB mainly received inhibitory inputs from ventral TRN. Furthermore, optogenetic activation of TRN-VB projections suppressed scratching behaviors, and ablation of TRN enhanced scratching behaviors. In addition, activation of TRN-VB projections relieved the pathological pain without affecting basal nociceptive thresholds. Thus, our study indicates that TRN modulates itch and pain signals processing via TRN-VB inhibitory projections.","541":"Predicting cancer survival from molecular data is an important aspect of biomedical research because it allows quantifying patient risks and thus individualizing therapy. We introduce XGBoost tree ensemble learning to predict survival from transcriptome data of 8,024 patients from 25 different cancer types and show highly competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods. To further improve plausibility of the machine learning approach we conducted two additional steps. In the first step, we applied pan-cancer training and showed that it substantially improves prognosis compared with cancer subtype-specific training. In the second step, we applied network propagation and inferred a pan-cancer survival network consisting of 103 genes. This network highlights cross-cohort features and is predictive for the tumor microenvironment and immune status of the patients. Our work demonstrates that pan-cancer learning combined with network propagation generalizes over multiple cancer types and identifies biologically plausible features that can serve as biomarkers for monitoring cancer survival.","542":null,"543":"A major barrier to conducting HIV cure research in populations with the highest HIV burden is the lack of an accurate assay to quantify the replication-competent reservoir across the dominant global HIV-1 subtypes. Here, we modify a subtype B HIV-1 assay that quantifies both intact and defective proviral DNA, adapting it to accommodate cross-subtype HIV-1 sequence diversity. We show that the cross-subtype assay works on subtypes A, B, C, D, and CRF01_AE and can detect a single copy of intact provirus. In longitudinal blood samples from Kenyan infants infected with subtypes A and D, patterns of intact and total HIV DNA follow the decay of plasma viral load over time during antiretroviral therapy, with intact HIV DNA comprising 7% (range 1%-33%) of the total HIV DNA during HIV RNA suppression. This high-throughput cross-subtype reservoir assay will be useful in HIV cure research in Africa and Asia, where HIV prevalence is highest.","544":"Continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive brain stimulation technique, can induce long-lasting changes in synaptic plasticity, vital for memory reconsolidation. For this study, a total of 170 participants completed four experiments by a randomized controlled design. Succeeding fear conditioning, the subjects received cTBS over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) or vertex (control) with or without exposure to the conditioned stimulus to reactivate the original fear memory, and then underwent fear response tests. Compared with cTBS over the vertex and without memory reactivation, only cTBS over the right dlPFC after reactivation decreased the fear response for both recent and remote fear memories. This procedure was effective only during the reconsolidation window. The disruptive effect of cTBS over the right dlPFC on fear memory reconsolidation was delay-dependent. These findings demonstrate that cTBS time-dependently and delay-dependently prevents the return of fear and may have clinical potential for treating fear-related disorders.","545":"To understand how brain functions arise from interconnected neural networks, it is necessary to develop tools that can allow simultaneous manipulation and recording of neural activities. Multimodal neural probes, especially those that combine optogenetics with electrophysiology, provide a powerful tool for the dissection of neural circuit functions and understanding of brain diseases. In this review, we provide an overview of recent developments in multimodal neural probes. We will focus on materials and integration strategies of multimodal neural probes to achieve combined optogenetic stimulation and electrical recordings with high spatiotemporal precision and low invasiveness. In addition, we will also discuss future opportunities of multimodal neural interfaces in basic and translational neuroscience.","546":"Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of RAS on the plasma membrane (PM) is the key for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of the RAS signaling pathway. Single particle tracking (SPT) experiments show that in cells, KRAS diffuses in at least three interchanging states on the cellular PM; however, KRAS remains monomeric and always shows homogeneous diffusion on artificial membranes. Here, we show for the first time on a supported lipid bilayer composed of heterogeneous lipid components that we can recapitulate the three-state diffusion of KRAS seen in cells. The use of a biologically relevant eight-lipid system opens a new frontier in the biophysical studies of RAS and other membrane associated proteins on a biomimetic system that recapitulates the complexity of a cellular PM.","547":"The mammalian brain is organized over sizes that span several orders of magnitude, from synapses to the entire brain. Thus, a technique to visualize neural circuits across multiple spatial scales (multi-scale neuronal imaging) is vital for deciphering brain-wide connectivity. Here, we developed this technique by coupling successive light microscopy\/electron microscopy (LM\/EM) imaging with a glutaraldehyde-resistant tissue clearing method, ScaleSF. Our multi-scale neuronal imaging incorporates (1) brain-wide macroscopic observation, (2) mesoscopic circuit mapping, (3) microscopic subcellular imaging, and (4) EM imaging of nanoscopic structures, allowing seamless integration of structural information from the brain to synapses. We applied this technique to three neural circuits of two different species, mouse striatofugal, mouse callosal, and marmoset corticostriatal projection systems, and succeeded in simultaneous interrogation of their circuit structure and synaptic connectivity in a targeted way. Our multi-scale neuronal imaging will significantly advance the understanding of brain-wide connectivity by expanding the scales of objects.","548":"Invasive species threaten biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. We develop an innovative experimental approach, integrating biologically inspired robotics, time-series analysis, and computer vision, to build a detailed profile of the effects of non-lethal stress on the ecology and evolution of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki)-a global pest. We reveal that brief exposures to a robotic predator alter mosquitofish behavior, increasing fear and stress responses, and mitigate the impact of mosquitofish on native tadpoles (Litoria moorei) in a cause-and-effect fashion. Effects of predation risk from the robot carry over to routine activity and feeding rate of mosquitofish weeks after exposure, resulting in weight loss, variation in body shape, and reduction in the fertility of both sexes-impairing survival, reproduction, and ecological success. We capitalize on evolved responses of mosquitofish to reduce predation risk-neglected in biological control practices-and provide scientific foundations for widespread use of state-of-the-art robotics in ecology and evolution research.","549":"Non-genetically modified somatic cells can only be inefficiently and stochastically reprogrammed to pluripotency by exogenous expression of reprogramming factors. Low competence of natural reprogramming factors may prevent the majority of cells to successfully and synchronously reprogram. Here we screened DNA-interacting amino acid residues in the zinc-finger domain of KLF4 for enhanced reprogramming efficiency using alanine-substitution scanning methods. Identified KLF4 L507A mutant accelerated and stabilized reprogramming to pluripotency in both mouse and human somatic cells. By testing all the variants of L507 position, variants with smaller amino acid residues in the KLF4 L507 position showed higher reprogramming efficiency. L507A bound more to promoters or enhancers of pluripotency genes, such as KLF5, and drove gene expression of these genes during reprogramming. Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that L507A formed additional interactions with DNA. Our study demonstrates how modifications in amino acid residues of DNA-binding domains enable next-generation reprogramming technology with engineered reprogramming factors.","550":"Despite the discovery of many dinosaur eggs and nests over the past 100 years, articulated in-ovo embryos are remarkably rare. Here we report an exceptionally preserved, articulated oviraptorid embryo inside an elongatoolithid egg, from the Late Cretaceous Hekou Formation of southern China. The head lies ventral to the body, with the feet on either side, and the back curled along the blunt pole of the egg, in a posture previously unrecognized in a non-avian dinosaur, but reminiscent of a late-stage modern bird embryo. Comparison to other late-stage oviraptorid embryos suggests that prehatch oviraptorids developed avian-like postures late in incubation, which in modern birds are related to coordinated embryonic movements associated with tucking - a behavior controlled by the central nervous system, critical for hatching success. We propose that such pre-hatching behavior, previously considered unique to birds, may have originated among non-avian theropods, which can be further investigated with additional discoveries of embryo fossils.","551":null,"552":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.103292.].","553":"COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury (COVID-AKI) is a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hospitalized patients. The susceptibility of human kidneys to direct SARS-CoV-2 infection and modulation of the renin-angiotensin II signaling (RAS) pathway by viral infection remain poorly characterized. Using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids, SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV tropism, defined by the paired expression of a host receptor (ACE2, NRP1 or DPP4) and protease (TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, FURIN, CTSB or CTSL), was identified primarily among proximal tubule cells. Losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker being tested in patients with COVID-19, inhibited angiotensin II-mediated internalization of ACE2, upregulated interferon-stimulated genes (IFITM1 and BST2) known to restrict viral entry, and attenuated the infection of proximal tubule cells by SARS-CoV-2. Our work highlights the susceptibility of proximal tubule cells to SARS-CoV-2 and reveals a putative protective role for RAS inhibitors during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","554":"The survival of individuals of gregarious species depends on their social interactions. In humans, atypical social behavior is a hallmark of several psychopathological conditions, many of which have sex-specific manifestations. Various laboratory mouse strains are used to reveal the mechanisms mediating typical and atypical social behavior in mammals. Here, we used three social discrimination tests to characterize social behavior in males and females of three widely used laboratory mouse strains (C57BL\/6J, BALB\/c, and ICR). We found marked sex- and strain-specific differences in the behavior exhibited by subjects, in a test-dependent manner. Interestingly, some characteristics were strain-dependent, while others were sex-dependent. We then crossbred C57BL\/6J and BALB\/c mice and found that offspring of such crossbreeding exhibit social behavior which differs from both parental strains and depends on the specific combination of parental strains. Thus, social behavior of laboratory mice is sex- and strain-specific and depends on both genetic and environmental factors.","555":null,"556":null,"557":"Most laboratories employ spin coating with application of antisolvent to achieve high efficiency in perovskite solar cells. However, this method wastes a lot of material and is not industrially usable. Conversely, large area coating techniques such as blade and slot-die require high precision engineering both for deposition of ink and for gas or for electromagnetic drying procedures that replace, out of necessity, anti-solvent engineering. Here we present a simple and effective method to deposit uniform high-quality perovskite films with a piece of paper as an applicator at low temperatures. We fabricated solar cells on flexible PET substrates manually with 11% power conversion efficiency. Deposition after soaking the sheet of paper in a green antisolvent improved the efficiency by 82% compared to when using dry paper as applicator. This new technique enables manual film deposition without any expensive equipment and has the potential to be fully automated for future optimization and exploitation.","558":"The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model is a versatile tool used to study the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, limited studies have described multi-tumor PDX screening strategies to detect hub regulators during cancer-stroma interaction. Transcriptomes of cancer (human) and stroma (mouse) components of 70 PDX samples comprising 9 distinctive tumor types were analyzed in this study. PDX models recapitulated the original tumors' features, including tumor composition and putative signaling. Particularly, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) stood out, with altered hypoxia-related pathways and a high proportion of endothelial cells in the TME. Furthermore, an integrated analysis conducted to predict paracrine effectors in the KIRC cancer-to-stroma communication detected well-established soluble factors responsible for the hypoxia-related reaction and the so-far unestablished soluble factor, apelin (APLN). Subsequent experiments also supported the potential role of APLN in KIRC tumor progression. Therefore, this paper hereby provides an analytical workflow to find hub regulators in cancer-stroma interactions.","559":null,"560":"Biological visual system can efficiently handle optical information within the retina and visual cortex of the brain, which suggests an alternative approach for the upgrading of the current low-intelligence, large energy consumption, and complex circuitry of the artificial vision system for high-performance edge computing applications. In recent years, retinomorphic machine vision based on the integration of optoelectronic image sensors and processors has been regarded as a promising candidate to improve this phenomenon. This novel intelligent machine vision technology can perform information preprocessing near or even within the sensor in the front end, thereby reducing the transmission of redundant raw data and improving the efficiency of the back-end processor for high-level computing tasks. In this contribution, we try to present a comprehensive review on the recent progress achieved in this emergent field.","561":"Compared with bulk materials, atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) crystals possess a range of unique mechanical properties, including relatively high in-plane stiffness and large bending flexibility. The atomic 2D building blocks can be reassembled into precisely designed heterogeneous composite structures of various geometries with customized mechanical sensing behaviors. Due to their small specific density, high flexibility, and environmental adaptability, mechanical sensors based on 2D materials can conform to soft and curved surfaces, thus providing suitable solutions for functional applications in future wearable devices. In this review, we summarize the latest developments in mechanical sensors based on 2D materials from the perspective of function-oriented applications. First, typical mechanical sensing mechanisms are introduced. Second, we attempt to establish a correspondence between typical structure designs and the performance\/multi-functions of the devices. Afterward, several particularly promising areas for potential applications are discussed, following which we present perspectives on current challenges and future opportunities.","562":null,"563":null,"564":"The BET-bromodomain protein BRD4 uses two bromodomains to target acetyl-histones and other domains to recruit P-TEFb and other transcription factors to stimulate transcription of proto-oncogenes and key cell identity genes. Recent studies show that its ability to form phase-separated condensates that cluster preferentially at the super-enhancer regions of target genes is key for BRD4 to exert its functions. Here, we describe the identification of a natural product called PCG from polygonum cuspidatum Sieb.et Zucc., a traditional Chinese medicinal herb, that directly binds to BRD4. This binding inhibits BRD4 phase separation, turns dynamic BRD4 nuclear condensates into static aggregates, and effectively shuts down transcription of BRD4-dependent genes. Thus, through PCG we have discovered a BET inhibitor that not only selectively targets BRD4 but also works by suppressing phase separation, a mechanism of action that is different from those of the other known BET inhibitors.","565":"Antiplatelet drugs targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), used for the secondary prevention of arterial thrombosis, coincide with an increased bleeding risk. Targeting ITAM-linked receptors, such as the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI (GPVI), is expected to provide a better antithrombotic-hemostatic profile. Here, we developed and characterized an ultra-high-throughput (UHT) method based on intracellular [Ca2+]i increases to differentiate GPVI and GPCR effects on platelets. In 96-, 384-, or 1,536-well formats, Calcium-6-loaded human platelets displayed a slow-prolonged or fast-transient [Ca2+]i increase when stimulated with the GPVI agonist collagen-related peptide or with thrombin and other GPCR agonists, respectively. Semi-automated curve fitting revealed five parameters describing the Ca2+ responses. Verification of the UHT assay was done with a robustness compound library and clinically relevant platelet inhibitors. Taken together, these results present proof of principle of distinct receptor-type-dependent Ca2+ signaling curves in platelets, which allow identification of new inhibitors in a UHT way.","566":"Two variants at the APOL1 gene, encoding apolipoprotein L1, account for more than 70% of the increased risk for chronic kidney disease in individuals of African ancestry. While the initiating event for APOL1 risk variant cell injury remains to be clarified, we explored the possibility of blocking APOL1 toxicity at a more upstream level. We demonstrate that deletion of the first six amino acids of exon 4 abrogates APOL1 cytotoxicity by impairing APOL1 translocation to the lumen of ER and splicing of the signal peptide. Likewise, in orthologous systems, APOL1 lethality was partially abrogated in yeast strains and flies with reduced dosage of genes encoding ER translocon proteins. An inhibitor of ER to Golgi trafficking reduced lethality as well. We suggest that targeting the MSALFL sequence or exon 4 skipping may serve as potential therapeutic approaches to mitigate the risk of CKD caused by APOL1 renal risk variants.","567":"Site-specific recombination systems (SRSs) are widely used in studies on synthetic biology and related disciplines. Nondirectional SRSs can randomly trigger excision, integration, reversal, and translocation, which are effective tools to achieve large-scale genome recombination. In this study, we designed 6 new nondirectional SRSs named Vika\/voxsym1-4 and Dre\/roxsym1-2. All 6 artificial nondirectional SRSs were able to generate random deletion and inversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, all six SRSs were orthogonal to Cre\/loxPsym. The pairwise orthogonal nondirected SRSs can simultaneously initiate large-scale and independent gene recombination in two different regions of the genome, which could not be accomplished using previous orthogonal systems. These SRSs were found to be robust while working in the cells at different growth stages, as well as in the different spatial structure of the chromosome. These artificial pairwise orthogonal nondirected SRSs offer newfound potential for site-specific recombination in synthetic biology.","568":"Mitochondrial dysfunction causes muscle wasting in many diseases and probably also during aging. The underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We generated transgenic mice with unbalanced mitochondrial protein loading and import, by moderately overexpressing the nuclear-encoded adenine nucleotide translocase, Ant1. We found that these mice progressively lose skeletal muscle. Ant1-overloading reduces mitochondrial respiration. Interestingly, it also induces small heat shock proteins and aggresome-like structures in the cytosol, suggesting increased proteostatic burden due to accumulation of unimported mitochondrial preproteins. The transcriptome of Ant1-transgenic muscles is drastically remodeled to counteract proteostatic stress, by repressing protein synthesis and promoting proteasomal function, autophagy, and lysosomal amplification. These proteostatic adaptations collectively reduce protein content thereby reducing myofiber size and muscle mass. Thus, muscle wasting can occur as a trade-off of adaptation to mitochondria-induced proteostatic stress. This finding could have implications for understanding the mechanism of muscle wasting, especially in diseases associated with Ant1 overexpression, including facioscapulohumeral dystrophy.","569":"Programmed cell death pathways are triggered by various stresses or stimuli, including viral infections. The mechanism underlying the regulation of these pathways upon Influenza A virus (IAV) infection is not well characterized. We report that a cytosolic DNA sensor IFI16 is essential for the activation of programmed cell death pathways in IAV infected cells. We have identified that IFI16 functions as an RNA sensor for the influenza A virus by interacting with genomic RNA. The activation of IFI16 triggers the production of type I, III interferons, and also pro-inflammatory cytokines via the STING-TBK1 and Pro-caspase-1 signaling axis, thereby promoting cell death (apoptosis and pyroptosis in IAV infected cells). On the contrary, IFI16 knockdown cells showed reduced inflammatory responses and also prevented cell mortality during IAV infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate the pivotal role of IFI16-mediated IAV sensing and its essential role in activating programmed cell death pathways.","570":"The factors that affect the electrical ideality and photoresponse in near-infrared (NIR) organic phototransistors (OPTs) are still nebulous. Here, simultaneous increase in electrical ideality and NIR response in the OPTs is realized by applying a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) channel. The acceptor in the channel helps to trap the undesirable injected electrons, avoiding the accumulation of the electrons at the active channel\/dielectric interface, and thereby improving the hole transporting. Use of a BHJ channel also helps reducing the contact resistance in the OPTs. The electrical stability is then improved with mitigated dependence of charge mobility on gate voltage in the saturation region. The BHJ channel also offers an improved photoresponse through enhanced exciton dissociation, leading to more than one order of magnitude increase in responsivity than that in a control OPT. The results are encouraging, which pave the way for the development of high-performing NIR OPTs.","571":"Characterization of I37R, a mutation located in the lasso motif of the CFTR chloride channel, was conducted by theratyping several CFTR modulators from both potentiator and corrector classes. Intestinal current measurements in rectal biopsies, forskolin-induced swelling (FIS) in intestinal organoids, and short circuit current measurements in organoid-derived monolayers from an individual with I37R\/F508del CFTR genotype demonstrated that the I37R-CFTR results in a residual function defect amenable to treatment with potentiators and type III, but not type I, correctors. Molecular dynamics of I37R using an extended model of the phosphorylated, ATP-bound human CFTR identified an altered lasso motif conformation which results in an unfavorable strengthening of the interactions between the lasso motif, the regulatory (R) domain, and the transmembrane domain 2 (TMD2). Structural and functional characterization of the I37R-CFTR mutation increases understanding of CFTR channel regulation and provides a potential pathway to expand drug access to CF patients with ultra-rare genotypes.","572":"SIRT1 is a metabolic sensor regulating energy homeostasis. The present study revealed that mice with selective overexpression of human SIRT1 in adipose tissue (Adipo-SIRT1) were protected from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic abnormalities. Adipose SIRT1 was enriched at mitochondria-ER contacts (MERCs) to trigger mitohormesis and unfolded protein response (UPRmt), in turn preventing ER stress. As a downstream target of UPRmt, clusterin was significantly upregulated and acted together with SIRT1 to regulate the protein and lipid compositions at MERCs of adipose tissue. In mice lacking clusterin, HFD-induced metabolic abnormalities were significantly enhanced and could not be prevented by overexpression of SIRT1 in adipose tissue. Treatment with ER stress inhibitors restored adipose SIRT1-mediated beneficial effects on systemic energy metabolism. In summary, adipose SIRT1 facilitated the dynamic interactions and communications between mitochondria and ER, via MERCs, in turn triggering a mild mitochondrial stress to instigate the defense responses against dietary obesity-induced metabolic dysfunctions.","573":"There is a bidirectional transplacental cell trafficking between mother and fetus during pregnancy in placental mammals. The presence and persistence of fetal cells in maternal tissues are known as fetal microchimerism (FMc). FMc has high multilineage potential with a great ability to differentiate and functionally integrate into maternal tissue. FMc has been found in various maternal tissues in animal models and humans. Its permanence in the maternal body up to decades after delivery suggests it might play an essential role in maternal pathophysiology. Studying the presence, localization, and characteristics of FMc in maternal tissues is key to understanding its impact on the woman's body. Here we comprehensively review the existence of FMc in different species and organs and tissues, aiming to better characterize their possible role in human health and disease. We also highlight several methodological considerations that would optimize the detection, quantification, and functional determination of FMc.","574":null,"575":"The vigorous research on low-loss photonic devices has brought significance to a new kind of electromagnetic excitation, known as toroidal resonances. Toroidal excitation, possessing high-quality factor and narrow linewidth of the resonances, has found profound applications in metamaterial (MM) devices. By the coupling of toroidal dipolar resonance to traditional electric\/magnetic resonances, a metamaterial analogue of electromagnetically induced transparency effect (EIT) has been developed. Toroidal induced EIT has demonstrated intriguing properties including steep linear dispersion in transparency windows, often leading to elevated group refractive index in the material. This review summarizes the brief history and properties of the toroidal resonance, its identification in metamaterials, and their applications. Further, numerous theoretical and experimental demonstrations of single and multiband EIT effects in toroidal-dipole-based metamaterials and its applications are discussed. The study of toroidal-based EIT has numerous potential applications in the development of biomolecular sensing, slow light systems, switches, and refractive index sensing.","576":"Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are large, intracellular ion channels that control Ca2+ release from the sarco\/endoplasmic reticulum. Dysregulation of RyRs in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain has been implicated in various muscle pathologies, arrhythmia, heart failure, and Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, there is considerable interest in therapeutically targeting RyRs to normalize Ca2+ homeostasis in scenarios involving RyR dysfunction. Here, a simple invertebrate screening platform was used to discover new chemotypes targeting RyRs. The approach measured Ca2+ signals evoked by cyclic adenosine 5'-diphosphate ribose, a second messenger that sensitizes RyRs. From a 1,534-compound screen, FLI-06 (currently described as a Notch \"inhibitor\") was identified as a potent blocker of RyR activity. Two closely related tyrosine kinase inhibitors that stimulate and inhibit Ca2+ release through RyRs were also resolved. Therefore, this simple screen yielded RyR scaffolds tractable for development and revealed an unexpected linkage between RyRs and trafficking events in the early secretory pathway.","577":null,"578":"Accurate modeling of bifacial illumination is critical to improve the prediction of the energy yield of bifacial solar systems. Monte Carlo ray tracing is the most powerful tool to accomplish this task. In this work, we accelerate Monte Carlo ray tracing of large solar systems by nearly 90%. Our model achieves root-mean-square error values of 7.9% and 37.2% for the front and rear irradiance compared against single-axis tracking field reference data, respectively. The rear irradiance modeling error decreases to 18.9% if suspected snow periods are excluded. Crucially, our full system simulations show that surrounding ground surfaces affect the rear irradiance deep into the system. Therefore, unit system simulations cannot necessarily ignore the influence of the perimeter of large installations to accurately estimate annual yield. Large-scale simulations involving high-performance supercomputing were necessary to investigate these effects accurately, calibrate our simplified models, and validate our results against experimental measurements.","579":"Progression of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is modified by metabolic defects and obesity. Indeed, reduced food intake slows cyst growth in preclinical rodent studies. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of daily caloric restriction (DCR) and intermittent fasting (IMF) in a cohort of overweight or obese patients with ADPKD. Clinically significant weight loss occurred with both DCR and IMF; however, weight loss was greater and adherence and tolerability were better with DCR. Further, slowed kidney growth correlated with body weight and visceral adiposity loss independent of dietary regimen. Similarly, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of DCR, IMF, and time restricted feeding (TRF) using an orthologous ADPKD mouse model. Only ADPKD animals on DCR lost significant weight and showed slowed cyst growth compared to ad libitum, IMF, or TRF feeding. Collectively, this supports therapeutic feasibility of caloric restriction in ADPKD, with potential efficacy benefits driven by weight loss.","580":null,"581":"Blood clot contraction plays an important role in wound healing and hemostasis. Although clot contraction is known to be driven by platelets, how single platelet forces relate to the forces generated by macroscopic clots remains largely unknown. Using our microfabricated high-throughput platelet contraction cytometer, we find that single platelets have an average force of 34 nN ( n = 10  healthy individuals). However, multiple bulk clot experiments predict a mean single platelet force lower than 0.5 nN. To resolve this discrepancy, we use a mesoscale computational model to probe the mechanism by which individual platelets induce forces in macroscopic clots. Our experimentally informed model shows that the number of platelets in the clot cross-section defines the net clot force. We provide a relationship between single platelet force and the clot force that is useful for better understanding of blood disorders associated with bleeding and thrombosis, and facilitates the development of platelet-based and platelet-mimetic biomaterials.","582":"Gut dysbiosis in Huntington's disease (HD) has recently been reported using microbiome profiling in R6\/1 HD mice and replicated in clinical HD. In HD mice, environmental enrichment (EE) and exercise (EX) were shown to have therapeutic impacts on the brain and associated symptoms. We hypothesize that these housing interventions modulate the gut microbiome, configuring one of the mechanisms that mediate their therapeutic effects observed in HD. We exposed R6\/1 mice to a protocol of either EE or EX, relative to standard-housed control conditions, before the onset of gut dysbiosis and motor deficits. We characterized gut structure and function, as well as gut microbiome profiling using 16S rRNA sequencing. Multivariate analysis identified specific orders, namely Bacteroidales, Lachnospirales and Oscillospirales, as the main bacterial signatures that discriminate between housing conditions. Our findings suggest a promising role for the gut microbiome in mediating the effects of EE and EX exposures, and possibly other environmental interventions, in HD mice.","583":"To explore the relative contributions of higher-order and primary visual cortex (V1) to visual perception, we compared cats' behavioral and V1 neuronal contrast sensitivity functions (CSF) and threshold versus external noise contrast (TvC) functions before and after top-down influence of area 7 (A7) was modulated with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We found that suppressing top-down influence of A7 with cathode-tDCS, but not sham-tDCS, reduced behavioral and neuronal contrast sensitivity in the same range of spatial frequencies and increased behavioral and neuronal contrast thresholds in the same range of external noise levels. The neuronal CSF and TvC functions were highly correlated with their behavioral counterparts both before and after the top-down suppression. Analysis of TvC functions using the Perceptual Template Model (PTM) indicated that top-down influence of A7 increased both behavioral and V1 neuronal contrast sensitivity by reducing internal additive noise and the impact of external noise.","584":null,"585":"Compelling evidence support an involvement of oxidative stress and intestinal inflammation as early events in the predisposition and development of obesity and its related comorbidities. Here, we show that deficiency of the major mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) in the gastrointestinal tract drives spontaneous obesity. Intestinal epithelium-specific Sod2 ablation in mice induced adiposity and inflammation via phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation and increased release of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid. Remarkably, this obese phenotype was rescued when fed an essential fatty acid-deficient diet, which abrogates de novo biosynthesis of arachidonic acid. Data from clinical samples revealed that the negative correlation between intestinal Sod2 mRNA levels and obesity features appears to be conserved between mice and humans. Collectively, our findings suggest a role of intestinal Sod2 levels, PLA2 activity, and arachidonic acid in obesity presenting new potential targets of therapeutic interest in the context of this metabolic disorder.","586":null,"587":null,"588":"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder with progressive motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. The disease is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which elongates a polyglutamine stretch of the HD protein, Huntingtin. No therapeutic treatments are available, and new pharmacological targets are needed. Retrotransposons are transposable elements (TEs) that represent 40% and 30% of the human and Drosophila genomes and replicate through an RNA intermediate. Mounting evidence suggests that mammalian TEs are active during neurogenesis and may be involved in diseases of the nervous system. Here we show that TE expression and mobilization are increased in a Drosophila melanogaster HD model. By inhibiting TE mobilization with Reverse Transcriptase inhibitors, polyQ-dependent eye neurodegeneration and genome instability in larval brains are rescued and fly lifespan is increased. These results suggest that TE activation may be involved in polyQ-induced neurotoxicity and a potential pharmacological target.","589":null,"590":"Negative emissions technologies will play a critical role in limiting global warming to sustainable levels. Electrocatalytic and\/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction will likely play an important role in this field moving forward, but efficient, selective catalyst materials are needed to enable the widespread adoption of these processes. The rational design of such materials is highly challenging, however, due to the complexity of the reactions involved as well as the large number of structural variables which can influence behavior at heterogeneous interfaces. Currently, there is a significant disconnect between the complexity of materials systems that can be handled experimentally and those that can be modeled theoretically with appropriate rigor and bridging these gaps would greatly accelerate advancements in the field of Negative Emissions Science (NES). Here, we present a perspective on how these gaps between materials design\/synthesis, characterization, and theory can be resolved, enabling the rational development of improved materials for CO2 conversion and other NES applications.","591":"A growing number of governments are pledging to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. Despite such ambitions, realized emissions reductions continue to fall alarmingly short of modeled energy transition pathways for achieving net-zero. This gap is largely a result of the difficulty of realistically modeling all the techno-economic and sociopolitical capabilities that are required to deliver actual emissions reductions. This limitation of models suggests the need for an energy-systems analytical framework that goes well beyond energy-system modeling in order to close the gap between ambition and reality. Toward that end, we propose the Emissions-Sustainability-Governance-Operation (ESGO) framework for structured assessment and transparent communication of national capabilities and realization. We illustrate the critical role of energy modeling in ESGO using recent net-zero modeling studies for the world's two largest emitters, China and the United States. This illustration leads to recommendations for improvements to energy-system modeling to enable more productive ESGO implementation.","592":null,"593":"Parasitoid wasps of the smallest flying insects with bristled wings exhibit sophisticated flight behaviors while challenging biomechanical limitations in miniaturization and low-speed flow regimes. Here, we investigate the morphology, material composition, and mechanical properties of the bristles of the parasitoid wasps Anagrus Haliday. The bristles are extremely stiff and exhibit a high-aspect-ratio conical tubular structure with a large Young's modulus. This leads to a marginal deflection and uniform structural stress distribution in the bristles while they experience high-frequency flapping-induced aerodynamic loading, indicating that the bristles are robust to fatigue. The flapping aerodynamics of the bristled wings reveal that the wing surfaces act as porous flat paddles to reduce the overall inertial load while utilizing a passive shear-based aerodynamic drag-enhancing mechanism to generate the requisite aerodynamic forces. The bristled wing may have evolved as a novel design that achieves multiple functions and provides innovative ideas for developing bioinspired engineering microdevices.","594":"The surface free energy of rare earth oxides (REOs) has been debated during the last decade, with some reporting REOs to be intrinsically hydrophilic and others reporting hydrophobic. Here, we investigate the wettability and surface chemistry of pristine and smooth REO surfaces, conclusively showing that hydrophobicity stems from wettability transition due to volatile organic compound adsorption. We show that, for indoor ambient atmospheres and well-controlled saturated hydrocarbon atmospheres, the apparent advancing and receding contact angles of water increase with exposure time. We examined the surfaces comprehensively with multiple surface analysis techniques to confirm hydrocarbon adsorption and correlate it to wettability transition mechanisms. We demonstrate that both physisorption and chemisorption occur on the surface, with chemisorbed hydrocarbons promoting further physisorption due to their high affinity with similar hydrocarbon molecules. This study offers a better understanding of the intrinsic wettability of REOs and provides design guidelines for REO-based durable hydrophobic coatings.","595":null,"596":null,"597":"California has adopted a substantial number of electric vehicles over the last decade but there are many challenges associated with the electrification of vehicles, including how they interact with the electricity grid. We employ real-world feeder circuit level data in California from PG&amp;E to measure the capacity of local feeders. We model the adoption of electric vehicles down to the census block and take advantage of real-world vehicle charging data to simulate the future loading on circuits throughout Northern California. In our highest adoption scenario of 6 million electric vehicles in California, we find that across PG&amp;E's service territory, 443 circuits will require upgrades (nearly 20% of all circuits) and merely 88 of these feeders have planned upgrades in the future. The costs of these feeders are an essential part of a utility's planning process, and this work speaks to the importance of electric vehicles on local distribution networks.","598":"Implantable devices and systems have been emerging as powerful tools for neuroscience research and medical applications. Here we report a wireless, dual-channel optoelectronic system for functional optogenetic interrogation of superior colliculus (SC), a layered structure pertinent to defensive behaviors, in rodents. Specifically, a flexible and injectable probe comprises two thin-film microscale light-emitting diodes (micro-LEDs) at different depths, providing spatially resolved optical illuminations within the tissue. Under remote control, these micro-LEDs interrogate the intermediate layer and the deep layer of the SC (ILSC and DLSC) of the same mice, and deterministically evoke distinct freezing and flight behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, the system allows synchronized optical stimulations in both regions, and we discover that the flight response dominates animals' behaviors in our experiments. In addition, c-Fos immunostaining results further elucidate the functional hierarchy of the SC. These demonstrations provide a viable route to unraveling complex brain structures and functions.","599":null,"600":"Abnormal activation of SETBP1 due to overexpression or missense mutations occurs frequently in various myeloid neoplasms and associates with poor prognosis. Direct activation of Hoxa9\/Hoxa10\/Myb transcription by SETBP1 and its missense mutants is essential for their transforming capability; however, the underlying epigenetic mechanisms remain elusive. We found that both SETBP1 and its missense mutant SETBP1(D\/N) directly interact with histone methyltransferase MLL1. Using a combination of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis in primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, we uncovered extensive overlap in their genomic occupancy and their cooperation in activating many oncogenic transcription factor genes including Hoxa9\/Hoxa10\/Myb and a large group of ribosomal protein genes. Genetic ablation of Mll1 as well as treatment with an inhibitor of the MLL1 complex OICR-9429 abrogated Setbp1\/Setbp1(D\/N)-induced transcriptional activation and transformation. Thus, the MLL1 complex plays a critical role in Setbp1-induced transcriptional activation and transformation and represents a promising target for treating myeloid neoplasms with SETBP1 activation.","601":null,"602":"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein and SCAR homolog (WASH), an actin nucleation-promoting factor, is present in the nucleus where it regulates gene transcription and maintains nuclear organization. Here, we show that WASH interacts with core non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) factors including Ku70\/Ku80 and DNA-PKcs, and Ku70\/Ku80 is involved in the recruitment of WASH to the sites of DNA double-stranded break (DSB). WASH depletion leads to increased cell sensitivity and impaired DNA repair capacity in response to etoposide-induced DSBs and reduces NHEJ efficiency. Mechanistically, we show that loss of WASH inhibits the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, H2AX, and KAP1 after DSB induction and reduces chromatin relaxation and the recruitment of several downstream NHEJ factors to DSBs. Moreover, WASH role in DSB repair depends on its conserved C-terminal VCA domain and Arp2\/3 activation. Our findings reveal a function and mechanistic insight for WASH in DNA DSB repair by the NHEJ pathway.","603":null,"604":null,"605":null,"606":"Dynamic tuning of terahertz (THz) wave is vital for the development of next generation THz devices. Utilization of solar energy for tuning THz waves is a promising, eco-friendly, and sustainable way to expand THz application scenarios. Ti2O3 with an ultranarrow bandgap of 0.1eV exhibits intriguing thermal-induced metal-insulator transition (MIT), and possesses excellent photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, Ti2O3 film was fabricated by a two-step magnetron sputtering method, and exhibited an excellent photothermal conversion efficiency of 90.45% and demonstrated temperature-dependent THz transmission characteristics with a wideband at 0.1-1 THz. We supposed to combine photothermal conversion characteristics with temperature-dependent THz transmission properties of Ti2O3 film, which could introduce solar light as the energy source for tuning THz waves. Our work will provide new sight for investigating MIT characteristics of Ti2O3 at THz regime and exhibit huge potential in the application of tuning terahertz waves in outdoor scenarios in the future.","607":null,"608":"We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of-mind, a new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an iterative communication process, i.e., dialogue between the machine and human user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates a sequence of explanations in a dialogue by mediating the differences between the minds of the machine and human user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly modeling the human's intention, the machine's mind as inferred by the human, as well as human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art XAI frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, we show that these attention-based explanations are not sufficient for increasing human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows: given an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class c pred , a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g., stripes on zebra), referred to as explainable concepts, that need to be added to or deleted from I to alter the classification category of I by M to another specified class c alt . Extensive experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating that our CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art XAI models.","609":"Impressive global efforts have identified both rare and common gene variants associated with severe COVID-19 using sequencing technologies. However, these studies lack the sensitivity to accurately detect several classes of variants, especially large structural variants (SVs), which account for a substantial proportion of genetic diversity including clinically relevant variation. We performed optical genome mapping on 52 severely ill COVID-19 patients to identify rare\/unique SVs as decisive predisposition factors associated with COVID-19. We identified 7 SVs involving genes implicated in two key host-viral interaction pathways: innate immunity and inflammatory response, and viral replication and spread in nine patients, of which SVs in STK26 and DPP4 genes are the most intriguing candidates. This study is the first to systematically assess the potential role of SVs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 severity and highlights the need to evaluate SVs along with sequencing variants to comprehensively associate genomic information with interindividual variability in COVID-19 phenotypes.","610":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101584.].","611":null,"612":null,"613":"Dysferlinopathies are muscular dystrophies caused by recessive loss-of-function mutations in dysferlin (DYSF), a membrane protein involved in skeletal muscle membrane repair. We describe a cell-based assay in which human DYSF proteins bearing missense mutations are quantitatively assayed for membrane localization by flow cytometry and identified 64 localization-defective DYSF mutations. Using this platform, we show that the clinically approved drug 4-phenylbutryric acid (4-PBA) partially restores membrane localization to 25 mutations, as well as membrane repair to cultured myotubes expressing 2 different mutations. Two-day oral administration of 4-PBA to mice homozygous for one of these mutations restored myofiber membrane repair. 4-PBA may hold therapeutic potential for treating a subset of humans with muscular dystrophy due to dysferlin deficiency.","614":"Xyloglucan is a prominent matrix heteropolysaccharide binding to cellulose microfibrils in primary plant cell walls. Hence, the hydrolysis of xyloglucan facilitates the overall lignocellulosic biomass degradation. Xyloglucanases (XEGs) are key enzymes classified in several glycoside hydrolase (GH) families. So far, family GH44 has been shown to contain bacterial XEGs only. Detailed genome analysis revealed GH44 members in fungal species from the phylum Basidiomycota, but not in other fungi, which we hypothesized to also be XEGs. Two GH44 enzymes from Dichomitus squalens and Pleurotus ostreatus were heterologously produced and characterized. They exhibited XEG activity and displayed a hydrolytic cleavage pattern different from that observed in fungal XEGs from other GH families. Specifically, the fungal GH44 XEGs were not hindered by substitution of neighboring glucosyl units and generated various \"XXXG-type,\" \"GXXX(G)-type,\" and \"XXX-type\" oligosaccharides. Overall, these fungal GH44 XEGs represent a novel class of enzymes for plant biomass conversion and valorization.","615":null,"616":null,"617":"Studies for sepsis prediction using machine learning are developing rapidly in medical science recently.

In this study, we investigated the effect of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) in cigarette smoking on chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer as well as the biological mechanism of NNK causing malignant transformation. We show that smoking may promote Kras mutation and P16 promoter methylation from clinical samples and NNK markedly facilitates the growth and migration of pancreatic cancer cells via the activation of Sonic Hedgehog signaling. We demonstrate that NNK promotes acinar-to-ductal metastasis and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia in rats with chronic pancreatitis, accompanied by desmoplastic reaction and Gli1 overexpression. Together, we here present evidence that NNK provokes the progression of chronic pancreatitis toward pancreatic cancer and highlight potential strategies and targets for early prevention of pancreatic cancer and its therapeutics.","620":null,"621":null,"622":"Nicotinamide riboside supplements (NRS) have been touted as a nutraceutical that promotes cardiometabolic and musculoskeletal health by enhancing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis, mitochondrial function, and\/or the activities of NAD-dependent sirtuin deacetylase enzymes. This investigation examined the impact of NRS on whole body energy homeostasis, skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, and corresponding shifts in the acetyl-lysine proteome, in the context of diet-induced obesity using C57BL\/6NJ mice. The study also included a genetically modified mouse model that imposes greater demand on sirtuin flux and associated NAD+ consumption, specifically within muscle tissues. In general, whole body glucose control was marginally improved by NRS when administered at the midpoint of a chronic high-fat diet, but not when given as a preventative therapy upon initiation of the diet. Contrary to anticipated outcomes, the study produced little evidence that NRS increases tissue NAD+ levels, augments mitochondrial function, and\/or mitigates diet-induced hyperacetylation of the skeletal muscle proteome.","623":null,"624":null,"625":"Megalograptidae and Mixopteridae with elongate, spinose prosomal appendages are unique early Palaeozoic sea scorpions (Eurypterida). These features were presumably used for hunting, an untested hypothesis. Here, we present 3D model-based kinematic range of motion (ROM) analyses of Megalograptus ohioensis and Mixopterus kiaeri and compare these to modern analogs. This comparison confirms that the eurypterid appendages were likely raptorial, used in grabbing and holding prey for consumption. The Megalograptus ohioensis model illustrates notable Appendage III flexibility, indicating hypertrophied spines on Appendage III may have held prey, while Appendage II likely ripped immobilized prey. Mixopterus kiaeri, conversely, constructed a capture basket with Appendage III, and impaled prey with Appendage II elongated spines. Thus, megalograptid and mixopterid frontalmost appendages constructed a double basket system prior to moving dismembered prey to the chelicerae.

While these compounds activate Parkin in a series of biochemical assays, they do not act by thermally destabilizing Parkin and fail to enhance the Parkin translocation rate to mitochondria or to enact mitophagy in cell-based assays. We conclude that in the context of the cellular milieu the therapeutic window to pharmacologically activate Parkin is very narrow.","632":null,"633":"Prey depletion may contribute to marine predator declines, yet the forage base required to sustain an unfished population of predatory fish at carrying capacity is unknown. We integrated demographic and physiological data within a Bayesian bioenergetic model to estimate annual consumption of a gray reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) population at a remote Pacific atoll (Palmyra Atoll) that are at carrying capacity. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of the atoll's reef fish biomass production consumed by the gray reef sharks, assuming sharks either partially foraged pelagically (mean 7%), or solely within the reef environment (mean 52%). We then predicted the gray reef shark population potential of other, less remote Pacific Ocean coral reef islands, illustrating that current populations are substantially smaller than could be supported by their forage base. Our research highlights the utility of modeling how far predator population sizes are from their expected carrying capacity in informing marine conservation.","634":null,"635":"Polymer memristors are preeminent candidates for low-power edge computing paradigms.

The introduction of chalcogen atoms (S, Se, Te) into viologen scaffolds can greatly improve electrical conductive, electrochemical, and electrochromic properties of the materials when compared with the conventional viologens. Taking PTeVTPA as an example, the as-fabricated electronic device with a configuration of Al\/PTeVTPA\/ITO exhibits excellent multilevel storage and history-dependent memristive switching performance. Associated with the unique memristive behavior, the PTeVTPA-based device can not only be used to emulate the synaptic potentiation\/depression, the human's learning and memorizing functions, and the transition from short-term synaptic plasticity to long-term plasticity but also carry out decimal arithmetic operations as well.

In neurons, DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) have been identified as novel epigenetic mechanisms regulating neurotransmission and cognition. Activity-dependent DSB contribute critically to neuronal plasticity processes, which could be impaired upon infection. Here, we show that BoDV-1 infection, or the singled-out expression of viral Nucleoprotein and Phosphoprotein, increases neuronal DSB levels. Of interest, inducing DSB promoted the recruitment anew of vSPOT colocalized with DSB and increased viral RNA replication. BoDV-1 persistence decreased neuronal activity and response to stimulation by dampening the surface expression of glutamate receptors.

Data addressing the neutralization capacity of a heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19\/mRNA-based vaccination approach against the Delta VoC in comparison to the widely used homologous mRNA-based vaccine regimen are limited. Here, we compare serological immune responses of a cohort of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19\/BNT162b2-vaccinated participants with those of BNT162b2\/BNT162b2 vaccinated ones and show that neutralization capacity against the Delta VoC is significantly increased in sera of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19\/BNT162b2-vaccinated participants.

Here, by combining quantitative proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and acetylproteomics analyses, we revealed RNA processing and translation as the most differentially regulated processes between naive and primed human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Although glycolytic primed hESCs rely predominantly on the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-mediated cap-dependent pathway for protein translation, naive hESCs with reduced mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC1) activity are more tolerant to eIF4E inhibition, and their bivalent metabolism allows for translating selective mRNAs via both eIF4E-dependent and eIF4E-independent\/eIF4A2-dependent pathways to form a more compact naive proteome. Globally up-regulated proteostasis and down-regulated post-translational modifications help to further refine the naive proteome that is compatible with the more rapid cycling of naive hESCs, where CDK1 plays an indispensable coordinative role. These findings may assist in better understanding the unrestricted lineage potential of naive hESCs and in further optimizing conditions for future clinical applications.","644":null,"645":"Microbiota-host interaction plays an important role in cancer predisposing, initiation, progression, and response to therapy.

We found PAH-degrading microbes were more abundant in lung tumor microbiota from smokers. Furthermore, TP53 mutation was more prevalent in smokers, and TP53-mutated tumor harbored more Massilia, as well as Acidovorax that was also capable of degrading PAH. Further analysis showed DNA recombination and repair pathway was enriched in microbiota of smokers, which was convergent to the alteration occurred in tumor cells. Meanwhile, the microbiota of TP53-mutated tumor also exhibited dysregulation of p53 signaling pathway. Our results provided insights into the association of lung commensal microbes with tobacco exposure and host gene mutation, suggesting microbiota and tumor cells might undergo convergent alteration and mutually benefit each other.","646":"Mitigating and adapting to climate change requires decarbonizing electricity while ensuring resilience of supply, since a warming planet will lead to greater extremes in weather and, plausibly, in power outages. Although it is well known that long-duration outages severely impact economies, such outages are usually not well characterized or modeled in grid infrastructure planning tools. Here, we bring together data and modeling techniques and show how they can be used to characterize and model long-duration outages. We illustrate how to integrate outages in planning tools for one promising mode of resilient energy supply-microgrids. Failing to treat these extremes in models can lead to microgrid designs (1) that do not realize their full value of resilience, since models do not see the benefits of protecting against extremes, and (2) that appear reliable on paper yet do not actually protect against extremes. Although utilities record power interruptions, lack of access to that data is hindering research on resilience; making datasets available publicly would substantially aid efforts to improve grid planning tools.","647":"Electrocatalysis is an indispensable technique for small-molecule transformations, which are essential for the sustainability of society. Electrocatalysis utilizes electricity as an energy source for chemical reactions. Hydrogen is considered the \"fuel for the future,\" and designing electrocatalysts for hydrogen production has thus become critical. Furthermore, fuel cells are promising energy solutions that require robust electrocatalysts for key fuel cell reactions such as the interconversion of oxygen to water. Concerns regarding the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide have prompted the search for CO2 conversion methods. One promising approach is the electrochemical conversion of CO2 into commodity chemicals and\/or liquid fuels, but such chemistry is highly energy demanding because of the thermodynamic stability of CO2. All of the above-mentioned electrocatalytic processes rely on the selective input of multiple protons (H+) and electrons (e-) to yield the desired products. Biological enzymes evolved in nature to perform such redox catalysis and have inspired the design of catalysts at the molecular and atomic levels. While it is synthetically challenging to mimic the exact biological environment, incorporating functional outer coordination spheres into molecular catalysts has shown promise for advancing multi-H+ and multi-e- electrocatalysis. From this Perspective, herein, catalysts with outer coordination sphere(s) are selected as the inspiration for developing new catalysts, particularly for the reductive conversion of H+, O2, and CO2, which are highly relevant to sustainability. The recent progress in electrocatalysis and opportunities to explore beyond the second coordination sphere are also emphasized.","648":"Obesity is known to affect female reproduction, as evidenced by obese patients suffering from subfertility and abnormal oogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms by which obesity impairs folliculogenesis are poorly documented. Here, we performed comprehensive single-cell transcriptome analysis in both regular diet (RD) and obese mouse models to systematically uncover how obesity affects ovarian follicle cells and their interactions. We found an increased proportion of Inhbb highly expressed granulosa cells (GCs) among all the GC subpopulations in obese mice. Under obese conditions, excessive androgen secreted from endocrine theca cells (ETCs) may contribute to the imbalanced change of GC subtypes through ETCs-GCs interactions. This is alleviated by enzalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist. We also identified and confirmed typical GC markers, such as Marcks and Prkar2b, for sensitive evaluation of female fertility in obesity. These data represent a resource for studying transcriptional networks and cell-cell interactions during folliculogenesis under physiological and pathological conditions.","649":null,"650":null,"651":null,"652":"Rho guanosine triphosphatase (GTPases), as molecular switches, have been identified to be dysregulated and involved in the pathogenesis of various rheumatic diseases, mainly including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.

In the honeybee, a social insect where food collection and defensive responses are socially regulated, only sNPF has an identified receptor. Here we increased artificially sNPF levels in honeybee foragers and studied the consequences of this manipulation in various forms of appetitive and aversive responsiveness. Increasing sNPF in partially fed bees turned them into the equivalent of starved animals, enhancing both their food consumption and responsiveness to appetitive gustatory and olfactory stimuli. Neural activity in the olfactory circuits of fed animals was reduced and could be rescued by sNPF treatment to the level of starved bees. In contrast, sNPF had no effect on responsiveness to nociceptive stimuli. Our results thus identify sNPF as a key modulator of hunger and food-related responses in bees, which are at the core of their foraging activities.","654":"The most efficient light-harvesting antennae found in nature, chlorosomes, are molecular tubular aggregates (TMAs) assembled by pigments without protein scaffolds. Here, we discuss a classification of chlorosomes as a unique tubular plastic crystal and we attribute the robust energy transfer in chlorosomes to this unique nature. To systematically study the role of supramolecular tube chirality by molecular simulation, a role that has remained unresolved, we share a protocol for generating realistic tubes at atomic resolution. We find that both the optical and the mechanical behavior are strongly dependent on chirality. The optical-chirality relation enables a direct interpretation of experimental spectra in terms of overall tube chirality. The mechanical response shows that the overall chirality regulates the hardness of the tube and provides a new characteristic for relating chlorosomes to distinct chirality. Our protocol also applies to other TMA systems and will inspire other systematic studies beyond lattice models.","655":null,"656":"Thousands of biomedical scientific articles, including those describing genes associated with human diseases, are published every week. Computational methods such as text mining and machine learning algorithms are now able to automatically detect these associations. In this study, we used a cognitive computing text-mining application to construct a knowledge network comprising 3,723 genes and 99 diseases. We then tracked the yearly changes on these networks to analyze how our knowledge has evolved in the past 30 years. Our systems approach helped to unravel the molecular bases of diseases and detect shared mechanisms between clinically distinct diseases. It also revealed that multi-purpose therapeutic drugs target genes that are commonly associated with several psychiatric, inflammatory, or infectious disorders. By navigating this knowledge tsunami, we were able to extract relevant biological information and insights about human diseases.","657":"Glucose-responsive ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP) are expressed in a variety of tissues including nervous systems. The depolarization of the membrane potential induced by glucose may lead to hyperexcitability of neurons and induce excitotoxicity. However, the roles of KATP in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are poorly understood. Here, we determine the roles of KATP in the PNS using KATP-deficient (Kir6.2-deficient) mice. We demonstrate that neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was reduced by channel closers sulfonylureas. However, a channel opener diazoxide elongated the neurite. KATP subunits were expressed in mouse DRG, and expression of certain subunits including Kir6.2 was increased in diabetic mice. In Kir6.2-deficient mice, the current perception threshold, thermal perception threshold, and sensory nerve conduction velocity were impaired. Electron microscopy revealed a reduction of unmyelinated and small myelinated fibers in the sural nerves. In conclusion, KATP may contribute to the development of peripheral neuropathy.","658":null,"659":"The RecQ family of helicases are important for maintenance of genomic integrity. Although functions of constructive subdomains of this family of helicases have been extensively studied, the helical hairpin (HH) in the RecQ-C-terminal domain (RQC) has been underappreciated and remains poorly understood. Here by using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer, we found that HH in the human BLM transiently intercepts different numbers of nucleotides when it is unwinding a double-stranded DNA. Single-site mutations in HH that disrupt hydrogen bonds and\/or salt bridges between DNA and HH change the DNA binding conformations and the unwinding features significantly. Our results, together with recent clinical tests that correlate single-site mutations in HH of human BLM with the phenotype of cancer-predisposing syndrome or Bloom's syndrome, implicate pivotal roles of HH in BLM's DNA unwinding activity. Similar mechanisms might also apply to other RecQ family helicases, calling for more attention to the RQC helical hairpin.","660":null,"661":null,"662":null,"663":"We introduce techniques for probing the dynamics of triplet states. We employ these tools, along with conventional techniques, to develop a detailed understanding of a complex chemical system: a negative-tone, radical photoresist for multiphoton absorption polymerization in which isopropylthioxanthone (ITX) is the photoinitiator. This work reveals that the same color of light used for the 2-photon excitation of ITX, leading to population of the triplet manifold through intersystem crossing, also depletes this triplet population via linear absorption followed by reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). Using spectroscopic tools and kinetic modeling, we identify the reactive triplet state and a non-reactive reservoir triplet state. We present compelling evidence that the deactivation channel involves RISC from an excited triplet state to a highly vibrationally excited level of the electronic ground state. The work described here offers the enticing possibility of understanding, and ultimately controlling, the photochemistry and photophysics of a broad range of triplet processes.","664":"Hybrid lead halide ABX3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a strong competitor to the traditional solar cells with a certified power conversion efficiency beyond 25% and other remarkable features such as light weight, solution processability, and low manufacturing cost. Further development on the efficiency and stability brings forth increasing attention in the component regulation, such as partial or entire substitution of A\/B\/X sites by alternative elements with similar size. However, the relationships between composition, property, and performance are poorly understood. Here, the instability of PSCs from the photon-, moisture-, thermal-, and mechanical-induced degradation was first summarized and discussed. In addition, the component regulation from the A\/X sites is highlighted from the aspects of band level alignment, charge-carrier dynamics, ion migration, crystallization behavior, residual strain, stoichiometry, and dimensionality control. Finally, the perspectives and future outlooks are highlighted to guide the rational design and practical application of PSCs.","665":"Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) metal oxides exhibit unique optical, electrical, magnetic, and chemical properties, rendering them a bright application prospect in high-performance smart devices. Given the large variety of both layered and non-layered 2D metal oxides, the controllable synthesis is the critical prerequisite for enabling the exploration of their great potentials. In this review, recent progress in the synthesis of 2D metal oxides is summarized and categorized. Particularly, a brief overview of categories and crystal structures of 2D metal oxides is firstly introduced, followed by a critical discussion of various synthesis methods regarding the growth mechanisms, advantages, and limitations. Finally, the existing challenges are presented to provide possible future research directions regarding the synthesis of 2D metal oxides. This work can provide useful guidance on developing innovative approaches for producing both 2D layered and non-layered nanostructures and assist with the acceleration of the research of 2D metal oxides.","666":"Natural fiber reinforced composites (FRC) are of great interests, because of their biodegradability, recyclability, and environmental benefits over synthetic FRC. Natural jute FRC could provide an environmentally sustainable, light weight, and cost-effective alternative to synthetic FRC. However, the application of natural jute FRC is limited because of their poor mechanical and interfacial properties. Graphene and its derivatives could potentially be applied to modify jute fiber surface for manufacturing natural FRC with excellent mechanical properties, and lower environmental impacts. Here, we review the physical and chemical treatments, and graphene-based modifications of jute fibers, and their effect on mechanical properties of jute FRC. We introduce jute fiber structure, chemical compositions, and their potential applications first. We then provide an overview of various surface treatments used to improve mechanical properties of jute FRC. We discuss and compare various graphene derivative-based surface modifications of jute fibers, and their impact on the performance of FRC. Finally, we provide our future perspective on graphene-based jute fibers research to enable next generation strong and sustainable FRC for high performance engineering applications without conferring environmental problems.","667":null,"668":null,"669":"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) targets include the oral mucosa and salivary glands after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Without incisional biopsy, no diagnostic test exists to confirm oral cGVHD. Consequently, therapy is often withheld until severe manifestations develop. This proteomic study examined saliva and human salivary gland for a biomarker profile at first onset of oral cGVHD prior to initiation of topical steroid therapy. Whole saliva collected at onset of biopsy-proven oral GVHD was assessed using liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry with identification of 569 proteins, of which 77 significantly changed in abundance. ZG16B, a secretory lectin protein, was reduced 2-fold in oral cGVHD saliva (p &lt;0.05), and significantly decreased in salivary gland secretory cells affected by cGVHD. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of healthy MSG localized ZG16B expression to two discrete acinar cell populations. Reduced ZG16B expression may indicate specific cGVHD activity and possibly general salivary gland dysfunction.","670":"Segmentation and tagmatization have contributed to the preeminent success of arthropods since their first appearance in the Cambrian. However, the exact mechanism of segmentogenesis is still insufficiently known in living and extinct groups. Here, we describe the postembryonic development of a Waptiid arthropod Chuandianella ovata from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota, South China. The new data illuminate a complex dynamic pattern of anamorphosis and epimorphosis, and a three-step process of segmentogenesis, i.e., the elongation of the terminal segment, delineation of an incipient segment, and full separation of a new segment. Compensatory growth is accomplished by rapid growth of new segments and\/or generation of additional segments, which results in the trimorphism of the posterior tagma. Such complex developmental dynamics has rarely been known in the arthropod fossil record and its presence in early history helps to understand the rapid diversification of arthropods in the early Cambrian.","671":null,"672":null,"673":"Trichodesmium, a globally important, N2-fixing, and colony-forming cyanobacterium, employs multiple pathways for acquiring nutrients from air-borne dust, including active dust collection. Once concentrated within the colony core, dust can supply Trichodesmium with nutrients. Recently, we reported a selectivity in particle collection enabling Trichodesmium to center iron-rich minerals and optimize its nutrient utilization. In this follow-up study we examined if colonies select Phosphorus (P) minerals. We incubated 1,200 Trichodesmium colonies from the Red Sea with P-free CaCO3, P-coated CaCO3, and dust, over an entire bloom season. These colonies preferably interacted, centered, and retained P-coated CaCO3 compared with P-free CaCO3. In both studies, Trichodesmium clearly favored dust over all other particles tested, whereas nutrient-free particles were barely collected or retained, indicating that the colonies sense the particle composition and preferably collect nutrient-rich particles. This unique ability contributes to Trichodesmium's current ecological success and may assist it to flourish in future warmer oceans.","674":"We demonstrate early progress toward constructing a high-throughput, single-molecule protein sequencing technology utilizing barcoded DNA aptamers (binders) to recognize terminal amino acids of peptides (targets) tethered on a next-generation sequencing chip. DNA binders deposit unique, amino acid-identifying barcodes on the chip. The end goal is that, over multiple binding cycles, a sequential chain of DNA barcodes will identify the amino acid sequence of a peptide. Toward this, we demonstrate successful target identification with two sets of target-binder pairs: DNA-DNA and Peptide-Protein. For DNA-DNA binding, we show assembly and sequencing of DNA barcodes over six consecutive binding cycles. Intriguingly, our computational simulation predicts that a small set of semi-selective DNA binders offers significant coverage of the human proteome. Toward this end, we introduce a binder discovery pipeline that ultimately could merge with the chip assay into a technology called ProtSeq, for future high-throughput, single-molecule protein sequencing.","675":null,"676":"Our bodies provide a necessary scaffold for memories of past events. Yet, we are just beginning to understand how feelings of one's own body during the encoding of realistic events shape memory. Participants formed memories for immersive, lifelike events by watching pre-recorded 3D videos that involved a first-person view of a mannequin's body through head mounted displays. We manipulated feelings of body ownership over the mannequin using a perceptual full-body illusion. Participants completed cued recall questions and subjective ratings (i.e., degree of reliving, emotional intensity, vividness, and belief in memory accuracy) for each video immediately following encoding and one week later. Sensing the mannequin's body as one's own during encoding enhanced the following factors: memory accuracy across testing points, immediate reliving, delayed emotional intensity, vividness, and belief in memory accuracy. These findings demonstrate that a basic sense of bodily selfhood provides a crucial foundation for the accurate reliving of the past.","677":null,"678":"Ultra-high chip power densities that are expected to surpass 1-2kW\/cm2 in future high-performance systems cannot be easily handled by conventional cooling methods. Various emerging cooling methods, such as liquid cooling via microchannels, thermoelectric coolers (TECs), two-phase vapor chambers, and hybrid cooling options have been designed to efficiently remove heat from high-performance processors. However, selecting the optimal cooling solution for a given chip and determining the optimal cooling parameters for that solution to achieve high efficiency are open problems. These problems are, in fact, computationally expensive because of the massive space of possible solutions. To address this design challenge, this article introduces a deep learning-based cooling design optimization flow that rapidly and accurately converges to the optimal cooling solution as well as the optimal cooling parameters for a given chip floorplan and its power profile.","679":null,"680":"Currently, the most difficult time of year for California to supply the demanded electricity is around sunset on very hot summer days. As California uses more renewable electricity, that challenge may shift to any time of the year depending on the supply of electricity more than on the demand. We study various scenarios for applying a 100% renewable energy grid using six years (2015-2020) of historical demand and scaled-up solar and wind generation to investigate the main function of the storage in affording adequate electricity supply at all times of the year. We identify the times of year that may be most challenging. We detect that, for a solar dominant generation profile, the ultimate challenge shifts from summer to winter. Furthermore, the critical time of the year may be shifted by one or two months depending on the amount and the mix of the renewable generation that will be built.","681":null,"682":null,"683":"SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With an urgent need for therapeutics, we lack a full understanding of the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2-induced cellular damage and disease progression. Here, we conducted transcriptomic analysis of human PBMCs, identified significant changes in mitochondrial, ion channel, and protein quality-control gene products. SARS-CoV-2 proteins selectively target cellular organelle compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. M-protein, NSP6, ORF3A, ORF9C, and ORF10 bind to mitochondrial PTP complex components cyclophilin D, SPG-7, ANT, ATP synthase, and a previously undescribed CCDC58 (coiled-coil domain containing protein 58). Knockdown of CCDC58 or mPTP blocker cyclosporin A pretreatment enhances mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity and bioenergetics. SARS-CoV-2 infection exacerbates cardiomyocyte autophagy and promotes cell death that was suppressed by cyclosporin A treatment. Our findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins suppress cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function that disrupts cardiomyocyte Ca2+ cycling and cell viability.","684":null,"685":"Childhood-onset myocardial hypertrophy and cardiomyopathic changes are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in early life, particularly in patients with Noonan syndrome, a multisystemic genetic disorder caused by autosomal dominant mutations in genes of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Although the cardiomyopathy associated with Noonan syndrome (NS-CM) shares certain cardiac features with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in sarcomeric proteins (HCM), such as pathological myocardial remodeling, ventricular dysfunction, and increased risk for malignant arrhythmias, the clinical course of NS-CM significantly differs from HCM. This suggests a distinct pathophysiology that remains to be elucidated. Here, through analysis of sarcomeric myosin conformational states, histopathology, and gene expression in left ventricular myocardial tissue from NS-CM, HCM, and normal hearts complemented with disease modeling in cardiomyocytes differentiated from patient-derived PTPN11 N308S\/+ induced pluripotent stem cells, we demonstrate distinct disease phenotypes between NS-CM and HCM and uncover cell cycle defects as a potential driver of NS-CM.","686":null,"687":null,"688":null,"689":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver-associated disease and liver cancer. Of the major HCV subtypes, patients infected with subtype 1b have been associated with having a higher risk of developing chronic infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, underlying reasons for this increased disease severity remain unknown. Here, we provide an evolutionary rationale, based on a comparative study of fitness landscape and in-host evolutionary models of the E2 glycoprotein of HCV subtypes 1a and 1b. Our analysis demonstrates that a higher chronicity rate of 1b may be attributed to lower fitness constraints, enabling 1b viruses to more easily escape antibody responses. More generally, our results suggest that differences in evolutionary constraints between HCV subtypes may be an important factor in mediating distinct disease outcomes. Our analysis also identifies antibodies that appear escape-resistant against both subtypes 1a and 1b, providing directions for designing HCV vaccines having cross-subtype protection.","690":"Progressive addition lenses (PALs) are ophthalmic lenses to correct presbyopia by providing improvements of near and far vision in different areas of the lens, but distorting the periphery of the wearer's field of view. Distortion-related difficulties reported by PAL wearers include unnatural self-motion perception. Visual self-motion perception is guided by optic flow, the pattern of retinal motion produced by self-motion. We tested the influence of PAL distortions on optic flow-based heading estimation using a model of heading perception and a virtual reality-based psychophysical experiment. The model predicted changes of heading estimation along a vertical axis, depending on visual field size and gaze direction. Consistent with this prediction, participants experienced upwards deviations of self-motion when gaze through the periphery of the lens was simulated, but not for gaze through the center. We conclude that PALs may lead to illusions of self-motion which could be remedied by a careful gaze strategy.","691":"Tungsten disulfide (WS2) has tunable bandgaps, which are required for diverse optoelectronic device applications. Here, we report the bandgap modulation in WS2 monolayers with two-dimensional core-shell structures formed by unique growth mode in chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The core-shell structures in our CVD-grown WS2 monolayers exhibit contrasts in optical images, Raman, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The strain and doping effects in the WS2, introduced by two different growth processes, generate PL peaks at 1.83 eV (at the core domain) and 1.98 eV (at the shell domain), which is distinct from conventional WS2 with a primary PL peak at 2.02 eV. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations explain the modulation of the optical bandgap in our core-shell-structured WS2 monolayers by the strain, accompanying a direct-to-indirect bandgap transition. Thus, the core-shell-structured WS2 monolayers provide a practical method to fabricate lateral heterostructures with different optical bandgaps, which are required for optoelectronic applications.","692":"The question of whether terahertz (THz) waves can interact with ions in channels of nerve cells and cause a further reaction has attracted much attention. To answer this question, we investigate the spontaneous radiation generated by Ca2+ moving in calcium channels and the effect of THz radiation on the transport of Ca2+ by solving the mathematical physical model through Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations. It is obtained that the moving Ca2+ in a calcium channel can generate electromagnetic radiation, the corresponding spectrum of which is concentrated in the THz range. Meanwhile, both the ion number in the channel and the background temperature are proved to have significant effects on the spontaneous emission spectra. The studies also show that external THz radiation can accelerate Ca2+ transport through the ion channel. These results are expected to provide a theoretical basis for the future treatment of THz waves in the neurological field.","693":null,"694":null,"695":null,"696":"Monocytes continuously adapt their shapes for proper circulation and elicitation of effective immune responses. Although these functions depend on the cell mechanical properties, the mechanical behavior of monocytes is still poorly understood and accurate physiologically relevant data on basic mechanical properties are lacking almost entirely. By combining several complementary single-cell force spectroscopy techniques, we report that the mechanical properties of human monocyte are strain-rate dependent, and that chemokines can induce alterations in viscoelastic behavior. In addition, our findings indicate that human monocytes are heterogeneous mechanically and this heterogeneity is regulated by chemokine CCL2. The technology presented here can be readily used to reveal mechanical complexity of the blood cell population in disease conditions, where viscoelastic properties may serve as physical biomarkers for disease progression and response to therapy.","697":"Mangroves are halophytic plants belonging to diverse angiosperm families that are adapted to highly stressful intertidal zones between land and sea. They are special, unique, and one of the most productive ecosystems that play enormous ecological roles and provide a large number of benefits to the coastal communities. To thrive under highly stressful conditions, mangroves have innovated several key morphological, anatomical, and physio-biochemical adaptations. The evolution of the unique adaptive modifications might have resulted from a host of genetic and molecular changes and to date we know little about the nature of these genetic and molecular changes. Although slow, new information has accumulated over the last few decades on the genetic and molecular regulation of the mangrove adaptations, a comprehensive review on it is not yet available. This review provides up-to-date consolidated information on the genetic, epigenetic, and molecular regulation of mangrove adaptive traits.","698":"Brain development is a highly orchestrated process requiring spatiotemporally regulated mitochondrial dynamics. Drp1, a key molecule in the mitochondrial fission machinery, undergoes various post-translational modifications including conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO). However, the functional significance of SUMOylation\/deSUMOylation on Drp1 remains controversial. SUMO-specific protease 5 (Senp5L) catalyzes the deSUMOylation of Drp1. We revealed that a splicing variant of Senp5L, Senp5S, which lacks peptidase activity, prevents deSUMOylation of Drp1 by competing against other Senps. The altered SUMOylation level of Drp1 induced by Senp5L\/5S affects mitochondrial morphology probably through controlling Drp1 ubiquitination and tubulation of the endoplasmic reticulum. A dynamic SUMOylation\/deSUMOylation balance controls neuronal polarization and migration during the development of the cerebral cortex. These findings suggest a novel role of post-translational modification, in which deSUMOylation enzyme isoforms competitively regulate mitochondrial dynamics via Drp1 SUMOylation levels, in a tightly controlled process of neuronal differentiation and corticogenesis.","699":null,"700":"DNA repair enzymes are essential for the maintenance of the neuronal genome and thereby proper brain functions.

In this study, we identified a role of the DNA repair enzyme NEIL3 in modulating the maturation and function of hippocampal CA1 neurons by shaping the CA1 transcriptome during postnatal development and in association with spatial behavior. We observed a delayed maturation in Neil3 -\/- CA1 and identified differentially regulated genes required for hippocampal development. We revealed impaired spatial stability in Neil3 -\/- CA1 place cells and found spatial experience-induced gene expression essential for synaptic plasticity. This is the first study that links molecular underpinnings of DNA repair to the neural basis of spatial cognition beyond animals' behavioral phenotypes, thus shedding light on the molecular determinants enabling a stable neural representation of space.","701":null,"702":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\/frontotemporal dementia (ALS\/FTD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, and continued innovation is needed for improved understanding and for developing therapeutics.

We establish a new standard of large knockin allele quality control, demonstrating the utility of indirect capture for enrichment of a genomic region of interest followed by Oxford Nanopore sequencing. Extensive analysis shows that homozygous humanized animals only express human protein at endogenous levels. Characterization of humanized FUS animals showed that they are phenotypically normal throughout their lifespan. These humanized strains are vital for preclinical assessment of interventions and serve as templates for the addition of coding or non-coding human ALS\/FTD mutations to dissect disease pathomechanisms, in a physiological context.","703":null,"704":"To cope with the challenges presented by habitat degradation and loss, animals must often respond by adjusting physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Here we quantified physiological and behavioral traits, including body temperature and food consumption, of two mammals with differing thermoregulatory strategies in response to changes in climate and habitat. We show that both species responded to challenging climatic conditions by increasing torpor use to save energy, yet their responses were impacted by varying vegetation levels. Sugar gliders decreased torpor use in a dense habitat likely due to a signal of greater food production and protection from predators. Conversely, eastern pygmy possums employed more torpor perhaps to build up fat reserves in anticipation of leaner times. Indeed, in dense habitat eastern pygmy possums did not alter food intake yet showed an increase in body mass, whereas sugar gliders consumed less food and lost body mass, revealing the large energetic savings provided by torpor.","705":null,"706":null,"707":"Existing methods of reducing carbon emissions on campus often require substantial investment, and the potential opportunities for carbon dioxide and energy savings in universities with existing infrastructure have not been considered in much detail. This work fills this gap by considering an indirect and soft demand response strategy, i.e., semester arrangement. To identify the optimal operational strategy of a realistic campus-level multi vector energy system (MES) in Scotland based on CO2 emissions, an original tool is presented. Two conclusions can be drawn safely from the case study. Firstly, changing the operational mode of the university could significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Secondly, considering the difference between average emission factor (AEF) and marginal emission factor (MEF) in the power grid, the different operational modes will bring different electricity\/heat demands and also affect carbon emissions.

The so-called RHINOS e-nose allows odor measurements with high spatial resolution, and its accuracy is only slightly worse than that of dynamic olfactometry. The device has been calibrated using odor samples collected in a WWTP in Spain over a period of six months and validated in the same WWTP three weeks after calibration. The promising results obtained support the suitability of the proposed instrument to identify the odor sources having the highest emissions, which may give a useful indication to the plant managers as regards odor control and abatement.","710":"Hydrogen crossover rate is an important indicator for characterizing the membrane degradation and failure in proton exchange membrane fuel cell. Several electrochemical methods have been applied to quantify it. But most of established methods are too rough to support follow-up applications. In this paper, a systematic and consistent theoretical foundation for electrochemical measurements of hydrogen crossover is established for the first time. Different electrochemical processes occurring throughout the courses of applying potentiostatic or galvanostatic excitations on fuel cell are clarified, and the linear current-voltage behavior observed in the steady-state voltammogram is reinterpreted. On this basis, we propose a modified galvanostatic charging method with high practicality to achieve accurate electrochemical measurement of hydrogen crossover, and the validity of this method is fully verified. This research provides an explicit framework for implementation of galvanostatic charging method and offers deeper insights into the principles of electrochemical methods for measuring hydrogen crossover.","711":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains a leading cause of infectious disease morbidity and mortality for which new drug combination therapies are needed. Combinations of respiratory inhibitors can have synergistic or synthetic lethal interactions with sterilizing activity, suggesting that regimens with multiple bioenergetic inhibitors could shorten treatment times. However, realizing this potential requires an understanding of which combinations of respiratory complexes, when inhibited, have the strongest consequences on bacterial growth and viability. Here we have used multiplex CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and Mycobacterium smegmatis as a physiological and molecular model for mycobacterial respiration to identify interactions between respiratory complexes. In this study, we identified synthetic lethal and synergistic interactions between respiratory complexes and demonstrated how the engineering of CRISPRi-guide sequences can be used to further explore networks of interacting gene pairs. These results provide fundamental insights into the functions of and interactions between bioenergetic complexes and the utility of CRISPRi in designing drug combinations.","712":null,"713":null,"714":null,"715":"Public antibody clonotypes shared among multiple individuals have been identified for several pathogens. However, little is known about the determinants of antibody \"publicness\". Here, we characterize the sequence and functional properties of antibodies from a public clonotype targeting the CD4 binding site on HIV-1 Env. Our results showed that HIV-1 specificity for the public antibodies studied here, comprising sequences from three individuals, was modulated by the VH, but not VL, germline gene. Non-native pairing of public heavy and light chains from different individuals suggested functional complementation of sequences within this public antibody clonotype. The strength of antigen recognition appeared to be dependent on the specific antibody light chain used, but not on other sequence features such as native-antibody or germline sequence identity. Understanding the determinants of antibody clonotype \"publicness\" can provide insights into the fundamental rules of host-pathogen interactions at the population level, with implications for clonotype-specific vaccine development.","716":"The complex 16p11.2 deletion syndrome (16pdel) is accompanied by neurological disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. We demonstrated that 16pdel iPSC differentiated neurons from affected people show augmented local field potential activity and altered ceramide-related lipid species relative to unaffected. FAM57B, a poorly characterized gene in the 16p11.2 interval, has emerged as a candidate tied to symptomatology. We found that FAM57B modulates ceramide synthase (CerS) activity, but is not a CerS per se. In FAM57B mutant human neuronal cells and zebrafish brain, composition and levels of sphingolipids and glycerolipids associated with cellular membranes are disrupted. Consistently, we observed aberrant plasma membrane architecture and synaptic protein mislocalization, which were accompanied by depressed brain and behavioral activity. Together, these results suggest that haploinsufficiency of FAM57B contributes to changes in neuronal activity and function in 16pdel syndrome through a crucial role for the gene in lipid metabolism.","717":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102877.].","718":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102125.].","719":"The neocortex has a globally encompassing network structure, which for each given input constrains the possible combinations of neuronal activations across it. Hence, its network contains solutions. But in addition, the cortex has an ever-changing multidimensional internal state, causing each given input to result in a wide range of specific neuronal activations. Here we use intracellular recordings in somatosensory cortex (SI) neurons of anesthetized rats to show that remote, subthreshold intracortical electrical perturbation can impact such constraints on the responses to a set of spatiotemporal tactile input patterns. Whereas each given input pattern normally induces a wide set of preferred response states, when combined with cortical perturbation response states that did not otherwise occur were induced and consequently made other response states less likely. The findings indicate that the physiological network structure can dynamically change as the state of any given cortical region changes, thereby enabling a rich, multifactorial, perceptual capability.","720":"Single biomolecule sensing often requires the quantification of multiple fluorescent species. Here, we theoretically and experimentally use time-resolved fluorescence via Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) to accurately quantify fluorescent species with similar chromatic signatures. A modified maximum likelihood estimator is introduced to include two fluorophore species, with compensation of the instrument response function. We apply this algorithm to simulated data of a simplified two-fluorescent species model, as well as to experimental data of fluorophores' mixtures and to a model protein, doubly labeled with different fluorophores' ratio. We show that 100 to 200 photons per fluorophore, in a 10-ms timescale, are sufficient to provide an accurate estimation of the dyes' ratio on the model protein. Our results provide estimation for the desired photon integration time toward implementation of TCSPC in systems with fast occurring events, such as translocation of biomolecules through nanopores or single-molecule burst analyses experiments.","721":null,"722":"Observations of black hole X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei indicate that the accretion flows around black holes are composed of hot and cold gas, which have been theoretically described in terms of either a hot geometrically thick corona lying above and below a cold geometrically thin disk or an inner advection dominated accretion flow connected to an outer thin disk.

Autoantibodies and disease were healed by anti-DOCK8 antibody in the mice including SLE-model (NZBxNZW) F1 mice. Thus, DOCK8+Tfh cells generated after repeated TCR stimulation by immunogenic form of pathogen, either exogenous or endogenous, in combination with HLA to levels that surpass system's self-organized criticality, cause SLE.","727":"Ataxin-2 (Atx2) is a highly conserved RNA binding protein. Atx2 undergoes polyglutamine expansion leading to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2). However, the physiological functions of Atx2 in neurons remain unknown. Here, using the powerful genetics of Drosophila, we show that Atx2 is essential for normal neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics and organelle trafficking. Upon neuron-specific Atx2 loss, the microtubule and actin networks were abnormally stabilized and cargo transport was drastically inhibited. Depletion of Atx2 caused multiple morphological defects in the nervous system of third instar larvae. These include reduced brain size, impaired axon development, and decreased dendrite outgrowth. Defects in the nervous system caused loss of the ability to crawl and lethality at the pupal stage. Taken together, these data mark Atx2 as a major regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and denote Atx2 as an essential gene in neurodevelopment, as well as a neurodegenerative factor.","728":null,"729":"Current technological advances in neural probing and modulation have enabled an extraordinary glimpse into the intricacies of the nervous system. Particularly, nanomaterials are proving to be an incredibly versatile platform for neurological applications owing to their biocompatibility, tunability, highly specific targeting and sensing, and long-term chemical stability. Among the most desirable nanomaterials for neuroengineering, freestanding nanomaterials are minimally invasive and remotely controlled. This review outlines the most recent developments of freestanding nanomaterials that operate on the neuronal interface. First, the different nanomaterials and their mechanisms for modulating neurons are explored to provide a basis for how freestanding nanomaterials operate. Then, the three main applications of subcellular neuronal engineering-modulating neuronal behavior, exploring fundamental neuronal mechanism, and recording neuronal signal-are highlighted with specific examples of current advancements. Finally, we conclude with our perspective on future nanomaterial designs and applications.","730":"Rapid, terawatt-scale deployment of photovoltaic (PV) modules is required to decarbonize the energy sector. Despite efficiency and manufacturing improvements, material demand will increase, eventually resulting in waste as deployed modules reach end of life. Circular choices for decommissioned modules could reduce waste and offset virgin materials. We present PV ICE, an open-source python framework using modern reliability data, which tracks module material flows throughout PV life cycles. We provide dynamic baselines capturing PV module and material evolution. PV ICE includes multimodal end of life, circular pathways, and manufacturing losses. We present a validation of the framework and a sensitivity analysis. Results show that manufacturing efficiencies strongly affect material demand, representing &gt;20% of the 9 million tons of waste cumulatively expected by 2050. Reliability and circular pathways represent the best opportunities to reduce waste by 56% while maintaining installed capacity. Shorter-lived modules generate 81% more waste and reduce 2050 capacity by 6%.","731":"Terahertz (THz) waves are ranged between microwave and infrared region in the electromagnetic spectrum. THz technology has been demonstrated promising potential for biomedical applications. Exploration of biological effects of THz waves has emerged as a critical new area in life sciences. It is critical to uncover the effects of THz waves on complex biological systems in order to lay out the framework for THz technology development and future applications. Specifically, THz radiation has been shown to affect the nervous system, including the structure of nerve cell membranes, genes expressions, and cytokines level. In this review, we primarily discuss the biological impacts and mechanisms of THz waves on the nervous system at the organisms, cellular, and molecular levels. The future application perspectives of THz technologies in neuroscience are also highlighted and proposed.","732":null,"733":"The COVID-19 outbreak poses a serious threat to global public health. Effective countermeasures and approved therapeutics are desperately needed. In this study, we screened a small molecule library containing the NCI-DTP compounds to identify molecules that can prevent SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. By applying a luciferase assay-based screening using a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2-mediated cell entry assay, we identified a small molecule compound Q34 that can efficiently block cellular entry of the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 into human ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells, and inhibit the infection of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 in human ACE2-expressing HEK293T cells, human iPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes, and human lung Calu-3 cells. Importantly, the safety profile of the compound is favorable. There is no obvious toxicity observed in uninfected cells treated with the compound. Thus, this compound holds great potential as both prophylactics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and future pandemics by blocking the entry of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses into human cells.","734":"Human respiratory viruses are of vastly different virulence, giving rise to symptoms ranging from common cold to severe pneumonia or even death. Although this most likely impacts molecular evolution of the corresponding viruses, the specific differences in their evolutionary patterns remain largely unknown. By comparing structural and nonstructural genes within respiratory viruses, greater similarities in codon usage bias (CUB) between nonstructural genes and humans were observed in weakly virulent viruses, whereas in strongly virulent viruses, it was structural genes whose CUBs were more similar to that of humans. Further comparisons between genomes of weakly and strongly virulent coronaviruses revealed greater similarities in CUBs between strongly virulent viruses and humans. Finally, using phylogenetic independent contrasts, dissimilation of viral CUB from that of humans was observed in SARS-CoV-2. Our work revealed distinct CUB evolutionary patterns between weakly and strongly virulent viruses, a previously unrecognized interaction between CUB and virulence in respiratory viruses.","735":"Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (CC) drive COVID-19 pathology. Yet, patients with similar circulating CC levels present with different disease severity. Here, we determined 171 microRNAomes from 58 hospitalized COVID-19 patients (Cohort 1) and levels of 25 cytokines and chemokines (CC) in the same samples. Combining microRNA (miRNA) and CC measurements allowed for discrimination of severe cases with greater accuracy than using miRNA or CC levels alone. Severity group-specific associations between miRNAs and COVID-19-associated CC (e.g., IL6, CCL20) or clinical hallmarks of COVID-19 (e.g., neutrophilia, hypoalbuminemia) separated patients with similar CC levels but different disease severity. Analysis of an independent cohort of 108 patients from a different center (Cohort 2) demonstrated feasibility of CC\/miRNA profiling in leftover hospital blood samples with similar severe disease CC and miRNA profiles, and revealed CCL20, IL6, IL10, and miR-451a as key correlates of fatal COVID-19. These findings highlight that systemic miRNA\/CC networks underpin severe COVID-19.","736":null,"737":null,"738":"The developing gut microbiome in infancy plays a key role in shaping the host immune system and metabolic state, and human milk is the main factor influencing its composition. Human milk does not only serve to feed the baby, but also to help the new-born adapt to its new environment and microbial exposures. Human milk protects the infant by providing multiple bioactive molecules, including human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are the third most abundant solid component after lipids and lactose. The infant is unable to digest HMOs, so they reach the small and large intestines intact where they have many roles, including acting as prebiotics. Bifidobacterium spp. are the main, but not the only, commensals equipped with genes for HMO degradation. In this review we will outline the HMOs structures and functions, list the genes needed for their digestion, and describe the main strategies adopted by bacteria for their utilization.","739":null,"740":"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common complications of diabetes without effective treatment options. Its pathogenesis is complex and remains unclear. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) MIAT allele has been reported to be enriched in DCM patients and activate a pyroptosis program in hypoxia-induced H9c2 cells. Thus, whether MIAT played a role in DCM pyroptosis remains to be clarified. In the study, the expression of MIAT was found elevated in the serum of diabetic patients, as well as in high-glucose induced cardiomyocytes and diabetic mice. Further, the expression levels of CASP1 and pyroptosis correlation factors (IL-1 and IL-18) were downregulated after silencing MIAT. Through modeling and validation experiments, we then confirmed that the MIAT-miR-214-3p-CASP1 axis serves as an essential point in pyroptosis of DCM mice. These results suggested that silencing MIAT would be a potential treatment strategy for DCM.","741":null,"742":null,"743":null,"744":null,"745":"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides structural and functional information, but it did not probe chemistry. Chemical information could help improve specificity of detection. Herein, we introduce a general method based on a modular design to construct a molecular building block Xe probe to help image intracellular biothiols (glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy)), the abnormal content of which is related to various diseases. This molecular building block possesses a high signal-to-noise ratio and no background signal effects. Its detection threshold was 100 pM, which enabled detection of intracellular biothiols in live cells. The construction strategy can be easily extended to the detection of any other biomolecule or biomarker. This modular design strategy promotes efficiency of development of low-cost multifunctional probes that can be combined with other readout parameters, such as optical readouts, to complement 129Xe MRI to usher in new capabilities for molecular imaging.","746":"Sensors are ubiquitous in modern society because of their wide applications in healthcare, security, forensic industries as well as environmental protection. Specifically, sensors which can be microfabricated employing very-large-scale-integration (VLSI) compatible microfabrication techniques are particularly desirable. This is because they can provide several advantages: small size, low cost, and possibility of mass fabrication. 2D materials are a promising building block for such sensors. Their atomically thin nature, flat surfaces and ability to form van der Waals hetero junctions opens up the pathway for versatile functionalities. Here, we review 2D material-based field-effect-transistors (FETs) and nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMs) for applications in detecting different gases, chemicals, and biomolecules. We will provide insights into the unique advantages of these materials for these sensing applications and discuss the fabrication methods, detection schemes and performance pertaining to these technologies. Finally, we will discuss the current challenges and prospects for this field.","747":"Bodily self-consciousness has been considered a sensorimotor root of self-consciousness. If this is the case, how does sensorimotor memory, which is important for the prediction of sensory consequences of volitional actions, influence awareness of bodily self-consciousness? This question is essential for understanding the effective acquisition and recovery of self-consciousness following its impairment, but it has remained unexamined. Here, we investigated how body ownership and agency recovered following body schema distortion in a virtual reality environment along with two kinds of motor memories: memories that were rapidly updated and memories that were gradually updated. We found that, although agency and body ownership recovered in parallel, the recovery of body ownership was predicted by fast memories and that of agency was predicted by slow memories. Thus, the bodily self was represented in multiple motor memories with different dynamics. This finding demystifies the controversy about the causal relationship between body ownership and agency.","748":null,"749":null,"750":null,"751":null,"752":"Competition for social influence is a major force shaping societies, from baboons guiding their troop in different directions, to politicians competing for voters, to influencers competing for attention on social media. Social influence is invariably a competitive exercise with multiple influencers competing for it. We study which strategy maximizes social influence under competition. Applying game theory to a scenario where two advisers compete for the attention of a client, we find that the rational solution for advisers is to communicate truthfully when favored by the client, but to lie when ignored. Across seven pre-registered studies, testing 802 participants, such a strategic adviser consistently outcompeted an honest adviser. Strategic dishonesty outperformed truth-telling in swaying individual voters, the majority vote in anonymously voting groups, and the consensus vote in communicating groups. Our findings help explain the success of political movements that thrive on disinformation, and vocal underdog politicians with no credible program.","753":"CircRNAs belong to a family of RNA molecules which are conserved in evolution, have tissue-specific expression, and are abundant in neuronal cells. Here, we define several features of circ-Hdgfrp3 and describe interesting alterations occurring in motor neurons (MNs) carrying ALS-associated FUS mutations. Through a highly sensitive in situ approach we describe that circ-Hdgfrp3 traffics along neurites, while upon oxidative stress it is retained in the perinuclear region. While in wild-type stressed MNs, circ-Hdgfrp3 localizes in stress granules (SGs), in MNs carrying mutant FUS, a higher proportion of circ-Hdgfrp3 was trapped into cytoplasmic aggregates. Upon stress removal, circ-Hdgfrp3 was easily freed from SGs whereas it was less efficiently released from FUS-aggregates. We found that the human circ-Hdgfrp3 counterpart was also similarly associated to mutant FUS-aggregates in stressed neuronal cells. Overall, the alteration of circ-Hdgfrp3 trafficking adds a further layer of complexity to the role of FUS-aggregates in ALS disease.","754":"To understand various intranuclear functions, it is important to know when, what, and how proteins enter the nucleus. Although many methods and commercial kits for nuclear fractionation have been developed, there are still no methods for obtaining a complete nuclear proteome. Soluble nuclear proteins are often lost during fractionation. We developed remarkably improved methods to obtain nuclear soluble fractions by optimizing the conditions of selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane. As a result, 10 million cells could be separated into the cytoplasmic and nuclear soluble fractions more precisely in a 1.5-mL test tube. Moreover, the addition of an inhibitor to prevent leakage from the nucleus retained small proteins in the nucleus. Because of the simple protocols and easy application for multiple samples, our methods are expected to be applied to various studies on spatiotemporal changes of dynamic nuclear proteins, such as signal transduction.","755":"Cognitive flexibility is essential to achieve higher level goals. Cognitive theories assume that the activation\/deactivation of goals and task rules is central to understand cognitive flexibility. However, how this activation\/deactivation dynamic is implemented on a neurophysiological level is unclear. Using EEG-based multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods, we show that activation of relevant information occurs parallel in time at multiple levels in the neurophysiological signal containing aspects of stimulus-related processing, response selection, and motor response execution, and relates to different brain regions. The intensity with which task sets are activated and processed dynamically decreases and increases. The temporal stability of these activations could, however, hardly explain behavioral performance. Instead, task set deactivation processes associated with left orbitofrontal regions and inferior parietal regions selectively acting on motor response task sets are relevant. The study shows how propositions from cognitive theories stressing the importance task set activation\/deactivation during cognitive flexibility are implemented on a neurophysiological level.","756":null,"757":"The disruption of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a promising anti-cancer strategy, but its effective targeting for solid tumors remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anti-cancer activity of the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor intervenolin (ITV), which modulates the TME independent of energy depletion. By modulating lactate metabolism, ITV induced the concomitant acidification of the intra- and extracellular environment, which synergistically suppressed S6K1 activity in cancer cells through protein phosphatase-2A-mediated dephosphorylation via G-protein-coupled receptor(s). Other complex I inhibitors including metformin and rotenone were also found to exert the same effect through an energy depletion-independent manner as ITV. In mouse and patient-derived xenograft models, ITV was found to suppress tumor growth and its mode of action was further confirmed. The TME is usually acidic owing to glycolytic cancer cell metabolism, and this condition is more susceptible to complex I inhibitors. Thus, we have demonstrated a potential treatment strategy for solid tumors.","758":"Driven by expanding interest in battery storage solutions and the success story of lithium-ion batteries, the research for the discovery and optimization of new battery materials and concepts is at peak. The generation of experimental (dis)charge data using coin cells is fast and feasible and proves to be a favorite practice in the battery research labs. The quantitative interpretation of the data, however, is not trivial and decelerates the process of screening and optimization of electrode materials and recipes. Here, we introduce the concept of polarographic map and demonstrate how it can be leveraged to quantify the contribution of different non-equilibrium phenomena to the performance limitation and total polarization of a lithium-ion cell. We showcase the accuracy and diagnostic power of this approach by preparing and analyzing the electrochemical performance of 54 sets of LiNixMnyCo1-x-yO2 electrodes with different formulations and designs discharged in a range of 0.2C-5C.","759":"This paper compares the relative cost of long-distance, large-scale energy transmission by electricity, gaseous, and liquid carriers (e-fuels). The results indicate that the cost of electrical transmission per delivered MWh can be up to eight times higher than for hydrogen pipelines, about eleven times higher than for natural gas pipelines, and twenty to fifty times higher than for liquid fuels pipelines. These differences generally hold for shorter distances as well. The higher cost of electrical transmission is primarily because of lower carrying capacity (MW per line) of electrical transmission lines compared to the energy carrying capacity of the pipelines for gaseous and liquid fuels. The differences in the cost of transmission are important but often unrecognized and should be considered as a significant cost component in the analysis of various renewable energy production, distribution, and utilization scenarios.","760":null,"761":null,"762":"Although the concepts underpinning green chemistry have evolved over the past 30 years, the practice of green chemistry must move beyond the environmental and human health-related roots of green chemistry towards a more systems-based, life cycle-informed, and interdisciplinary practice of chemistry. To make a transition from green to sustainable chemistry, one must learn to think at a systems level; otherwise green chemistry-inspired solutions are unlikely to be sustainable. This perspective provides a brief description of why the current situation needs to change and is followed by how life cycle thinking helps chemists avoid significant systems-level impacts. The transition from batch to continuous flow processing and novel approaches to isolation and purification provide a case for interdisciplinary collaboration. Finally, an example of end-of-useful-life considerations makes the case that systems and life cycle thinking from an interdisciplinary perspective needs to inform the design of new chemical entities and their associated processes.","763":"The loss of uterine epithelial progesterone receptor (PGR) is crucial for successful embryo implantation in both humans and mice. The two major isoforms PGRA and PGRB have divergent functions under both physiological and pathological conditions. The present study compares phenotypes and gene signatures of PGRA and PGRB in uterine epithelium using uterine epithelial-specific constitutively expressed PGRA or PGRB mouse models. The cistrome and transcriptome analysis reveals substantial overlap between epithelial PGRA and PGRB, and both disrupt embryo implantation through FOXO1 pathways. Constitutive epithelial PGRA and PGRB expression impairs ESR1 occupancy at the promoter of Lif leading to reduced Lif transcription and further exaggerates SGK1 expression leading to enhanced PI3K-SGK1 activities, and both contribute to the decline of nuclear FOXO1 expression. Our study demonstrates that PGRA and PGRB in the uterine epithelium act on a similar set of target genes and commonly regulate the LIF-SGK1-FOXO1 signaling pathway for embryo implantation.","764":"Reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOFC) is an energy device that flexibly interchanges between electrical and chemical energy according to people's life and production needs. The development of cell materials affects the stability and cost of the cell, but also restricts its market-oriented development. After decades of research by scientists, a lot of achievements and progress have been made on RSOFC materials. According to the composition and requirements of each component of RSOFC, this article summarizes the research progress based on materials and discusses the merits and demerits of current cell materials in electrochemical performance. According to the efficiency of different materials in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC mode) and solid oxide electrolyzer (SOEC mode), the challenges encountered by RSOFC in the operation are evaluated, and the future development of RSOFC materials is boldly prospected.","765":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102427.].","766":"RNAs adopt various conformations to perform different functions in cells. Incapable of acquiring intermediates, the key initiations of ligand recognition in the adenine riboswitch have not been characterized. In this work, stopped-flow fluorescence was used to track structural switches in the full-length adenine riboswitch in real time. We used PLOR (position-selective labeling of RNA) to incorporate fluorophores into desired positions in the RNA. The switching sequence P1 responded to adenine more rapidly than helix P4 and the binding pocket, followed by stabilization of the binding pocket, P4, and annealing of P1. Moreover, a transient intermediate consisting of an unwound P1 was detected during adenine binding. These events were observed in both the WT riboswitch and a functional mutant. The findings provide insight into the conformational changes of the riboswitch RNA triggered by a ligand.","767":"Electric vehicles (EVs) are currently being promoted to reduce transport emissions. We present a life cycle assessment of EV charging behaviors based on marginal emissions factors. For Great Britain, we find that electricity consumption accounts for the highest proportion of life cycle carbon emissions from EVs. We highlight the potential life cycle carbon emissions reduction brought by charging during periods when the grid mix produces relatively low emissions. While our study focuses on Great Britain, we have applied our methodology to several European countries with contrasting electricity generation mixes. Our analysis demonstrates that countries with a high proportion of fossil energy will have reduced benefits from deploying EVs, but are likely to achieve increased benefits from smart charging approaches. We conclude that using marginal emissions factors is essential to understanding the greenhouse gas impacts of EV deployment, and that smart charging tied to instantaneous grid emissions factors can bring benefits.","768":"We produced oils via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of binary mixtures of biomass components (e.g., lignin, cellulose, starch) with different plastics and binary mixtures of plastics themselves. Cellulose, starch, and lignin demonstrated synergistic interactions (i.e., enhanced oil yields) with the plastics tested (polypropylene, polycarbonate, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate). Polystyrene exhibited synergy during HTL with the three other plastics as did polypropylene during HTL with PET or PC. We used the experimental results to develop the first component-additivity model that predicts the oil yields from HTL of biomass-plastic and plastic-plastic mixtures. The model accounts for interactions among and between biomass components and plastic components in sub-, near-, and supercritical water. The model predicts 88% of 48 published oil yields from HTL experiments with mixtures containing plastics to within 10 wt%.","769":null,"770":"Two-dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) with an alternating stacked structure of an organic layer and an inorganic layer draw significant attention for photovoltaics, multiple quantum-well, and passivation of three-dimensional perovskites. Although the low-cost and simple spin-coating process of these materials offers a vast platform to study fundamental properties and help them achieve rapid progress in electronics and optoelectronics, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is also necessary for large-area, epitaxial, selective, and conformal growth. Here, one-step CVD strategies for 2D OIHP growth are proposed, and the growth trends depending on the precursor and substrate conditions are discussed. We report a CVD-grown nontoxic, lead-free 2D tin-OIHP flake to show the system offering a universal route to synthesize perovskite crystals based on arbitrary organic and inorganic components.","771":null,"772":"Cells maintain their volume through fine intracellular osmolarity regulation. Osmotic challenges drive fluid into or out of cells causing swelling or shrinkage, respectively. The dynamics of cell volume changes depending on the rheology of the cellular constituents and on how fast the fluid permeates through the membrane and cytoplasm. We investigated whether and how poroelasticity can describe volume dynamics in response to osmotic shocks. We exposed cells to osmotic perturbations and used defocusing epifluorescence microscopy on membrane-attached fluorescent nanospheres to track volume dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution. We found that a poroelastic model that considers both geometrical and pressurization rates captures fluid-cytoskeleton interactions, which are rate-limiting factors in controlling volume changes at short timescales. Linking cellular responses to osmotic shocks and cell mechanics through poroelasticity can predict the cell state in health, disease, or in response to novel therapeutics.","773":"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in maintaining health. Monitoring the complex dynamics of its microbial population is, therefore, important. Here, we present a deep convolution network that can characterize the dynamic changes in the gut microbiota using low-resolution images of fecal samples. Further, we demonstrate that the microbial relative abundances, quantified via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, can be quantitatively predicted by the neural network. Our approach provides a simple and inexpensive method of gut microbiota analysis.","774":"Despite the advancements in material science and surgical techniques, the incidence of implant-associated infections (IAIs) has increased significantly. IAIs are mainly caused by microbial adhesion and biofilm formation on implant surfaces. In this study, we aimed to evaluate and critically discuss the antimicrobial efficacy of chitosan-based coatings to prevent the occurrence of IAIs. For this purpose, a PRISMA-oriented systematic review was conducted based on predefined criteria and forty studies were selected for qualitative analysis. Results indicated that chitosan (CS) association with enzymes and antimicrobial peptides improves its antimicrobial activity and extends its use in a broad range of physiological conditions. Likewise, CS association with polymers resulted in enhanced antimicrobial and anti-adhesive coatings with desirable properties, such as biocompatibility and durability, for implantable medical devices (IMDs). These findings can assist researchers in the design of new CS coatings for application in IMDs.","775":"Nowadays, wearable devices mainly exist in the form of portable accessories with various functions, connecting various kinds of terminals like mobile phones to form various wearable systems. In a wearable system, the wearable power supply device is the key component as energy dispenser for all devices. Nanosheets, a kind of two-dimensional material, which always displays a high surface-to-volume ratio and thus is lightweight and has remarkable conductive as well as electrochemical properties, have become the optimal choice for wearable power supply devices. The development and status of nanosheet-based wearable power supply devices including nanosheet-based wearable batteries, nanosheet-based wearable supercapacitors, nanosheet-based wearable self-powered energy suppliers are introduced in this article.

This paper elucidates biomolecular mechanisms of time derivative computation, facilitating the design of reliable synthetic differentiator devices for a variety of applications, ultimately expanding our understanding of cell behavior. In particular, we describe and analyze three alternative biomolecular topologies that are able to work as signal differentiators to input signals around their nominal operation. We propose strategies to preserve their performance even in the presence of high-frequency input signal components which are detrimental to the performance of most differentiators. We find that the core of the proposed topologies appears in natural regulatory networks and we further discuss their biological relevance. The simple structure of our designs makes them promising tools for realizing derivative control action in synthetic biology.","778":null,"779":"Plant proteins exert effects of reducing cardio-cerebrovascular disease-related mortality partly via cholesterol-lowering, which was associated with gut microbiota. Here, we verify that there are significant differences in cholesterol levels among hamsters consuming different proteins. The decisive roles of gut microbiota in regulating host cholesterol are illustrated by the fact that the difference in serum cholesterol levels between hamsters feeding with pea protein and pork protein disappeared when treated with antibiotics. The results of cross-over intervention of pea and pork protein show that serum cholesterol levels are reversed with dietary exchange. The corresponding changes in microbiota suggest that Muribaculaceae are responsible for the inhibitory effect of pea protein on serum cholesterol level, whereas the opposite effect of pork protein is due to Erysipelotrichaceae. Moreover, pea protein supplement alters cecal metabolites including arginine\/histidine pathway, primary bile acid biosynthesis, short-chain fatty acids, and other lipid-like molecules involved in cholesterol metabolism.","780":"Along with the advancement in neural engineering techniques, unprecedented progress in the development of neural interfaces has been made over the past few decades. However, despite these achievements, there is still room for further improvements especially toward the possibility of monitoring and modulating neural activities with high resolution and specificity in our daily lives.

We highlight several preparation techniques and recent advancements in compositional engineering of TMDCs structure. We summarize different approaches for TMDCs such as doping and alloying with different materials, alloying with other 2D metals, and scrutinize the technological potential of these methods. Beyond that, we also highlight the recent significant advancement in preparing 2D quasicrystals and alloying the 2D TMDCs with MAX phases. Finally, we highlight the future perspectives for crystal engineering in TMDC materials for structure stability, machine learning concept marge with materials, and their emerging applications.","784":"Few studies have explored the association between SNPs and alterations in mRNA translation potential. We developed an approach to identify SNPs that can mark allele-specific protein expression levels and could represent sources of inter-individual variation in disease risk. Using MCF7 cells under different treatments, we performed polysomal profiling followed by RNA sequencing of total or polysome-associated mRNA fractions and designed a computational approach to identify SNPs showing a significant change in the allelic balance between total and polysomal mRNA fractions. We identified 147 SNPs, 39 of which located in UTRs. Allele-specific differences at the translation level were confirmed in transfected MCF7 cells by reporter assays. Exploiting breast cancer data from TCGA we identified UTR SNPs demonstrating distinct prognosis features and altering binding sites of RNA-binding proteins. Our approach produced a catalog of tranSNPs, a class of functional SNPs associated with allele-specific translation and potentially endowed with prognostic value for disease risk.","785":"Amplification of ubiquitin E3 ligase Smurf1 promotes degradation of PTEN leading to hyperactivation of the Akt\/mTORC1 pathway. However, inhibitors of this pathway have not hitherto yielded promising results in clinical studies because of strong drug resistance. Here, we investigated Smurf1 expression in various glioblastoma (GB) cell lines and patient tissues. The therapeutic efficacy of Smurf1 silencing and Torin1 treatment was assessed in GB cells and orthotopic mouse model. We found Smurf1 loss elevates PTEN levels that interrupt the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway activity. Cotreatment with Smurf1 silencing and mTORC1\/C2 inhibitor Torin1 remarkably decreased phosphorylation of Akt, and mTORC1 downstream targets 4EBP1 and S6K resulting in synergistic inhibitory effects. Smurf1 knockdown in orthotopic GB mouse model impaired tumor growth and enhanced cytotoxicity of Torin1. Together, these findings suggest a rational combination of Smurf1 inhibition and Torin1 as a promising new avenue to circumvent PI3K\/Akt pathway-driven tumor progression and drug resistance.","786":null,"787":"A design for genetically encoded counters is proposed via repressor-based circuits. An N-bit counter reads sequences of input pulses and displays the total number of pulses, modulo  2 N   . The design is based on distributed computation with specialized cell types allocated to specific tasks. This allows scalability and bypasses constraints on the maximal number of circuit genes per cell due to toxicity or failures due to resource limitations. The design starts with a single-bit counter. The N-bit counter is then obtained by interconnecting (using diffusible chemicals) a set of N single-bit counters and connector modules. An optimization framework is used to determine appropriate gate parameters and to compute bounds on admissible pulse widths and relaxation (inter-pulse) times, as well as to guide the construction of novel gates. This work can be viewed as a step toward obtaining circuits that are capable of finite automaton computation in analogy to digital central processing units.","788":"Recent findings indicate that changes underlying cancer onset and progression are not only attributable to changes in DNA structure and expression of individual genes but to changes in interactions among these genes as well. We examined co-expression changes in gene-network structure occurring during the onset and progression of nine different cancer types. Network complexity is generally reduced in the transition from normal precursor tissues to corresponding primary tumors. Cross-tissue cancer network similarity generally increases in early-stage cancers followed by a subsequent loss in cross-tissue cancer similarity as tumors reacquire cancer-specific network complexity. Gene-gene connections remaining stable through cancer development are enriched for \"housekeeping\" gene functions, whereas newly acquired interactions are associated with established cancer-promoting functions. Surprisingly, &gt;90% of changes in gene-gene network interactions in cancers are not associated with changes in the expression of network genes relative to normal precursor tissues.","789":"Protein AMPylation is a posttranslational modification with an emerging role in neurodevelopment. In metazoans two highly conserved protein AMP-transferases together with a diverse group of AMPylated proteins have been identified using chemical proteomics and biochemical techniques. However, the function of AMPylation remains largely unknown. Particularly problematic is the localization of thus far identified AMPylated proteins and putative AMP-transferases. We show that protein AMPylation is likely a posttranslational modification of luminal lysosomal proteins characteristic in differentiating neurons. Through a combination of chemical proteomics, gel-based separation of modified and unmodified proteins, and an activity assay, we determine that the modified, lysosomal soluble form of exonuclease PLD3 increases dramatically during neuronal maturation and that AMPylation correlates with its catalytic activity. Together, our findings indicate that AMPylation is a so far unknown lysosomal posttranslational modification connected to neuronal differentiation and it may provide a molecular rationale behind lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegeneration.","790":null,"791":"In metasurface-based ultra-compact image display, color-nanoprints, gray-imaging elements, and binary-pattern-imaging elements are three different types of nanoprints, implemented with different mechanisms of light manipulation.

Specifically, by decoupling spectrum and polarization-assisted intensity manipulations of incident light, the proposed metasurface appears as a dual-color nanoprint under a broadband unpolarized light source illumination, while simultaneously displaying an independent continuous gray image and another binary-pattern in an orthogonal-polarization optical setup with different polarization controls. Our approach can increase the system integration and security of metasurfaces, which can be of interest to many advanced applications such as data storage, optical information encoding, high-end optical anti-counterfeiting, and optical information hiding.","792":"Cells with mesenchymal stem cell properties have been identified in menstrual blood and termed menstrual blood-derived stem\/stromal cells (MenSCs). MenSCs have been proposed as ideal candidates for cell-based therapy in regenerative medicine and immune-related diseases. However, MenSCs identity has been loosely defined so far and there is controversy regarding their cell markers and differentiation potential. In this review, we outline the origin of MenSCs in the context of regenerating human endometrium, with attention to endometrial eMSCs as reference cells to understand MenSCs. We summarize the cell identity markers analyzed and the immunomodulatory and reparative properties reported. We also address the recent use of MenSCs in cell reprogramming. The main goal of this review is to contribute to the understanding of the identity and properties of MenSCs as well as to identify potential caveats and new venues that deserve to be explored to strengthen their potential applications.","793":null,"794":null,"795":null,"796":"Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a promising approach for the controllable synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Many studies have demonstrated that the morphology and structure of 2D materials are highly dependent on growth substrates. Hence, the choice of growth substrates is essential to achieve the precise control of CVD growth. Noble metal substrates have attracted enormous interest owing to the high catalytic activity and rich surface morphology for 2D material growth. In this review, we introduce recent progress in noble metals as substrates for the controllable growth of 2D materials. The underlying growth mechanism and substrate designs of noble metals based on their unique features are thoroughly discussed. In the end, we outline the advantages and challenges of using noble metal substrates and prospect the possible approaches to extend the uses of noble metal substrates for 2D material growth and enhance the structural controllability of the grown materials.","797":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the agent causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (Alpha), a WHO variant of concern first identified in the United Kingdom in late 2020, contains several mutations including P681H in the spike S1\/S2 cleavage site, which is predicted to increase cleavage by furin, potentially impacting the viral cell entry. Here, we studied the role of the P681H mutation in B.1.1.7 cell entry. We performed assays using fluorogenic peptides mimicking the Wuhan-Hu-1 and B.1.1.7 S1\/S2 sequence and observed no significant difference in furin cleavage. Functional assays using pseudoparticles harboring SARS-CoV-2 spikes and cell-to-cell fusion assays demonstrated no differences between Wuhan-Hu-1, B.1.1.7, or a P681H point mutant. Likewise, we observed no differences in viral growth between USA-WA1\/2020 and a B.1.1.7 isolate in cell culture. Our findings suggest that, although the B.1.1.7 P681H mutation may slightly increase S1\/S2 cleavage, this does not significantly impact viral entry or cell-cell spread.","798":"It is unclear why COVID-19 ranges from asymptomatic to severe. When SARS-CoV-2 is detected, interferon (IFN) response is activated. When it is insufficient or delayed, it might lead to overproduction of cytokines and severe COVID-19. The aim was to compare cytokine and IFN patterns in children and adults with differing severity with SARS-CoV-2.It was a prospective, observational study, including 84 patients. Patients with moderate\/severe disease had higher cytokines' values than patients with mild disease (p&lt; 0.001).Two IFN genes were selected to build a decision tree for severity classification: SOCS1 (representative of the rest of the IFN genes) and CIITA (inverse correlation). Low values of CIITA and high values of SOCS1 indicated severe disease. This method correctly classified 33\/38(86.8%) of children and 27\/34 (79.4%) of adults. To conclude, patients with severe disease had an elevated cytokine pattern, which correlated with the IFN response, with low CIITA and high SOCS1 values.","799":"Renewable forms of electricity generation like solar and wind require low-cost energy storage solutions to meet climate change deployment goals. Here, we explore the use of depleted hydraulically fractured (\"fracked\") oil and gas wells to store electrical energy in the form of compressed natural gas to be released to spin an expander\/generator when electrical demand is high. Our reservoir model indicates that the same dual-porosity geological environment of fracked wells used to liberate hydrocarbons is also suitable for storing and releasing gas in a diurnal or seasonal cycle. Round-trip storage efficiency is calculated to be 40%-70% depending on the natural reservoir temperature. Levelized cost of storage is estimated to be $70-270\/MWh, on par with pumped hydro storage. This study indicates that repurposed \"fracked\" wells could provide a much-needed low-cost seasonal energy storage solution at the TWh scale.","800":null,"801":"Group II self-splicing introns are large structured RNAs that remove themselves from transcripts while simultaneously sealing the resulting gaps. Some representatives can subsequently reverse splice into DNA, accounting for their pervasive distribution in bacteria. The catalytically active tertiary structure of each group II intron is assembled from six domains that are arranged in a conserved order. Here, we report structural isomers of group II introns, called CP group II ribozymes, wherein the characteristic order of domains has been altered. Domains five and six, which normally reside at the 3' end of group II introns, instead occupy the 5' end to form circularly permuted variants. These unusual group II intron derivatives are catalytically active and generate large linear branched and small circular RNAs, reaction products that are markedly different from those generated by canonical group II introns. The biological role of CP group II ribozymes is currently unknown.","802":"To achieve net-zero emissions, a particular interest has been raised in the electrochemical evolution of H2 by using catalysts. Considering the complexity of designing catalyst, we demonstrate a data-driven strategy to develop optimized catalysts for H2 evolution. This work starts by collecting data of Pt\/carbon catalysts, and applying machine learning to reveal the importance of ranking various features. The algorithms reveal that the Pt content and Pt size have the greatest impact on the catalyst overpotentials. Following the data-driven analysis, a space-confined method is used to fabricate the size-controllable Pt nanoclusters that anchor on nitrogen-doped (N-doped) mesoporous carbon nanosheet network. The obtained catalysts use less platinum and exhibit better catalytic activity than current commercial catalysts in alkaline electrolytes. Moreover, the data formed in this work can be used as feedback to further improve the data-driven model, thereby accelerating the development of high-performance catalysts.","803":"It has been 40 years since the report of long-term synaptic plasticity on the rodent brain. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) shows advantages in spatial resolution and penetration depth when compared with electrical or magnetic stimulation. The repetitive TUS (rTUS) can induce cortical excitability alteration on animals, and persistent aftereffects were observed. However, the effects of rTUS on synaptic plasticity in humans remain unelucidated. In the current study, we applied a 15-min rTUS protocol to stimulate left primary motor cortex (l-M1) in 24 male healthy participants. The single-pulsed transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked motor evoked potential and Stop-signal task was applied to measure the rTUS aftereffects. Here, we report that conditioning the human motor cortex using rTUS may produce long-lasting and statistically significant effects on motor cortex excitability as well as motor behavior, without harmful side effects observed. These findings suggest a considerable potential of rTUS in cortical plasticity modulation and clinical intervention for impulsivity-related disorders.","804":"The microbiota of Anopheles mosquitoes influences malaria transmission. Antibiotics ingested during a blood meal impact the mosquito microbiome and malaria transmission, with substantial differences between drugs. Here, we assessed if amoxicillin affects the gut mosquito microbiota. We collected Anopheles larvae in Burkina Faso, kept them in semi-field conditions, and offered a blood meal to adult females. We tested the impact of blood supplementation with two alternative amoxicillin preparations on microbiota composition, determined by high-throughput sequencing in individual gut samples. Our analysis detected four major genera, Elizabethkingia, Wigglesworthia, Asaia, and Serratia. The antibiotic treatment significantly affected overall microbiota composition, with a specific decrease in the relative abundance of Elizabethkingia and Asaia during blood digestion. Besides its interest on the influence of amoxicillin on the mosquito microbiota, our study proposes a thorough approach to report negative-control data of high-throughput sequencing studies on samples with a reduced microbial load.","805":null,"806":null,"807":"Li metal anodes are enticing for batteries due to high theoretical charge storage capacity, but commercialization is plagued by dendritic Li growth and short circuits when cycled at high currents. Applied pressure has been suggested to improve morphology, and therefore performance. We hypothesized that increasing pressure would suppress dendritic growth at high currents. To test this hypothesis, here, we extensively use cryogenic scanning electron microscopy to show that varying the applied pressure from 0.01 to 1 MPa has little impact on Li morphology after one deposition. We show that pressure improves Li density and preserves Li inventory after 50 cycles. However, contrary to our hypothesis, pressure exacerbates dendritic growth through the separator, promoting short circuits. Therefore, we suspect Li inventory is better preserved in cells cycled at high pressure only because the shorts carry a larger portion of the current, with less being carried by electrochemical reactions that slowly consume Li inventory.","808":"The COVID-19 pandemic revealed an urgent need for rapid profiling of neutralizing antibody responses and development of antibody therapeutics. The current Food and Drug Administration-approved serological tests do not measure antibody-mediated viral neutralization, and there is a need for standardized quantitative neutralization assays. We report a high-throughput two-step profiling approach for identifying neutralizing convalescent plasma. Screening and downselection for serum antibody binding to the receptor-binding domain are followed by quantitative neutralization testing using a chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus expressing spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in a real-time cell analysis assay. This approach enables a predictive screening process for identifying plasma units that neutralize SARS-CoV-2. To calibrate antibody neutralizing activity in serum from convalescent plasma donors, we introduce a neutralizing antibody standard reagent composed of two human antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV strains, including SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Our results provide a framework for establishing a standardized assessment of antibody-based interventions against COVID-19.","809":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein is essential for viral replication, making it a promising target for antiviral drug and vaccine development. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients exhibit an uncoordinated immune response; however, the underlying mechanistic details of this imbalance remain obscure. Here, starting from a functional proteomics workflow, we cataloged the protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, including an evolutionarily conserved specific interaction of N with the stress granule resident proteins G3BP1 and G3BP2. N localizes to stress granules and sequesters G3BPs away from their typical interaction partners, thus attenuating stress granule formation. We found that N binds directly to host mRNAs in cells, with a preference for 3' UTRs, and modulates target mRNA stability. We show that the N protein rewires the G3BP1 mRNA-binding profile and suppresses the physiological stress response of host cells, which may explain the imbalanced immune response observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","810":"Context-specific activities of transcription regulators (TRs) in the nucleus modulate spatiotemporal gene expression precisely. Using the largest ChIP-seq data and chromatin loops in the human K562 cell line, we initially interrogated TR cooperation in 3D chromatin via a graphical model and revealed many known and novel TRs manipulating context-specific pathways. To explore TR cooperation across broad tissue\/cell types, we systematically leveraged large-scale open chromatin profiles, computational footprinting, and high-resolution chromatin interactions to investigate tissue\/cell type-specific TR cooperation. We first delineated a landscape of TR cooperation across 40 human tissue\/cell types. Network modularity analyses uncovered the commonality and specificity of TR cooperation in different conditions. We also demonstrated that TR cooperation information can better interpret the disease-causal variants identified by genome-wide association studies and recapitulate cell states during neural development. Our study characterizes shared and unique patterns of TR cooperation associated with the cell type specificity of gene regulation in 3D chromatin.","811":"Deficiency of the serine hydrolase prolyl endopeptidase-like (PREPL) causes a recessive metabolic disorder characterized by neonatal hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and growth hormone deficiency. The pathophysiology of PREPL deficiency and the physiological substrates of PREPL remain largely unknown. In this study, we connect PREPL with mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative phosphorylation by analyzing its protein interactors. We demonstrate that the long PREPLL isoform localizes to mitochondria, whereas PREPLS remains cytosolic. Prepl KO mice showed reduced mitochondrial complex activities and disrupted mitochondrial gene expression. Furthermore, mitochondrial ultrastructure was abnormal in a PREPL-deficient patient and Prepl KO mice. In addition, we reveal that PREPL has (thio)esterase activity and inhibition of PREPL by Palmostatin M suggests a depalmitoylating function. We subsequently determined the crystal structure of PREPL, thereby providing insight into the mechanism of action. Taken together, PREPL is a (thio)esterase rather than a peptidase and PREPLL is involved in mitochondrial homeostasis.","812":null,"813":null,"814":"In cells, segregation allows for diverse biochemical reactions to take place simultaneously. Such intricate regulation of cellular processes is achieved through the dynamic formation and disassembly of membraneless organelles via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Herein, we demonstrate the light-controlled formation and disassembly of liquid droplets formed from a complex of polylysine (pLys) and arylazopyrazole (AAP)-conjugated single-stranded DNA. Photoswitchablility of droplet formation was also shown to be applicable to the control of chemical reactions; imine formation and a DNAzyme-catalyzed oxidation reaction were accelerated in the presence of droplets. These outcomes were reversed upon droplet disassembly. Our results demonstrate that the photoswitchable droplet formation system is a versatile model for the regulation of reactions through dynamic LLPS.","815":null,"816":"Every human somatic cell inherits a maternal and a paternal genome, which work together to give rise to cellular phenotypes. However, the allele-specific relationship between gene expression and genome structure through the cell cycle is largely unknown. By integrating haplotype-resolved genome-wide chromosome conformation capture, mature and nascent mRNA, and protein binding data from a B lymphoblastoid cell line, we investigate this relationship both globally and locally. We introduce the maternal and paternal 4D Nucleome, enabling detailed analysis of the mechanisms and dynamics of genome structure and gene function for diploid organisms. Our analyses find significant coordination between allelic expression biases and local genome conformation, and notably absent expression bias in universally essential cell cycle and glycolysis genes. We propose a model in which coordinated biallelic expression reflects prioritized preservation of essential gene sets.","817":null,"818":null,"819":null,"820":"Bispecific antibodies (Bispecifics) demonstrate exceptional clinical potential to address some of the most complex diseases. However, Bispecific production in a single cell often requires the correct pairing of multiple polypeptide chains for desired assembly. This is a considerable hurdle that hinders the development of many immunoglobulin G (IgG)-like bispecific formats. Our approach focuses on the rational engineering of charged residues to facilitate the chain pairing of distinct heavy chains (HC). Here, we deploy structure-guided protein design to engineer charge pair mutations (CPMs) placed in the CH3-CH3' interface of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of an antibody (Ab) to correctly steer heavy chain pairing. When used in combination with our stable effector functionless 2 (SEFL2.2) technology, we observed high pairing efficiency without significant losses in expression yields. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between CPMs and the sequence diversity in the parental antibodies, proposing a rational strategy to deploy these engineering technologies.","821":null,"822":"Retinoic acid (RA) signaling is an important and conserved pathway that regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, perturbed RA signaling is implicated in cancer initiation and progression. However, the mechanisms by which RA signaling contributes to homeostasis, malignant transformation, and disease progression in the intestine remain incompletely understood. Here, we report, in agreement with previous findings, that activation of the Retinoic Acid Receptor and the Retinoid X Receptor results in enhanced transcription of enterocyte-specific genes in mouse small intestinal organoids. Conversely, inhibition of this pathway results in reduced expression of genes associated with the absorptive lineage. Strikingly, this latter effect is conserved in a human organoid model for colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. We further show that RXR motif accessibility depends on progression state of CRC organoids. Finally, we show that reduced RXR target gene expression correlates with worse CRC prognosis, implying RA signaling as a putative therapeutic target in CRC.","823":null,"824":null,"825":null,"826":"Organoids mimic the physiologic and pathologic events of organs. However, no consensus on esophageal organoid (EO) culture methods has been reached. Moreover, organoid models reproducing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) initiation have been unavailable. Herein, we sought to develop an esophageal minimum essential organoid culture medium (E-MEOM) for culturing murine EOs and establishing an early ESCC model. We formulated E-MEOM to grow EOs from a single cell with clonal expansion, maintenance, and passage. We found that EOs cultured in E-MEOM were equivalent to the esophageal epithelium by histological analysis and transcriptomic study. Trp53 knockout and Kras G12D expression in EOs induced the development of esophageal squamous neoplasia, an early lesion of ESCC. Here we propose the new formula for EO culture with minimum components and the organoid model recapitulating ESCC initiation, laying the foundation for ESCC research and drug discovery.","827":null,"828":"The \"preconditioning effect\" in AKI is a phenomenon in which an episode of ischemia-reperfusion results in tolerance to subsequent ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, its relationship between DNA damage repair has not been elucidated. Here, we show the role of KAT5 in the preconditioning effect. Preconditioning attenuated DNA damage in proximal tubular cells with elevated KAT5 expression. Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injuries were exacerbated, and preconditioning effect vanished in proximal tubular-cell-specific KAT5 knockout mice. Investigation of tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) by MALDI-IMS and urinary adenosine revealed that preconditioning caused attenuated TGF at least in part via KAT5. In addition, K-Cl cotransporter 3 (KCC3) expression decreased in damaged proximal tubular cells, which may be involved in accelerated TGF following IR. Furthermore, KAT5 induced KCC3 expression by maintaining chromatin accessibility and binding to the KCC3 promoter. These results suggest a novel mechanism of the preconditioning effect mediated by the promotion of DNA repair and attenuation of TGF through KAT5.","829":null,"830":"Hepatic miRNA, miR-122, plays an important role in controlling metabolic homeostasis in mammalian liver. Intercellular transfer of miR-122 was found to play a role in controlling tissue inflammation. miR-122, as part of extracellular vesicles released by lipid-exposed hepatic cells, are taken up by tissue macrophages to activate them and produce inflammatory cytokines. Matrix metalloprotease 2 or MMP2 was found to be essential for transfer of extracellular vesicles and their miRNA content from hepatic to non-hepatic cells. MMP2 was found to increase the movement of the extracellular vesicles along the extracellular matrix to enhance their uptake in recipient cells. Inhibition of MMP2 restricts functional transfer of hepatic miRNAs across the hepatic and non-hepatic cell boundaries, and by targeting MMP2, we could reduce the innate immune response in mammalian liver by preventing intra-tissue miR-122 transfer. MMP2 thus could be a useful target to restrict high-fat-diet-induced obesity-related metaflammation.","831":"Maintaining the superhydrophobicity underwater offers drag resistance reduction, antifouling, anti-corrosion, noise reduction, and gas collection for boat hulls and submarine vehicles. However, superhydrophobicity typically does not last long underwater since the Cassie state is metastable. Here, we report a reversible and localized recovery of superhydrophobicity from the fully wetted state via air bubble spreading. Composed of sparse fluorinated chained nanoparticles, the submerged surface shows super-low energy barrier for bubble attachment. Especially the recovered plastron exhibits excellent longevity. Based on a simplified, truncated nanocone model, the dynamic spreading of bubbles is analyzed considering two basic parameters, i.e., surface geometric structure and surface energy (which appeared as intrinsic water contact angle). Numerical simulation results via COMSOL confirms the effect of geometric structure on bubble spreading. This investigation will not only offer new insights for the design of robust recoverable superhydrophobic surfaces but also broaden the applications of superhydrophobic coatings.","832":null,"833":"Humans are constantly influenced by others' behavior and opinions. Of importance, social influence among humans is shaped by reciprocity: we follow more the advice of someone who has been taking into consideration our opinions. In the current work, we investigate whether reciprocal social influence can emerge while interacting with a social humanoid robot. In a joint task, a human participant and a humanoid robot made perceptual estimates and then could overtly modify them after observing the partner's judgment. Results show that endowing the robot with the ability to express and modulate its own level of susceptibility to the human's judgments represented a double-edged sword. On the one hand, participants lost confidence in the robot's competence when the robot was following their advice; on the other hand, participants were unwilling to disclose their lack of confidence to the susceptible robot, suggesting the emergence of reciprocal mechanisms of social influence supporting human-robot collaboration.","834":"The desire toward decarbonization and renewable energy has sparked research interests in reactive CO2 separations, such as direct air capture that utilize electricity as opposed to conventional thermal and pressure swing processes, which are energy-intensive, cost-prohibitive, and fossil-fuel dependent. Although the electrochemical approaches in CO2 capture that support negative emissions technologies are promising in terms of modularity, smaller footprint, mild reaction conditions, and possibility to integrate into conversion processes, their practice depends on the wider availability of renewable electricity. This perspective discusses key advances made in electrolytes and electrodes with redox-active moieties that reversibly capture CO2 or facilitate its transport from a CO2-rich side to a CO2-lean side within the last decade. In support of the discovery of new heterogeneous electrode materials and electrolytes with redox carriers, the role of computational chemistry is also discussed.","835":"The obesity epidemic significantly contributes to overall morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is the gold standard treatment for obesity and metabolic dysfunction, yet the mechanisms by which it exerts metabolic benefit remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate a model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) in nonhuman primates (NHP) that mimics the complexity and outcomes in humans. We also show that VSG confers weight loss and durable metabolic benefit, where equivalent caloric intake in shams resulted in significant weight gain following surgery. Furthermore, we show that VSG is associated with early, weight-independent increases in bile acids, short-chain fatty acids, and reduced visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation with a polarization of VAT-resident immunocytes toward highly regulatory myeloid cells and Tregs. These data demonstrate that this strongly translational NHP model can be used to interrogate factors driving successful intervention to unravel the interplay between physiologic systems and improve therapies for obesity and metabolic syndrome.","836":"The structure of lithium (Li) metal anode, including the Li metal and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), is critical to the investigation of cycle stability or decay mechanisms. The three-dimensional (3D) visualization of Li metal and SEI, however, has not been demonstrated yet, owing to the lack of 3D characterization techniques and the susceptibility of Li metal anode toward oxygen, moisture, as well as electron beam. Herein, we introduce a successful 3D presentation of deposited Li metal and SEI established via low-dose cryogenic electron microscopy tomography. The Li metal anode is imaged in low-dose mode at different tilt angles and then aligned and reconstructed into a 3D image through an expectation-maximization algorithm. The spherical Li deposits and SEI are confirmed in the 3D tomography of Li metal anode. It is also discovered that the Li metal corrodes and SEI turns concave owing to possible self-discharge after long-time rest.","837":"Multisensory integration helps the brain build reliable models of the world and resolve ambiguities. Visual interactions with sound and touch are well established but vestibular influences on vision are less well studied. Here, we test the vestibular influence on vision using horizontally opposed motions presented one to each eye so that visual perception is unstable and alternates irregularly. Passive, whole-body rotations in the yaw plane stabilized visual alternations, with perceived direction oscillating congruently with rotation (leftward motion during leftward rotation, and vice versa). This demonstrates a purely vestibular signal can resolve ambiguous visual motion and determine visual perception. Active self-rotation following the same sinusoidal profile also entrained vision to the rotation cycle - more strongly and with a lesser time lag, likely because of efference copy and predictive internal models. Both experiments show that visual ambiguity provides an effective paradigm to reveal how vestibular and motor inputs can shape visual perception.","838":null,"839":"We hypothesize that dosage compensation of critical genes arises from systems-level properties for cancer cells to withstand the negative effects of aneuploidy. We identified several candidate genes in cancer multiomics data and developed a biocomputational platform to construct a mathematical model of their interaction network with micro-RNAs and transcription factors, where the property of dosage compensation emerged for MYC and was dependent on the kinetic parameters of its feedback interactions with three micro-RNAs. These circuits were experimentally validated using a genetic tug-of-war technique to overexpress an exogenous MYC, leading to overexpression of the three microRNAs involved and downregulation of endogenous MYC. In addition, MYC overexpression or inhibition of its compensating miRNAs led to dosage-dependent cytotoxicity in MYC-amplified colon cancer cells. Finally, we identified negative correlation of MYC dosage compensation with patient survival in TCGA breast cancer patients, highlighting the potential of this mechanism to prevent aneuploid cancer progression.","840":null,"841":null,"842":"Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic has altered electricity consumption can provide insights into society's responses to future shocks and other extreme events. We quantify changes in electricity consumption in 58 different countries\/regions around the world from January-October 2020 and examine how those changes relate to government restrictions, health outcomes, GDP, mobility metrics, and electricity sector characteristics in different countries. We cluster the timeseries of electricity consumption changes to identify impact groupings that capture systematic differences in timing, depth of initial changes, and recovery rate, revealing substantial heterogeneity. Results show that stricter government restrictions and larger decreases in mobility (particularly retail and recreation) are most tightly linked to decreases in electricity consumption, although these relationships are strongest during the initial phase of the pandemic. We find indications that decreases in electricity consumption relate to pre-pandemic sensitivity to holidays, suggesting a new direction for future research.","843":"Knowledge of the host-specific properties of the spike protein is of crucial importance to understand the adaptability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) to infect multiple species and alter transmissibility, particularly in humans. Here, we propose a spike protein predictor SPIKES incorporating with an inheritable bi-objective combinatorial genetic algorithm to identify the biochemical properties of spike proteins and determine their specificity to human hosts. SPIKES identified 20 informative physicochemical properties of the spike protein, including information measures for alpha helix and relative mutability, and amino acid and dipeptide compositions, which have shown compositional difference at the amino acid sequence level between human and diverse animal coronaviruses. We suggest that alterations of these amino acids between human and animal coronaviruses may provide insights into the development and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in human and other species and support the discovery of targeted antiviral therapies.","844":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019. Few studies have compared replication dynamics and host responses to SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines from different tissues and species. Therefore, we investigated the role of tissue type and antiviral genes during SARS-CoV-2 infection in nonhuman primate (kidney) and human (liver, respiratory epithelial, gastric) cell lines. We report different viral growth kinetics and release among the cell lines despite comparable ACE2 expression. Transcriptomics revealed that absence of STAT1 in nonhuman primate cells appeared to enhance inflammatory responses without effecting infectious viral titer. Deletion of RL-6 in respiratory epithelial cells increased viral replication. Impaired infectious virus release was detected in Huh7 but not Huh7.5 cells, suggesting a role for RIG1. Gastric cells MKN45 exhibited robust antiviral gene expression and supported viral replication. Data here provide insight into molecular pathogenesis of and alternative cell lines for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection.","845":"The golden hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection recapitulates key characteristics of COVID-19. In this work we examined the influence of the route of exposure, sex, and age on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in hamsters. We report that delivery of SARS-CoV-2 by a low- versus high-volume intranasal or intragastric route results in comparable viral titers in the lung and viral shedding. However, low-volume intranasal exposure results in milder weight loss, whereas intragastric exposure leads to a diminished capacity to regain body weight. Male hamsters, and particularly older male hamsters, display an impaired capacity to recover from illness and delayed viral clearance. These factors were found to influence the nature of the host inflammatory cytokine response but had a minimal effect on the quality and durability of the humoral immune response and susceptibility to re-infection. These data further elucidate key factors that impact pre-clinical challenge studies carried out in the hamster model of COVID-19.","846":"The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused tremendous healthcare burden worldwide. Our focus was to develop a practical and easy-to-deploy system to predict the severe manifestation of disease in patients with COVID-19 with an aim to assist clinicians in triage and treatment decisions. Our proposed predictive algorithm is a trained artificial intelligence-based network using 8,427 COVID-19 patient records from four healthcare systems. The model provides a severity risk score along with likelihoods of various clinical outcomes, namely ventilator use and mortality. The trained model using patient age and nine laboratory markers has the prediction accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, 95% CI: 0.77-0.82, and the negative predictive value NPV of 0.86, 95% CI: 0.84-0.88 for the need to use a ventilator and has an accuracy with AUC of 0.85, 95% CI: 0.84-0.86, and the NPV of 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96 for predicting in-hospital 30-day mortality.","847":null,"848":null,"849":"","850":null,"851":"Recently, thanks to its excellent opto-electronic properties, two-dimension topological insulator not only has attracted broad interest in fields such as tunable detectors and nano-electronics but also shall yield more interesting prospect in thermal management, energy conversion, and so on. In this work, the excellent near-filed radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) resulting from monolayer topological insulator (Bi2Se3) is demonstrated. The NFRHT of this system is mainly dominated by the strong coupling effect of the surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) between two Bi2Se3 sheets. Moreover, the non-monotonic dependence of the Fermi energy of Bi2Se3 on NFRHT is then discovered. It is indicated that the system can provide great thermal adjustability by controlling the Fermi energy, achieving a modulation factor of heat flux as high as 98.94%. Finally, the effect of substrate on the NFRHT is also explored. This work provides a promising pathway for the highly efficient thermal management.","852":"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are genetically complex and exhibit significant inter-patient heterogeneity in disease presentation and therapeutic response. Here, we show that mouse models of IBD exhibit variable responses to inhibition of MK2, a pro-inflammatory serine\/threonine kinase, and that MK2 inhibition suppresses inflammation by targeting inflammatory monocytes and neutrophils in murine models. Using a computational approach (TransComp-R) that allows for cross-species comparison of transcriptomic features, we identified an IBD patient subgroup that is predicted to respond to MK2 inhibition, and an independent preclinical model of chronic intestinal inflammation predicted to be non-responsive, which we validated experimentally. Thus, cross-species mouse-human translation approaches can help to identify patient subpopulations in which to deploy new therapies.","853":null,"854":null,"855":"The emerging cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has demonstrated its power and essential role in probing the beam-sensitive battery materials and delivering new insights.

This process is often driven through aberrant activation of Wnt signaling by mutations in components acting downstream of the receptor complex that unfetter tumor cells from the need for Wnts. Here we describe a class of colon cancer that does not depend on mutated core components of the Wnt pathway. Genetically blocking Wnt secretion from epithelial cells of such tumors results in apoptosis, reduced expression of colon cancer markers, followed by enhanced tumor differentiation. In contrast to the normal colonic epithelium, such tumor cells autosecrete Wnts to maintain their uncontrolled proliferative behavior. In humans, we determined certain cases of colon cancers in which the Wnt pathway is hyperactive, but not through mutations in its core components. Our findings illuminate the path in therapy to find further subtypes of Wnt-dependent colon cancer that might be responsive to Wnt secretion inhibitors.","858":"Nuclear transfer systems represent the efficient means to reprogram a cell and in theory provide a basis for investigating the development of endangered species. However, conventional nuclear transfer using oocytes of laboratory animals does not allow reprogramming of cross-species nuclei owing to defects in cell divisions and activation of embryonic genes. Here, we show that somatic nuclei transferred into mouse four-cell embryos arrested at the G2\/M phase undergo reprogramming toward the embryonic state. Remarkably, genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming is induced within a day, and ZFP281 is important for this replication-free reprogramming. This system further enables transcriptional reprogramming of cells from Oryx dammah, now extinct in the wild. Thus, our findings indicate that arrested mouse embryos are competent to induce intra- and cross-species reprogramming. The direct induction of embryonic transcripts from diverse genomes paves a unique approach for identifying mechanisms of transcriptional reprogramming and genome activation from a diverse range of species.","859":"Fibrosis-driven solid organ failure is an enormous burden on global health. Spiny mice (Acomys) are terrestrial mammals that can regenerate severe skin wounds without scars to avoid predation. Whether spiny mice also regenerate internal organ injuries is unknown. Here, we show that despite equivalent acute obstructive or ischemic kidney injury, spiny mice fully regenerate nephron structure and organ function without fibrosis, whereas C57Bl\/6 or CD1 mice progress to complete organ failure with extensive renal fibrosis. Two mechanisms for vertebrate regeneration have been proposed that emphasize either extrinsic (pro-regenerative macrophages) or intrinsic (surviving cells of the organ itself) controls. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that the Acomys genome appears poised at the time of injury to initiate regeneration by surviving kidney cells, whereas macrophage accumulation was not detected until about day 7. Thus, we provide evidence for rapid activation of a gene expression signature for regenerative wound healing in the spiny mouse kidney.","860":null,"861":"The health and economic impacts of extreme heat on humans are especially pronounced in populations without the means to adapt. We deployed a sensor network across 12 informal settlements in Makassar, Indonesia to measure the thermal environment that people experience inside and outside their homes. We calculated two metrics to assess the magnitude and frequency of heat stress conditions, wet bulb temperature and wet bulb globe temperature, and compared our in situ data to that collected by weather stations. We found that informal settlement residents experience chronic heat stress conditions, which are underestimated by weather stations. Wet bulb temperatures approached the uppermost limits of human survivability, and wet bulb globe temperatures regularly exceeded recommended physical activity thresholds, both in houses and outdoors. Under a warming climate, a growing number of people living informally will face potentially severe impacts from heat stress that have likely been previously overlooked or underestimated.","862":"","863":null,"864":null,"865":null,"866":"Cannabis sativa L. has been one of the oldest medicinal plants cultivated for 10,000 years for several agricultural and industrial applications. However, the plant became controversial owing to some psychoactive components that have adverse effects on human health. In this review, we analyzed the trends in cannabis research for the past two centuries. We discussed the historical transitions of cannabis from the category of herbal medicine to an illicit drug and back to a medicinal product post-legalization. In addition, we address the new-age application of immuno-suppressive and anti-inflammatory extracts for the treatment of COVID-19 inflammation. We further address the influence of the legal aspects of cannabis cultivation for medicinal, pharmaceutical, and biotechnological research. We reviewed the up-to-date cannabis genomic resources and advanced technologies for their potential application in genomic-based cannabis improvement. Overall, this review discusses the diverse aspects of cannabis research developments ranging from traditional use as herbal medicine to the latest potential in COVID-19, legal practices with updated patent status, and current state of art genetic and genomic tools reshaping cannabis biotechnology in modern age agriculture and pharmaceutical industry.","867":"Can we recover self-motion from vision? This basic issue remains unsolved since, while the human visual system is known to estimate the direction of self-motion from optic flow, it remains unclear whether it also estimates the speed. Importantly, the latter requires disentangling self-motion speed and depths of objects in the scene as retinal velocity depends on both. Here we show that our automatic regulator of walking speed based on vision, which estimates and maintains the speed to its preferred range by adjusting stride length, is robust to changes in the depths. The robustness was not explained by temporal-frequency-based speed coding previously suggested to underlie depth-invariant object-motion perception. Meanwhile, it broke down, not only when the interocular distance was virtually manipulated but also when monocular depth cues were deceptive. These observations suggest that our visuomotor system embeds a speedometer that calculates self-motion speed from vision by integrating monocular\/binocular depth and motion cues.","868":"Trifluoromethylated molecules have gained privileged recognition among the medicinal and pharmaceutical chemists. Sustainable photoredox- and electrochemical processes were employed to facilitate the relatively less explored radical cross-electrophile coupling to access trifluoromethyl- and allyl-substituted tert-alcohols. Reactions proceed through trifluoromethyl ketyl radical and allyl radical intermediates, which undergo challenging radical-radical cross-coupling. The developed transformations are mild and chemo-selective to give cross-coupled products and deliver a wide range of valuable trifluoromethyl- and allyl-containing tertiary alcohols. Both processes can also be applied for the synthesis of amine variant containing trifluoromethyl and allyl moiety, which is considered as amide bioisostere.","869":null,"870":null,"871":null,"872":null,"873":"Vaccines based on mRNA-containing lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a promising new platform used by two leading vaccines against COVID-19. Clinical trials and ongoing vaccinations present with varying degrees of protection levels and side effects. However, the drivers of the reported side effects remain poorly defined. Here we present evidence that Acuitas' LNPs used in preclinical nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine studies are highly inflammatory in mice. Intradermal and intramuscular injection of these LNPs led to rapid and robust inflammatory responses, characterized by massive neutrophil infiltration, activation of diverse inflammatory pathways, and production of various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The same dose of LNP delivered intranasally led to similar inflammatory responses in the lung and resulted in a high mortality rate, with mechanism unresolved. Thus, the mRNA-LNP platforms' potency in supporting the induction of adaptive immune responses and the observed side effects may stem from the LNPs' highly inflammatory nature.","874":null,"875":"Maintaining proteostasis is important for animal development. How proteostasis influences spermatogenesis that generates male gametes, spermatozoa, is not clear. We show that testis-specific paralog of ribosomal large subunit protein RPL39, RPL39L, is required for mouse spermatogenesis. Deletion of Rpl39l in mouse caused reduced proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells, malformed sperm mitochondria and flagella, leading to sub-fertility in males. Biochemical analyses revealed that lack of RPL39L deteriorated protein synthesis and protein quality control in spermatogenic cells, partly due to reduced biogenesis of ribosomal subunits and ribosome homeostasis. RPL39\/RPL39L is likely assembled into ribosomes via H\/ACA domain containing NOP10 complex early in ribosome biogenesis pathway. Furthermore, Rpl39l null mice exhibited compromised regenerative spermatogenesis after chemical insult and early degenerative spermatogenesis in aging mice. These data demonstrate that maintaining proteostasis is important for spermatogenesis, of which ribosome homeostasis maintained by ribosomal proteins coordinates translation machinery to the regulation of cellular growth.","876":"Recently identified proton-activated chloride channel (PAC) contains two transmembrane helices (S1-S2) and is involved in lysosome function, hypoxia adaption, stroke, and carcinogenesis. Although a PAC structure was recently resolved, its gating and activation mechanisms remained largely unknown. By the two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes, we found that the hydrophobicity of site 304 at fenestrations, but not that of neighbor sites, is important for maintaining PAC at a closed state at pH 7.5. When activated at acidic pH, PAC activity significantly increased with the hydrophilicity of site 307 within S2, but not with that of neighbor sites, suggesting that 307 acts as an activation gate. We identified six conserved protonatable residues critical for proton-induced activation, consistent with structural studies. Our study depicted a scheme in which proton binding induces conformational changes from the W304-controlled closed state at fenestrations to an activated state controlled by activation gate I307 in helix S2.","877":"The artificial ciliary motion has been known not to be hydrodynamically optimal, limiting their associated applications in the microscale flow domain. One of the major hurdles of contemporary artificial cilia is its structural rigidity, which restricts their flexibility. To address this issue, this work proposed a shape-programmable artificial cilia design with distinctive polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and magnetic segments distributed throughout the structure, which provided precise control for time-spatial modulation of the whole artificial cilia structure under external magnetic actuation. For the fabrication of the proposed multi-segment artificial cilia, a facile microfabrication process with stepwise mold blocking followed by the PDMS and magnetic composite casting was adopted. The hydrodynamic analysis further elucidated that the proposed artificial cilia beating induced significant flow disturbance within the flow field, and the associated application was demonstrated through an efficient mixing operation.","878":null,"879":null,"880":null,"881":"The retrosplenial cortex (RSC) is an area interconnected with regions of the brain that display spatial correlates. Neurons in connected regions may encode an animal's position in the environment and location or proximity to objects or boundaries. RSC has also been shown to be important for spatial memory, such as tracking distance from and between landmarks, contextual information, and orientation within an environment. For these reasons, it is important to determine how neurons in RSC represent cues such as objects or boundaries and their relationship to the environment. In the current work, we performed electrophysiological recordings in RSC, whereas rats foraged in arenas that could contain an object or in which the environment was altered. We report RSC neurons display changes in mean firing rate responding to alterations of the environment. These alterations include the arena rotating, changing size or shape, or an object being introduced into the arena.","882":null,"883":null,"884":"To address current unmet needs in terms of scalability and material biocompatibility for future photocrosslinking-based additive manufacturing technologies, emergent platform designs are in inexorable demand. In particular, a shift from the present use of cell-damaging UV light sources in light-based three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting methods demands new platforms. We adopted an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) microdisplay as a digital visible light modulator to create a 3D printing platform modality that offers scalability and multi-material capability while forgoing the need for UV photocrosslinking. We formulate biocompatible inks that are visible light-crosslinkable with relatively quick photoinitiation rates. We demonstrated successful attachment and rapid growth of primary human dermal fibroblast-adult (HDF-a) cells on biological substrates fabricated using the OLED platform. This platform incites new possibilities by providing a simple-yet-effective means for low-cost, high-throughput, and multi-material 3D fabrication of functional structures made of polymers, ceramic composites, and biomaterials.","885":"Cancer bioenergetics fuel processes necessary to maintain viability and growth under stress conditions. We hypothesized that cancer metabolism supports the repair of radiation-induced DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs). We combined the systematic collection of metabolic and radiobiological data from a panel of irradiated cancer cell lines with mathematical modeling and identified a common metabolic response with impact on the DSB repair kinetics, including a mitochondrial shutdown followed by compensatory glycolysis and resumption of mitochondrial function. Combining ionizing radiation (IR) with inhibitors of the compensatory glycolysis or mitochondrial respiratory chain slowed mitochondrial recovery and DNA repair kinetics, offering an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Mathematical modeling allowed us to generate new hypotheses on general and individual mechanisms of the radiation response with relevance to DNA repair and on metabolic vulnerabilities induced by cancer radiotherapy. These discoveries will guide future mechanistic studies for the discovery of metabolic targets for overcoming intrinsic or therapy-induced radioresistance.","886":null,"887":"The accumulation of ice will reduce the performance of the base material and lead to all kinds of damage, even a threat to people's life safety. Recent increasing studies suggest that superhydrophobic surfaces (SHSs) originating from nature can remove impacting and condensing droplets from the surface before freezing to subzero temperatures, and it can be seen that hydrophobic\/SH coating has good freezing cold resistance. But such anti-icing performances and developments in practical applications are restricted by various factors. In this paper, the mechanism and process of surface icing phenomenon are introduced, as well as how to prevent surface icing on SHS. The development of SH materials in the aspect of anti-icing in recent years is described, and the existing problems in the aspect of anti-icing are analyzed, hoping to provide new research ideas and methods for the research of anti-icing materials.","888":null,"889":"Medical procedures can disperse infectious agents and spread disease. Particularly, dental procedures may pose a high risk of disease transmission as they use high-powered instruments operating within the oral cavity that may contain infectious microbiota or viruses. Here we assess the ability of powered dental devices in removing the biofluid films and identified mechanical, hydrodynamic, and aerodynamic forces as the main underlying mechanisms of removal and dispersal processes. Our results indicate that potentially infectious agents can be removed and dispersed immediately after dental instrument engagement with the adherent biofluid film, while the degree of their dispersal is rapidly depleted owing to the removal of the source and dilution by the coolant water. We found that droplets created by high-speed drill interactions typically travel ballistically, while aerosol-laden air tends to flow as a current over surfaces. Our mechanistic investigation offers plausible routes for reducing the spread of infection during invasive medical procedures.","890":"Genomic data can facilitate personalized treatment decisions by enabling therapeutic hypotheses in individual patients. Mutual exclusivity has been an empirically useful signal for identifying activating mutations that respond to single agent targeted therapies. However, a low mutation frequency can underpower this signal for rare variants. We develop a resampling based method for the direct pairwise comparison of conditional selection between sets of gene pairs. We apply this method to a transcript variant of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in melanoma, termed ALKATI that was suggested to predict sensitivity to ALK inhibitors and we find that it is not mutually exclusive with key melanoma oncogenes. Furthermore, we find that ALKATI is not likely to be sufficient for cellular transformation or growth, and it does not predict single agent therapeutic dependency. Our work strongly disfavors the role of ALKATI as a targetable oncogenic driver that might be sensitive to single agent ALK treatment.","891":null,"892":null,"893":null,"894":"Plant epidermis are multifunctional surfaces that directly affect how plants interact with animals or microorganisms and influence their ability to harvest or protect from abiotic factors. To do this, plants rely on minuscule structures that confer remarkable properties to their outer layer. These microscopic features emerge from the hierarchical organization of epidermal cells with various shapes and dimensions combined with different elaborations of the cuticle, a protective film that covers plant surfaces. Understanding the properties and functions of those tridimensional elements as well as disentangling the mechanisms that control their formation and spatial distribution warrant a multidisciplinary approach. Here we show how interdisciplinary efforts of coupling modern tools of experimental biology, physics, and chemistry with advanced computational modeling and state-of-the art microscopy are yielding broad new insights into the seemingly arcane patterning processes that sculpt the outer layer of plants.","895":"The social environment of individuals affects various evolutionary and ecological processes. Their social environment is affected by individual and environmental traits. We assessed the effects of these traits on nodes and dyads in six layers of networks of Arabian babblers, representing different interaction types. Additionally, we tested how traits affect social niches in the multilayer networks using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimensionality reduction algorithm. The effect of group size and season was similar across network layers, but individual traits had different effects on different layers. Additionally, we documented assortativity with respect to individual traits in the dominance display and allopreening networks. The joint analysis of all six layers revealed that most traits did not affect individuals' social niches. However, older individuals occupied fewer social niches than younger ones. Our results suggest that multilayer social networks are an important tool for understanding the complex social systems of cooperative breeders and intragroup interactions.","896":null,"897":"Whether nonhuman species can change their communicative repertoire in response to socio-ecological environments has critical implications for communicative innovativeness prior to the emergence of human language, with its unparalleled productivity. Here, we use a comparative sample of wild and zoo-housed orangutans of two species (Pongo abelii, Pongo pygmaeus) to assess the effect of the wild-captive contrast on repertoires of gestures and facial expressions. We find that repertoires on both the individual and population levels are larger in captive than in wild settings, regardless of species, age class, or sampling effort. In the more sociable Sumatran species, dominant use of signals toward single outcomes was also higher in captive settings. We thus conclude that orangutans exposed to more sociable and terrestrial conditions evince behavioral plasticity, in that they produce additional innate or innovated signals that are highly functionally specific. These findings suggest a latent capacity for innovativeness in these apes' communicative repertoires.","898":"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited intellectual disability with a high risk for comorbid autism spectrum disorders. Since FXS is a genetic disease, patients are more susceptible to environmental factors aggravating symptomatology. However, this confounding interaction between FXS environmental and genetic risk factors is under-investigated. Here, Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice and the immune stimulus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to explore this interaction between FXS development and inflammation in microglia, the brain's primary immune cell. Our results demonstrate that Fmr1 KO and wild-type (WT) microglia are not different in inflammatory outcomes without LPS. However, Fmr1 KO microglia produces an elevated pro-inflammatory and phagocytic response following LPS treatment when compared to WT microglia. Our experiments also revealed baseline differences in mitochondrial function and morphology between WT and Fmr1 KO microglia, which LPS treatment exaggerated. Our data suggest an altered inflammatory mechanism in Fmr1 KO microglia implicating a gene and environment interaction.","899":"The differentiation of lymphatic progenitors is a crucial step in lymphangiogenesis. However, its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we found that noncanonical protease-activated receptor 1 (par1) regulates the differentiation of lymphatic progenitors in zebrafish embryos. Loss of par1 function impaired lymphatic differentiation by downregulating prox1a expression in parachordal lymphangioblasts and caused compromised thoracic duct formation in zebrafish. Meanwhile, the G protein gnai2a, a par1 downstream effector, was selectively required for lymphatic development in zebrafish, and its mutation mimicked the lymphatic phenotype observed in par1 mutants. Interestingly, mmp13, but not thrombin, was required for lymphatic development in zebrafish. Furthermore, analyses of genetic interactions confirmed that mmp13b serves as a par1 upstream protease to regulate lymphatic development in zebrafish embryos. Mechanistically, par1 promotes flt4 expression and phospho-Erk1\/2 activity in the posterior cardinal vein. Taken together, our findings highlight a function of par1 in the regulation of lymphatic differentiation in zebrafish embryos.","900":"The auditory system relies on local and global representations to discriminate sounds. This study investigated whether vision influences the development and functioning of these fundamental sound computations. We employed a computational approach to control statistical properties embedded in sounds and tested samples of sighted controls (SC) and congenitally (CB) and late-onset (LB) blind individuals in two experiments. In experiment 1, performance relied on local features analysis; in experiment 2, performance benefited from computing global representations. In both experiments, SC and CB performance remarkably overlapped. Conversely, LB performed systematically worse than the other groups when relying on local features, with no alterations on global representations. Results suggest that auditory computations tested here develop independently from vision. The efficiency of local auditory processing can be hampered in case sight becomes unavailable later in life, supporting the existence of an audiovisual interplay for the processing of auditory details, which emerges only in late development.","901":"Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and its heterostructures with graphene are widely investigated van der Waals (vdW) quantum materials for electronics, photonics, sensing, and energy storage\/transduction. However, their metal catalyst-based growth and transfer-based heterostructure assembly approaches present impediments to obtaining high-quality and wafer-scale quantum material. Here, we have presented our perspective on the synthetic strategies that involve direct nucleation of h-BN on various dielectric substrates and its heterostructures with graphene. Mechanistic understanding of direct growth of h-BN via bottom-up approaches such as (a) the chemical-interaction guided nucleation on silicon-based dielectrics, (b) surface nitridation and N+ sputtering of h-BN target on sapphire, and (c) epitaxial growth of h-BN on sapphire, among others, are reviewed. Several design methodologies are presented for the direct growth of vertical and lateral vdW heterostructures of h-BN and graphene. These complex 2D heterostructures exhibit various physical phenomena and could potentially have a range of practical applications.","902":null,"903":"Autonomously oscillating circadian clocks resonate with daily environmental (zeitgeber) rhythms to organize physiology around the solar day. Although entrainment properties and mechanisms have been studied widely and in great detail for light-dark cycles, entrainment to daily temperature rhythms remains poorly understood despite that they are potent zeitgebers. Here we investigate the entrainment of the chronobiological model organism Neurospora crassa, subject to thermocycles of different periods and fractions of warm versus cold phases, mimicking seasonal variations. Depending on the properties of these thermocycles, regularly entrained rhythms, period-doubling (frequency demultiplication) but also irregular aperiodic behavior occurs. We demonstrate that the complex nonlinear phenomena of experimentally observed entrainment dynamics can be understood by molecular mathematical modeling.","904":null,"905":null,"906":null,"907":null,"908":"Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) cause lethal endotoxemia if not rapidly cleared from blood circulation. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) systemically clear LPS by unknown mechanisms. We discovered that LPS clearance through LSEC involves endocytosis and lysosomal inactivation via Stabilin-1 and 2 (Stab1 and Stab2) but does not involve TLR4. Cytokine production was inversely related to clearance\/endocytosis of LPS by LSEC. When exposed to LPS, Stabilin double knockout mice (Stab DK) and Stab1 KO, but not Stab2 KO, showed significantly enhanced systemic inflammatory cytokine production and early death compared with WT mice. Stab1 KO is not significantly different from Stab DK in circulatory LPS clearance, LPS uptake and endocytosis by LSEC, and cytokine production. These data indicate that (1) Stab1 receptor primarily facilitates the proactive clearance of LPS and limits TLR4-mediated inflammation and (2) TLR4 and Stab1 are functionally opposing LPS receptors. These findings suggest that endotoxemia can be controlled by optimizing LPS clearance by Stab1.","909":"A single protein can be multifaceted depending on the cellular contexts and interacting molecules. LIN28A is an RNA-binding protein that governs developmental timing, cellular proliferation, differentiation, stem cell pluripotency, and metabolism. In addition to its best-known roles in microRNA biogenesis, diverse molecular roles have been recognized. In the nervous system, LIN28A is known to play critical roles in proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). We profiled the endogenous LIN28A-interacting proteins in NPCs differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using immunoprecipitation and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We identified over 500 LIN28A-interacting proteins, including 156 RNA-independent interactors. Functions of these proteins span a wide range of gene regulatory processes. Prompted by the interactome data, we revealed that LIN28A may impact the subcellular distribution of its interactors and stress granule formation upon oxidative stress. Overall, our analysis opens multiple avenues for elaborating molecular roles and characteristics of LIN28A.","910":"PBX1 is a transcription factor involved in diverse cellular functions including organ development, stem cell renewal, and tumorigenesis. PBX1 is localized at chr1q23.3, a frequently amplified chromosomal region, and it is overexpressed in many human malignancies. Cancer cells with elevated PBX1 signaling are particularly vulnerable to PBX1 withdrawal. We designed a series of small molecule compounds capable of docking to the interface between PBX1 and its cognate DNA target sequence. Among them, T417 is found to be a lead compound. In cell-based assays, T417 significantly suppressed self-renewal and proliferation of cancer cells expressing high levels of PBX1. T417 also re-sensitized platinum-resistant ovarian tumors to carboplatin. T417 did not affect healthy tissues likely due to their lower PBX1 expression levels. Therefore, targeting PBX-DNA interface can be a promising strategy for treating human tumors reliant on PBX1 for survival.","911":null,"912":null,"913":null,"914":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101422.].","915":"The current gold standard for classifying lupus nephritis (LN) progression is a renal biopsy, which is an invasive procedure. Undergoing a series of biopsies for monitoring disease progression and treatments is unlikely suitable for patients with LN. Thus, there is an urgent need for non-invasive alternative biomarkers that can facilitate LN class diagnosis. Such biomarkers will be very useful in guiding intervention strategies to mitigate or treat patients with LN. Urine samples were collected from two independent cohorts. Patients with LN were classified into proliferative (class III\/IV) and membranous (class V) by kidney histopathology. Metabolomics was performed to identify potential metabolites, which could be specific for the classification of membranous LN. The ratio of picolinic acid (Pic) to tryptophan (Trp) ([Pic\/Trp] ratio) was found to be a promising candidate for LN diagnostic and membranous classification. It has high potential as an alternative biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis of LN.","916":"The Krebs cycle enzyme fumarase, which has been identified as a tumor suppressor, is involved in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage response (DDR) in human, yeast, and bacterial cells. We have found that the overexpression of the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1p restores DNA repair in fumarase-deficient yeast cells. Nfs1p accumulates inactivating post-translational modifications in yeast cells lacking fumarase under conditions of DNA damage. Our model is that in addition to metabolic signaling of the DDR in the nucleus, fumarase affects the DDR by protecting the desulfurase Nfs1p in mitochondria from modification and inactivation. Fumarase performs this protection by directly binding to Nfs1p in mitochondria and enabling, the maintenance, via metabolism, of a non-oxidizing environment in mitochondria. Nfs1p is required for the formation of Fe-S clusters, which are essential cofactors for DNA repair enzymes. Thus, we propose that the overexpression of Nfs1p overcomes the lack of fumarase by enhancing the activity of DNA repair enzymes.","917":"Anthropology began in the late nineteenth century with an emphasis on kinship as a key factor in human evolution. From the 1960s, archaeologists attempted increasingly sophisticated ways of reconstructing prehistoric kinship but ancient DNA analysis has transformed the field, making it possible, to directly examine kin relations from human skeletal remains. Here, we retrieved genomic data from four Late Neolithic individuals in central China associated with the Late Neolithic Longshan culture. We provide direct evidence of consanguineous mating in ancient China, revealing inbreeding among the Longshan populations. By combining ancient genomic data with anthropological and archaeological evidence, we further show that Longshan society household was built based on the extended beyond the nuclear family, coinciding with intensified social complexity during the Longshan period, perhaps showing the transformation of large communities through a new role of genetic kinship-based extended family units.","918":null,"919":"The functional inactivation of tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) is closely related to the tumorigenesis of cancer. There are instances where the miRNA and the corresponding target both exist in a cell, but the target gene silencing do not occur as expected. Herein, we found that both miR-506 and its target CDK6 are highly co-expressed in lung cancer cells. Sequence analyses suggested that a miR-506 binding site (1648-1654) and a cis-element (1785-1795) for binding by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2\/B1 (HNRNPA2B1) are evolutionarily conserved and forms a stem structure in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of CDK6. Furthermore, HNRNPA2B1 can bind to the stem structure to denature it and recruit the RNA helicase DExH-box helicase 9 (DHX9) to the 3'UTR, which ultimately facilitates miRNAs-mediated CDK6 silencing. These results indicate that the cis-element of the 3'UTR of CDK6, where HNRNPA2B1 binds, serves as an RNA switch to regulate miRNAs' function in cancer cells.","920":null,"921":"Research on material synthesis is mostly performed through batch by batch testing with each corresponding to a set of parameters and a reaction time. Concurrent experiments that allow for multiple loadings throughout an inhomogeneous reaction zone provide a way to obtain high-throughput results. Here, a time-space conversion method is proposed. By sequentially passing a number of identical objects through a reaction zone, a significant diversity of reactions in one batch can be achieved depending on the spatial distribution and changes with time of the reaction zone. In particular, when the reaction zone is steady, the evolution of a reaction can be associated with the objects at their corresponding reaction stage. This greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of research on material synthesis kinetics. This method may initiate a new wave of material synthesis research and accelerate the development of material science.","922":null,"923":"Male moths utilize spatio-temporal female sex pheromone information to orient toward conspecific females. Pheromones are distributed as discontinuous plumes owing to air turbulence; thus, efficient tracking of intermittent stimuli is expected to require a high temporal resolution. Here, using pheromone binding protein (BmPBP1)-knockout silkmoths, we showed that a loss of functional PBP lowered the temporal sensory resolution of male antennae. This altered temporal resolution resulted in significantly reduced straight walking and longer turning behavior, which respectively occurred when males detected and lost contact with pheromones, indicating that temporal resolution was also lowered at the behavioral level. BmPBP1-knockout males required significantly longer time than wild-type males in locating pheromone sources and female moths. Our results suggest that BmPBP1 plays a critical role in determining olfactory response kinetics. Accordingly, high temporal olfactory and behavioral resolutions, as shaped by PBP, are essential for tracking pheromone plumes and locating females efficiently.","924":null,"925":"Deliberately optimizing the d-band position of an active component via electronic and lattice strain tuning is an effective way to boost its catalytic performance. We herein demonstrate this concept by constructing core-shell Au@NiPd nanoparticles with NiPd alloy shells of only three atomic layers through combining an Au catalysis with the galvanic replacement reaction. The Au core with larger electronegativity modulates the Pd electronic configuration, while the Ni atoms alloyed in the ultrathin shells neutralize the lattice stretching in Pd shells exerted by Au cores, equipping the active Pd metal with a favorable d-band position for electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction in an alkaline medium, for which core-shell Au@NiPd nanoparticles with a Ni\/Pd atomic ratio of 3\/7 exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.92 V, specific activity of 3.7 mA cm-2, and mass activity of 0.65 A mg-1 at 0.9 V, much better than most of the recently reported Pd-even Pt-based electrocatalysts.","926":"Human sensorimotor interaction requires mutual behavioral adaptation as well as shared cognitive task representations (Joint Action, JA). Yet, an under-investigated aspect of JA is the neurobehavioral mechanisms employed to stop actions if the context calls for it. Sparse evidence points to the possible contribution of the left dorsal premotor cortex (lPMd) in sculpting movements according to the socio-interactive context. To clarify this issue, we ran two experiments integrating a classical stop signal paradigm with an ecological JA task. The first behavioral study shows longer Stop performance in the JA condition. In the second, we use transcranial magnetic stimulation to inhibit the lPMd or a control site (vertex). Results show that lPMd modulates the JA stopping performance. Action stopping is an important component of JA coordination, and here we provide evidence that lPMd is a key node of a brain network recruited for online mutual co-adaptation in social contexts.","927":"A quarter of all seasonal influenza cases are caused by type B influenza virus (IBV) that also dominates periodically. Here, we investigated a recombinant adenovirus vaccine carrying a synthetic HA2 representing the consensus sequence of all IBV hemagglutinins. The vaccine fully protected mice from lethal challenges by IBV of both genetic lineages, demonstrating its breadth of protection. The protection was not mediated by neutralizing antibodies but robust antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and cell-mediated immune responses. Complete protection of the animals required the entire codon-optimized HA2 sequence that elicited a balanced immune response, whereas truncated vaccines without either the fusion peptide or the transmembrane domain reduced the efficacy of protection. Finally, the vaccines did not demonstrate any sign of disease exacerbation following lung pathology and morbidity monitoring. Collectively, these data suggest that it could be worth further exploring this prototype universal vaccine because of its considerable efficacy, safety, and breadth of protection.","928":null,"929":"Langerhans cells (LC) are skin-resident antigen-presenting cells that regulate immune responses to epithelial microorganisms. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection can promote malignant epithelial transformation. As LCs are considered important for controlling HPV infection, we compared the transcriptome of murine LCs from skin transformed by K14E7 oncoprotein and from healthy skin. We identified transcriptome heterogeneity at the single cell level amongst LCs in normal skin, associated with ontogeny, cell cycle, and maturation. We identified a balanced co-existence of immune-stimulatory and immune-inhibitory LC cell states in normal skin that was significantly disturbed in HPV16 E7-transformed skin. Hyperplastic skin was depleted of immune-stimulatory LCs and enriched for LCs with an immune-inhibitory gene signature, and LC-keratinocyte crosstalk was dysregulated. We identified reduced expression of interleukin (IL)-34, a critical molecule for LC homeostasis.

Early clinical trials in cancer have shown heterogeneous clinical responses, development of resistance, and adverse events. Increased understanding of their mechanism(s) of action and identification of biomarkers are needed to identify appropriate indication(s) and achieve efficacious dosing. Using genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens at different concentrations, we report molecular mechanisms defining cellular responses to BET inhibitors, some of which appear specific to a single compound concentration. We identify multiple transcriptional regulators and mTOR pathway members as key determinants of JQ1 sensitivity and two Ca2+\/Mn2+ transporters, ATP2C1 and TMEM165, as key determinants of JQ1 resistance. Our study reveals new molecular mediators of BET bromodomain inhibitor effects, suggests the involvement of manganese, and provides a rich resource for discovery of biomarkers and targets for combination therapies.","932":"Cardiolipin (CL) is a major cardiac mitochondrial phospholipid maintaining regular mitochondrial morphology and function in cardiomyocytes. Cardiac CL production includes its biosynthesis and a CL remodeling process. Here we studied the impact of CL biosynthesis and the enzyme cardiolipin synthase (CLS) on cardiac function. CLS and cardiac CL species were significantly downregulated in cardiomyocytes following catecholamine-induced cardiac damage in mice, accompanied by increased oxygen consumption rates, signs of oxidative stress, and mitochondrial uncoupling. RNAi-mediated cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of CLS in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in marked cardiac dilatation, severe impairment of systolic performance, and slower diastolic filling velocity assessed by fluorescence-based heart imaging. Finally, we showed that CL72:8 is significantly decreased in cardiac samples from patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). In summary, we identified CLS as a regulator of cardiac function. Considering the cardiac depletion of CL species in HFrEF, pharmacological targeting of CLS may be a promising therapeutic approach.","933":null,"934":"Since their identification, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Kappa and Delta have rapidly spread to become globally dominant. However, their infectivity and sensitivity to administered vaccines have not been documented. We monitored the neutralization potential of convalescent or BNT162b2 post-vaccination sera against Kappa and Delta SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. We show that both variants were successfully neutralized by convalescent and post-vaccination sera, exhibiting a mild decrease in their neutralization sensitivity. Of the two variants, Delta presented enhanced infectivity levels compared with Kappa or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, both variants were not as infectious or resistant to post-vaccination sera as the Beta variant of concern. Interestingly, the Delta plus variant (AY.1\/B.1.617.2.1) exhibited high resistance to post-vaccination sera, similar to that of the Beta SARS-CoV-2. However, its infectivity levels were close to those of wild-type SARS-CoV-2. These results account for the worldwide prevalence of Delta variant of concern and confirm the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine against circulating other Delta variants.","935":"We developed an intranasal vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the replication-incompetent human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV2) vector BC-PIV, which can deliver ectopic gene as stable RNA and ectopic protein on the envelope. BC-PIV expressing the full-length prefusion-stabilized spike gene (K986P\/V987P) of SARS-CoV-2, S-2PM, possessed a corona-like viral envelope. Intranasal vaccination of mice with BC-PIV\/S-2PM induced high levels of neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) and mucosal IgA antibodies against the spike protein. Although BC-PIV showed hemagglutinating activity, BC-PIV\/S-2PM lacked such activity, in accordance with the presence of the massive spike protein on the viral surface. Furthermore, single-dose intranasal vaccination of hamsters with BC-PIV\/S-2PM completely protected the lungs from SARS-CoV-2 at 11-week post-immunization, and boost vaccination two weeks before the challenge conferred virtually complete protection of the nasal turbinates against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this chimeric hPIV2\/spike intranasal vaccine is a promising vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 to curtail virus transmission.","936":"Glycosylation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike glycoprotein mediates viral entry and immune escape. While glycan site is determined by viral genetic code, glycosylation is completely dependent on host cell post-translational modification. Here, by producing SARS-CoV-2 virions from various host cell lines, viruses of different origins with diverse spike protein glycan patterns were revealed. Binding affinities to C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) DC&amp;L-SIGN differed in the different glycan pattern virions. Although none of the CLRs supported viral productive infection, viral trans&amp;cis-infection mediated by the CLRs were substantially changed among the different virions. Specifically, trans&amp;cis-infection of virions with a high-mannose structure (Man5GlcNAc2) at the N1098 glycan site of the spike postfusion trimer were markedly enhanced. Considering L-SIGN co-expression with ACE2 on respiratory tract cells, our work underlines viral epigenetic glycosylation in authentic viral infection and highlights the attachment co-receptor role of DC&amp;L-SIGN in SARS-CoV-2 infection and prevention.","937":null,"938":null,"939":"The performance of deep learning in disease detection from high-quality clinical images is identical to and even greater than that of human doctors. However, in low-quality images, deep learning performs poorly. Whether human doctors also have poor performance in low-quality images is unknown. Here, we compared the performance of deep learning systems with that of cornea specialists in detecting corneal diseases from low-quality slit lamp images. The results showed that the cornea specialists performed better than our previously established deep learning system (PEDLS) trained on only high-quality images. The performance of the system trained on both high- and low-quality images was superior to that of the PEDLS while inferior to that of a senior corneal specialist. This study highlights that cornea specialists perform better in low-quality images than the system trained on high-quality images. Adding low-quality images with sufficient diagnostic certainty to the training set can reduce this performance gap.","940":null,"941":null,"942":null,"943":"The energy-only-market implemented in China cannot strongly support large-scale renewable energy expansion because the renewable energy expansion may disorderly phase out non-renewable power capacity. However, non-renewable power capacity, particularly the coal-fired power capacity in China, can provide vital power system adequacy needed by renewable energy expansion. We introduce capacity payments to orderly retire current coal-fired power capacity by transforming some of it into reserve capacity in order to support renewable energy expansion. Using generation and transmission expansion results from the SWITCH-China model, this paper proposes an orderly retirement path based on the assumption of implementing capacity payments. Our results show that roughly 100-200 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power capacity can continue to serve through 2050, and most of it is used as reserve capacity. Capacity payments of 400-700 billion yuan are needed to achieve this retirement path, and a higher adequacy requirement needs higher payments.","944":null,"945":null,"946":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101068.].","947":null,"948":"VCP\/p97 is an evolutionarily conserved AAA+ ATPase important for cellular homeostasis. Previous studies suggest that VCP predominantly exists as a homohexamer. Here, we performed structural and biochemical characterization of VCP dodecamer, an understudied state of VCP. The structure revealed an apo nucleotide status that has rarely been captured, a tail-to-tail assembly of two hexamers, and the up-elevated N-terminal domains akin to that seen in the ATP-bound hexamer. Further analyses elucidated a nucleotide status-dependent dodecamerization mechanism, where nucleotide dissociation from the D2 AAA domains induces and promotes VCP dodecamerization. In contrast, nucleotide-free D1 AAA domains are associated with the up-rotation of N-terminal domains, which may prime D1 for ATP binding. These results therefore reveal new nucleotide status-dictated intra- and interhexamer conformational changes and suggest that modulation of D2 domain nucleotide occupancy may serve as a mechanism in controlling VCP oligomeric states.","949":"Blocking the activity of cytokines is an efficient strategy to combat inflammatory diseases. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) fulfills its pro-inflammatory properties via its soluble receptor (IL-6 trans-signaling). The selective trans-signaling inhibitor olamkicept (sgp130Fc) is currently in clinical development. We have previously shown that sgp130Fc can also efficiently block trans-signaling of the closely related cytokine IL-11, which elicits the question how selectivity for one of the two cytokines can be achieved. Using structural information, we show that the interfaces between IL-6R-gp130 and IL-11R-gp130, respectively, within the so-called site III are different between the two cytokines. Modification of an aromatic cluster around Q113 of gp130 within these interfaces allows the discrimination between IL-6 and IL-11 trans-signaling. Using recombinant sgp130Fc variants, we demonstrate that these differences can indeed be exploited to generate a truly selective IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor. Our data highlight how the selectivity of a clinically relevant designer protein can be further improved.","950":"Mechanically-gated ion channels play an important role in the human body, whereas it is challenging to design artificial mechanically-controlled ionic transport devices as the intrinsically rigidity of traditional electrodes. Here, we report on a mechanically-gated electrochemical channel by virtue of vertically aligned gold nanowires (v-AuNWs) as 3D stretchable electrodes. By surface modification with a self-assembled 1-Dodecanethiol monolayer, the v-AuNWs become hydrophobic and inaccessible to hydrated redox species (e.g.,   Fe ( CN )  6 3 - \/ 4 -     and   Ru ( bpy )  3 2 +    ). Under mechanical strains, the closely-packed v-AuNWs unzip\/crack to generate ionic channels to enable redox reactions, giving rise to increases in Faradaic currents. The redox current increases with the strain level until it reaches a certain threshold value, and then decreases as the strain-induced conductivity decreases. The good reversible \"on-off\" behaviors for multiple cycles were also demonstrated. The results presented demonstrate a new strategy to control redox reactions simply by tensile strain, indicating the potential applications in future soft smart mechanotransduction devices.","951":null,"952":null,"953":null,"954":"Conceiving \"nothing\" as a numerical value zero is considered a sophisticated numerical capability that humans share with cognitively advanced animals. We demonstrate that representation of zero spontaneously emerges in a deep learning neural network without any number training. As a signature of numerical quantity representation, and similar to real neurons from animals, numerosity zero network units show maximum activity to empty sets and a gradual decrease in activity with increasing countable numerosities. This indicates that the network spontaneously ordered numerosity zero as the smallest numerical value along the number line. Removal of empty-set network units caused specific deficits in the network's judgment of numerosity zero, thus reflecting these units' functional relevance. These findings suggest that processing visual information is sufficient for a visual number sense that includes zero to emerge and explains why cognitively advanced animals with whom we share a nonverbal number system exhibit rudiments of numerosity zero.","955":null,"956":null,"957":"Our understanding of cell types has advanced considerably with the publication of single-cell atlases. Marker genes play an essential role for experimental validation and computational analyses such as physiological characterization, annotation, and deconvolution. However, a framework for quantifying marker replicability and selecting replicable markers is currently lacking. Here, using high-quality data from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we systematically investigate marker replicability for 85 neuronal cell types. We show that, due to dataset-specific noise, we need to combine 5 datasets to obtain robust differentially expressed (DE) genes, particularly for rare populations and lowly expressed genes. We estimate that 10 to 200 meta-analytic markers provide optimal downstream performance and make available replicable marker lists for the 85 BICCN cell types. Replicable marker lists condense interpretable and generalizable information about cell types, opening avenues for downstream applications, including cell type annotation, selection of gene panels, and bulk data deconvolution.","958":"2D layered materials with diverse exciting properties have recently attracted tremendous interest in the scientific community. Layered topological insulator Bi2Se3 comes into the spotlight as an exotic state of quantum matter with insulating bulk states and metallic Dirac-like surface states. Its unique crystal and electronic structure offer attractive features such as broadband optical absorption, thickness-dependent surface bandgap and polarization-sensitive photoresponse, which enable 2D Bi2Se3 to be a promising candidate for optoelectronic applications. Herein, we present a comprehensive summary on the recent advances of 2D Bi2Se3 materials. The structure and inherent properties of Bi2Se3 are firstly described and its preparation approaches (i.e., solution synthesis and van der Waals epitaxy growth) are then introduced. Moreover, the optoelectronic applications of 2D Bi2Se3 materials in visible-infrared detection, terahertz detection, and opto-spintronic device are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and prospects in this field are expounded on the basis of current development.","959":null,"960":"A data-driven approach is developed to predict the future capacity of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in this work. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD), kernel recursive least square tracker (KRLST), and long short-term memory (LSTM) are used to derive the proposed approach. First, the LIB capacity data is split into local regeneration and monotonic global degradation using the EMD approach. Next, the KRLST is used to track the decomposed intrinsic mode functions, and the residual signal is predicted using the LSTM sub-model. Finally, all the predicted intrinsic mode functions and the residual are ensembled to get the future capacity. The experimental and comparative analysis validates the high accuracy (RMSE of 0.00103) of the proposed ensemble approach compared to Gaussian process regression and LSTM fused model. Furthermore, two times lesser error than other fused models makes this approach an efficient tool for battery health prognostics.","961":"Auditory brainstem response (ABR) serves as an objective indication of auditory perception at a given sound level and is nowadays widely used in hearing function assessment. Despite efforts for automation over decades, ABR threshold determination by machine algorithms remains unreliable and thereby one still relies on visual identification by trained personnel. Here, we described a procedure for automatic threshold determination that can be used in both animal and human ABR tests. The method terminates level averaging of ABR recordings upon detection of time-locked waveform through cross-correlation analysis. The threshold level was then indicated by a dramatic increase in the sweep numbers required to produce \"qualified\" level averaging. A good match was obtained between the algorithm outcome and the human readouts. Moreover, the method varies the level averaging based on the cross-correlation, thereby adapting to the signal-to-noise ratio of sweep recordings. These features empower a robust and fully automated ABR test.","962":null,"963":null,"964":null,"965":"Spermidine (Spd) is a nitrogen sink and signaling molecule that plays pivotal roles in eukaryotic cell growth and must be finetuned to meet various energy demands. In eukaryotes, target of rapamycin (TOR) is a central nutrient sensor, especially N, and a master-regulator of growth and development. Here, we discovered that Spd stimulates the growth of maize and Arabidopsis seedlings through TOR signaling. Inhibition of Spd biosynthesis led to TOR inactivation and growth defects. Furthermore, disruption of a TOR complex partner RAPTOR1B abolished seedling growth stimulation by Spd. Strikingly, TOR activated by Spd promotes translation of key metabolic enzyme upstream open reading frame (uORF)-containing mRNAs, PAO and CuAO, by facilitating translation reinitiation and providing feedback to polyamine metabolism and TOR activation. The Spd-TOR relay protected young-age seedlings of maize from expeditious stress heat shock. Our results demonstrate Spd is an upstream effector of TOR kinase in planta and provide its potential application for crop protection.","966":"Protein oligomerization is central to biological function and regulation, yet its experimental quantification and measurement of dynamic transitions in solution remain challenging. Here, we show that single molecule mass photometry quantifies affinity and polydispersity of heterogeneous protein complexes in solution. We demonstrate these capabilities by studying the functionally relevant oligomeric equilibria of 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins (2CPs). Comparison of the polydispersity of plant and human 2CPs as a function of concentration and redox state revealed features conserved among all 2CPs. In addition, we also find species-specific differences in oligomeric transitions, the occurrence of intermediates and the formation of high molecular weight complexes, which are associated with chaperone activity or act as a storage pool for more efficient dimers outlining the functional differentiation of human 2CPs. Our results point to a diversified functionality of oligomerization for 2CPs and illustrate the power of mass photometry for characterizing heterogeneous oligomeric protein distributions in near native conditions.","967":null,"968":null,"969":null,"970":"miR-1307 is highly expressed in liver cancer and inhibits methyltransferase protein8. Thereby, miR-1307 inhibits the expression of KDM3A and KDM3B and increases the methylation modification of histone H3 lysine 9, which enhances the expression of endoplasmic-reticulum-related gene CALR. Of note, miR-1307 weakens the binding ability of OSTC to CDK2, CDK4, CyclinD1, and cyclinE and enhances the binding ability of CALR to CDK2, CDK4, CyclinD1, and cyclinE, decreasing of p21WAF1\/CIP1, GADD45, pRB, and p18, and decreasing of ppRB. Furthermore, miR-1307 increases the activity of H-Ras, PKM2, and PLK1. Strikingly, miR-1307 reduces the binding ability of OSTC to ATG4 and enhances the binding ability of CALR to ATG4. Therefore, miR-1307 reduces the occurrence of autophagy based on ATG4-LC3-ATG3-ATG7-ATG5-ATG16L1-ATG12-ATG9- Beclin1. In particular, miR-1307 enhances the expression of PAK2, PLK1, PRKAR2A, MYBL1, and Trim44 and inhibits the expression of Sash1 and Smad5 via autophagy. Our observations suggest that miR-1307 promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by CALR-OSTC-endoplasmic reticulum protein folding pathway.","971":"Neutrophil elastase (NE) promotes multiple stages of tumorigenesis. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying its stimulatory role. This study shows that NE triggers dose-dependent ERK signaling and cell migration in a panel of prostate cell lines representing the spectrum of prostate cell malignancy. All cell lines tested internalize NE; however, NE endocytosis is not required for ERK activation. Instead, NE acts extracellularly by stimulating the release of amphiregulin to initiate EGFR-dependent signaling. Inhibiting amphiregulin's biological activity with neutralizing antibodies, as well as gene silencing of amphiregulin or EGFR, attenuates NE-induced migration in normal and benign prostatic cells. Alternatively, in prostate cancer cells, knockdown of receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, but not EGFR, impairs both basal and NE-stimulated migration. When prostate cells progress to malignancy, the switch from EGFR-to AXL-dependence in NE-mediated migration implies the potential combined application of EGFR and AXL targeted therapy in prostate cancer treatment.","972":"Postsynaptic density protein 95 is a key scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density of excitatory glutamatergic neurons, organizing signaling complexes primarily via its three PSD-95\/Discs-large\/Zona occludens domains. PSD-95 is regulated by phosphorylation, but technical challenges have limited studies of the molecular details. Here, we genetically introduced site-specific phosphorylations in single, tandem, and full-length PSD-95 and generated a total of 11 phosphorylated protein variants. We examined how these phosphorylations affected binding to known interaction partners and the impact on phase separation of PSD-95 complexes and identified two new phosphorylation sites with opposing effects. Phosphorylation of Ser78 inhibited phase separation with the glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B and the auxiliary protein stargazin, whereas phosphorylation of Ser116 induced phase separation with stargazin only. Thus, by genetically introducing phosphoserine site-specifically and exploring the impact on phase separation, we have provided new insights into the regulation of PSD-95 by phosphorylation and the dynamics of the PSD.","973":"","974":"Capturing water vapor from atmospheric air is a possible solution to local water scarcity, but it is very energy demanding. Energy consumption estimates of water-from-air technologies involving adsorption processes, thermo-responsive hydrophilicity switching polymers, air cooling processes, and reverse osmosis of deliquescent salt solutions reveal that these technologies are not competitive when compared with seawater desalination, and the use of fresh water and wastewater sources. They only become a viable option in the absence of local liquid water sources and when long-distance transport for socio-economic reasons is not an option. Of interest, direct solar-driven technology for water-from-air production is an attractive means to disentangle the local water-energy nexus. It is expected that climate change will accelerate the introduction of water-from-air technologies in local water supply schemes. The optimal water-from-air technology depends on the climate, relative humidity, and temperature profiles. A world map is presented, indicating the optimal geographic location for each technology.","975":"Accurate state of health (SOH) prediction is significant to guarantee operation safety and avoid latent failures of lithium-ion batteries. With the development of communication and artificial intelligence technologies, a body of researches have been performed toward precise and reliable SOH prediction method based on machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, the conception of SOH is defined, and the state-of-the-art prediction methods are classified based on their primary implementation procedure. As an essential step in ML-based SOH algorithms, the health feature extraction methods reported in the literature are comprehensively surveyed. Next, an exhausted comparison is conducted to elaborate the development of ML-based SOH prediction techniques. Not only their advantages and disadvantages of the application in SOH prediction are reviewed but also their accuracy and execution process are fully discussed. Finally, pivotal challenges and corresponding research directions are provided for more reliable and high-fidelity SOH prediction.","976":"Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive skin malignancy, mostly caused by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). MCPyV T-antigens can induce mature microRNA expressions through the DnaJ domain, but its underlying mechanism is still unknown. Here, we report that the T-antigens induce protein expression and mRNA stability of DICER1, a key factor in microRNA biogenesis, through heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70). HSC70 directly interacts with the AU-rich elements (ARE) of DICER1 mRNA in both coding and 3' untranslated region in the presence of MCPyV T-antigen. The T-antigen\/HSC70 interaction could induce luciferase activity of synthetic ARE-containing reporter, as well as the stability of ARE-containing mRNAs, suggesting a broader role of MCPyV T-antigens in regulating multiple mRNAs via HSC70. These findings highlight a new role for the interaction of HSC70 and MCPyV T-antigens in mRNA regulation and an undescribed regulatory mechanism of DICER1 mRNA stability and translation through its direct interaction with HSC70.","977":null,"978":null,"979":null,"980":"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) driven by viruses or bacteria, as well as in numerous immune-mediated disorders. Histone citrullination by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) and the consequent decondensation of chromatin are hallmarks in the induction of NETs. Nevertheless, additional histone modifications that may govern NETosis are largely overlooked. Herein, we show that histone deacetylases (HDACs) play critical roles in driving NET formation in human and mouse neutrophils. HDACs belonging to the zinc-dependent lysine deacetylases family are necessary to deacetylate histone H3, thus allowing the activity of PAD4 and NETosis. Of note, HDAC inhibition in mice protects against microbial-induced pneumonia and septic shock, decreasing NETosis and inflammation. Collectively, our findings illustrate a new fundamental step that governs the release of NETs and points to HDAC inhibitors as therapeutic agents that may be used to protect against ARDS and sepsis.","981":"There has been extensive research in predictive modeling of genome-scale metabolic reaction networks. Living systems involve complex stochastic processes arising from interactions among different biomolecules. For more accurate and robust prediction of target metabolic behavior under different conditions, not only metabolic reactions but also the genetic regulatory relationships involving transcription factors (TFs) affecting these metabolic reactions should be modeled. We have developed a modeling and simulation pipeline enabling the analysis of Transcription Regulation Integrated with Metabolic Regulation: TRIMER. TRIMER utilizes a Bayesian network (BN) inferred from transcriptomes to model the transcription factor regulatory network. TRIMER then infers the probabilities of the gene states relevant to the metabolism of interest, and predicts the metabolic fluxes and their changes that result from the deletion of one or more transcription factors at the genome scale. We demonstrate TRIMER's applicability to both simulated and experimental data and provide performance comparison with other existing approaches.","982":"Palaeontologists often use finite element analyses, in which forces propagate through objects with specific material properties, to investigate feeding biomechanics. Teeth are usually modeled with uniform properties (all bone or all enamel). In reality, most teeth are composed of pulp, dentine, and enamel. We tested how simplified teeth compare to more realistic models using mandible models of three reptiles. For each, we created models representing enamel thicknesses found in extant taxa, as well as simplified models (bone, dentine or enamel). Our results suggest that general comparisons of stress distribution among distantly related taxa do not require representation of dental tissues, as there was no noticeable effect on heatmap representations of stress. However, we find that representation of dental tissues impacts bite force estimates, although magnitude of these effects may differ depending on constraints. Thus, as others have shown, the detail necessary in a biomechanical model relates to the questions being examined.","983":"The two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising flexible electronic materials for strategic flexible information devices. Large-area and high-quality patterned materials were usually required by flexible electronics due to the limitation from the process of manufacturing and integration. However, the synthesis of large-area patterned 2D TMDs with high quality is difficult. Here, an efficient and powerful pulsed laser has been developed to synthesize wafer-scale MoS2. The flexible strain sensor was fabricated using MoS2 and showed high performance of low detection limit (0.09%), high gauge factor (1,118), and high stability (1,000 cycles). Besides, we demonstrated its applications in real-time monitoring of health-related physiological signals such as radial artery pressure, respiratory rate, and vocal cord vibration. Our findings suggest that the laser-assisted method is effective and capable of synthesizing wafer-scale 2D TMDs, which opens new opportunities for the next flexible electronic devices and wearable health monitoring.","984":"Autophagy is a conserved biological process that maintains cell homeostasis by targeting macromolecules for lysosome-mediated degradation. The levels of autophagy are relatively lower under normal conditions than under stress conditions (e.g., starvation), as autophagy is usually stimulated after multiple stresses. However, many autophagy-related regulators are still expressed under normal conditions. Although these regulators have been studied deeply in autophagy regulation, the nonautophagic roles of these regulators under normal conditions remain incompletely understood. Here, we found that autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), which is a key regulator of autophagy, regulates c-Myc protein degradation under normal conditions through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We also found that ATG5 binds c-Myc and recruits the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase FBW7 to promote c-Myc degradation. Moreover, ATG5-mediated degradation of c-Myc limits cell growth under normal conditions and is essential for embryonic stem cell differentiation. Therefore, this study reveals a nonautophagic role of ATG5 in regulating of c-Myc protein degradation.","985":"Mitochondria are a hallmark of eukaryal cells and play an important role in cellular metabolism. There is a vast amount of knowledge available on mitochondrial metabolism and essential mitochondrial functions, such as protein import and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, including multiple studies on the mitochondrial proteome. Therefore, there is a need for in silico approaches to facilitate the analysis of these data. Here, we present a detailed model of mitochondrial metabolism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including protein import, iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis, and a description of the coupling between charge translocation processes and ATP synthesis. Model analysis implied a dual dependence of absolute levels of proteins in protein import, iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and cluster abundance on growth rate and respiratory activity. The model is instrumental in studying dynamics and perturbations in these processes and given the high conservation of mitochondrial metabolism in humans, it can provide insight into their role in human disease.","986":null,"987":"Despite extensive research in the past five years and several successfully completed and on-going pilot projects, regulators are still reluctant to implement peer-to-peer trading at a large scale in today's electricity market. The reason could partly be attributed to the perceived disadvantage of current market participants such as retailers due to their exclusion from market participation-a fundamental property of decentralized peer-to-peer trading. As a consequence, recently, there has been growing pressure from energy service providers in favor of retailers' participation in peer-to-peer trading. However, the role of retailers in the peer-to-peer market is yet to be established, as no existing study has challenged this fundamental circumspection of decentralized trading. In this context, this perspective takes the first step to discuss the feasibility of retailers' involvement in the peer-to-peer market. In doing so, we identify key characteristics of retail-based and peer-to-peer electricity markets and discuss our viewpoint on how to incorporate a single retailer in a peer-to-peer market without compromising the fundamental decision-making characteristics of both markets. Finally, we give an example of a hypothetical business model to demonstrate how a retailer can be a part of a peer-to-peer market with a promise of collective benefits for the participants.","988":"The decarbonization of heavy industry and the emergence of renewable energy technologies are inextricably linked to access to mineral resources. As such, there is an urgent need to develop benchmarked assessments of the role of critical elements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Here, we explore the role of vanadium in decarbonizing construction by serving as a microalloying element and enabling the energy transition as the primary component of flow batteries used for grid-level storage. We estimate that vanadium has enabled an avoided environmental burden totaling 185 million metric tons of CO2 on an annual basis. A granular analysis estimates savings for China and the European Union at 1.15% and 0.18% of their respective emissions, respectively. Our results highlight the role of critical metals in developing low-carbon infrastructure while underscoring the need for holistic assessments to inform policy interventions that mitigate supply chain risks.","989":null,"990":"Recent studies suggest that a western diet may contribute to clinical neurodegeneration and dementia. Adipocyte-specific expression of the Na,K-ATPase signaling antagonist, NaKtide, ameliorates the pathophysiological consequences of murine experimental obesity and renal failure. In this study, we found that a western diet produced systemic oxidant stress along with evidence of activation of Na,K-ATPase signaling within both murine brain and peripheral tissues. We also noted this diet caused increases in circulating inflammatory cytokines as well as behavioral, and brain biochemical changes consistent with neurodegeneration. Adipocyte specific NaKtide affected by a doxycycline on\/off expression system ameliorated all of these diet effects. These data suggest that a western diet produces cognitive decline and neurodegeneration through augmented Na,K-ATPase signaling and that antagonism of this pathway in adipocytes ameliorates the pathophysiology. If this observation is confirmed in humans, the adipocyte Na,K-ATPase may serve as a clinical target in the therapy of neurodegenerative disorders.","991":"The bioaccumulation of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins\/furans (PCDD\/Fs), known as dioxins, in fatty meat is one of primary pathways of entry into the human body, but levels of human exposure to dioxins in fatty meat subject to global trade are unknown. We show high dioxin estimated dietary intake (EDI) via pork consumption in Europe, the United States, and China, owing to stronger dioxin environmental contamination and high pork consumption in these countries. The dioxin risk transfer embodied in pork trade is mostly significant in high-latitude countries and regions of Canada, Russia, and Greenland because these regions with low dioxin environmental levels import large amounts of pork meat from more severely dioxin-contaminated Europe and the United States. We demonstrate that global pig feed trading decreases the exposure of pork consumers to dioxins via the import of feed from countries with low dioxin environmental contamination by pig breeding countries.","992":null,"993":"It is well established that the early malignant tumor invades surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) in a manner that depends upon material properties of constituent cells, surrounding ECM, and their interactions. Recent studies have established the capacity of the invading tumor spheroids to evolve into coexistent solid-like, fluid-like, and gas-like phases. Using breast cancer cell lines invading into engineered ECM, here we show that the spheroid interior develops spatial and temporal heterogeneities in material phase which, depending upon cell type and matrix density, ultimately result in a variety of phase separation patterns at the invasive front. Using a computational approach, we further show that these patterns are captured by a novel jamming phase diagram. We suggest that non-equilibrium phase separation based upon jamming and unjamming transitions may provide a unifying physical picture to describe cellular migratory dynamics within, and invasion from, a tumor.","994":"Diffuse glioma is the most prevalent and malignant brain tumor. The function and significance of CD37 in diffuse gliomas remain largely unknown. Here, we showed CD37 was abnormally expressed in diverse cancers, especially glioma by pan-cancer differential expression analysis. In addition, we found CD37 was upregulated in higher grade and IDH or IDH1-wildtype gliomas, which was further validated by qPCR and IHC. Survival analysis revealed CD37 served as an independent indicator for unfavorable prognosis of patients with diffuse gliomas. Functional enrichment analysis revealed CD37 was associated with immunological processes. Moreover, immune infiltration analyses suggested gliomas with high-expression CD37 had greater infiltration of M2 macrophages and neutrophils, and lower NK cell abundance. CD37 was closely correlated to immune checkpoint molecules, including CD276, CD80, CD86, and PD-L2. Our results indicated CD37 is an independent prognostic factor and plays an immunosuppressive role in diffuse gliomas. Targeting CD37 could be a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for diffuse gliomas.","995":"Nonconvulsive epileptiform activity and microglial alterations have been detected in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related mouse models. However, the relationship between these abnormalities remains to be elucidated. We suppressed epileptiform activity by treatment with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam or by genetic ablation of tau and found that these interventions reversed or prevented aberrant microglial gene expression in brain tissues of aged human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, which simulate several key aspects of AD. The most robustly modulated genes included multiple factors previously implicated in AD pathogenesis, including TREM2, the hypofunction of which increases disease risk. Genetic reduction of TREM2 exacerbated epileptiform activity after mice were injected with kainate. We conclude that AD-related epileptiform activity markedly changes the molecular profile of microglia, inducing both maladaptive and adaptive alterations in their activities. Increased expression of TREM2 seems to support microglial activities that counteract this type of network dysfunction.","996":null,"997":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health-care problem with limited therapeutic options. To obtain a cellular resolution of pathogenesis, 82,168 single-cell transcriptomes (scRNA-seq) across different NAFLD stages were profiled, identifying hepatocytes and 12 other non-parenchymal cell (NPC) types. scRNA-seq revealed insights into the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the disease. We discovered a dual role for hepatic stellate cells in gene expression regulation and in the potential to trans-differentiate into myofibroblasts. We uncovered distinct expression profiles of Kupffer cells versus monocyte-derived macrophages during NAFLD progression. Kupffer cells showed stronger immune responses, while monocyte-derived macrophages demonstrated a capability for differentiation. Three chimeric NPCs were identified including endothelial-chimeric stellate cells, hepatocyte-chimeric endothelial cells, and endothelial-chimeric Kupffer cells. Our work identified unanticipated aspects of mouse with NAFLD at the single-cell level and advanced the understanding of cellular heterogeneity in NAFLD livers.","998":"Skin-like electronics are developing rapidly to realize a variety of applications such as wearable sensing and soft robotics. Hydrogels, as soft biomaterials, have been studied intensively for skin-like electronic utilities due to their unique features such as softness, wetness, biocompatibility and ionic sensing capability. These features could potentially blur the gap between soft biological systems and hard artificial machines. However, the development of skin-like hydrogel devices is still in its infancy and faces challenges including limited functionality, low ambient stability, poor surface adhesion, and relatively high power consumption (as ionic sensors). This review aims to summarize current development of skin-inspired hydrogel devices to address these challenges. We first conduct an overview of hydrogels and existing strategies to increase their toughness and conductivity. Next, we describe current approaches to leverage hydrogel devices with advanced merits including anti-dehydration, anti-freezing, and adhesion. Thereafter, we highlight state-of-the-art skin-like hydrogel devices for applications including wearable electronics, soft robotics, and energy harvesting. Finally, we conclude and outline the future trends.","999":null,"1000":"Paradoxically, many microRNAs appear to exhibit entirely opposite functions when placed in different contexts. For example, miR-125b has been shown to be pro-apoptotic in some studies, but anti-apoptotic in others. To investigate this phenomenon, we combine computational modeling with experimental approaches to examine how the function of miR-125b in apoptosis varies with respect to the expression levels of its pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic targets. In doing so, we elucidate a general trend that miR-125b is more pro-apoptotic when its anti-apoptotic targets are overexpressed, whereas it is more anti-apoptotic when its pro-apoptotic targets are overexpressed. We show that it is possible to completely reverse miR-125b's function in apoptosis by modifying the expression levels of its target genes. Furthermore, miR-125b's function may also be altered by the presence of anticancer drugs. These results suggest that the function of a microRNA can vary substantially and is dependent on its target gene expression levels.","1001":"Neuronal activity in the brain depends on mostly aerobic generation of energy equivalents and thus on a constant O2 supply. Oxygenation of the vertebrate brain has been optimized during evolution by species-specific uptake and transport of O2 that originally derives from the phototrophic activity of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms in the environment. Here, we employed a concept that exploits transcardial injection and vascular distribution of unicellular green algae or cyanobacteria in the brain of Xenopus laevis tadpoles. Using oxygen measurements in the brain ventricle, we found that these microorganisms robustly produce sizable amounts of O2 upon illumination. In a severe hypoxic environment, when neuronal activity has completely ceased, the photosynthetic O2 reliably provoked a restart and rescue of neuronal activity. In the future, phototrophic microorganisms might provide a novel means to directly increase oxygen levels in the brain in a controlled manner under particular eco-physiological conditions or following pathological impairments.","1002":"Spider silk is frequently attributed antimicrobial properties. This notion is based on studies reporting antimicrobial activity (AMA) of spider silk; however, close inspection of these studies reveals that the evidence is conflicting, and at best anecdotal. We performed a systematic study of antimicrobial properties of different silk types from seven species across the spider phylogeny. We found no evidence of AMA of silk in direct contact and disc diffusion assays against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, and the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, staining experiments and fluorescence microscopy showed the presence of live bacteria on silk surfaces indicating no antimicrobial effect on direct contact. A critical evaluation of the literature reveals that published tests of AMA are scarce and that all the studies claiming positive results are compromised by methodological shortcomings. Our analysis demonstrates that the common notion that spider silk is antimicrobial is not supported by empirical data.","1003":null,"1004":"Macropinocytosis refers to the non-specific uptake of extracellular fluid, which plays ubiquitous roles in cell growth, immune surveillance, and virus entry. Despite its widespread occurrence, it remains unclear how its initial cup-shaped plasma membrane extensions form without any external solid support, as opposed to the process of particle uptake during phagocytosis. Here, by developing a computational framework that describes the coupling between the bistable reaction-diffusion processes of active signaling patches and membrane deformation, we demonstrated that the protrusive force localized to the edge of the patches can give rise to a self-enclosing cup structure, without further assumptions of local bending or contraction. Efficient uptake requires a balance among the patch size, magnitude of protrusive force, and cortical tension. Furthermore, our model exhibits cyclic cup formation, coexistence of multiple cups, and cup-splitting, indicating that these complex morphologies self-organize via a common mutually-dependent process of reaction-diffusion and membrane deformation.","1005":"Impairment in the learning\/memory behavior of bees is responsible for the massive disappearance of bee populations and its consequent agricultural economic losses. Such impairment might be because of o both pesticide exposure and pathogen infection, with a key contributor deformed wing virus (DWV). The present study found that sodium butyrate (NaB) significantly increased survival and reversed the learning\/memory impairment of DWV-infected bees. A next-generation sequencing analysis showed that NaB affected the expression of genes involved in glycolytic processes and memory formation, which were suppressed by DWV infection. In addition, we performed a large-scale movement tracking experiment by using a wireless sensor network-based automatic real-time monitoring system and confirmed that NaB could improve the homing ability of DWV-infected bees. In short, we demonstrated the mechanism of how epigenetic regulation can resume the memory function of honeybees and suggest strategies for applying NaB to reduce the incidence of colony losses.","1006":"This paper provides a perspective on potential applications of a new single-molecule technique, viz., the nanopore electro-osmotic trap (NEOtrap). This solid-state nanopore-based method uses locally induced electro-osmosis to form a hydrodynamic trap for single molecules. Ionic current recordings allow one to study an unlabeled protein or nanoparticle of arbitrary charge that can be held in the nanopore's most sensitive region for very long times. After motivating the need for improved single-molecule technologies, we sketch various possible technical extensions and combinations of the NEOtrap. We lay out diverse applications in biosensing, enzymology, protein folding, protein dynamics, fingerprinting of proteins, detecting post-translational modifications, and all that at the level of single proteins - illustrating the unique versatility and potential of the NEOtrap.","1007":"We propose a weight-neutral strategy for obesity treatment on the following grounds: (1) the mortality risk associated with obesity is largely attenuated or eliminated by moderate-to-high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) or physical activity (PA), (2) most cardiometabolic risk markers associated with obesity can be improved with exercise training independent of weight loss and by a magnitude similar to that observed with weight-loss programs, (3) weight loss, even if intentional, is not consistently associated with lower mortality risk, (4) increases in CRF or PA are consistently associated with greater reductions in mortality risk than is intentional weight loss, and (5) weight cycling is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes including increased mortality. Adherence to PA may improve if health care professionals consider PA and CRF as essential vital signs and consistently emphasize to their patients the myriad benefits of PA and CRF in the absence of weight loss.","1008":null,"1009":null,"1010":"Low reproducibility in gene expression profiles has been observed in transcriptome studies, and this often limits applying findings to clinical practice. Here, we show time-of-day effects on gene expression and analytical schemes to increase the reproducibility in expression patterns. We recruited patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and healthy subjects and collected blood from individuals twice a day, day (2 pm) and night (9 pm). RNA sequencing analyses found that gene expression in RRMS in relapse (Relapse) is significantly changed at night compared with either Relapse at day or RRMS in remission (Remission). Gene set overrepresentation analysis demonstrated that gene sets significantly changed in Relapse at night are enriched to immune responses related to MS pathology. In those gene sets, 68 genes are significantly changed expression in Relapse at night compared with Relapse at day and Remission. This supports that times of sample collections should be standardized to obtain reproducible gene expression patterns.","1011":null,"1012":"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has recently been recognized to play a role in immune regulation and tissue regeneration. However, the short half-life of PGE2 limits its clinical application. Improving the delivery of PGE2 specifically to the target organ with a prolonged release method is highly desirable. Taking advantage of the adequate space and proximity of the renal parenchyma, renal subcapsular delivery allows minimally invasive and effective delivery to the entire kidney. Here, we report that by covalently cross-linking it to a collagen matrix, PGE2 exhibits an adequate long-term presence in the kidney with extensive intraparenchymal penetration through renal subcapsular delivery and significantly improves kidney function. Sox9 cell lineage tracing with intravital microscopy revealed that PGE2 could activate the endogenous renal progenitor Sox9+ cells through the Yap signaling pathway. Our results highlight the prospects of utilizing renal subcapsular-based drug delivery and facilitate new applications of PGE2-releasing matrices for regenerative therapy.","1013":null,"1014":null,"1015":"Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOE4 is known to affect the function of microglia, but to what extent this gene drives microglial gene expression has thus far not been examined. Using a transgenic mouse model of AD that expresses human APOE, we identify a unique transcriptional profile associated with APOE4 expression. We also show a sex and APOE interaction, such that both female sex and APOE4 drive expression of this gene profile. We confirm these findings in human cells, using microglia derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iMGL). Moreover, we find that these interactions are driven in part by genes related to metal processing, and we show that zinc treatment has APOE genotype-dependent effects on iMGL. These data identify a sex- and APOE4-associated microglial transcription profile and highlight the importance of considering interactive risk factors such as sex and environmental exposures.","1016":null,"1017":"Inflorescence architecture is diverse in flowering plants, and two determinants of inflorescence architecture are the inflorescence meristem and pedicel length. Although the ERECTA (ER) signaling pathway, in coordination with the SWR1 chromatin remodeling complex, regulates inflorescence architecture with subsequent effects on pedicel elongation, the mechanism underlying SWR1-ER signaling pathway regulation of inflorescence architecture remains unclear. This study determined that SDG2 genetically interacts with the SWR1-ER signaling pathways in regulating inflorescence architecture. Transcriptome results showed that auxin might potentially influence inflorescence growth mediated by SDG2 and SWR1-ER pathways. SWR1 and ER signaling are required to enrich H2A.Z histone variant and SDG2 regulated SDG2-mediated H3K4me3 histone modification at auxin-related genes and H2A.Z histone variant enrichment. Our study shows how the regulation of inflorescence architecture is mediated by SDG2 and SWR1-ER, which affects auxin hormone signaling pathways.","1018":null,"1019":null,"1020":"Adult stem cells and their transit-amplifying progeny alter their proliferation rates to maintain tissue homeostasis. To test how the division rates of stem cells and transit-amplifying progeny affect tissue growth and differentiation, we developed a computation strategy that estimates the average cell-cycle lengths (lifespans) of germline stem cells and their progeny from fixed-tissue demography in the Drosophila testis. Analysis of the wild-type data using this method indicated that during the germline transit-amplification, the cellular lifespans extend by nearly 1.3-fold after the first division and shrink by about 2-folds after the second division. Cell-autonomous perturbations of the stem cell lifespan accordingly altered the lifespans of successive transit-amplifying stages. Remarkably, almost 2-fold alterations in the lifespans of stem cells and their immediate daughters did not affect the subsequent differentiation. The results indicate that the early germline division rates can adjust the following division rates and the onset of differentiation.","1021":null,"1022":null,"1023":"Neurodegenerative diseases are challenging for systems biology because of the lack of reliable animal models or patient samples at early disease stages. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) could address these challenges. We investigated DNA, RNA, epigenetics, and proteins in iPSC-derived motor neurons from patients with ALS carrying hexanucleotide expansions in C9ORF72. Using integrative computational methods combining all omics datasets, we identified novel and known dysregulated pathways. We used a C9ORF72 Drosophila model to distinguish pathways contributing to disease phenotypes from compensatory ones and confirmed alterations in some pathways in postmortem spinal cord tissue of patients with ALS. A different differentiation protocol was used to derive a separate set of C9ORF72 and control motor neurons. Many individual -omics differed by protocol, but some core dysregulated pathways were consistent. This strategy of analyzing patient-specific neurons provides disease-related outcomes with small numbers of heterogeneous lines and reduces variation from single-omics to elucidate network-based signatures.","1024":"Link prediction is a paradigmatic problem in network science, which aims at estimating the existence likelihoods of nonobserved links, based on known topology. After a brief introduction of the standard problem and evaluation metrics of link prediction, this review will summarize representative progresses about local similarity indices, link predictability, network embedding, matrix completion, ensemble learning, and some others, mainly extracted from related publications in the last decade. Finally, this review will outline some long-standing challenges for future studies.","1025":"Depolarization of the myometrial smooth muscle cell (MSMC) resting membrane potential is necessary for the uterus to transition from a quiescent state to a contractile state. The molecular mechanisms involved in this transition are not completely understood. Here, we report that a coupled system between the Na+-activated K+ channel (SLO2.1) and the non-selective Na+ leak channel (NALCN) determines the MSMC membrane potential. Our data indicate that Na+ entering through NALCN acts as an intracellular signaling molecule that activates SLO2.1. Potassium efflux through SLO2.1 hyperpolarizes the membrane. A decrease in SLO2.1\/NALCN activity induces membrane depolarization, triggering Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and promoting contraction. Consistent with functional coupling, our data show that NALCN and SLO2.1 are in close proximity in human MSMCs. We propose that these arrangements of SLO2.1 and NALCN permit these channels to functionally regulate MSMC membrane potential and cell excitability and modulate uterine contractility.","1026":"Immune activation has been shown to play a critical role in the development of schizophrenia; however its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Our report demonstrates a high-quality protein interaction network for schizophrenia (SCZ Network), constructed using our \"neighborhood walk\" approach in combination with \"random walk with restart\". The spatiotemporal expression pattern of the genes in this disease network revealed two developmental stages sensitive to perturbation by immune activation: mid-to late gestation, and adolescence. Furthermore, we induced immune activation at these stages in mice, carried out transcriptome sequencing on the mouse brains, and illustrated clear potential molecular pathways and key regulators correlating maternal immune activation during gestation and an increased risk for schizophrenia after a second immune activation at puberty. This work provides not only valuable resources for the study on molecular mechanisms underlying schizophrenia, but also a systematic strategy for the discovery of molecular pathways of complex mental disorders.","1027":null,"1028":"Newts utilize their unique genes to restore missing parts by strategic regulation of conserved signaling pathways. Lack of genetic tools poses challenges to determine the function of such genes. Therefore, we used the Drosophila eye model to demonstrate the potential of 5 unique newt (Notophthalmus viridescens) gene(s), viropana1-viropana5 (vna1-vna5), which were ectopically expressed in L 2 mutant and GMR-hid, GMR-GAL4 eye. L 2 exhibits the loss of ventral half of early eye and head involution defective (hid) triggers cell-death during later eye development. Surprisingly, newt genes significantly restore missing photoreceptor cells both in L 2 and GMR&gt;hid background by upregulating cell-proliferation and blocking cell-death, regulating evolutionarily conserved Wingless (Wg)\/Wnt signaling pathway and exhibit non-cell-autonomous rescues. Further, Wg\/Wnt signaling acts downstream of newt genes. Our data highlights that unique newt proteins can regulate conserved pathways to trigger a robust restoration of missing photoreceptor cells in Drosophila eye model with weak restoration capability.","1029":null,"1030":"Low-income households (LIHs) have experienced increased poverty and inaccess to healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, limiting their ability to adhere to health-protective behaviors. We use an epidemiological model to show how a households' inability to adopt social distancing, owing to constraints in utility and healthcare expenditure, can drastically impact the course of disease outbreaks in five urban U.S. counties. LIHs suffer greater burdens of disease and death than higher income households, while functioning as a consistent source of virus exposure for the entire community due to socioeconomic barriers to following public health guidelines. These impacts worsened when social distancing policy could not be imposed. Health interventions combining social distancing and LIH resource protection strategies (e.g., utility and healthcare access) were the most effective in limiting virus spread for all income levels. Policies need to address the multidimensionality of energy, housing, and healthcare access for future disaster management.","1031":null,"1032":null,"1033":"Thermoelectric materials convert waste heat into electric energy. Oxyselenide-based material, specifically, p-type BiCuSeO, is one of the most promising materials for these applications. There are numerous approaches to improve the heat-to-electricity conversion performance. Usually, these approaches are applied individually, starting from the pure intrinsic material. Higher performance could, however, be reached by combining a few strategies simultaneously. In the current work, yttrium, niobium, and phosphorous substitutions on the bismuth sites in already bismuth-deficient Bi1-xCuSeO systems were investigated via density functional theory. The bismuth-deficient system was used as the reference system for further introduction of substitutional defects. The substitution with phosphorous showed a decrease of up to 40 meV (11%) in the energy gap between conduction and valence bands at the highest substitution concentration. Doping with niobium led to the system changing from a p-type to an n-type conductor, which provides a possible route to obtain n-type BiCuSeO systems.","1034":"Low- and moderate-income (LMI) households remain less likely to adopt rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) than higher-income households. A transient period of inequitable adoption is common among emerging technologies but stakeholders are calling for an accelerated transition to equitable rooftop PV adoption. To date, researchers have focused on demand-side drivers of PV adoption inequity, but supply-side factors could also play a role. Here, we use quote data to explore whether PV installers implement income-targeted marketing and the extent to which such strategies drive adoption inequity. We find that installers submit fewer quotes to households in low-income areas and those households that receive fewer quotes are less likely to adopt. The data suggest that income-targeted marketing explains about one-quarter of the difference in PV adoption rates between LMI and higher-income households. Policymakers could explore a broader suite of interventions to address demand- and supply-side drivers of PV adoption inequity.","1035":"The ever-growing installation of solar power systems imposes severe challenges on the operations of local and regional power grids due to the inherent intermittency and variability of ground-level solar irradiance. In recent decades, solar forecasting methodologies for intra-hour, intra-day and day-ahead energy markets have been extensively explored as cost-effective technologies to mitigate the negative effects on the power grids caused by solar power instability. In this work, the progress in intra-hour solar forecasting methodologies are comprehensively reviewed and concisely summarized. The theories behind the forecasting methodologies and how these theories are applied in various forecasting models are presented. The reviewed mathematical tools include regressive methods, stochastic learning methods, deep learning methods, and genetic algorithm. The reviewed forecasting methodologies include data-driven methods, local-sensing methods, hybrid forecasting methods, and application orientated methods that generate probabilistic forecasts and spatial forecasts. Furthermore, suggestions to accelerate the development of future intra-hour forecasting methods are provided.","1036":"Highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants identified in India and designated B.1.617, Kappa (B.1.617.1), Delta (B.1.617.2), B.1.618, and B.1.36.29 contain spike mutations L452R, T478K, E484K, E484Q, and N440K located within the spike receptor-binding domain and thus could contribute to increased transmissibility and potentially allow re-infection or cause resistance to vaccine-elicited antibody. To address these issues, we used lentiviruses pseudotyped by variant spikes to measure their neutralization by convalescent sera, vaccine-elicited and Regeneron therapeutic antibodies, and ACE2 affinity. Convalescent sera and vaccine-elicited antibodies neutralized viruses with Delta spike with 2- to 5-fold decrease in titer in different donors. Regeneron antibody cocktail neutralized virus with the Delta spike with a 2.6-fold decrease in titer. Neutralization resistance to serum antibodies and monoclonal antibodies was mediated by L452R mutation. These relatively modest decreases in antibody neutralization titer for viruses with variant spike proteins suggest that current vaccines will remain protective against the family of Delta variants.","1037":null,"1038":"In parasite and viral infections, aberrant B cell responses can suppress germinal center reactions thereby blunting long-lived memory and may provoke immunopathology including autoimmunity. Using COVID-19 as model, we set out to identify serological, cellular, and transcriptomic imprints of pathological responses linked to autoreactive B cells at single-cell resolution. We show that excessive plasmablast expansions are prognostically adverse and correlate with autoantibody production but do not hinder the formation of neutralizing antibodies. Although plasmablasts followed interleukin-4 (IL-4) and BAFF-driven developmental trajectories, were polyclonal, and not enriched in autoreactive B cells, we identified two memory populations (CD80+\/ISG15+ and CD11c+\/SOX5+\/T-bet+\/-) with immunogenetic and transcriptional signs of autoreactivity that may be the cellular source of autoantibodies in COVID-19 and that may persist beyond recovery. Immunomodulatory interventions discouraging such adverse responses may be useful in selected patients to shift the balance from autoreactivity toward long-term memory.","1039":null,"1040":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102741.].","1041":null,"1042":"Salt-assisted chemical vapor deposition (SA-CVD), which uses halide salts (e.g., NaCl, KBr, etc.) and molten salts (e.g., Na2MoO4, Na2WO4, etc.) as precursors, is one of the most popular methods favored for the fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as atomically thin metal chalcogenides, graphene, and h-BN. In this review, the distinct functions of halogens (F, Cl, Br, I) and alkali metals (Li, Na, K) in SA-CVD are first clarified. Based on the current development in SA-CVD growth and its related reaction modes, the existing methods are categorized into the Salt 1.0 (halide salts-based) and Salt 2.0 (molten salts-based) techniques. The achievements, advantages, and limitations of each technique are discussed in detail.

Based on network analysis, we identified a highly conserved disease-associated gene module across three different NAFLD cohorts and highlighted the predominant role of key transcriptional regulators associated with lipid and cholesterol metabolism. In addition, we revealed the detailed metabolic differences between heterogeneous NAFLD patients through integrative systems analysis of transcriptomic data and liver-specific genome-scale metabolic model. Furthermore, we identified transcription factors (TFs), including SREBF2, HNF4A, SREBF1, YY1, and KLF13, showing regulation of hepatic expression of genes in the NAFLD-associated modules and validated the TFs using data generated from a mouse NAFLD model. In conclusion, our integrative analysis facilitates the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of these perturbed TFs and their associated biological processes.","1048":"Delivering peptides into cells could open up possibilities for targeting intracellular proteins. Although fatty acylation of peptide therapeutics improves their systemic half-life, it remains unclear how it influences their cellular uptake. Here, we demonstrate that a fatty acylated peptide exhibits enhanced cellular internalization and cytosolic distribution compared to the un-acylated version. By using a cystine-knot peptide as a model system, we report an efficient strategy for site-specific conjugation of fatty acids. Peptides modified with fatty acids of different chain lengths entered cells through clathrin-mediated and macropinocytosis pathways. The cellular uptake was mediated by the length of the hydrocarbon chain, with myristic acid conjugates displaying the highest distribution across the cytoplasm including the cytosol, and endomembranes of the ER, Golgi and mitochondria. Our studies demonstrate how fatty acylation improves the cellular uptake of peptides, and lay the groundwork for future development of bioactive peptides with enhanced intracellular distribution.","1049":"We know a lot about varying gut microbiome compositions. Yet, how the bacteria affect each other remains elusive. In mammals, this is largely based on the sheer complexity of the microbiome with at least hundreds of different species. Thus, model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster are commonly used to investigate mechanistic questions as the microbiome consists of only about 10 leading bacterial species. Here, we isolated gut bacteria from laboratory-reared Drosophila, sequenced their respective genomes, and used this information to reconstruct genome-scale metabolic models. With these, we simulated growth in mono- and co-culture conditions and different media including a synthetic diet designed to grow Drosophila melanogaster. Our simulations reveal a synergistic growth of some but not all gut microbiome members, which stems on the exchange of distinct metabolites including tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Culturing experiments confirmed our predictions. Our study thus demonstrates the possibility to predict microbiome-derived growth-promoting cross-feeding.","1050":null,"1051":"We developed Miscell, a self-supervised learning approach with deep neural network as latent feature encoder for mining information from single-cell transcriptomes.

FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) inhibits mTOR kinase activity via direct association. The FKBP12-mTOR association can be strengthened by the immunosuppressant rapamycin, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. We show here that the FKBP12-mTOR association is tightly regulated by an acetylation-deacetylation cycle. FKBP12 is acetylated on the lysine cluster (K45\/K48\/K53) by CREB-binding protein (CBP) in mammalian cells in response to nutrient treatment. Acetyl-FKBP12 associates with CBP acetylated Rheb. Rapamycin recruits SIRT2 with a high affinity for FKBP12 association and deacetylation. SIRT2-deacetylated FKBP12 then switches its association from Rheb to mTOR. Nutrient-activated mTOR phosphorylates IRF3S386 for the antiviral response. In contrast, rapamycin strengthening FKBP12-mTOR association blocks mTOR antiviral activity by recruiting SIRT2 to deacetylate FKBP12. Hence, on\/off mTOR activity in response to environmental nutrients relies on FKBP12 acetylation and deacetylation status in mammalian cells.","1053":"Superhydrophobic coatings have tremendous potential for protecting porous structures from corrosion. However, the weak adhesion and poor abrasion resistance have long been challenges for their real-life applications. Inspired by tree roots, we prepared a robust superhydrophobic coating by spraying fluorinated nanodiamonds (FNDs) on a permeable epoxy coating. The epoxy can not only coat the surface but also permeate deeply inside a porous substrate and consolidate in situ as tree roots in soil. Thus, the structure is thoroughly reinforced where the pull-off strength reaches 9.4 MPa for concrete. On the other hand, the surface is covered with immobilized FNDs, forming a superhydrophobic surface. Thanks to the ultra-hard FNDs, the coating surface has high abrasion resistance and its superhydrophobicity holds even after 100 abrasion cycles. Moreover, it exhibits self-cleaning, anti-icing, and anticorrosion performance. It is promising in protecting various porous structures such as concrete, wood, and untreated corroded steel.","1054":"","1055":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102957.].","1056":null,"1057":null,"1058":"Significant progress has been made in both fields of atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in recent years.

This logical operation requires keeping two alternatives open (A or B), until one of them is eliminated (if not A), allowing the inference: B is true.

We measured infants' preference for the correct face when both faces and the initial voice were presented again. Infant pupillary response was measured and utilized as an indicator of cognitive load at the critical moment of disjunctive inference. We controlled for other possible explanations in three additional experiments. Our results show that 10-month-olds can correctly deploy disjunction and negation to disambiguate scenes, suggesting that disjunctive inference does not rely on linguistic constructs.","1061":"The identification of proteins at the single-molecule level would open exciting new venues in biological research and disease diagnostics. Previously, we proposed a nanopore-based method for protein identification called chop-n-drop fingerprinting, in which the fragmentation pattern induced and measured by a proteasome-nanopore construct is used to identify single proteins. In the simulation study presented here, we show that 97.1% of human proteome constituents are uniquely identified under close to ideal measuring circumstances, using a simple alignment-based classification method. We show that our method is robust against experimental error, as 69.4% can still be identified if the resolution is twice as low as currently attainable, and 10% of proteasome restriction sites and protein fragments are randomly ignored. Based on these results and our experimental proof of concept, we argue that chop-n-drop fingerprinting has the potential to make cost-effective single-molecule protein identification feasible in the near future.","1062":null,"1063":"We study a population-based cellular model that starts from a single stem cell that divides stochastically to give rise to either daughter stem cells or differentiated daughter cells. There are three main components in the model: nucleus position, the underlying gene-regulatory network, and stochastic segregation of transcription factors in the daughter cells. The proportion of self-renewal and differentiated cell lines as a function of the nucleus position which in turn decides the plane of cleavage is studied. Both nuclear position and noise play an important role in determining the stem cell genealogies. We have observed both long and short genealogies in model simulation, and these compare well with experimental results from neuroblast and B-cell division. Symmetric divisions are observed in apical nuclei, while asymmetric division occurs when the nucleus is toward the base. In this model, the number of clones decreases over time, although the average clone size increases.","1064":"Quiescence is a dynamic process of reversible cell cycle arrest. High-level persistent expression of the HES1 transcriptional repressor, which oscillates with an ultradian periodicity in proliferative neural stem cells (NSCs), is thought to mediate quiescence. However, it is not known whether this is due to a change in levels or dynamics. Here, we induce quiescence in embryonic NSCs with BMP4, which does not increase HES1 level, and we find that HES1 continues to oscillate. To assess the role of HES1 dynamics, we express persistent HES1 under a moderate strength promoter, which overrides the endogenous oscillations while maintaining the total HES1 level within physiological range. We find that persistent HES1 does not affect proliferation or entry into quiescence; however, exit from quiescence is impeded. Thus, oscillatory expression of HES1 is specifically required for NSCs to exit quiescence, a finding of potential importance for controlling reactivation of stem cells in tissue regeneration and cancer.","1065":"Multi-component behavior is a form of goal-directed behavior that depends on the ability to execute various responses in a precise temporal order. Even though this function is vital for any species, little is known about how non-mammalian species accomplish such behavior and what the underlying neural mechanisms are. We show that humans and a non-mammalian species (pigeons) perform equally well in multi-component behavior and provide a validated experimental approach useful for cross-species comparisons. Applying molecular imaging methods, we identified brain regions most important for the examined behavioral dynamics in pigeons. Especially activity in the nidopallium intermedium medialis pars laterale (NIML) was specific to multi-component behavior since only activity in NIML was predictive for behavioral efficiency. The data suggest that NIML is important for hierarchical processing during goal-directed behavior and shares functional characteristics with the human inferior frontal gyrus in multi-component behavior.","1066":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. We developed a mouse model that mimics human CKD with inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, increased proteinuria, and associated reduction in glomerular filtration rate over time. Using this model, we show that genetic deficiency of SMOC2 or therapeutic silencing of SMOC2 with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) after disease onset significantly ameliorates inflammation, fibrosis, and kidney function loss. Mechanistically, we found that SMOC2 promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation by activation of diverse cellular signaling pathways including MAPKs, Smad, and Akt. Thus, targeting SMOC2 therapeutically offers an approach to prevent fibrosis progression and CKD after injury.","1067":"Magnesium is integral to many physiological processes, whereas variations in its levels, even within the normal range, can have critical implications for health. To explore the broad clinical effects of varying serum magnesium levels, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization and phenome-wide association study (MR-PheWAS) in the UK Biobank cohort. In total, MR-PheWAS analysis implicated a causal role of serum magnesium levels in five disease groups and six disease outcomes. In addition, our study indicated the gender-specific effects of nine disease groups\/outcomes in MR estimated effects. The protein-protein interaction network demonstrated an interaction between the serum magnesium-associated gene DCDC1 and the cataract- associated gene PAX6. The present study verified several previously reported disease outcomes and identified novel potential disease outcomes for serum magnesium levels. The DCDC1 gene and the PAX6 gene may be the new targets for promoting the treatments of cataracts using magnesium intervention.","1068":"Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of vascular permeability. Herein we aim to understand how acute and chronic exposures of VEGF induce different levels of vascular permeability. We demonstrate that chronic VEGF exposure leads to decreased phosphorylation of VEGFR2 and c-Src as well as steady increases of nitric oxide (NO) as compared to that of acute exposure. Utilizing heat-inducible VEGF transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) and establishing an algorithm incorporating segmentation techniques for quantification, we monitored acute and chronic VEGF-induced vascular hyperpermeability in real time. Importantly, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1), an enzyme essential for NO generation, was shown to play essential roles in both acute and chronic vascular permeability in cultured human cells, zebrafish model, and Miles assay. Taken together, our data reveal acute and chronic VEGF exposures induce divergent signaling pathways and identify DDAH1 as a critical player and potentially a therapeutic target of vascular hyperpermeability-mediated pathogenesis.","1069":null,"1070":"Although defective synaptic transmission was suggested to play a role in neurodegenerative diseases, the dynamics and vesicle pools of synaptic vesicles during neurodegeneration remain elusive. Here, we performed real-time three-dimensional tracking of single synaptic vesicles in cortical neurons from a mouse model of Huntington's disease (HD). Vesicles in HD neurons had a larger net displacement and radius of gyration compared with wild-type neurons. Vesicles with high release probability (Pr) were interspersed with low-Pr vesicles in HD neurons, whereas high-Pr vesicles were closer to fusion sites than low-Pr in wild-type neurons. Non-releasing vesicles in HD neurons had an abnormally high prevalence of irregular oscillatory motion. These abnormal dynamics and vesicle pools were rescued by overexpressing Rab11, and the abnormal irregular oscillatory motion was rescued by jasplakinolide. Our studies reveal the abnormal dynamics and pools of synaptic vesicles in the early stages of HD, suggesting a possible pathogenic mechanism of neurodegenerative diseases.","1071":null,"1072":null,"1073":null,"1074":null,"1075":"Neuronal activation is often accompanied by the regulation of cerebral hemodynamics via a process known as neurovascular coupling (NVC) which is essential for proper brain function and has been observed to be disrupted in a variety of neuropathologies. A comprehensive understanding of NVC requires imaging capabilities with high spatiotemporal resolution and a field-of-view that spans different orders of magnitude. Here, we present an approach for concurrent multi-contrast mesoscopic and two-photon microscopic imaging of neurovascular dynamics in the cortices of live mice. We investigated the spatiotemporal correlation between sensory-evoked neuronal and vascular responses in the auditory cortices of living mice using four imaging modalities. Our findings unravel drastic differences in the NVC at the regional and microvascular levels and the distinctive effects of different brain states on NVC. We further investigated the brain-state-dependent changes of NVC in large cortical networks and revealed that anesthesia and sedation caused spatiotemporal disruption of NVC.","1076":null,"1077":"Schlafen11 (SLFN11) is referred to as interferon (IFN)-inducible. Based on cancer genomic databases, we identified human acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemia cells with gain-of-function mutations in the Janus kinase (JAK) family as exhibiting high SLFN11 expression. In these cells, the clinical JAK inhibitors cerdulatinib, ruxolitinib, and tofacitinib reduced SLFN11 expression, but IFN did not further induce SLFN11 despite phosphorylated STAT1. We provide evidence that suppression of SLFN11 by JAK inhibitors is caused by inactivation of the non-canonical IFN pathway controlled by AKT and ERK. Accordingly, the AKT and ERK inhibitors MK-2206 and SCH77284 suppressed SLFN11 expression. Both also suppressed the E26 transformation-specific (ETS)-family genes ETS-1 and FLI-1 that act as transcription factors for SLFN11. Moreover, SLFN11 expression was inhibited by the ETS inhibitor TK216. Our study reveals that SLFN11 expression is regulated via the JAK, AKT and ERK, and ETS axis. Pharmacological suppression of SLFN11 warrants future studies.","1078":"Cocaine dependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder caused by lasting changes in the brain. Animal studies have identified cocaine-related alterations in striatal DNA methylation; however, it is unclear how methylation is related to cocaine dependence in humans. We generated methylomic profiles of the nucleus accumbens using human postmortem brains from a cohort of individuals with cocaine dependence and healthy controls (n = 25 per group). We found hypermethylation in a cluster of CpGs within the gene body of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), containing a putative binding site for the early growth response 1 (EGR1) transcription factor, which is hypermethylated in the caudate nucleus of cocaine-dependent individuals. We replicated this finding and found it to be specific to striatal neuronal nuclei. Furthermore, this locus demonstrates enhancer activity which is attenuated by methylation and enhanced by EGR1 overexpression. These results suggest that cocaine dependence alters the epigenetic regulation of dopaminergic signaling genes.","1079":null,"1080":null,"1081":"","1082":null,"1083":null,"1084":null,"1085":"Lipids, such as cholesterol and fatty acids, influence cell signaling, energy storage, and membrane formation. Cholesterol is biosynthesized through the mevalonate pathway, and aberrant metabolism causes metabolic diseases. The genetic association of a transcription factor NRF3 with obesity has been suggested, although the molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that NRF3 upregulates gene expression in SREBP2-dependent mevalonate pathway. We further reveal that NRF3 overexpression not only reduces lanosterol, a cholesterol precursor, but also induces the expression of the GGPS1 gene encoding an enzyme in the production of GGPP from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a lanosterol precursor. NRF3 overexpression also enhances cholesterol uptake through RAB5-mediated macropinocytosis process, a bulk and fluid-phase endocytosis pathway. Moreover, we find that GGPP treatment abolishes NRF3 knockdown-mediated increase of neutral lipids. These results reveal the potential roles of NRF3 in the SREBP2-dependent mevalonate pathway for cholesterol uptake through macropinocytosis induction and for lipogenesis inhibition through GGPP production.","1086":"Working memory and response inhibition are functions that mature relatively late in life, after adolescence, paralleling the maturation of the prefrontal cortex. The link between behavioral and neural maturation is not obvious, however, making it challenging to understand how neural activity underlies the maturation of cognitive function. To gain insights into the nature of observed changes in prefrontal activity between adolescence and adulthood, we investigated the progressive changes in unit activity of recurrent neural networks as they were trained to perform working memory and response inhibition tasks. These included increased delay period activity during working memory tasks and increased activation in antisaccade tasks. These findings reveal universal properties underlying the neuronal computations behind cognitive tasks and explicate the nature of changes that occur as the result of developmental maturation.","1087":null,"1088":null,"1089":"The densely glycosylated spike (S) protein highly exposed on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) surface mediates host cell entry by binding to the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the role of glycosylation has not been fully understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of different N-glycosylation of S1 protein on its binding to ACE2. Using real-time surface plasmon resonance assay the negative effects were demonstrated by the considerable increase of binding affinities of de-N-glycosylated S1 proteins produced from three different expression systems including baculovirus-insect, Chinese hamster ovarian and two variants of human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Molecular dynamic simulations of the S1 protein-ACE2 receptor complex revealed the steric hindrance and Coulombic repulsion effects of different types of N-glycans on the S1 protein interaction with ACE2. The results should contribute to future pathological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and therapeutic development of Covid-19, particularly using recombinant S1 proteins as models.","1090":"Taxane-based reagents, such as Taxol, Taxotere, and Abraxane, are popular anti-cancer drugs that can differ in their clinical efficacy. This difference is generally attributed to their active pharmaceutical ingredients. Here, we report a serendipitous discovery that Taxol induces metabolic dysregulation and unfolded protein response. Surprisingly, these effects of Taxol are entirely dependent on its excipient, Cremophor EL (CrEL). We show that CrEL promotes aerobic glycolysis and in turn results in drastic upregulation of angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4), a major regulator of human blood lipid profile. Notably, premedication with dexamethasone further enhances the expression of ANGPTL4. Consistently, we find that the amplitude and frequency of increase in triglycerides is more prominent in Taxol-treated patients with breast cancer. In addition, we find that CrEL activates the unfolded protein response pathway to trigger proinflammatory gene expression and caspase\/gasdermin E-dependent pyroptosis. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results in anti-cancer therapies.","1091":"Integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) promotes cancer metastasis through selective adhesion to ECM proteins; however, the specific contribution of integrin glycosylation remains uncertain. We provide evidence that ITGA2 is a highly glycosylated transmembrane protein expressed in ovarian cancer tissue and cell lines. In-depth glycoproteomics identified predominant N- and O-glycosylation sites harboring substantially divergent ITGA2 glycosylation profiles. Generated putative ITGA2 N-glycosite mutants halted collagen and laminin binding and cells lacking N-glycosylated ITGA2 were marginally adherent to collagen, likely associated with its enhanced proteasome degradation through poly-ubiquitination. Proteomic and enrichment pathway analysis revealed increased cellular apoptosis and collagen organization in non-glycosylated ITGA2 mutant cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that ITGA2-specific sialylation is involved in selective cell-ECM binding. These results highlight the importance of glycans in regulating ITGA2 stability and ligand binding capacity which in turn modulates downstream focal adhesion and promotes cell survival in a collagen environment.","1092":"Identifying the molecular mechanisms related to genomic breakage is an important goal of cancer mechanism studies. Among diverse locations of structural variants, fusion genes, which have the breakpoints in the gene bodies and are typically identified from the split reads of RNA-seq data, can provide a highlighted structural variant resource for studying the genomic breakages with expression and potential pathogenic impacts. In this study, we developed FusionAI, which utilizes deep learning to predict gene fusion breakpoints based on DNA sequence and let us identify fusion breakage code and genomic context. FusionAI leverages the known fusion breakpoints to provide a prediction model of the fusion genes from the primary genomic sequences via deep learning, thereby helping researchers a more accurate selection of fusion genes and better understand genomic breakage.","1093":null,"1094":null,"1095":null,"1096":null,"1097":"Control of mRNA stability and degradation is essential for appropriate gene expression, and its dysregulation causes various disorders, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, and obesity. The 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRN1 executes the last step of RNA decay, but its physiological impact is not well understood. To address this, forebrain-specific Xrn1 conditional knockout mice (Xrn1-cKO) were generated, as Xrn1 null mice were embryonic lethal. Xrn1-cKO mice exhibited obesity with leptin resistance, hyperglycemia, hyperphagia, and decreased energy expenditure. Obesity resulted from dysregulated communication between the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Moreover, expression of mRNAs encoding proteins that regulate appetite and energy expenditure was dysregulated in the hypothalamus of Xrn1-cKO mice. Therefore, we propose that XRN1 function in the hypothalamus is critical for maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.","1098":null,"1099":null,"1100":null,"1101":"The liver's remarkable regenerative capacity is orchestrated by several growth factors and cytokines. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (Fgfr3) is frequently overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and promotes cancer aggressiveness, whereas its role in liver homeostasis, repair and regeneration is unknown. We show here that Fgfr3 is expressed by hepatocytes in the healthy liver. Its major ligand, Fgf9, is mainly expressed by non-parenchymal cells and upregulated upon injury. Mice lacking Fgfr3 in hepatocytes exhibit increased tissue necrosis after acute toxin treatment and more excessive fibrosis after long-term injury. This was not a consequence of immunological alterations in the non-injured liver as revealed by comprehensive flow cytometry analysis. Rather, loss of Fgfr3 altered the expression of metabolic and pro-fibrotic genes in hepatocytes. These results identify a paracrine Fgf9-Fgfr3 signaling pathway that protects from toxin-induced cell death and the resulting liver fibrosis and suggests a potential use of FGFR3 ligands for therapeutic purposes.","1102":null,"1103":"Extracellular agonists linked to inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) formation elicit cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations in many cell types, but despite a common signaling pathway, distinct agonist-specific Ca2+ spike patterns are observed. Using qPCR, we show that rat hepatocytes express multiple purinergic P2Y and P2X receptors (R). ADP acting through P2Y1R elicits narrow Ca2+ oscillations, whereas UTP acting through P2Y2R elicits broad Ca2+ oscillations, with composite patterns observed for ATP. P2XRs do not play a role at physiological agonist levels. The discrete Ca2+ signatures reflect differential effects of protein kinase C (PKC), which selectively modifies the falling phase of the Ca2+ spikes. Negative feedback by PKC limits the duration of P2Y1R-induced Ca2+ spikes in a manner that requires extracellular Ca2+. By contrast, P2Y2R is resistant to PKC negative feedback. Thus, the PKC leg of the bifurcated IP3 signaling pathway shapes unique Ca2+ oscillation patterns that allows for distinct cellular responses to different agonists.","1104":"In eukaryotes, mRNA 3'-polyadenylation triggers poly(A) binding protein (PABP) recruitment and stabilization. In a stark contrast, polyadenylation marks mRNAs for degradation in bacteria. To study this difference, we trans-express the mammalian nuclear PABPN1 chromosomally and extra-chromosomally in Escherichia coli. Expression of PABPN1 but not the mutant PABPN1 stabilizes polyadenylated mRNAs and improves their half-lives. In the presence of PABPN1, 3'-exonuclease PNPase is not detected on PA-tailed mRNAs compromising the degradation. We show that PABPN1 trans-expression phenocopies pcnB (that encodes poly(A) polymerase, PAPI) mutation and regulates plasmid copy number. Genome-wide RNA-seq analysis shows a general up-regulation of polyadenylated mRNAs on PABPN1 expression, the largest subset of which are those involved in general stress response. However, major global stress regulators are unaffected on PABPN1 expression. Concomitantly, PABPN1 expression or pcnB mutation imparts cellular tolerance to multiple stresses. This study establishes mRNA 3'-polyadenylation as a general stress response mechanism in E. coli.","1105":"Two-dimensional black phosphorus (BP) has triggered tremendous research interest owing to its unique crystal structure, high carrier mobility, and tunable direct bandgap. Preparation of few-layer BP with high quality and stability is very important for its related research and applications in biomedicine, electronics, and optoelectronics. In this review, the synthesis methods of BP, including the preparation of bulk BP crystal which is an important raw material for preparing few-layer BP, the popular top-down methods, and some direct growth strategies of few-layer BP are comprehensively overviewed. Then chemical ways to enhance the stability of few-layer BP are concretely introduced. Finally, we propose a selection rule of preparation methods of few-layer BP according to the requirement of specific BP properties for different applications. We hope this review would bring some insight for future researches on BP and contributes to the acceleration of BP's commercial progress.","1106":"The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated energy insecurity and economic hardship among vulnerable populations. This paper provides robust empirical evidence of the degree to which COVID-19 mitigation measures, especially the mandates of school closure and limiting business operations, have impacted electricity consumption behavior in low-income and ethnic minority groups in the United States. We use a regression discontinuity design applied to individual-consumer-level high-frequency smart meter data in Arizona and Illinois to highlight the disparities in mitigation measure impacts. We find that the mandates of school closures and limiting business operations increase residential electricity consumption by 4-5%, but reduce commercial electricity consumption by 5-8%. Considerable heterogeneity is observed across income and race: low-income and ethnic-minority populations experience a larger electricity consumption increase, reflecting the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on electricity insecurity in the residential sector. Policies that address energy insecurity, especially during the pandemic, become essentially important.","1107":null,"1108":null,"1109":"Driven by technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and internet of things, the energy efficiency and throughput limitations of the von Neumann architecture are becoming more and more serious. As a new type of computer architecture, computing-in-memory is an alternative approach to alleviate the von Neumann bottleneck. Here, we have demonstrated two kinds of computing-in-memory designs based on two-surface-channel MoS2 transistors: symmetrical 4T2R Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell and skewed 3T3R SRAM cell, where the symmetrical SRAM cell can realize in-memory XNOR\/XOR computations and the skewed SRAM cell can achieve in-memory NAND\/NOR computations. Furthermore, since both the memory and computing units are based on two-surface-channel transistors with high area efficiency, the two proposed computing-in-memory SRAM cells consume fewer transistors, suggesting a potential application in highly area-efficient and multifunctional computing chips.","1110":"Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) are ideal platforms for the generation of a wide variety of organic scaffolds in a convergent and atom-economical manner. Many strategies for the generation of highly substituted and diverse structures have been developed and among these, the Petasis reaction represents a viable reaction manifold for the synthesis of substituted amines via coupling of an amine, an aldehyde and a boronic acid (BA). Despite its synthetic utility, the inherent drawbacks associated with the traditional two-electron Petasis reaction have stimulated continuous research towards more facile and tolerant methodologies. In this regard, we present the use of free alkyl BAs as effective radical precursors in this MCR through a single-electron transfer mechanism under mild reaction conditions. We have further demonstrated its applicability to photo-flow reactors, facilitating the reaction scale-up for the rapid assembly of complex molecular structures.","1111":null,"1112":"Transcription factors (TFs) are essential mediators of epigenetic regulation and modifiers of penetrance. Studies from the past decades have revealed a sub-class of TF that is capable of remodeling closed chromatin states through targeting nucleosomal motifs. This pioneer factor (PF) class of chromatin remodeler is ATP independent in its roles in epigenetic initiation, with nucleosome-motif recognition and association with repressive chromatin regions. Increasing evidence suggests that the fundamental properties of PFs can be coopted in human cancers. We explore the role of PFs in the larger context of tissue-specific epigenetic regulation. Moreover, we highlight an emerging class of chimeric PF derived from translocation partners in human disease and PFs associated with rare tumors. In the age of site-directed genome editing and targeted protein degradation, increasing our understanding of PFs will provide access to next-generation therapy for human disease driven from altered transcriptional circuitry.","1113":"A series of N-alkyl-substituted polybenzimidazoles (SPBIs), synthesized by simple condensation and N-alkylation, act as functional materials with tunable microstructures and sensing performance. For their controllable morphologies, the formation of nano-\/microspheres is observed at the n(RBr)\/n(PBI) feed ratio of 5:1. Products with different degrees of alkylation can recognize metal ions and nitroaromatic compounds (NACs). For example, SPBI-c, obtained at the feed ratio of 1:1, can selectively detect Cu2+, Fe3+, and NACs. By contrast, SPBI-a, obtained at the feed ratio of 0.1:1, can exclusively detect Cu2+ with high sensitivity. Their sensing mechanisms have been studied by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM, XPS, and DFT calculations. Interestingly, the SPBIs can adsorb Cu2+ in solution and show good recyclability. These results demonstrate that polymeric materials with both sensing and adsorption applications can be realized by regulating the alkylation extent of the main chain, thus providing a new approach for the facile synthesis of multifunctional materials.","1114":"The reliable assessment of battery degradation is fundamental for safe and efficient battery utilization. As an important in situ health diagnostic method, the incremental capacity (IC) analysis relies highly on the low-noise constant-current profiles, which violates the real-life scenarios. Here, a model-free fitting process is reported, for the first time, to reconstruct the IC trajectories from noisy or even current-varying profiles. Based on the results from overall 22 batteries with three case studies, the errors of the peak positions in the reconstructed IC trajectories can be bounded within only 0.25%. With health indicators extracted from the reconstructed IC trajectories, the state of health can be readily determined from simple linear mappings, with estimation error lower than 1% only. By enabling the IC-based methods under complex load profiles, enhanced health assessment could be implemented to improve the reliability of the power systems and further promoting a more sustainable society.","1115":null,"1116":null,"1117":null,"1118":"","1119":"Synthetic biology has the potential to revolutionize the biotech industry and our everyday lives and is already making an impact.

EuGeneCiD and EuGeneCiM preclude problematic designs leading to future synthetic biology application development pipelines. EuGeneCiD and EuGeneCiM are applied to developing 30 basic logic gates as genetic circuit conceptualizations which respond to heavy metal ions pairs as input signals for Arabidopsis thaliana.

Symbolic expression and personal ornamentation, new tool forms, and regional technological traditions are widely recognized as the earliest indicators of complex culture and cognition in humans. Here we describe a bone tool tradition from Contrebandiers Cave on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, dated between 120,000-90,000 years ago. The bone tools were produced for different activities, including likely leather and fur working, and were found in association with carnivore remains that were possibly skinned for fur. A cetacean tooth tip bears what is likely a combination of anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic modification and shows the use of a marine mammal tooth by early humans. The evidence from Contrebandiers Cave demonstrates that the pan-African emergence of complex culture included the use of multiple and diverse materials for specialized tool manufacture.","1121":null,"1122":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102478.].","1123":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101528.].","1124":null,"1125":null,"1126":"The shift of China's economy since 2013, dubbed the \"new normal\", has caused its production and consumption emissions to plateau, with the country seeming to embody the tantalizing promise of decoupling its economic growth from carbon emissions.

By applying structural decomposition analysis, we further explore the driving forces behind the slowdown in China's imported emissions growth, finding that it is attributable to restructuring of import patterns resulting from changes in the structures of domestic demand. These changes could have been caused by China moving along the global value chain and rebalancing its industrial linkages toward trade in carbon-efficient goods to avoid transferring emissions-intensive production to other regions, indicating a shift to less emissions-intensive trade rather than pure outsourcing.","1127":"Shift workers and many other groups experience irregular sleep-wake patterns. This can induce excessive daytime sleepiness that decreases productivity and elevates the risk of accidents. However, the degree of daytime sleepiness is not correlated with standard sleep parameters like total sleep time, suggesting other factors are involved. Here, we analyze real-world sleep-wake patterns of shift workers measured with wearables by developing a computational package that simulates homeostatic sleep pressure - physiological need for sleep - and the circadian rhythm. This reveals that shift workers who align sleep-wake patterns with their circadian rhythm have lower daytime sleepiness, even if they sleep less. The alignment, quantified by the sleep parameter, circadian sleep sufficiency, can be increased by dynamically adjusting daily sleep durations according to varying bedtimes. Our computational package provides flexible and personalized real-time sleep-wake patterns for individuals to reduce their daytime sleepiness and could be used with wearables to develop smart alarms.","1128":"Little is known about the diversity and function of adipose tissue nerves, due in part to the inability to effectively visualize the tissue's diverse nerve subtypes and the patterns of innervation across an intact depot. The tools to image and quantify adipose tissue innervation are currently limited. Here, we present a method of tissue processing that decreases tissue thickness in the z-axis while leaving cells intact for subsequent immunostaining. This was combined with autofluorescence quenching techniques to permit intact whole tissues to be mounted on slides and imaged by confocal microscopy, with a complementary means to perform whole tissue neurite density quantification after capture of tiled z-stack images. Additionally, we demonstrate how to visualize nerve terminals (the neuro-adipose nexus) in intact blocks of adipose tissue without z-depth reduction. We have included examples of data demonstrating nerve subtypes, neurovascular interactions, label-free imaging of collagen, and nerve bundle digital cross-sections.","1129":null,"1130":"Sustaining, maintaining, and upgrading the electricity grid, while meeting decarbonization goals is a challenge facing policymakers, regulators, grid operators, and investors. Simultaneously meeting demands for future capacity, retiring older inefficient technologies, and addressing externalities from energy production and use requires more diverse and inclusive technologies to avoid constraints and shortfalls in grid capability. Changing the energy production paradigm by encouraging alternative technologies was a key driver for FERC Order 2222. This stimulus for developing new small-scale generation will complement and supplement the existing fleet only if it attracts new investment. This investment must reflect technology that goes beyond the energy-only characteristics of traditional generation, creating systems where suites of energy-equivalent outputs are enhanced by environmental quality benefits and offsets.

The UPRmt is involved in a wide range of physiological and disease conditions, including aging, stem cell maintenance, innate immunity, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Here we report that the UPRmt is integral to zebrafish fin regeneration. Taking advantage of a novel zebrafish UPRmt reporter, we observed that UPRmt activation occurs in regenerating fin tissue shortly after injury. Through chemical and genetic approaches, we discovered that the Sirt1-UPRmt pathway, best known for its role in promoting lifespan extension, is crucial for fin regeneration. The metabolism of NAD+ is an important contributor to Sirt1 activity in this context. We propose that Sirt1 activation induces mitochondrial biogenesis in injured fin tissue, which leads to UPRmt activation and promotes tissue regeneration.","1134":"Recovering waste solvent for reuse presents an excellent alternative to improving the greenness of industrial processes. Implementing solvent recovery practices in the chemical industry is necessary, given the increasing focus on sustainability to promote a circular economy. However, the systematic design of recovery processes is a daunting task due to the complexities associated with waste stream composition, techno-economic analysis, and environmental assessment. Furthermore, the challenges to satisfy the desired product specifications, particularly in pharmaceuticals and specialty chemical industries, may also deter solvent recovery and reuse practices. To this end, this review presents a systems-level approach including various methodologies that can be implemented to design and evaluate efficient solvent recovery pathways.","1135":"The kidney local microenvironment (KLM) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis. However, the composition and regulation of a fibrotic KLM remain unclear. Through a multidisciplinary approach, we investigated the roles of the hepatocyte growth factor\/c-met signaling pathway in regulating KLM formation in various chronic kidney disease (CKD) models. We performed a retrospective analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data and determined that tubular epithelial cells and macrophages are two major cell populations in a fibrotic kidney. We then created a mathematical model that predicted loss of c-met in tubular cells would cause greater responses to injury than loss of c-met in macrophages. By generating c-met conditional knockout mice, we validated that loss of c-met influences epithelial plasticity, myofibroblast activation, and extracellular matrix synthesis\/degradation, which ultimately determined the characteristics of the fibrotic KLM.

Various markers or regulators associated with distinct phenotypes in melanoma have been identified, but, how does a network of interactions among these regulators give rise to multiple \"attractor\" states and phenotypic switching remains elusive. Here, we inferred a network of transcription factors (TFs) that act as master regulators for gene signatures of diverse cell-states in melanoma. Dynamical simulations of this network predicted how this network can settle into different \"attractors\" (TF expression patterns), suggesting that TF network dynamics drives the emergence of phenotypic heterogeneity. These simulations can recapitulate major phenotypes observed in melanoma and explain de-differentiation trajectory observed upon BRAF inhibition. Our systems-level modeling framework offers a platform to understand trajectories of phenotypic transitions in the landscape of a regulatory TF network and identify novel therapeutic strategies targeting melanoma plasticity.","1137":"Genome-scale metabolic reconstructions include all known biochemical reactions occurring in a cell. A typical application is the prediction of potential drug targets for cancer treatment. The precision of these predictions relies on the definition of the objective function. Generally, the biomass reaction is used to illustrate the growth capacity of a cancer cell. Today, seven human biomass reactions can be identified in published metabolic models. The impact of these differences on the metabolic model predictions has not been explored in detail. We explored this impact on cancer metabolic model predictions and showed that the metabolite composition and the associated coefficients had a large impact on the growth rate prediction accuracy, whereas gene essentiality predictions were mainly affected by the metabolite composition. Our results demonstrate the importance of defining a consensus biomass reaction compatible with most human models, which would contribute to ensuring the reproducibility and consistency of the results.","1138":"B cell follicles (BCFs) in lymph nodes (LNs) are generally exempt of CD8+ T and NK cells. African green monkeys (AGMs), a natural host of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), display NK cell-mediated viral control in BCF. NK cell migration into BCF in chronically SIVagm-infected AGM is associated with CXCR5+ NK cells. We aimed to identify the mechanism leading to CXCR5 expression on NK cells. We show that CXCR5+ NK cells in LN were induced following SIVagm infection. CXCR5+ NK cells accumulated preferentially in BCF with proliferating B cells. Autologous NK-B cell co-cultures in transwell chambers induced CXCR5+ NK cells. Transcriptome analysis of CXCR5+ NK cells revealed expression of bcl6 and IL6R. IL-6 induced CXCR5 on AGM and human NK cells. IL6 mRNA was detected in LN at higher levels during SIVagm than SIVmac infection and often produced by plasma cells. Our study reveals a mechanism of B cell-dependent NK cell regulation.","1139":"The release of excess glutamate following traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in glutamate excitotoxicity and metabolic energy failure. Endogenous mechanisms for reducing glutamate concentration in the brain parenchyma following TBI are poorly understood. Using multiple mass spectrometry approaches, we examined TBI-induced changes to glutamate metabolism. We present evidence that glutamate concentration can be reduced by glutamate oxidation via a \"truncated\" tricarboxylic acid cycle coupled to the urea cycle. This process reduces glutamate levels, generates carbon for energy metabolism, leads to citrulline accumulation, and produces nitric oxide. Several key metabolites are identified by metabolomics in support of this mechanism and the locations of these metabolites in the injured hemisphere are demonstrated by MALDI-MS imaging. The results of this study establish the advantages of multiple mass spectrometry approaches and provide insights into glutamate metabolism following TBI that could lead to improved treatment approaches.","1140":null,"1141":"The thalamus is critical for the brain's integrative hub functions; however, the localization and characterization of the different thalamic hubs remain unclear. Using a voxel-level network measure called functional connectivity overlap ratio (FCOR), we examined the thalamus' association with large-scale resting-state networks (RSNs) to elucidate its connector hub roles. Connections to the core-neurocognitive networks were localized in the anterior and medial parts, such as the anteroventral and mediodorsal nuclei areas. Regions functionally connected to the sensorimotor network were distinctively located around the lateral pulvinar nucleus but to a limited extent. Prominent connector hubs include the anteroventral, ventral lateral, and mediodorsal nuclei with functional connections to multiple RSNs. These findings suggest that the thalamus, with extensive connections to most of the RSNs, is well placed as a critical integrative functional hub and could play an important role for functional integration facilitating brain functions associated with primary processing and higher cognition.","1142":null,"1143":"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) persistently provides a prognosis improvement but only in a small fraction of patients with cancer due to immunotherapy resistance induced by the consecutive activated oncogenic pathways, including MAPK, Akt, and WNT pathway partially driven by Metadherin (MTDH). However, there is no study to investigate the potential role and mechanisms of MTDH in ICB-treated cancers. Here, we systematically explored the cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and independent cancer cohorts. Elevated MTDH expression was founded to associate with a worse overall survival and poorer immune response in patients with cancer. Dysregulated tumor-infiltrating immune cells and inhibitory immune checkpoint expression were correlated with MTDH expression. Furthermore, the mutual interactions between epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition, m6A-RNA-methylation, and MTDH may illustrate the potential mechanisms of MTDH resistant to ICB treatment. Although more designed experiments and trials are needed in the future, targeting MTDH may help to overcome immunotherapy resistance in a wide range of cancers.","1144":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that would permanently damage the affected joints. Unfortunately, a large proportion of RA patients fail to respond adequately to current treatments. Here, repurposing hemin and its ultra-long-acting formulation were explored for the effective treatment of RA in animal models. We provided evidence that hemin prevented the onset and ameliorated the clinical course of RA. Notably, hemin treatment rescued the dysregulated gene expression in animal models of RA, resulting in attenuation of Th1\/Th17 cell-mediated responses and proinflammatory cytokines. Moreover, we further formulated hemin into the in-situ forming implant, and a single injection of the ultra-long-acting hemin exerted potent disease-modifying effects for at least six weeks with a remarkable dose reduction. Taken together, given the potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, the once-monthly hemin injection holds promise for rapid clinical translation, and represents a potential strategy to treat RA and possibly other autoimmune diseases.","1145":"Small immunoglobulin superfamily (sIGSF) adhesion complexes form a corolla of microdomains around an integrin ring and secretory core during immunological synapse (IS) formation. The corolla recruits and retains major costimulatory\/checkpoint complexes, such as CD28, making forces that govern corolla formation of particular interest. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying molecular reorganization of CD2, an adhesion and costimulatory molecule of the sIGSF family during IS formation. Computer simulations showed passive distal exclusion of CD2 complexes under weak interactions with the ramified F-actin transport network. Attractive forces between CD2 and CD28 complexes relocate CD28 from the IS center to the corolla. Size-based sorting interactions with large glycocalyx components, such as CD45, or short-range CD2 self-attraction successfully explain the corolla 'petals.' This establishes a general simulation framework for complex pattern formation observed in cell-bilayer and cell-cell interfaces, and the suggestion of new therapeutic targets, where boosting or impairing characteristic pattern formation can be pivotal.","1146":"Pancreatic islets are essential for maintaining physiological blood glucose levels, and declining islet function is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes. We employ mass spectrometry-based proteomics to systematically analyze islets from 9 genetic or diet-induced mouse models representing a broad cross-section of metabolic health. Quantifying the islet proteome to a depth of &gt;11,500 proteins, this study represents the most detailed analysis of mouse islet proteins to date. Our data highlight that the majority of islet proteins are expressed in all strains and diets, but more than half of the proteins vary in expression levels, principally due to genetics. Associating these varied protein expression levels on an individual animal basis with individual phenotypic measures reveals islet mitochondrial function as a major positive indicator of metabolic health regardless of strain. This compendium of strain-specific and dietary changes to mouse islet proteomes represents a comprehensive resource for basic and translational islet cell biology.","1147":"Yeasts, broadly defined as unicellular fungi, fulfill essential roles in soil ecosystems as decomposers and nutrition sources for fellow soil-dwellers. Broad-scale investigations of soil yeasts pose a methodological challenge as metagenomics are of limited use for identifying this group of fungi. Here we characterize global soil yeast diversity using fungal DNA barcoding on 1473 yeasts cultured from 3826 soil samples obtained from nine countries in six continents. We identify mean annual precipitation and international air travel as two significant correlates with soil yeast community structure and composition worldwide. Evidence for anthropogenic influences on soil yeast communities, directly via travel and indirectly via altered rainfall patterns resulting from climate change, is concerning as we found common infectious yeasts frequently distributed in soil in several countries. Our discovery of 41 putative novel species highlights the continued need for culture-based studies to advance our knowledge of environmental yeast diversity.","1148":"The serine\/arginine-rich (SR) family of splicing factors plays important roles in mRNA splicing activation, repression, export, stabilization, and translation. SR-splicing factor 5 (SRSF5) is a glucose-inducible protein that promotes tumor cell growth. However, the functional role of SRSF5 in tissue development and disease remains unknown. Here, Srsf5 knockout (Srsf5 -\/- ) mice were generated using CRISPR-Cas9. Mutant mice were perinatally lethal and exhibited cardiac dysfunction with noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium. The left ventricular internal diameter and volume were increased in Srsf5 -\/- mice during systole. Null mice had abnormal electrocardiogram patterns, indicative of a light atrioventricular block. Mechanistically, Srsf5 promoted the alternative splicing of Myom1 (myomesin-1), a protein that crosslinks myosin filaments to the sarcomeric M-line. The switch between embryonic and adult isoforms of Myom1 could not be completed in Srsf5-deficient heart. These findings indicate that Srsf5-regulated alternative splicing plays a critical role during heart development.","1149":"The omnigenic\/polygenic theory, which states that complex traits are not shaped by single\/few genes, but by situation-specific large networks, offers an explanation for a major enigma in microbiology: deletion of specific small RNAs (sRNAs) playing key roles in various aspects of bacterial physiology, including virulence and antibiotic resistance, results in surprisingly subtle phenotypes. A recent study uncovered polar accumulation of most sRNAs upon osmotic stress, the majority not known to be involved in the applied stress. Here we show that cells deleted for a handful of pole-enriched sRNAs exhibit fitness defect in several stress conditions, as opposed to single, double, or triple sRNA-knockouts, implying that regulation by sRNA relies on sets of genes. Moreover, analysis of RNA-seq data of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium exposed to antibiotics and\/or infection-relevant conditions reveals the involvement of multiple sRNAs in all cases, in line with the existence of a polygenic plan for sRNA-mediated regulation.","1150":"The gut microbiome has been implicated as a key regulator of brain function in health and disease. But the impact of gut microbiota on functional brain connectivity is unknown. We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in germ-free and normally colonized mice under naive conditions and after ischemic stroke. We observed a strong, brain-wide increase of functional connectivity in germ-free animals. Graph theoretical analysis revealed significant higher values in germ-free animals, indicating a stronger and denser global network but with less structural organization. Breakdown of network function after stroke equally affected germ-free and colonized mice. Results from histological analyses showed changes in dendritic spine densities, as well as an immature microglial phenotype, indicating impaired microglia-neuron interaction in germ-free mice as potential cause of this phenomenon. These results demonstrate the substantial impact of bacterial colonization on brain-wide function and extend our so far mainly (sub) cellular understanding of the gut-brain axis.","1151":"FeRIC (Ferritin iron Redistribution to Ion Channels) is a magnetogenetic technique that uses radiofrequency (RF) alternating magnetic fields to activate the transient receptor potential channels, TRPV1 and TRPV4, coupled to cellular ferritins. In cells expressing ferritin-tagged TRPV, RF stimulation increases the cytosolic Ca2+ levels via a biochemical pathway. The interaction between RF and ferritin increases the free cytosolic iron levels that, in turn, trigger chemical reactions producing reactive oxygen species and oxidized lipids that activate the ferritin-tagged TRPV. In this pathway, it is expected that experimental factors that disturb the ferritin expression, the ferritin iron load, the TRPV functional expression, or the cellular redox state will impact the efficiency of RF in activating ferritin-tagged TRPV. Here, we examined several experimental factors that either enhance or abolish the RF control of ferritin-tagged TRPV. The findings may help optimize and establish reproducible magnetogenetic protocols.","1152":null,"1153":"The gut microbiota affects remote organ functions but its impact on organotypic endothelial cell (EC) transcriptomes remains unexplored. The liver endothelium encounters microbiota-derived signals and metabolites via the portal circulation. To pinpoint how gut commensals affect the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium, a magnetic cell sorting protocol, combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, was used to isolate hepatic sinusoidal ECs from germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice for transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing. This resulted in a comprehensive map of microbiota-regulated hepatic EC-specific transcriptome profiles. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that several functional processes in the hepatic endothelium were affected. The absence of microbiota influenced the expression of genes involved in cholesterol flux and angiogenesis. Specifically, genes functioning in hepatic endothelial sphingosine metabolism and the sphingosine-1-phosphate pathway showed drastically increased expression in the GF state. Our analyses reveal a prominent role for the microbiota in shaping the transcriptional landscape of the hepatic endothelium.","1154":"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used as the energy carrier in our daily life. However, the higher energy density of LIBs results in poor safety performance. Thermal runaway (TR) is the critical problem which hinders the further application of LIBs. Clarifying the mechanism of TR evolution is beneficial to safer cell design and safety management. In this paper, liquid nitrogen spray is proved to be an effective way to stop the violent reaction of LIBs during the TR process. Based on extended-volume accelerating rate calorimetry, the liquid nitrogen ceasing combined with non-atmospheric exposure analysis is used to investigate the TR evolution about LiFePO4\/graphite batteries at critical temperature. Specifically, the geometrical shape, voltage, and impedance change are monitored during the TR process on the cell level. The morphologies\/constitution of electrodes and separators are presented on the component level. Utilizing the gas analysis, the failure mechanism of the prismatic LiFePO4\/graphite battery is studied comprehensively.","1155":null,"1156":"The suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are negative regulators of cytokine signaling required to prevent excessive cellular responses. In particular, SOCS3 is involved in the regulation of metabolic syndromes, such as obesity and diabetes, by suppressing leptin and insulin signals. SOCS3 also suppresses the inflammatory response associated with metabolic stress, but this specific role remains undefined. Wild-type mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) exhibited only fatty liver, whereas systemic deletion of SOCS3 resulted in excessive myeloid hematopoiesis and hepatic inflammation. In addition, depletion of the gut microbiota resulted in considerable improvement in excess granulopoiesis and splenomegaly, halting the progression of systemic inflammation in SOCS3KO mice on the HFD. This result suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is involved in inflammation associated with SOCS3KO. Although contributing to diet-induced obesity and fatty liver, SOCS3 is nevertheless critical to suppress excess myeloid hematopoiesis and severe systemic inflammation associated with intestinal dysbiosis on HFD.","1157":null,"1158":null,"1159":"Cancer is an organism-level disease, impacting processes from cellular metabolism and the microenvironment to systemic immune response. Nevertheless, efforts to distinguish overarching mutational processes from interactions with the cell of origin for a tumor have seen limited success, presenting a barrier to individualized medicine. Here we present a pathway-centric approach, extracting somatic mutational profiles within and between tissues, largely orthogonal to cell of origin, mutational burden, or stage. Known predisposition variants are equally distributed among clusters, and largely independent of molecular subtype. Prognosis and risk of death vary jointly by cancer type and cluster. Analysis of metastatic tumors reveals that differences are largely cluster-specific and complementary, implicating convergent mechanisms that combine familiar driver genes with diverse low-frequency lesions in tumor-promoting pathways, ultimately producing distinct molecular phenotypes. The results shed new light on the interplay between organism-level dysfunction and tissue-specific lesions.","1160":null,"1161":"The COVID-19 pandemic poses enormous challenges to global healthcare sectors. To prevent the overburden of medical systems, it is crucial to distinguish individuals approaching the most infectious early phase from those in the declining non-infectious phase. However, a large fraction of transmission events occur during pre- or asymptomatic phases. Especially in the absence of symptoms, it is difficult to distinguish prodromal from late phases of infection just by RT-PCR since both phases are characterized by low viral loads and corresponding high Ct values (&gt;30). We evaluated a new rapid test detecting IgG antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein using two commercial antibody assays and an in-house neutralization test before determining suitability for testing clinical swab material. Our analyses revealed the combination of the well-known RT-PCR and the new rapid antibody test using one single clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimen as a fast, cost-effective, and reliable way to discriminate prodromal from subsiding phases of COVID-19.","1162":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 220 million infections and 4.5 million deaths worldwide. Current risk factor cannot fully explain the diversity in disease severity. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a broad range of patients' laboratory and clinical assessments to investigate the genetic contributions to COVID-19 severity. By performing GWAS analysis, we discovered several concrete associations for laboratory traits and used Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to further investigate the causality of traits on disease severity. Two causal traits, WBC counts and cholesterol levels, were identified based on MR study, and their functional genes are located at genes MHC complex and ApoE, respectively. Our gene-based analysis and GSEA revealed four interferon pathways, including type I interferon receptor binding and SARS coronavirus and innate immunity. We hope that our work will contribute to studying the genetic mechanisms of disease and serve as a useful reference for COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment.","1163":"The role of preoptic GABAergic inhibitory neurons was addressed in parenting, anxiety and depression. Pup exposure and forced swimming resulted in similar c-Fos activation pattern in neurons expressing vesicular GABA transporter in the preoptic area with generally stronger labeling and different distributional pattern in females than in males. Chemogenetic stimulation of preoptic GABAergic cells resulted in elevated maternal motivation and caring behavior in females and mothers but aggression toward pups in males. Behavioral effects were the opposite following inhibition of preoptic GABAergic neurons suggesting their physiological relevance. In addition, increased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors were found following chemogenetic stimulation of the same neurons in females, whereas previous pup exposure increased only anxiety-like behavior suggesting that not the pups, but overstimulation of the cells can lead to depression-like behavior. A sexually dimorphic projection pattern of preoptic GABAergic neurons was also identified, which could mediate sex-dependent parenting and associated emotional behaviors.","1164":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has elicited a unique mobilization of the scientific community to develop efficient tools to understand and combat the infection. Like other coronavirae, SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cell secretory machinery to produce viral proteins that compose the nascent virions; including spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins, the most exposed transmembrane proteins to the host immune system. As antibody response is part of the anti-viral immune arsenal, we investigate the immunogenic potential of S, E, and M using a human cell-based system to mimic membrane insertion and N-glycosylation. Both S and M elicit specific Ig production in patients with SARS-CoV-2. Patients with moderate and severe diseases exhibit elevated Ig responses. Finally, reduced Ig binding was observed with spike G614 compared to D614 variant. Altogether, our assay points toward an unexpected immune response against M and represents a powerful tool to test humoral responses against actively evolving SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccine effectiveness.","1165":null,"1166":"Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (LIFUS) holds promise for the remote modulation of neural activity, but an incomplete mechanistic characterization hinders its clinical maturation. Here we developed a computational framework to model intramembrane cavitation (a candidate mechanism) in multi-compartment, morphologically structured neuron models, and used it to investigate ultrasound neuromodulation of peripheral nerves. We predict that by engaging membrane mechanoelectrical coupling, LIFUS exploits fiber-specific differences in membrane conductance and capacitance to selectively recruit myelinated and\/or unmyelinated axons in distinct parametric subspaces, allowing to modulate their activity concurrently and independently over physiologically relevant spiking frequency ranges. These theoretical results consistently explain recent empirical findings and suggest that LIFUS can simultaneously, yet selectively, engage different neural pathways, opening up opportunities for peripheral neuromodulation currently not addressable by electrical stimulation. More generally, our framework is readily applicable to other neural targets to establish application-specific LIFUS protocols.","1167":"A critical question in the conservation of large mammals in the Anthropocene is to know the extent to which they can tolerate human disturbance. Surprisingly, little quantitative data is available about large-scale effects of human activity and land use on their broad scale distribution in Europe. In this study, we quantify the relative importance of human land use and protected areas as opposed to biophysical constraints on large mammal distribution. We analyze data on large mammal distribution to quantify the relative effect of anthropogenic variables on species' distribution as opposed to biophysical constraints. We finally assess the effect of anthropogenic variables on the size of the species' niche by simulating a scenario where we assumed no anthropogenic pressure on the landscape. Results show that large mammal distribution is primarily constrained by biophysical constraints rather than anthropogenic variables. This finding offers grounds for cautious optimism concerning wildlife conservation in the Anthropocene.","1168":"The new generation, i.e., second- and third-generation, drug-eluting stents (DESs) remain a risk of in-stent restenosis (ISR). We evaluated the power of a genetic risk score (GRS) model to identify high-risk populations for new generation DES ISR. We enrolled patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) treated with new generations DESs by a single-center cohort study in Taiwan and evaluated their genetic profile. After propensity score matching, there were 343 patients and 153 patients in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. Five selected single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e., SNPs in CAMLG, GALNT2, C11orf84, THOC5, and SAMD11, were included to calculate the GRS for new generation DES ISR. In the derivation and the validation cohorts, patients with a GRS greater than or equal to 3 had significantly higher new generation DES ISR rates. We provide biological information for interventional cardiologists prior to percutaneous coronary intervention by specific five SNP-derived GRS.","1169":null,"1170":null,"1171":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by a loss of self-tolerance, systemic inflammation, and multi-organ damage. While a variety of therapeutic interventions are available, it has become clear that an early diagnosis and treatment may be key to achieve long lasting therapeutic responses and to limit irreversible organ damage. Loss of humoral tolerance including the appearance of self-reactive antibodies can be detected years before the actual onset of the clinical autoimmune disease, representing a potential early point of intervention. Not much is known, however, about how and to what extent this pre-phase of disease impacts the onset and development of subsequent autoimmunity. By targeting the B cell compartment in the pre-disease phase of a spontaneous mouse model of SLE we now show, that resetting the humoral immune system during the clinically unapparent phase of the disease globally alters immune homeostasis delaying the downstream development of systemic autoimmunity.","1172":"Our experiences shape our knowledge and understanding of the world around us. The natural vibrational environment (vibroscape) is hidden to human senses but is nevertheless perceived and exploited by the majority of animals. Here, we show that the vibroscape recorded on plants in a temperate hay meadow is a dynamic low-frequency world, rich in species-specific vibrational signals. The overall vibroscape composition changed throughout the season and also depended on the plant species, as well as on the spatial position of individual plants within the meadow. Within the studied community, vibrationally signaling species sharing this communication channel avoided interference primarily by partitioning vibrational space on a fine temporal scale. The vibroscape is a reliable source of information in the environment and expands our understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes.","1173":null,"1174":null,"1175":null,"1176":null,"1177":null,"1178":null,"1179":null,"1180":"The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has becoming the bottleneck of largescale implementation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, when it comes to the ORR activity assessing of platinum group metals (PGMs) with rotating disk electrode, the corresponding potential conversion vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, test protocols, and activity calculation processes are still in chaos in many published literatures. In this work, two standard calculation processes for PGM ORR activities are demonstrated, followed by a specification for the usage of reference electrodes. Then a 4-fold discrepancy in ORR activities obtained via different test protocols is found for the same Pt\/C, and an average adsorption model and the \"coverage effects\" are proposed to illustrate the hysteresis loop between negative and positive-going ORR polarization plots. Finally, four motions over appropriate assessment of PGM ORR activity are emphasized, hoping to bring a fair communication platform for researchers from different groups.","1181":"Humans and animals can achieve agile and efficient movements because the muscle can operate in different modes depending on its intrinsic mechanical properties. For bioinspired robotics and prosthetics, it is highly desirable to have artificial actuators with muscle-like properties. However, it still remains a challenge to realize both intrinsic muscle-like force-velocity and force-length properties in one single actuator simultaneously. This study presents a bioinspired soft actuator, named HimiSK (highly imitating skeletal muscle), designed by spatially arranging a set of synergistically contractile units in a flexible matrix similar to skeletal musculature. We have demonstrated that the actuator presents both intrinsic force-velocity and force-length characteristics that are very close to biological muscle with inherent self-stability and robustness in response to external perturbations. These outstanding properties result from the bioinspired architecture and the adaptive morphing of the flexible matrix material, which adapts automatically to mechanically diverse tasks without reliance on sensors and controllers.","1182":null,"1183":"Using antibody arrays, we found that the RNA helicase DDX3 modulates the expression of secreted signaling factors in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Ribo-seq analysis confirmed amphiregulin (AREG) as a translational target of DDX3. AREG exerts important biological functions in cancer, including promoting cell migration and paracrine effects of OSCC cells and reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME) of OSCC in mice. DDX3-mediated translational control of AREG involves its 3'-untranslated region. Proteomics identified the signal recognition particle (SRP) as an unprecedented interacting partner of DDX3. DDX3 and SRP54 were located near the endoplasmic reticulum, regulated the expression of a common set of secreted factors, and were essential for targeting AREG mRNA to membrane-bound polyribosomes. Finally, OSCC-associated mutant DDX3 increased the expression of AREG, emphasizing the role of DDX3 in tumor progression via SRP-dependent, endoplasmic reticulum-associated translation. Therefore, pharmacological targeting of DDX3 may inhibit the tumor-promoting functions of the TME.","1184":null,"1185":null,"1186":"Organisms in nature grow with senses, nervous, and actuation systems coordinated in ingenious ways to sustain metabolism and other essential life activities. The understanding of biological structures and functions guide the construction of soft robotics with unprecedented performances.

The development trends of bioinspired soft robotics toward closed loop and embodiment are proposed. Challenges for obtaining autonomous soft robotics similar to natural organisms are outlined to provide a perspective in this field.","1187":"ERK1\/2 involvement in cell death remains unclear, although many studies have demonstrated the importance of ERK1\/2 dynamics in determining cellular responses. To untangle how ERK1\/2 contributes to two cell death programs, we investigated ERK1\/2 signaling dynamics during hFasL-induced apoptosis and TNF-induced necroptosis in L929 cells. We observed that ERK1\/2 inhibition sensitizes cells to apoptosis while delaying necroptosis. By monitoring ERK1\/2 activity by live-cell imaging using an improved ERK1\/2 biosensor (EKAR4.0), we reported differential ERK1\/2 signaling dynamics between cell survival, apoptosis, and necroptosis. We also decrypted a temporally shifted amplitude- and frequency-modulated (AM\/FM) ERK1\/2 activity profile in necroptosis versus apoptosis. ERK1\/2 inhibition, which disrupted ERK1\/2 signaling dynamics, prevented TNF and IL-6 gene expression increase during TNF-induced necroptosis. Using an inducible cell line for activated MLKL, the final executioner of necroptosis, we showed ERK1\/2 and its distinctive necroptotic ERK1\/2 activity dynamics to be positioned downstream of MLKL.","1188":"Circulating tumor cells are metastatic precursors in several cancer types. Their biology and clinical utility are subject to numerous investigations, yet one aspect that is often neglected is their entanglement with the tumor microenvironment, namely the cross talk with stromal and immune cells and their relationships with other tumor-derived components such as circulating tumor DNA and extracellular vesicles in circulation. We will focus our short review specifically on these aspects, i.e., providing some examples of the liaison that circulating tumor cells have with stromal or immune cells and illustrating their relationship with other circulating tumor derivatives such as circulating tumor DNA and extracellular vesicles.","1189":"DNA nanotechnology offers new biosensing approaches by templating different sensor and transducer components. Here, we combine DNA origami nanoantennas with label-free antibody detection by incorporating a nanoswitch in the plasmonic hotspot of the nanoantenna. The nanoswitch contains two antigens that are displaced by antibody binding, thereby eliciting a fluorescent signal. Single-antibody detection is demonstrated with a DNA origami integrated anti-digoxigenin antibody nanoswitch. In combination with the nanoantenna, the signal generated by the antibody is additionally amplified. This allows the detection of single antibodies on a portable smartphone microscope. Overall, fluorescence-enhanced antibody detection in DNA origami nanoantennas shows that fluorescence-enhanced biosensing can be expanded beyond the scope of the nucleic acids realm.","1190":"Differences in ionic strength, pH, temperature, shear forces, and other environmental factors impact adhesion, and organisms have evolved various strategies to optimize their adhesins for their specific environmental conditions. Many species of Alphaproteobacteria, including members of the order Caulobacterales, use a polar adhesin, called holdfast, for surface attachment and subsequent biofilm formation in both freshwater and marine environments. Hirschia baltica, a marine member of Caulobacterales, produces a holdfast adhesin that tolerates a drastically higher ionic strength than the holdfast produced by its freshwater relative, Caulobacter crescentus. In this work, we show that the holdfast polysaccharide deacetylase HfsH plays an important role in adherence in high-ionic-strength environments. We show that increasing expression of HfsH improves holdfast binding in high-ionic-strength environments. We conclude that HfsH plays a role in modulating holdfast binding at high ionic strength and hypothesize that this modulation occurs through varied deacetylation of holdfast polysaccharides.","1191":"In recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention because of their high energy conversion efficiency, low cost, and simple preparation process. Up to now, the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells has been increased from 3.8% to 25.5%. Metal-organic skeleton-derived metal oxides and their composites (MOFs) are widely considered for application in PSCs due to their low and flat charge\/discharge potential plateau, high capacity, and stable cycling performance. By combining MOFs and PSCs, based on the composition materials of perovskite film, electron transport layer, hole transport layer, and interfacial interlayer of PSCs, this article discusses the photovoltaic performance or structure optimization effect of MOFs in each function layer, which is of great significance to improve the photovoltaic performance of the cell. The problems faced by MOFs on perovskite solar cells are summarized, the next research directions are discussed, and the development of this crossover area of MOFs-PSC is foreseen to accelerate the comprehensive research and popularization of MOFs on PSCs.","1192":null,"1193":null,"1194":"TENM4, encoding a member of the teneurin protein family, is a risk gene shared by many types of mental diseases and is implicated in neuronal plasticity and signaling. However, the role and the mechanisms of TENM4 in schizophrenia (SCZ) remain unclear. We identified possible pathogenic mutations in the TENM4 gene through target sequencing of TENM4 in 68 SCZ families. We further demonstrated that aberrant expression of Ten-m leads to lower learning ability, sleep reduction, and increased aggressiveness in animal models. RNA sequencing showed that aberrant expression of Ten-m was related to stimulus perception and metabolic process, and Gene Ontology enrichment terms were neurogenesis and ATPase activity. This study provides strong evidence that TENM4 contributes to SCZ, and its functional mutations might be responsible for the impaired neural circuits and behaviors observed in SCZ.","1195":null,"1196":"","1197":"Circadian clocks are important to much of life on Earth and are of inherent interest to humanity, implicated in fields ranging from agriculture and ecology to developmental biology and medicine.

Recent years have also seen impressive advances in synthetic biology to the point where parallels can be drawn between synthetic biological and circadian oscillators. This review will emphasize theoretical and experimental studies that have revealed a fascinating dichotomy of coupling and heterogeneity among circadian clocks. We will also consolidate the fields of chronobiology and synthetic biology, discussing key design principles of their respective oscillators.","1198":"Light olefins are the precursors of all modern-day plastics. Olefin is always mixed with paraffins in the time of production, and therefore it needs to be separated from paraffins to produce polymer-grade olefin. The state-of-the-art separation technique, cryogenic distillation, is highly expensive and hazardous. Adsorption could be a novel, sustainable, and inexpensive separation strategy, provided a suitable adsorbent can be designed. There are different types of mechanisms that were harnessed for the separation of olefins by adsorption, and in this review, we have focused our discussion on those mechanisms. These mechanisms include, (a) Affinity-based separation, like pi complexation and hydrogen bonding, (b) Separation based on pore size and shape, like size-exclusion and gate-opening effect, and (c) Non-equilibrium separation, like kinetic separation. In this review, we have elaborated each of the separation strategies from the fundamental level and explained their roles in the separation processes of different types of paraffins and olefins.","1199":null,"1200":null,"1201":"Hypoxia is a critical factor in solid tumors that has been associated with cancer progression and aggressiveness. We recently developed a hypoxia fate mapping system to trace post-hypoxic cells within a tumor for the first time. This approach uses an oxygen-dependent fluorescent switch and allowed us to measure key biological features such as oxygen distribution, cell proliferation, and migration. We developed a computational model to investigate the motility and phenotypic persistence of hypoxic and post-hypoxic cells during tumor progression. The cellular behavior was defined by phenotypic persistence time, cell movement bias, and the fraction of cells that respond to an enhanced migratory stimulus. This work combined advanced cell tracking and imaging techniques with mathematical modeling, to reveal that a persistent invasive migratory phenotype that develops under hypoxia is required for cellular escape into the surrounding tissue, promoting the formation of invasive structures (\"plumes\") that expand toward the oxygenated tumor regions.","1202":null,"1203":"Early quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) technologies have unsatisfactory versatility and accuracy in fields such as drug discovery because they are based on traditional machine learning and interpretive expert features.

Here we discuss the integration of wet experiments (which provide experimental data and reliable verification), molecular dynamics simulation (which provides mechanistic interpretation at the atomic\/molecular levels), and machine learning (including deep learning) techniques to improve QSAR models. We first review the history of traditional QSAR and point out its problems. We then propose a better QSAR model characterized by a new iterative framework to integrate machine learning with disparate data input. Finally, we discuss the application of QSAR and machine learning to many practical research fields, including drug development and clinical trials.","1204":null,"1205":null,"1206":"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have been widely recognized as key players in regulating blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, and their roles are unclear in ischemic stroke. Myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) is essential for VSMC contraction and maintaining healthy vasculature. We generated VSMC-specific MYPT1 knockout (MYPT1SMKO) mice and cultured VSMCs infected with Lv-shMYPT1 to explore phenotypic switching of VSMCs and the accompanied impacts on BBB integrity. We found that MYPT1 deficiency induced phenotypic switching of synthetic VSMCs, which aggravated BBB disruption. Proteomic analysis identified evolutionarily conserved signaling intermediates in Toll pathways (ECSIT) as a downstream molecule that promotes activation of synthetic VSMCs and contributed to IL-6 expression. Knocking down ECSIT rescued phenotypic switching of VSMCs and BBB disruption. Additionally, inhibition of IL-6 decreased BBB permeability. These findings reveal that MYPT1 deficiency activated phenotypic switching of synthetic VSMCs and induced BBB disruption through ECSIT-IL-6 signaling after ischemic stroke.","1207":"Chemical modification on mRNA can recruit specific binding proteins (readers\/partners) to determine post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the identification of the reader is extremely limited owing to the rather weak and highly dynamic non-covalent interactions between mRNA modification and reader, and therefore the sensitive and robust approaches are desirable. Here, we report a DNA-guided photoactivatable-based chemical proteomic approach for profiling the readers of mRNA methylation. By use of N6-methyladenosine (m6A), we illustrated that this method can be successfully utilized for labelling and enriching the readers of mRNA modification, as well as for the discovery of new partners. Thus we applied this strategy to a new modification 2'-O-methyladenosine. As a result, DDX1 was identified and verified as a potential binding protein. Our study therefore provides a powerful chemical proteomics tool for identifying the binding factors of mRNA modification and reveals the underlying function of mRNA modification.","1208":"Mitochondrial biogenesis is a cell response to external stimuli which is generally believed to suppress apoptosis. However, during the process of apoptosis, whether mitochondrial biogenesis occurs in the early stage of the apoptotic cells remains unclear. To address this question, we constructed the COX8-EGFP-ACTIN-mCherry HeLa cells with recombinant fluorescent proteins respectively tagged on the nucleus and mitochondria and monitored the mitochondrial changes in the living cells exposed to gamma-ray radiation. Besides in situ detection of mitochondrial fluorescence changes, we also examined the cell viability, nuclear DNA damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial superoxide, citrate synthase activity, ATP, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial calcium, mitochondrial mass, mitochondrial morphology, and protein expression related to mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as the apoptosis biomarkers. As a result, we confirmed that significant mitochondrial biogenesis took place preceding the radiation-induced apoptosis, and it was closely correlated with the apoptotic cells at late stage. The involved mechanism was also discussed.","1209":null,"1210":"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus, is a global health issue with unprecedented challenges for public health. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects cells of the respiratory tract via spike glycoprotein binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2). Circadian rhythms coordinate an organism's response to its environment and can regulate host susceptibility to virus infection. We demonstrate that silencing the circadian regulator Bmal1 or treating lung epithelial cells with the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 reduces ACE2 expression and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication. Importantly, treating infected cells with SR9009 limits SARS-CoV-2 replication and secretion of infectious particles, showing that post-entry steps in the viral life cycle are influenced by the circadian system. Transcriptome analysis revealed that Bmal1 silencing induced interferon-stimulated gene transcripts in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, providing a mechanism for the circadian pathway to limit SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Immunoprecipitation of STING from isolated nuclear envelopes coupled with mass spectrometry revealed a distinct nuclear envelope-STING proteome consisting of known nuclear membrane proteins and enriched in DNA- and RNA-binding proteins. Seventeen of these nuclear envelope STING partners are known to bind direct interactors of IRF3\/7 transcription factors, and testing a subset of these revealed STING partners SYNCRIP, MEN1, DDX5, snRNP70, RPS27a, and AATF as novel modulators of dsDNA-triggered IIRs.

In humans, their physical but not functional interactions were thoughtfully investigated. Here we have screened cells deficient in DIS3, XRN2, EXOSC10, DIS3L, and DIS3L2 with a custom siRNA library and determined their genetic interactions (GIs) with diverse pathways of RNA metabolism. We uncovered a complex network of positive interactions that buffer alterations in RNA degradation and reveal reciprocal cooperation with genes involved in transcription, RNA export, and splicing. Further, we evaluated the functional distinctness of nuclear DIS3 and cytoplasmic DIS3L using a library of all known genes associated with RNA metabolism. Our analysis revealed that DIS3 mutation suppresses RNA splicing deficiency, while DIS3L GIs disclose the interplay of cytoplasmic RNA degradation with nuclear RNA processing. Finally, genome-wide DIS3 GI map uncovered relations with genes not directly involved in RNA metabolism, like microtubule organization or regulation of telomerase activity.","1217":null,"1218":"Newly emerging or re-emerging viral infections continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality every year worldwide, resulting in serious effects on both health and the global economy. Despite significant drug discovery research against dengue viruses (DENVs) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), no fully effective and specific drugs directed against these viruses have been discovered. Here, we examined the anti-DENV activity of tubercidin derivatives from a compound library from Hokkaido University and demonstrated that 5-hydroxymethyltubercidin (HMTU, HUP1108) possessed both potent anti-flavivirus and anti-coronavirus activities at submicromolar levels without significant cytotoxicity. Furthermore, HMTU inhibited viral RNA replication and specifically inhibited replication at the late stages of the SARS-CoV-2 infection process. Finally, we demonstrated that HMTU 5'-triphosphate inhibited RNA extension catalyzed by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Our findings suggest that HMTU has the potential of serving as a lead compound for the development of a broad spectrum of antiviral agents, including SARS-CoV-2.","1219":null,"1220":"Proteins carry out life's essential functions.

However, a significant barrier to achieving this goal is controlling protein\/peptide translocation through the nanopore sensor for processive strand analysis. Here, we review recent approaches that use a range of techniques, from oligonucleotide conjugation to molecular motors, aimed at driving protein strands and peptides through protein nanopores.

As an electron shuttles (mediators), phenazines are involved in several biological processes facilitating extracellular electron transfer (EET). Therefore, it is of great importance to understand the structural and electronic properties of phenazines that promote EET in microbial electrochemical systems. Our previous study experimentally investigated a phenazine-based library as an exogenous mediator system to facilitate EET in Escherichia coli. Herein, we combine our experimental data with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and multivariate linear regression modeling to understand the structure-function relationships in phenazine-based mediated EET. These calculations demonstrate that the computed redox properties of phenazines in lipophilic environments (e.g., cell membrane) correlate to experimental mediated current densities. Additional DFT-derived molecular properties were considered to develop a predictive model, which could be used in metabolic engineering approaches to introduce phenazines as endogenous mediators into bacteria.","1223":"p-Methyl benzaldehyde (p-MBA) is a class of key chemical intermediates of pharmaceuticals. Conventional industrial processes for p-MBA production involve the consecutive photochlorination, amination, and acid hydrolysis of petroleum-derived p-xylene, while producing vast pollutants and waste water. Herein, we report a direct, green route for selective synthesis of p-MBA from acetaldehyde using a diphenyl prolinol trimethylsilyl ether catalyst. The optimized p-MBA selectivity is up to 90% at an acetaldehyde conversion as high as 99.8%. Intermediate structure and 18O-isotope data revealed that the conversion of acetaldehyde to p-methylcyclohexadienal intermediates proceeds in an enamine-iminium intermediate mechanism. Then, controlled experiments and D-isotope results indicated that the dehydrogenation of p-methylcyclohexadienal to p-MBA and H2 is catalyzed by the same amines through an iminium intermediate. This is an example that metal-free amines catalyze the dehydrogenation (releasing H2), rather than using metals or stoichiometric oxidants.","1224":null,"1225":"Age is the major risk factor in most carcinomas, yet little is known about how proteomes change with age in any human epithelium.

Data were quality controlled and results were biologically validated with cell-based assays. Age-dependent protein signatures were identified using differential expression analyses and weighted protein co-expression network analyses. Upregulation of basal markers in luminal cells, including KRT14 and AXL, were a prominent consequence of aging. PEAK1 was identified as an age-dependent signaling kinase in luminal cells, which revealed a potential age-dependent vulnerability for targeted ablation.

Epigenetic changes including modification of histones via binding of various polar metabolites underlie the establishment of trained innate immunity. Therefore, host metabolism and this response are intimately linked. However, little is known regarding the influence of lipids on the development and function of trained immunity. Utilizing two models of pulmonary bacterial infection combined with multi-omic approaches, we identified persistent, pathogen-specific changes to the lung lipidome that correlated with differences in the trained immune response against a third unrelated pathogen. Further, we establish the specific cellular populations in the lung that contribute to this altered lipidome.

We characterized the thermostability, binding kinetics, and cross-species reactivity of NbHSAs, mapped their epitopes, and structurally resolved a tetrameric HSA-Nb complex. We parallelly determined the half-lives of a cohort of selected NbHSAs in an HSA mouse model by quantitative proteomics. Compared to short-lived control nanobodies, the half-lives of NbHSAs were drastically prolonged by 771-fold. NbHSAs have distinct and diverse pharmacokinetics, positively correlating with their albumin binding affinities at the endosomal pH. We then generated stable and highly bioactive NbHSA-cytokine fusion constructs \"Duraleukin\" and demonstrated Duraleukin's high preclinical efficacy for cancer treatment in a melanoma model. This high-quality and versatile Nb toolkit will help tailor drug half-life to specific medical needs.","1235":"Achievement of human-level image recognition by deep neural networks (DNNs) has spurred interest in whether and how DNNs are brain-like. Both DNNs and the visual cortex perform hierarchical processing, and correspondence has been shown between hierarchical visual areas and DNN layers in representing visual features. Here, we propose the brain hierarchy (BH) score as a metric to quantify the degree of hierarchical correspondence based on neural decoding and encoding analyses where DNN unit activations and human brain activity are predicted from each other. We find that BH scores for 29 pre-trained DNNs with various architectures are negatively correlated with image recognition performance, thus indicating that recently developed high-performance DNNs are not necessarily brain-like. Experimental manipulations of DNN models suggest that single-path sequential feedforward architecture with broad spatial integration is critical to brain-like hierarchy. Our method may provide new ways to design DNNs in light of their representational homology to the brain.","1236":"The gut microbiota's function in regulating health has seen it linked to disease progression in several cancers. However, there is limited research detailing its influence in breast cancer (BrCa). This study found that antibiotic-induced perturbation of the gut microbiota significantly increases tumor progression in multiple BrCa mouse models. Metagenomics highlights the common loss of several bacterial species following antibiotic administration. One such bacteria, Faecalibaculum rodentium, rescued this increased tumor growth. Single-cell transcriptomics identified an increased number of cells with a stromal signature in tumors, and subsequent histology revealed an increased abundance of mast cells in the tumor stromal regions. We show that administration of a mast cell stabilizer, cromolyn, rescues increased tumor growth in antibiotic treated animals but has no influence on tumors from control cohorts. These findings highlight that BrCa-microbiota interactions are different from other cancers studied to date and suggest new research avenues for therapy development.","1237":null,"1238":"Foraging is a common decision problem in natural environments.

When participants could choose sites, they visited fast-replenishing sites more often, left sites at higher levels of reward, and achieved a higher net reward rate. Decisions to exploit-or-leave a site were best explained with a computational model that included both the average reward rate for the environment and reward information about the unattended sites. This suggests that unattended sites influence leave decisions, in foraging environments where sites can be revisited.","1239":null,"1240":"Biomethane is suggested as an advanced biofuel for the hard-to-abate sectors such as heavy transport.

The mass and energy flow of the three bioelectrochemical systems are compared with the conventional AD amine scrubber system depending on the availability of renewable electricity. An energy balance assessment indicates that P2G-AD, MEC-AD, and AD-MES circular cascading bioelectrochemical systems gain positive energy outputs by using electricity that would have been curtailed or constrained (equivalent to a primary energy factor of zero). This analysis of technological innovation, aids in the design of future cascading circular biosystems to produce sustainable advanced biofuels.","1241":"Terrestrial locomotion presents tremendous computational challenges on account of the enormous degrees of freedom in legged animals, and complex, unpredictable properties of natural environments, including the body and its effectors, yet the nervous system can achieve locomotion with ease.

The control architecture is a hierarchical network of simple negative feedback control systems inspired by the organization of the vertebrate nervous system. This robot is capable of robust posture control and locomotion in novel environments with unpredictable disturbances. Unlike current robots, our robot does not use internal inverse and forward models, nor does it require any training in order to perform successfully in novel environments.","1242":null,"1243":null,"1244":null,"1245":"Urbanization is a pressing challenge for earth's humans because it is changing not only natural environments but also agricultural lands.

We used a 17-year data set to investigate the dynamics of three moth pest species (i.e., striped stem borer, yellow stem borer, and pink stem borer) and their driving forces across the largest mega-urban region of China. Total abundance of three pest species is declined by about 80%, which was strongly associated with cropland loss during rapid urbanization. Our findings indicate that not only the increasing conversion of natural areas to human-dominated landscapes but also that of agricultural lands to urban landscapes can be critical to insect populations. It is therefore essential to monitor and understand the insect dynamics in rapidly urbanizing regions, which are currently found in many developing countries worldwide.","1246":"The circadian system is comprised three components: a network of core clock cells in the brain that keeps time, input pathways that entrain clock cells to the environment, and output pathways that use this information to ensure appropriate timing of physiological and behavioral processes throughout the day. Core clock cells can be divided into molecularly distinct populations that likely make unique functional contributions. Here we clarify the role of the dorsal neuron 1 (DN1) population of clock neurons in the transmission of circadian information by the Drosophila core clock network. Using an intersectional genetic approach that allowed us to selectively and comprehensively target DN1 cells, we show that suppressing DN1 neuronal activity alters the magnitude of daily activity and sleep without affecting overt rhythmicity. This suggests that DN1 cells are dispensable for both the generation of circadian information and the propagation of this information across output circuits.","1247":"As large renewable capacities penetrate the European energy system and the climate faces significant alterations, the future operation of hydropower reservoirs might deviate from today. In this work, we first analyze the changes in hydropower operation required to balance a wind- and solar-dominated European energy system. Second, we apply runoff data obtained from combining five different global circulation models and two regional climate models to estimate future reservoir inflow at three CO2 emissions scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). This enables us to address the climate model uncertainty reported in previous literature. Despite large interannual and intermodel variability, significant changes are measured in the climate model signal between today and future climate. Annual inflow decreases by 31% (20%) in Southern countries and increases by 21% (14%) in Northern countries for high (mid)-emission scenarios.

Here, we examine the kinetics of single-turnover target and multi-turnover trans-nuclease activities of both enzymes. High-turnover, non-specific Cas13a trans-RNase activity is coupled to rapid binding of target RNA. By contrast, low-turnover Cas12a trans-nuclease activity is coupled to relatively slow cleavage of target DNA, selective for DNA over RNA, indifferent to base identity, and preferential for single-stranded substrates. Combining multiple crRNA increases detection sensitivity of targets, an approach we use to quantify pathogen DNA in samples from patients suspected of Buruli ulcer disease.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this tumor-suppressive process still remain enigmatic. We first show by electron microscopic analysis that characteristic finger-like membrane protrusions are projected from both normal and RasV12 cells at their interface. In addition, FBP17, a member of the F-BAR proteins, accumulates in RasV12 cells, as well as surrounding normal cells, which plays a positive role in the formation of finger-like protrusions and apical elimination of RasV12 cells. Furthermore, cdc42 acts upstream of these processes.

The dR\/dT values exhibit a sine-like pressure-dependence, with the zero-crossing appearing at around 6 GPa. These special phenomena are well explained from electron transition viewpoints. The first-principles calculations show that the energy difference of parallel bands is enlarged from 1.45 to 2 eV, thereby increasing the threshold for electron transitions. The lifted threshold changes the optical absorption rates of Al and the density of states of the electrons involving interband transitions; finally, the resulting dR\/dT exhibits such a pressure-dependent behavior.

However, perceptual fading is rarely observed in everyday perception, possibly because eye movements refresh retinal input. Recently, it has been suggested that amplitudes of large saccadic eye movements are scaled to maximally decorrelate presaccadic and postsaccadic inputs and thus to annul perceptual fading. However, this argument builds on the assumption that adaptation within naturally brief fixation durations is strong enough to survive any visually disruptive saccade and affect perception. We tested this assumption by measuring the effect of luminance adaptation on postsaccadic contrast perception. We found that postsaccadic contrast perception was affected by presaccadic luminance adaptation during brief periods of fixation. This adaptation effect emerges within 100 milliseconds and persists over seconds. These results indicate that adaptation during natural fixation periods can affect perception even after visually disruptive saccades.","1260":null,"1261":null,"1262":null,"1263":null,"1264":null,"1265":"The plasma membrane repair holds significance for maintaining cell survival and homeostasis.

Yet, such methods have poorly reflected the 3D antigen structure and antibody breadth. Here, we present Ymir, a new 3D-lattice-based framework that calculates in silico antibody-antigen affinities. Key physiological properties naturally emerge from Ymir such as affinity jumps, cross-reactivity, and differential epitope accessibility.

Social bonds increased fitness in several ways: first, subordinate males that formed strong bonds with the alpha male had higher siring success. Independently, males with larger networks of strong bonds had higher siring success. In the short term, bonds predicted coalition formation and centrality in the coalition network, suggesting that males benefit from being potential allies to numerous male rivals.

These observations should be acknowledged when performing EOF analysis using CIC, overlooking either non-100% combustion efficiencies or the differences in calibrating the CIC with inorganic fluorine or organofluorine could lead to underestimating EOF content and through that to misguide policy decisions.","1286":"Ventilation is dependent upon pulmonary alveoli lined by two major epithelial cell types, alveolar type-1 (AT1) and 2 (AT2) cells. AT1 cells mediate gas exchange while AT2 cells synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactants and serve as progenitor cells which repair the alveoli. We developed transgenic mice in which YAP was activated or deleted to determine its roles in alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. Postnatal YAP activation increased epithelial cell proliferation, increased AT1 cell numbers, and caused indeterminate differentiation of subsets of alveolar cells expressing atypical genes normally restricted to airway epithelial cells. YAP deletion increased expression of genes associated with mature AT2 cells. YAP activation enhanced DNA accessibility in promoters of transcription factors and motif enrichment analysis predicted target genes associated with alveolar cell differentiation. YAP participated with KLF5, NFIB, and NKX2-1 to regulate AGER. YAP plays a central role in a transcriptional network that regulates alveolar epithelial differentiation.","1287":"Large-scale stationary hydrogen storage is critical if hydrogen is to fulfill its promise as a global energy carrier. While densified storage via compressed gas and liquid hydrogen is currently the dominant approach, liquid organic molecules have emerged as a favorable storage medium because of their desirable properties, such as low cost and compatibility with existing fuel transport infrastructure. This perspective article analytically investigates hydrogenation systems' technical and economic prospects using liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) to store hydrogen at a large scale compared to densified storage technologies and circular hydrogen carriers (mainly ammonia and methanol). Our analysis of major system components indicates that the capital cost for liquid hydrogen storage is more than two times that for the gaseous approach and four times that for the LOHC approach. Ammonia and methanol could be attractive options as hydrogen carriers at a large scale because of their compatibility with existing liquid fuel infrastructure. However, their synthesis and decomposition are energy and capital intensive compared to LOHCs. Together with other properties such as safety, these factors make LOHCs a possible option for large-scale stationary hydrogen storage. In addition, hydrogen transportation via various approaches is briefly discussed. We end our discussions by identifying important directions for future research on LOHCs.","1288":"Tradeoffs among plant traits help maintain relative fitness under unpredictable conditions and maximize reproductive success. However, modifying tradeoffs is a breeding challenge since many genes of minor effect are involved. The intensive crosstalk and fine-tuning between growth and defense responsive phytohormones via transcription factors optimizes growth, reproduction, and stress tolerance. There are regulating genes in grain crops that deploy diverse functions to overcome tradeoffs, e.g., miR-156-IPA1 regulates crosstalk between growth and defense to achieve high disease resistance and yield, while OsALDH2B1 loss of function causes imbalance among defense, growth, and reproduction in rice. GNI-A1 regulates seed number and weight in wheat by suppressing distal florets and altering assimilate distribution of proximal seeds in spikelets. Knocking out ABA-induced transcription repressors (AITRs) enhances abiotic stress adaptation without fitness cost in Arabidopsis. Deploying AITRs homologs in grain crops may facilitate breeding. This knowledge suggests overcoming tradeoffs through breeding may expose new ones.","1289":"It is of great importance and practical value to develop a facile and operable surface treatment method of materials with excellent antipollution and antiadhesion property, but still a huge challenge. In this work, a series of pseudo-zwitterions are prepared from electrostatic assembly of cationic polyethyleneimine and anionic phosphonic clusters. These pseudo-zwitterionic assemblies provide a strong hydration through electrostatic interaction with water and in turn create a barrier against oil foulants, leading to a nearly zero crude oil adhesion force. The pseudo-zwitterions-decorated surfaces exhibit exceptional water-cleanable oil-repellent property, even when they are completely dried and without prehydration before fouled by crude oil. While using these pseudo-zwitterions-modified polymeric membranes for separating surfactant stabilized oil-in-water emulsion, less than 10% decline of permeating flux is observed throughout a 2-h continuous separation experiment, showing excellent emulsion separation ability and antipollution performance for high viscous oil.","1290":null,"1291":"Cryo-electron tomography has stepped fully into the spotlight. Enthusiasm is high. Fortunately for us, this is an exciting time to be a cryotomographer, but there is still a way to go before declaring victory. Despite its potential, cryo-electron tomography possesses many inherent challenges. How do we image through thick cell samples, and possibly even tissue? How do we identify a protein of interest amidst the noisy, crowded environment of the cytoplasm? How do we target specific moments of a dynamic cellular process for tomographic imaging? In this review, we cover the history of cryo-electron tomography and how it came to be, roughly speaking, as well as the many approaches that have been developed to overcome its intrinsic limitations.","1292":"We investigated the short-term dynamics of microbial composition and function in bioreactors with inocula collected from full-scale and laboratory-based anaerobic digestion (AD) systems. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of both inocula was approximately 10% of the predicted Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway and 40% of the taxonomic composition and yet resulted in a similar performance in methane production, implying that the variation of community composition may be decoupled from performance. However, the significant correlation of volatile fatty acids with taxonomic variation suggested that the pathways of AD could be different because of the varying genus. The predicted function of the significantly varying genus was mostly related to fermentation, which strengthened the conclusion that most microbial variation occurred within the fermentative species and led to alternative routes to result in similar methane production in methanogenic bioreactors. This finding sheds some light on the understanding of AD community regulation, which depends on the aims to recover intermediates or methane.","1293":"Lineage-defining transcription factors (LTFs) play key roles in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) pathophysiology. Delineating the LTF-regulated genes operative in SCLC could provide a road map to identify SCLC dependencies. We integrated chromatin landscape and transcriptome analyses of patient-derived SCLC preclinical models to identify super-enhancers (SEs) and their associated genes in the ASCL1-, NEUROD1-, and POU2F3-high SCLC subtypes. We find SE signatures predict LTF-based classification of SCLC, and the SE-associated genes are enriched with those defined as common essential genes in DepMap. In addition, in ASCL1-high SCLC, we show ASCL1 complexes with NKX2-1 and PROX1 to co-regulate genes functioning in NOTCH signaling, catecholamine biosynthesis, and cell-cycle processes. Depletion of ASCL1 demonstrates it is a key dependency factor in preclinical SCLC models and directly regulates multiple DepMap-defined essential genes. We provide LTF\/SE-based subtype-specific gene sets for SCLC for further therapeutic investigation.","1294":"The importance of lysosomes in cardiac physiology and pathology is well established, and evidence for roles in calcium signaling is emerging. We describe a label-free proteomics method suitable for small cardiac tissue biopsies based on density-separated fractionation, which allows study of endolysosomal (EL) proteins. Density gradient fractions corresponding to tissue lysate; sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), mitochondria (Mito) (1.3 g\/mL); and EL with negligible contamination from SR or Mito (1.04 g\/mL) were analyzed using Western blot, enzyme activity assay, and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analysis (adapted discontinuous Percoll and sucrose differential density gradient). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Reactome, Panther, and Gene Ontology pathway analysis showed good coverage of RAB proteins and lysosomal cathepsins (including cardiac-specific cathepsin D) in the purified EL fraction. Significant EL proteins recovered included catalytic activity proteins. We thus present a comprehensive protocol and data set of guinea pig atrial EL organelle proteomics using techniques also applicable for non-cardiac tissue.","1295":null,"1296":"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are currently the fastest growing segment of the global battery market, and the preferred electrochemical energy storage system for portable applications. Magnetism is one of the forces that can be applied improve performance, since the application of magnetic fields influences electrochemical reactions through variation of electrolyte properties, mass transportation, electrode kinetics, and deposits morphology. This review provides a description of the magnetic forces present in electrochemical reactions and focuses on how those forces may be taken advantage of to influence the LIBs components (electrolyte, electrodes, and active materials), improving battery performance. The different ways that magnetic forces can interact with LIBs components are discussed, as well as their influence on the electrochemical behavior. The suitable control of these forces and interactions can lead to higher performance LIBs structures and to the development of innovative concepts.","1297":null,"1298":null,"1299":"Despite remarkable progress in the development and authorization of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there is a need to validate vaccine platforms for broader application. The current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity in the nasal compartment, which is the first barrier that SARS-CoV-2 virus breaches before dissemination to the lung. We report the development of an intranasal subunit vaccine that uses lyophilized spike protein and liposomal STING agonist as an adjuvant. This vaccine induces systemic neutralizing antibodies, IgA in the lung and nasal compartments, and T-cell responses in the lung of mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirmed the coordinated activation of T\/B-cell responses in a germinal center-like manner within the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues, confirming its role as an inductive site to enable durable immunity. The ability to elicit immunity in the respiratory tract can prevent the establishment of infection in individuals and prevent disease transmission.","1300":null,"1301":null,"1302":null,"1303":null,"1304":"Recently, allele-specific single-cell RNA-seq analysis has demonstrated widespread dynamic random monoallelic expression of autosomal genes (aRME) in different cell types. However, the prevalence of dynamic aRME during pregastrulation remains unknown. Here, we show that dynamic aRME is widespread in different lineages of pregastrulation embryos. Additionally, the origin of dynamic aRME remains elusive. It is believed that independent transcriptional bursting from each allele leads to dynamic aRME. Here, we show that allelic burst is not perfectly independent; instead it happens in a semicoordinated fashion. Importantly, we show that semicoordinated allelic bursting of genes, particularly with low burst frequency, leads to frequent asynchronous allelic bursting, thereby contributing to dynamic aRME. Furthermore, we found that coordination of allelic bursting is lineage specific and genes regulating the development have a higher degree of coordination. Altogether, our study provides significant insights into the prevalence and origin of dynamic aRME and their developmental relevance during early development.","1305":"The conversion of CO2 to value-added products powered with solar energy is an ideal solution to establishing a closed carbon cycle. Combining microorganisms with light-harvesting nanomaterials into photosynthetic biohybrid systems (PBSs) presents an approach to reaching this solution. Metabolic pathways precisely evolved for CO2 fixation selectively and reliably generate products. Nanomaterials harvest solar light and biocompatibly associate with microorganisms owing to similar lengths scales. Although this is a nascent field, a variety of approaches have been implemented encompassing different microorganisms and nanomaterials. To advance the field in an impactful manner, it is paramount to understand the molecular underpinnings of PBSs. In this perspective, we highlight studies inspecting charge uptake pathways and singularities in photosensitized cells. We discuss further analyses to more completely elucidate these constructs, and we focus on criteria to be met for designing photosensitizing nanomaterials. As a result, we advocate for the pairing of microorganisms with naturally occurring and highly biocompatible mineral-based semiconductor nanomaterials.","1306":"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and 2 (HSF2) play distinct but overlapping regulatory roles in maintaining cellular proteostasis or mediating cell differentiation and development. Upon activation, both HSFs trimerize and bind to heat shock elements (HSEs) present in the promoter region of target genes. Despite structural insights gained from recent studies, structures reflecting the physiological architecture of this transcriptional machinery remains to be determined. Here, we present co-crystal structures of human HSF1 and HSF2 trimers bound to DNA, which reveal a triangular arrangement of the three DNA-binding domains (DBDs) with protein-protein interactions largely mediated by the wing domain. Two structural properties, different flexibility of the wing domain and local DNA conformational changes induced by HSF binding, seem likely to contribute to the subtle differential specificity between HSF1 and HSF2. Besides, two more structures showing DBDs bound to \"two-site\" head-to-head HSEs were determined as additions to the published tail-to-tail dimer-binding structures.","1307":"Recent discoveries indicate that tolerance and resistance could rapidly evolve in bacterial populations under intermittent antibiotic treatment. In the present study, we applied antibiotic combinations in laboratory experiments to generate novel methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains with distinct phenotypes (tolerance, resistance, and suppressed tolerance), and compared their proteome profiles to uncover the adaptation mechanisms. While the tolerant strains have very different proteomes than the susceptible ancestral strain, the resistant strain largely resembles the ancestral in terms of their proteomes. Our proteomics data and other assays support the connection between the detected mutations to the observed phenotypes, confirming the general understanding of tolerance and resistance mechanisms. While resistance directly counteracts the action mechanism of the antibiotic, tolerance involves complex substantial changes in the cells' biological process to achieve survival advantages. Overall, this study provides insights into the existence of diverse evolutionary pathways for tolerance and resistance development under different treatment scenarios.","1308":null,"1309":"The Laplace pressure is one of the most fundamental regulators that determine cell shape and function, and thus has been receiving widespread attention. Here, we systemically investigate the effect of the Laplace pressure on the shape and function of the cells during cytokinesis. We find that the Laplace pressure during cytokinesis can directly control the distribution and size of cell blebbing and adjust the symmetry of cell division by virtue of changing the characteristics of cell blebbing. Further, we demonstrate that the Laplace pressure changes the structural uniformity of cell boundary to regulate the symmetry of cell division. Our findings provide further insights as to the important role of the Laplace pressure in regulating the symmetry of cell division during cytokinesis.","1310":"Reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fired electricity generation in China is critical to limit global warming. Long-term projections of China's electricity supply tend to assume that coal generation will be a mainstay of China's electricity system through 2050, due to limitations in the scalability of hydropower, nuclear, and natural gas generation and the commercial availability of carbon capture and storage. This paper examines the resource, economic, and institutional implications of reducing and replacing coal generation in China with mostly renewable energy and energy storage by 2040. We find that the scale of solar, wind, and storage resources needed to do so is on the order of 100-150 GW\/year of solar and wind capacity and 15 GW\/year of energy storage from 2020 to 2025, growing to 250 GW\/year and 90 GW\/year, respectively, from 2025 to 2040. We then also evaluate the sensitivities if coal plants are retired by 2050.","1311":null,"1312":null,"1313":null,"1314":null,"1315":null,"1316":"The capacity of the brain to elicit sustained remission of hyperglycemia in rodent models of type 2 diabetes following intracerebroventricular (icv) injection of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) is well established. Here, we show that following icv FGF1 injection, hypothalamic signaling by extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1\/2), members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, is induced for at least 24 h. Further, we show that this prolonged response is required for the sustained antidiabetic action of FGF1 since it is abolished by sustained (but not acute) pharmacologic blockade of hypothalamic MAPK\/ERK signaling. We also demonstrate that FGF1 R50E, a FGF1 mutant that activates FGF receptors but induces only transient hypothalamic MAPK\/ERK signaling, fails to mimic the sustained glucose lowering induced by FGF1. These data identify sustained activation of hypothalamic MAPK\/ERK signaling as playing an essential role in the mechanism underlying diabetes remission induced by icv FGF1 administration.","1317":null,"1318":null,"1319":"Here, we evaluate three different noble metal co-catalysts (Pd, Pt, and Au) that are present as single atoms (SAs) on the classic benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2. To trap the single atoms on the surface, we introduced controlled surface vacancies (Ti3+-Ov) on anatase TiO2 nanosheets by a thermal reduction treatment. After anchoring identical loadings of single atoms of Pd, Pt, and Au, we measure the photocatalytic H2 generation rate and compare it to the classic nanoparticle co-catalysts on the nanosheets. While nanoparticles yield the well-established the hydrogen evolution reaction activity sequence (Pt &gt; Pd &gt; Au), for the single atom form, Pd radically outperforms Pt and Au. Based on density functional theory (DFT), we ascribe this unusual photocatalytic co-catalyst sequence to the nature of the charge localization on the noble metal SAs embedded in the TiO2 surface.","1320":null,"1321":null,"1322":"Fruit softening indicated by firmness determines the texture, transportability, and shelf life of tomato products. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying firmness formation in tomato fruit is poorly understood. Here, we report the regulatory role of SlBES1, an essential component of brassinosteroid hormone signaling, in tomato fruit softening. We found that SlBES1 promotes fruit softening during tomato fruit ripening and postharvest storage. RNA-seq analysis suggested that PMEU1, which encodes a pectin methylesterase, might participate in SlBES1-mediated softening. Biochemical and immunofluorescence assays indicated that SlBES1 inhibited PMEU1-related pectin de-methylesterification. Further molecular and genetic evidence verified that SlBES1 directly binds to the E-box of PMEU1 to repress its expression, leading to fruits softening. Loss-of-function SlBES1 mutant generated by CRISPR-Cas9 showed firmer fruits and longer shelf life during postharvest storage without other quality alteration. Collectively, our results indicated the potential of manipulating SlBES1 to regulate firmness without negative consequence on visual and nutrition quality.","1323":"Health is often qualitatively defined as a status free from disease and its quantitative definition requires finding the boundary separating health from pathological conditions. Since many complex diseases have a strong genetic component, substantial efforts have been made to sequence large-scale personal genomes; however, we are not yet able to effectively quantify health status from personal genomes. Since mutational impacts are ultimately manifested at the protein level, we envision that introducing a panoramic proteomic view of complex diseases will allow us to mechanistically understand the molecular etiologies of human diseases. In this perspective article, we will highlight key proteomic approaches to identify pathogenic mutations and map their convergent pathways underlying disease pathogenesis and the integration of omics data at multiple levels to define the borderline between health and disease.","1324":null,"1325":"Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat for public health, underscoring the need for new antibacterial agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent an alternative to classical antibiotics. TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a recently described AMP effective against a broad range of bacteria, but little is known about the conditions that may influence its activity. Using RNA-sequencing and screening of mutant libraries, we show that Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respond to TAT-RasGAP317-326 by regulating metabolic and stress response pathways, possibly implicating two-component systems. Our results also indicate that bacterial surface properties, in particular integrity of the lipopolysaccharide layer, influence peptide binding and entry. Finally, we found differences between bacterial species with respect to their rate of resistance emergence against this peptide. Our findings provide the basis for future investigation on the mode of action of TAT-RasGAP317-326, which may help developing antimicrobial treatments based on this peptide.","1326":null,"1327":null,"1328":"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a prominent role in performing flexible cognitive functions and working memory, yet the underlying computational principle remains poorly understood. Here, we trained a rate-based recurrent neural network (RNN) to explore how the context rules are encoded, maintained across seconds-long mnemonic delay, and subsequently used in a context-dependent decision-making task. The trained networks replicated key experimentally observed features in the PFC of rodent and monkey experiments, such as mixed selectivity, neuronal sequential activity, and rotation dynamics. To uncover the high-dimensional neural dynamical system, we further proposed a geometric framework to quantify and visualize population coding and sensory integration in a temporally defined manner. We employed dynamic epoch-wise principal component analysis (PCA) to define multiple task-specific subspaces and task-related axes, and computed the angles between task-related axes and these subspaces. In low-dimensional neural representations, the trained RNN first encoded the context cues in a cue-specific subspace, and then maintained the cue information with a stable low-activity state persisting during the delay epoch, and further formed line attractors for sensor integration through low-dimensional neural trajectories to guide decision-making. We demonstrated via intensive computer simulations that the geometric manifolds encoding the context information were robust to varying degrees of weight perturbation in both space and time. Overall, our analysis framework provides clear geometric interpretations and quantification of information coding, maintenance, and integration, yielding new insight into the computational mechanisms of context-dependent computation.","1329":"Soil-borne diseases cause serious economic losses in agriculture. Managing diseases with microbial preparations is an excellent approach to soil-borne disease prevention. However, microbial preparations often exhibit unstable effects, limiting their large-scale application. This review introduces and summarizes disease-suppressive soils, the relationship between carbon sources and the microbial community, and the application of human microbial preparation concepts to plant microbial preparations. We also propose an innovative synthetic microbial community assembly strategy with synergistic prebiotics to promote healthy plant growth and resistance to disease. In this review, a new approach is proposed to improve traditional microbial preparations; provide a better understanding of the relationships among carbon sources, beneficial microorganisms, and plants; and lay a theoretical foundation for developing new microbial preparations.","1330":"There are &gt;200 types of protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) described in eukaryotes, each with unique proteome coverage and functions. We hypothesized that some genetic diseases may be caused by the removal of a specific type of PTMs by genomic variants and the consequent deregulation of particular functions. We collected &gt;320,000 human PTMs representing 59 types and crossed them with &gt;4M nonsynonymous DNA variants annotated with predicted pathogenicity and disease associations. We report &gt;1.74M PTM-variant co-occurrences that an enrichment analysis distributed into 215 pairwise associations between 18 PTM types and 148 genetic diseases. Of them, 42% were not previously described. Removal of lysine acetylation exerts the most pronounced effect, and less studied PTM types such as S-glutathionylation or S-nitrosylation show relevance. Using pathogenicity predictions, we identified PTM sites that may produce particular diseases if prevented. Our results provide evidence of a substantial impact of PTM-specific removal on the pathogenesis of genetic diseases and phenotypes.","1331":"Dispersal is the movement of organisms from one habitat to another that potentially results in gene flow. It is often plastic, allowing organisms to adjust dispersal movements depending on environmental conditions. A fundamental aim in ecology is to understand the determinants underlying dispersal and its plasticity. We utilized 22 strains of the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila to determine if different phenotypic dispersal strategies co-exist within a species and which mechanisms underlie this variability. We quantified the cell morphologies impacting cell motility and dispersal. Distinct differences in innate cellular morphology and dispersal rates were detected, but no universally utilized combinations of morphological parameters correlate with dispersal. Rather, multiple distinct and plastic morphological changes impact cilia-dependent motility during dispersal, especially in proficient dispersing strains facing challenging environmental conditions. Combining ecology and cell biology experiments, we show that dispersal can be promoted through plastic motility-associated changes to cell morphology and motile cilia.","1332":"The mouse eye is used to model central nervous system development, pathology, angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and regenerative therapies. To facilitate the analysis of these processes, we developed an optimized tissue clearing and depigmentation protocol, termed InVision, that permits whole-eye fluorescent marker tissue imaging. We validated this method for the analysis of normal and degenerative retinal architecture, transgenic fluorescent reporter expression, immunostaining and three-dimensional volumetric (3DV) analysis of retinoblastoma and angiogenesis. We also used this method to characterize material transfer (MT), a recently described phenomenon of horizontal protein exchange that occurs between transplanted and recipient photoreceptors. 3D spatial distribution analysis of MT in transplanted retinas suggests that MT of cytoplasmic GFP between photoreceptors is mediated by short-range, proximity-dependent cellular interactions. The InVision protocol will allow investigators working across multiple cell biological disciplines to generate novel insights into the local cellular networks involved in cell biological processes in the eye.","1333":"In this paper, we foreground some of the key research challenges that arise in the design of trustworthy human-AI partnerships. In particular, we focus on the challenges in designing human-AI partnerships that need to be addressed to help humans and organizations trust their machine counterparts individually or as a collective (e.g., as robot teams or groups of software agents). We also aim to identify the risks associated with human-AI partnerships and therefore determine the associated measures to mitigate these risks. By so doing, we will trigger new avenues of research that will address the key barriers to the adoption of AI-based systems more widely in our daily lives and in industry.","1334":"Hyperimmune immunoglobulin (hCoV-2IG) generated from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent plasma (CP) are under evaluation in clinical trials. Here we explored the antibody epitope repertoire, and virus neutralizing capacity of six hCoV-2IG batches as well as nine CP against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants of concern (VOCs). Epitope-mapping by gene-fragment phage display library spanning the SARS-CoV-2 spike demonstrated broad recognition of multiple antigenic sites spanning the entire spike that was higher for hCoV-2IG than CP, with predominant binding to the fusion peptide. In the pseudovirus neutralization assay and in the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 PRNT assay, hCoV-2IG lots showed higher titers against the WA-1 strain compared with CP. Neutralization of VOCs were reduced to different extent by hCoV-2IG lots but were higher than CP. Significant reduction of hCoV-2IG binding was observed to RBD-E484K followed by RBD-N501Y (but not RBD-K417N). This study suggests that post-exposure treatment with hCoV-2IG could be preferable to CP.","1335":"The biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles from precious metals has been of wide concern. Their antibacterial activity is a main bottleneck restricting the bacterial activity and reduction performance. Here, bio-electrochemical systems were used to harvest electroactive biofilms (EABs), where bacteria were naturally protected by extracellular polymeric substances to keep activity. The biofilm was further encapsulated with polydopamine (PDA) as additional shield. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized on EABs, whose electroactivity could be fully recovered after Ag+ reduction. The PDA increased bacterial viability by 90%-105%, confirmed as an effective protection against antibacterial activity of Ag+\/AgNPs. The biosynthetic process changed the component and function of the microbial community, shifting from bacterial Fe reduction to archaeal methanogenesis. These results demonstrated that the electrochemical acclimation of EABs and encapsulation with PDA were effective protective measures during the biosynthesis of AgNPs. These approaches have a bright future in the green synthesis of nanomaterials, biotoxic wastewater treatment, and sustainable bio-catalysis.","1336":"Cotton fiber is an excellent model for studying plant cell elongation and cell wall biogenesis as well because they are highly polarized and use conserved polarized diffuse growth mechanism. Fiber strength is an important trait among cotton fiber qualities due to ongoing changes in spinning technology. However, the molecular mechanism of fiber strength forming is obscure. Through map-based cloning, we identified the fiber strength gene GhUBX. Increasing its expression, the fiber strength of the transgenic cotton was significantly enhanced compared to the receptor W0 and the helices number of the transgenic fiber was remarkably increased. Additionally, we proved that GhUBX regulates the fiber helical growth by degrading the GhSPL1 via the ubiquitin 26S-proteasome pathway. Taken together, we revealed the internal relationship between fiber helices and fiber stronger. It will be useful for improving the fiber quality in cotton breeding and illustrating the molecular mechanism for plant twisted growth.","1337":null,"1338":"Enterobacter cloacae complex species are involved in infections among critically ill patients. After a recent E.cloacae outbreak of fulminant neonatal septic shock, we conducted a study to determine whether septic shock severity and its lethal consequence are related to structural features of the endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) of the strains isolated from hospitalized infants and more specifically its lipid A region. It appeared that the LPSs are very heterogeneous, carrying fifteen different molecular species of lipid A. The virulence was correlated with a structural feature identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry: the presence of 2-hydroxymyristic acid as a secondary substituent in lipid A. This is the first published evidence linking LPS structural moiety to neonatal sepsis outcome and opens the possibility of using this fatty acid marker as a detection tool for high-risk patients, which could help reduce their mortality.","1339":null,"1340":null,"1341":null,"1342":"Green ammonia is a promising hydrogen derivative which enables intercontinental transport of dispatchable renewable energy. This research describes the development of a model which optimizes a global green ammonia network, considering the costs of production, storage, and transport. In generating the model, we show economies of scale for green ammonia production are small beyond 1 million tonnes per annum (MMTPA), although benefits accrue up to a production rate of 10 MMTPA if a production facility is serviced by a new port or requires a long pipeline. The model demonstrates that optimal sites for ammonia production require not only an excellent renewable resource but also ample land from which energy can be harvested. Land limitations constrain project size in otherwise optimal locations and force production to more expensive sites. Comparison of current crude oil markets to future ammonia markets reveals a trend away from global supply hubs and toward demand centers serviced by regional production.","1343":null,"1344":"Fire has fascinated humankind since the prehistoric era.

To realize material specimen derived from fire, we use the autoencoder to generate image stacks to yield continuous 3D geometries that are manufactured using 3D printing. This represents the first generation of nature-inspired materials from fire and can be a platform to be used for other natural phenomena in the quest for de novo architectures, geometries, and design ideas, thus creating additional directions in artistic and scientific research through the creative manipulation of data with structural similarities across fields.","1345":"ESC\/iPSC-retinal sheet transplantation, which supplies photoreceptors as well as other retinal cells, has been shown to be able to restore visual function in mice with end-stage retinal degeneration. Here, by introducing a novel type of genetically engineered mouse ESC\/iPSC-retinal sheet with reduced numbers of secondary retinal neurons but intact photoreceptor cell layer structure, we reinforced the evidence that ESC\/iPSC-retinal sheet transplantation can establish synaptic connections with the host, restore light responsiveness, and reduce aberrant retinal ganglion cell spiking in mice. Furthermore, we show that genetically engineered grafts can substantially improve the outcome of the treatment by improving neural integration. We speculate that this leads to reduced spontaneous activity in the host which in turn contributes to a better visual recovery.","1346":"Inorganic halide perovskites have emerged as a promising platform in a wide range of applications from solar energy harvesting to computing and light emission. The recent advent of epitaxial thin film growth of halide perovskites has made it possible to investigate low-dimensional quantum electronic devices based on this class of materials. This study leverages advances in vapor-phase epitaxy of halide perovskites to perform low-temperature magnetotransport measurements on single-domain cesium tin iodide (CsSnI3) epitaxial thin films. The low-field magnetoresistance carries signatures of coherent quantum interference effects and spin-orbit coupling. These weak anti-localization measurements reveal a micron-scale low-temperature phase coherence length for charge carriers in this system. The results indicate that epitaxial halide perovskite heterostructures are a promising platform for investigating long coherent quantum electronic effects and potential applications in spintronics and spin-orbitronics.","1347":"The metasurfaces through the reasonable design and arrangement of subwavelength nanostructures to control the spatial light field are expected to replace the traditional lens elements. However, the low light use efficiency (LUE) and difficulty in preparation caused by the etching process restrict the development of its application. Here, an idea of \"doped metasurfaces\" based on a spatial and regular doping of semiconductor thin films is proposed for the first time. Since the metasurfaces has no etched micro-nano structure, other optical functional films are allowed to be added, which greatly improves and enriches its optical performance. The effectiveness of the design is verified by simulating a suitable metasurface lens. The simulation results show that this designed MIR metalens possesses wide operating range, high transmittance, and high LUE. The method proposed here provides a new idea or perspective for constructing metasurfaces devices compatible with traditional optical thin films.","1348":null,"1349":"Entosis is a cell death mechanism that is executed through neighbor cell ingestion and killing that occurs in cancer tissues and during development. Here, we identify JNK and p38 stress-activated kinase signaling as an inducer of entosis in cells exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Cells with high levels of stress signaling are ingested and killed by those with low levels, a result of heterogeneity arising within cell populations over time. In stressed cells, entosis occurs as part of mixed-cell death response with parallel induction of apoptosis and necrosis, and we find that inhibition of one form of cell death leads to increased rates of another. Together, these findings identify stress-activated kinase signaling as a new inducer of entosis and demonstrate cross talk between different forms of cell death that can occur in parallel in response to UV radiation.","1350":null,"1351":"Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an integral component of eukaryotic cell membranes and organelles.

Flies with Pss loss-of-function alleles show a reduced life span, increased bang sensitivity, locomotor defects, and vacuolated brain, which are the signs associated with neurodegeneration. We observed defective mitochondria in mutant adult brain, as well as elevated production of reactive oxygen species, and an increase in autophagy and apoptotic cell death. Intriguingly, glial-specific knockdown or overexpression of Pss alters synaptogenesis and axonal growth in the larval stage, causes developmental arrest in pupal stages, and neurodegeneration in adults. This is not observed with pan-neuronal up- or down-regulation. These findings suggest that precisely regulated expression of Pss in glia is essential for the development and maintenance of brain function. We propose a mechanism that underlies these neurodegenerative phenotypes triggered by defective PS metabolism.","1352":null,"1353":"Active sensing animals such as echolocating bats produce the energy with which they probe their environment. The intense echolocation calls of bats are energetically expensive, but their cost can be reduced by synchronizing the exhalations needed to vocalize to wingbeats. Here, we use sound-and-movement recording tags to investigate how wild bats balance efficient sound production with information needs during foraging and navigation. We show that wild bats prioritize energy efficiency over sensory flow when periodic snapshots of the acoustic scene are sufficient during travel and search. Rapid calls during tracking and interception of close prey are decoupled from the wingbeat but are weaker and comprise &lt;2% of all calls during a night of hunting. The limited use of fast sonar sampling provides bats with high information update rates during critical hunting moments but adds little to their overall costs of sound production despite the inefficiency of decoupling calls from wingbeats.","1354":"The mitochondrial uniporter is a Ca2+-selective ion-conducting channel in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is involved in various cellular processes. The components of this uniporter, including the pore-forming membrane subunit MCU and the modulatory subunits MCUb, EMRE, MICU1, and MICU2, have been identified in recent years. Previously, extensive studies revealed various aspects of uniporter activities and proposed multiple regulatory models of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Recently, the individual auxiliary components of the uniporter and its holocomplex have been structurally characterized, providing the first insight into the component structures and their spatial relationship within the context of the uniporter. Here, we review recent uniporter structural studies in an attempt to establish an architectural framework, elucidating the mechanism that governs mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and regulation, and to address some apparent controversies. This information could facilitate further characterization of mitochondrial Ca2+ permeation and a better understanding of uniporter-related disease conditions.","1355":"Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder that affects 1% of the global population. Copy number variations (CNVs) have been shown to play a critical role in its pathophysiology; however, only case-control studies on SCZ susceptibility CNVs have been conducted in Han Chinese. Here, we performed an array comparative genomic hybridization-based genome-wide CNV analysis in 100 Chinese family trios with SCZ. Burden test suggested that the SCZ probands carried more duplications than their healthy parents and unrelated healthy controls. Besides, five CNV loci were firstly reported to be associated with SCZ here, including both unbalanced transmitted CNVs and enriched de novo CNVs. Moreover, two genes (CTDSPL and MGAM) in these CNVs showed significant SCZ relevance in the expression level. Our findings support the crucial role of CNVs in the etiology of SCZ and provide new insights into the underlying mechanism of SCZ pathogenesis.","1356":"Here, with the example of common copy number variation (CNV) in the TSPAN8 gene, we present an important piece of work in the field of CNV detection, that is, CNV association with complex human traits such as 1H NMR metabolomic phenotypes and an example of functional characterization of CNVs among human induced pluripotent stem cells (HipSci). We report TSPAN8 exon 11 (ENSE00003720745) as a pleiotropic locus associated with metabolomic regulation and show that its biology is associated with several metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cancer. Our results further demonstrate the power of multivariate association models over univariate methods and define metabolomic signatures for variants in TSPAN8.","1357":"During murine germ cell development, male germ cells enter the mitotically arrested G0 stage, which is an initial step of sexually dimorphic differentiation. The male-specific RNA-binding protein NANOS2 has a key role in suppressing the cell cycle in germ cells. However, the detailed mechanism of how NANOS2 regulates the cell cycle remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we extracted the cell cycle state of each germ cell in wild-type and Nanos2-KO testes and revealed that Nanos2 expression starts in mitotic cells and induces mitotic arrest. We identified Rheb, a regulator of mTORC1, and Ptma as possible targets of NANOS2. We propose that repression of the cell cycle is a primary function of NANOS2 and that it is mediated via the suppression of mTORC1 activity through the repression of Rheb in a post-transcriptional manner.","1358":null,"1359":null,"1360":null,"1361":null,"1362":"Single-cell sequencing has emerged as an indispensable technology to dissect cellular heterogeneity but never been applied to the simultaneous analysis of glycan and RNA. Using oligonucleotide-labeled lectins, we first established lectin-based glycan profiling of single cells by sequencing (scGlycan-seq). We then combined the scGlycan-seq with single-cell transcriptome profiling for joint analysis of glycan and RNA in single cells (scGR-seq). Using scGR-seq, we analyzed the two modalities in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) before and after differentiation into neural progenitor cells at the single-cell resolution. The combination of RNA and glycan separated the two cell types clearer than either one of them. Furthermore, integrative analysis of glycan and RNA modalities in single cells found known and unknown lectins that were specific to hiPSCs and coordinated with neural differentiation. Taken together, we demonstrate that scGR-seq can reveal the cellular heterogeneity and biological roles of glycans across multicellular systems.","1363":null,"1364":"Despite advances in artificial intelligence models, neural networks still cannot achieve human performance, partly due to differences in how information is encoded and processed compared with human brain. Information in an artificial neural network (ANN) is represented using a statistical method and processed as a fitting function, enabling handling of structural patterns in image, text, and speech processing. However, substantial changes to the statistical characteristics of the data, for example, reversing the background of an image, dramatically reduce the performance. Here, we propose a quantum superposition spiking neural network (QS-SNN) inspired by quantum mechanisms and phenomena in the brain, which can handle reversal of image background color. The QS-SNN incorporates quantum theory with brain-inspired spiking neural network models from a computational perspective, resulting in more robust performance compared with traditional ANN models, especially when processing noisy inputs. The results presented here will inform future efforts to develop brain-inspired artificial intelligence.","1365":"Pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) constitute the cell types of the adult vertebrate through a series of developmental state transitions. These states can be defined by expression levels of marker genes, such as Nanog and Sox2. In culture, ESCs reversibly transition between states. However, whether ESCs retain memory of their previous states or transition in a memoryless (Markovian) process remains relatively unknown. Here, we show some highly dynamic lineages of ESCs do not exhibit the Markovian property: their previous states and kin relations influence future choices. Unexpectedly, the distribution of lineages across their composition between states is constant over time, contrasting with the predictions of a Markov model. Additionally, highly dynamic ESC lineages show skewed cell fate distributions after retinoic acid differentiation. Together, these data suggest ESC lineage is an important variable governing future cell states, with implications for stem cell function and development.","1366":null,"1367":"Glia, the non-neuronal cells of the nervous system, were long considered secondary cells only necessary for supporting the functions of their more important neuronal neighbors. Work by many groups over the past two decades has completely overturned this notion, revealing the myriad and vital functions of glia in nervous system development, plasticity, and health. The largest population of glia outside the brain is in the enteric nervous system, a division of the autonomic nervous system that constitutes a key node of the gut-brain axis. Here, we review the latest in the understanding of these enteric glia in mammals with a focus on their putative roles in human health and disease.","1368":"Highly mutable viruses evolve to evade host immunity that exerts selective pressure and adapts to viral dynamics. Here, we provide a framework for identifying key determinants of the mode and fate of viral-immune coevolution by linking molecular recognition and eco-evolutionary dynamics. We find that conservation level and initial diversity of antigen jointly determine the timing and efficacy of narrow and broad antibody responses, which in turn control the transition between viral persistence, clearance, and rebound. In particular, clearance of structurally complex antigens relies on antibody evolution in a larger antigenic space than where selection directly acts; viral rebound manifests binding-mediated feedback between ecology and rapid evolution. Finally, immune compartmentalization can slow viral escape but also delay clearance. This work suggests that flexible molecular binding allows a plastic phenotype that exploits potentiating neutral variations outside direct contact, opening new and shorter paths toward highly adaptable states.","1369":"Primordial black holes (PBHs) might form from the collapse of over-densed regions generated by large scalar curvature perturbations in the radiation dominated era. Despite decades of various independent observations, the nature of dark matter (DM) remains highly puzzling. Recently, PBH DM have aroused interest since they provide an attracting explanation to the merger events of binary black holes discovered by LIGO\/VIRGO and may play an important role on DM. During the formation of PBH, gravitational waves will be sourced by linear scalar perturbations at second-order, known as the scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), which provides a new way to hunt for PBH DM. This topic review mainly focuses on the physics about SIGWs accompanying the formation of PBH DM.","1370":"Solid-state thermal control devices that present an asymmetric heat flow depending on thermal bias directionality, referred to as thermal diodes, have recently received increased attention for energy management. The use of materials that can change phase is a common approach to design thermal diodes, but typical sizes, moderate rectification ratios, and narrow thermal tunability limit their potential applications. In this work, we propose a multilayer thermal diode made of a combination of phase change and invariant materials. This device presents state-of-the-art thermal rectification ratios up to 136% for a temperature range between 300 K and 500 K. Importantly, this design allows to switch between distinct rectification states that can be modulated with temperature, achieving an additional degree of thermal control compared with single-rectification-state devices. We analyze the relevance of our thermal diodes for retaining heat more efficiently in thermal storage elements.","1371":null,"1372":"Asymptomatic infection is a big challenge in curbing the spread of COVID-19. However, its identification and pathogenesis elucidation remain issues. Here, by performing comprehensive lipidomic characterization of serum samples from 89 asymptomatic COVID-19 patients and 178 healthy controls, we screened out a panel of 15 key lipids that could accurately identify asymptomatic patients using a new ensemble learning model based on stacking strategy with a voting algorithm. This strategy provided a high accuracy of 96.0% with only 3.6% false positive rate and 4.8% false negative rate. More importantly, the unique lipid metabolic dysregulation was revealed, especially the enhanced synthesis of membrane phospholipids, altered sphingolipids homeostasis, and differential fatty acids metabolic pattern, implicating the specific host immune, inflammatory, and antiviral responses in asymptomatic COVID-19. This study provides a potential prediagnostic method for asymptomatic COVID-19 and molecular clues for the pathogenesis and therapy of this disease.","1373":"Current conventional detection of SARS-CoV-2 involves collection of a patient's sample with a nasopharyngeal swab, storage of the swab during transport in a viral transport medium, extraction of RNA, and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). We developed a simplified preparation method using a chelating resin, Chelex, which obviates RNA extraction during viral testing. Direct detection RT-qPCR and digital droplet PCR were compared to the current conventional method with RNA extraction for simulated samples and patient specimens. The heat treatment in the presence of Chelex markedly improved detection sensitivity as compared to heat alone, and lack of RNA extraction shortens the overall diagnostic workflow. Furthermore, the initial sample heating step inactivates SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, thus improving workflow safety. This fast RNA preparation and detection method is versatile for a variety of samples, safe for testing personnel, and suitable for standard clinical collection and testing on high-throughput platforms.","1374":"The capacity to distinguish comparable experiences is fundamental for the recall of similar memories and has been proposed to require pattern separation in the dentate gyrus (DG). However, the cellular mechanisms by which mature granule cells (GCs) of the DG accomplish this function are poorly characterized. Here, we show that Kv4.2 channels selectively modulate the excitability of medial dendrites of dentate GCs. These dendrites are targeted by the medial entorhinal cortex, the main source of spatial inputs to the DG. Accordingly, we found that the spatial pattern separation capability of animals lacking the Kv4.2 channel is significantly impaired. This points to the role of intrinsic excitability in supporting the mnemonic function of the dentate and to the Kv4.2 channel as a candidate substrate promoting spatial pattern separation.","1375":null,"1376":null,"1377":null,"1378":"Distinct sub-assemblies (modules) of mitochondrial complex I (CI) are assembled with the assistance of CI Assembly Factors (CIAFs) through mechanisms that are incompletely defined. Here, using genetic analyses in Drosophila, we report that when either of the CIAFs - NDUFAF3 or NDUFAF4 - is disrupted, biogenesis of the Q-, N-, and PP-b-modules of CI is impaired. This is due, at least in part, to the compromised integration of NDUFS3 and NDUFS5 into the Q-, and PP-b-modules, respectively, coupled with a destabilization of another CIAF, TIMMDC1, in assembly intermediates. Notably, forced expression of NDUFAF4 rescues the biogenesis defects in the Q-module and some aspects of the defects in the PP-b-module of CI when NDUFAF3 is disrupted. Altogether, our studies furnish new fundamental insights into the mechanism by which NDUFAF3 and NDUFAF4 regulate CI assembly and raises the possibility that certain point mutations in NDUFAF3 may be rescued by overexpression of NDUFAF4.","1379":"Recent characterizations of pioneer transcription factors provide insights into their structures and patterns of chromatin recognition associated with their roles in cell fate commitment and transformation. Intersecting with these basic science concepts, identification of pioneer factors (PFs) fused together as driver translocations in childhood cancers raises questions of whether these fusions retain the fundamental ability to invade repressed chromatin, consistent with their monomeric PF constituents. This study defines the cellular and chromatin localization of PAX3-FOXO1, an oncogenic driver of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), derived from a fusion of PFs. To quantitatively define its chromatin-targeting functions and capacity to drive epigenetic reprogramming, we developed a ChIP-seq workflow with per-cell normalization (pc-ChIP-seq). Our quantitative localization studies address structural variation in RMS genomes and reveal insights into inactive chromatin localization of PAX3-FOXO1. Taken together, our studies are consistent with pioneer function for a driver oncoprotein in RMS, with repressed chromatin binding and nucleosome-motif targeting.","1380":null,"1381":"Oral word reading is supported by a neural subnetwork that includes gray matter regions and white matter tracts connected by the regions. Traditional methods typically determine the reading-relevant focal gray matter regions or white matter tracts rather than the reading-relevant global subnetwork. The present study developed a network-based lesion-symptom mapping (NLSM) method to identify the reading-relevant global white matter subnetwork in 84 brain-damaged patients. The global subnetwork was selected among all possible subnetworks because its global efficiency exhibited the best explanatory power for patients' reading scores. This reading subnetwork was left lateralized and included 7 gray matter regions and 15 white matter tracts. Moreover, the reading subnetwork had additional explanatory power for the patients' reading performance after eliminating the effects of reading-related local regions and tracts. These findings refine the reading neuroanatomical architecture and indicate that the NLSM can be a better method for revealing behavior-specific subnetworks.","1382":"Biochemical systems in living cells have their optimum concentration ratio among each constituent element to maintain their functionality. However, in the case of the biochemical system with complex interactions and feedbacks among elements, their activity as a system greatly changes by the concentration shift of the entire system irrespective of the concentration ratio among elements. In this study, by using a transcription-translation (TX-TL) system as the subject, we illustrate the principle of the nonlinear relationship between the system concentration and the activity of the system. Our experiment and simulation showed that shifts of the system concentration of TX-TL by dilution and concentration works as a switch of activity and demonstrated its ability to induce a biochemical system to confer the permeability of small molecules to liposomes. These results contribute to the creation of artificial cells with the switch and provide an insight into the emergence of protocells.","1383":"Duplications and deletions of short chromosomal fragments are increasingly recognized as the cause for rare neurodevelopmental conditions and disorders. The NDR2 gene encodes a protein kinase important for neuronal development and is part of a microduplication region on chromosome 12 that is associated with intellectual disabilities, autism, and epilepsy. We developed a conditional transgenic mouse with increased Ndr2 expression in postmigratory forebrain neurons to study the consequences of an increased gene dosage of this Hippo pathway kinase on brain circuitry and cognitive functions. Our analysis reveals reduced terminal fields and synaptic transmission of hippocampal mossy fibers, altered hippocampal network activity, and deficits in mossy fiber-dependent behaviors. Reduced doublecortin expression and protein interactome analysis indicate that transgenic Ndr2 disturbs the maturation of granule cells in the dentate gyrus. Together, our data suggest that increased expression of Ndr2 may critically contribute to the development of intellectual disabilities upon gene amplification.","1384":null,"1385":"The hippocampal formation is anatomically and functionally divided into a dorsal and a ventral part, being involved in processing cognitive tasks and emotional stimuli, respectively. The ventral subiculum as part of the hippocampal formation projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but only very little is known about connections arising from the dorsal SUB (dSUB). Here, we investigate the dSUB to mPFC connectivity in acute brain slices using electrophysiology and optogenetics. We show that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is the main target of dorsal subicular projections to the mPFC, with no preference between excitatory or inhibitory neurons. In addition to superficial neurons in the ACC, the prelimbic and infralimbic PFC are also targeted by subicular fibers. Thus, these novel region- and layer-specific connections between the dSUB and the prefrontal cortices challenge existing anatomical data and refine the hippocampocortical wiring diagram.","1386":"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a revolutionary technology to characterize cells under different biological conditions. Unlike bulk RNA-seq, gene expression from scRNA-seq is highly sparse due to limited sequencing depth per cell. This is worsened by tossing away a significant portion of reads that attribute to gene quantification. To overcome data sparsity and fully utilize original reads, we propose scSimClassify, a reference-free and alignment-free approach to classify cell types with k-mer level features. The compressed k-mer groups (CKGs), identified by the simhash method, contain k-mers with similar abundance profiles and serve as the cells' features. Our experiments demonstrate that CKG features lend themselves to better performance than gene expression features in scRNA-seq classification accuracy in the majority of experimental cases. Because CKGs are derived from raw reads without alignment to reference genome, scSimClassify offers an effective alternative to existing methods especially when reference genome is incomplete or insufficient to represent subject genomes.","1387":"Safety issue of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is always a concern. We have studied the inhabitation on thermal runaway (TR) and propagation of 18,650 LIBs in an enclosed space systematically. LIBs at 70% state of charge are chosen for testing. Four fire extinguishing agents are applied on LIB arrays for 20 s, and the inhibiting effects are different. The cooling efficiency varies with the surface temperatures of LIBs. Water spray has the highest cooling efficiency and inhibits the TR propagation among LIB arrays successfully. Three LIBs undergo TR for the releasing of ABC ultrafine dry powder. BC ultrafine dry powder and Novec 1230 are failed to inhibit the TR propagation. Nevertheless, Novec 1230 shows the best on inhibiting fire occurring and the generation of toxic gas. Generally, this study provides valuable information for the choice of fire extinguishing agents.","1388":"Bayes' rule is a fundamental principle that has been applied across multiple disciplines. However, few studies have addressed its origin as a cognitive strategy or the underlying basis for generalization from a small sample. Using a simple binary choice model subject to natural selection, we derive Bayesian inference as an adaptive behavior under certain stochastic environments. Such behavior emerges purely through the forces of evolution, despite the fact that our population consists of mindless individuals without any ability to reason, act strategically, or accurately encode or infer environmental states probabilistically. In addition, three specific environments favor the emergence of finite memory-those that are Markov, nonstationary, and environments where sampling contains too little or too much information about local conditions. These results provide an explanation for several known phenomena in human cognition, including deviations from the optimal Bayesian strategy and finite memory beyond resource constraints.","1389":null,"1390":"Visceral hypersensitivity (VH) is a hallmark of many functional gastrointestinal disorders including irritable bowel syndrome and is categorized by a dull, diffuse sensation of abdominal pain. Recently, the gut microbiota has been implicated in VH in male mice, but the effects in females have yet to be explored fully. To this end, we now show that somewhat surprisingly, female germ-free mice have similar visceral pain responses to colorectal distension (CRD) as their conventional controls. However, we show that although sensitivity to CRD is estrous cycle stage-dependent in conventional mice, it is not in germ-free mice. Further, ovariectomy (OVX) induced VH in conventional but not germ-free mice, and induced weight gain regardless of microbiota status. Finally, we show that estrogen-replacement ameliorated OVX-induced VH. Taken together, this study provides evidence for a major role of female sex hormones and the gut microbiota in sensation of visceral pain in females.","1391":"The intestinal microbiota closely interacts with the neuroendocrine system and exerts profound effects on host physiology. Here, we report that nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 1 (Nod1) ligand derived from intestinal bacteria modulates catecholamine storage and secretion in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. The cytosolic peptidoglycan receptor Nod1 is involved in chromogranin A (Chga) retention in dense core granules (DCGs) in chromaffin cells. Mechanistically, upon recognizing its ligand, Nod1 localizes to DCGs, and recruits Rab2a, which is critical for Chga and epinephrine retention in DCGs. Depletion of Nod1 ligand or deficiency of Nod1 leads to a profound defect in epinephrine storage in chromaffin cells and subsequently less secretion upon stimulation. The intestine-adrenal medulla cross talk bridged by Nod1 ligand modulates adrenal medullary responses during the immobilization-induced stress response in mice. Thus, our study uncovers a mechanism by which intestinal microbes modulate epinephrine secretion in response to stress, which may provide further understanding of the gut-brain axis.","1392":null,"1393":"We investigated whether extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced under hyperglycemic conditions could communicate signaling to drive atherosclerosis. We did so by treating Apoe-\/- mice with exosomes produced by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) exposed to high glucose (BMDM-HG-exo) or control. Infusions of BMDM-HG-exo increased hematopoiesis, circulating myeloid cell numbers, and atherosclerotic lesions with an accumulation of macrophage foam and apoptotic cells. Transcriptome-wide analysis of cultured macrophages treated with BMDM-HG-exo or plasma EVs isolated from subjects with type II diabetes revealed a reduced inflammatory state and increased metabolic activity. Furthermore, BMDM-HG-exo induced cell proliferation and reprogrammed energy metabolism by increasing glycolytic activity. Lastly, profiling microRNA in BMDM-HG-exo and plasma EVs from diabetic subjects with advanced atherosclerosis converged on miR-486-5p as commonly enriched and recognized in dysregulated hematopoiesis and Abca1 control. Together, our findings show that EVs serve to communicate detrimental properties of hyperglycemia to accelerate atherosclerosis in diabetes.","1394":"The recent years have witnessed the emergence of high-throughput phenotyping techniques. In particular, these techniques can characterize a comprehensive landscape of physiological traits of plants responding to dynamic changes in the environment. These innovations, along with the next-generation genomic technologies, have brought plant science into the big-data era. However, a general framework that links multifaceted physiological traits to DNA variants is still lacking. Here, we developed a general framework that integrates functional physiological phenotyping (FPP) with functional mapping (FM). This integration, implemented with high-dimensional statistical reasoning, can aid in our understanding of how genotype is translated toward phenotype. As a demonstration of method, we implemented the transpiration and soil-plant-atmosphere measurements of a tomato introgression line population into the FPP-FM framework, facilitating the identification of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that mediate the spatiotemporal change of transpiration rate and the test of how these QTLs control, through their interaction networks, phenotypic plasticity under drought stress.","1395":"Macrophages contribute to host immunity and tissue homeostasis via alternative activation programs. M1-like macrophages control intracellular bacterial pathogens and tumor progression. In contrast, M2-like macrophages shape reparative microenvironments that can be conducive for pathogen survival or tumor growth. An imbalance of these macrophages phenotypes may perpetuate sites of chronic unresolved inflammation, such as infectious granulomas and solid tumors. We have found that plant-derived and synthetic rocaglates sensitize macrophages to low concentrations of the M1-inducing cytokine IFN-gamma and inhibit their responsiveness to IL-4, a prototypical activator of the M2-like phenotype. Treatment of primary macrophages with rocaglates enhanced phagosome-lysosome fusion and control of intracellular mycobacteria. Thus, rocaglates represent a novel class of immunomodulators that can direct macrophage polarization toward the M1-like phenotype in complex microenvironments associated with hypofunction of type 1 and\/or hyperactivation of type 2 immunity, e.g., chronic bacterial infections, allergies, and, possibly, certain tumors.","1396":"Finding appropriate incentives to enforce collaborative efforts for governing the commons in risky situations is a long-lasting challenge. Previous works have demonstrated that both punishing free-riders and rewarding cooperators could be potential tools to reach this goal. Despite weak theoretical foundations, policy makers frequently impose a punishment-reward combination. Here, we consider the emergence of positive and negative incentives and analyze their simultaneous impact on sustaining risky commons. Importantly, we consider institutions with fixed and flexible incentives. We find that a local sanctioning scheme with pure reward is the optimal incentive strategy. It can drive the entire population toward a highly cooperative state in a broad range of parameters, independently of the type of institutions. We show that our finding is also valid for flexible incentives in the global sanctioning scheme, although the local arrangement works more effectively.","1397":"Current studies estimate that 1-3% of females with unexplained intellectual disability (ID) present de novo splice site, nonsense, frameshift, or missense mutations in the DDX3X protein (DEAD-Box Helicase 3 X-Linked). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X mutations impair brain development are not fully comprehended. Here, we show that the ID-linked missense mutation L556S renders DDX3X prone to aggregation. By using a combination of biophysical assays and imaging approaches, we demonstrate that this mutant assembles solid-like condensates and amyloid-like fibrils. Although we observed greatly reduced expression of the mutant allele in a patient who exhibits skewed X inactivation, this appears to be enough to sequestrate healthy proteins into solid-like ectopic granules, compromising cell function. Therefore, our data suggest ID-linked DDX3X L556S mutation as a disorder arising from protein misfolding and aggregation.","1398":null,"1399":null,"1400":null,"1401":"Gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers are the most common malignant cancers with high mortality rate. Pan-cancer multi-omics data fusion provides a powerful strategy to examine commonalities and differences among various cancer types and benefits for the identification of pan-cancer drug targets. Herein, we conducted an integrative omics analysis on The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-GI samples including six carcinomas and stratified into 9 clusters, i.e. 5 single-type-dominant clusters and 4 mixed clusters, the clustering reveals the molecular features of different subtypes, other than the organ and cell-of-origin classifications. Especially the mixed clusters revealed the homogeneity of pan-GI cancers. We demonstrated that the prognosis differences among pan-GI subtypes based on multi-omics integration are more significant than clustering by single-omics. The potential prognostic markers for pan-GI stratification were identified by proportional hazards model, such as PSCA (for colorectal and stomach cancer) and PPP1CB (for liver and pancreatic cancer), which have prominent prognostic power supported by high concordance index.","1402":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein kinase\/RNase Ire1 is a conserved sensor of the cellular unfolded protein response and has been implicated in lipid homeostasis, including lipid synthesis and transport, across species. Here we report a novel catabolic role of Ire1 in regulating lipid mobilization in Drosophila. We found that Ire1 is activated by nutrient deprivation, and, importantly, fat body-specific Ire1 deficiency leads to increased lipid mobilization and sensitizes flies to starvation, whereas fat body Ire1 overexpression results in the opposite phenotypes. Genetic interaction and biochemical analyses revealed that Ire1 regulates lipid mobilization by promoting Xbp1s-associated FoxO degradation and suppressing FoxO-dependent lipolytic programs. Our results demonstrate that Ire1 is a catabolic sensor and acts through the Xbp1s-FoxO axis to hamper the lipolytic response during chronic food deprivation. These findings offer new insights into the conserved Ire1 regulation of lipid homeostasis.","1403":"In an attempt to explore the role of the gut microbiome during recent canine evolutionary history, we sequenced the metagenome of 13 canine coprolites dated ca. 3,600-3,450 years ago from the Bronze Age archaeological site of Solarolo (Italy), which housed a complex farming community. The microbiome structure of Solarolo dogs revealed continuity with that of modern dogs, but it also shared some features with the wild wolf microbiome, as a kind of transitional state between them. The dietary niche, as also inferred from the microbiome composition, was omnivorous, with evidence of consumption of starchy agricultural foods. Of interest, the Solarolo dog microbiome was particularly enriched in sequences encoding alpha-amylases and complemented a low copy number of the host amylase gene. These findings suggest that Neolithic dogs could have responded to the transition to a starch-rich diet by expanding microbial functionalities devoted to starch catabolism, thus compensating for delayed host response.","1404":null,"1405":"Maintaining connectivity between high-elevation public lands is important for wolverines and other species of conservation concern. This work represents the first effort to prioritize wolverine connectivity under future climate conditions using a systematic conservation planning framework. We optimized 10, 15, 20, and 50% of habitat features for wolverines using integer linear programming. We identified 369 privately owned areas in the 10% solution, 572 in the 15% solution, 822 in the 20% solution, and 3,996 in the 50% solution where voluntary landowner easements would improve the long-term landscape functionality for wolverine connectivity. The median estimated easements ranged from $8,762 to $12,220 across the four solutions (total costs $14,874,371 to $196,346,714). Overall, this effort demonstrates the utility of optimization problems for conserving connectivity, provides a proactive tool to engage potential collaborators, identifies easements that will likely protect various subalpine species, and offers a framework for the conservation of additional species.","1406":"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are important mediators of intercellular communication with respect to diverse pathophysiological processes. Here, we determined novel phosphatidylserine (PS)-deficient sEV subpopulations as a major somatic cell-derived sEV subpopulation in blood because of long blood circulation half-life through escape from macrophage uptake. PS(-)-sEVs were identified in various cultured cells as a minor population. However, as a result of rapid uptake of PS(+)-sEVs by macrophages, circulating somatic cell-derived sEVs in the blood were found to be mainly PS(-)-sEVs. These results suggest that endogenous PS(-)-sEVs could indeed be the key player in sEV-mediated intercellular communication, a good target for sEV-based diagnosis, and a potent candidate for sEV-based drug delivery. Our findings bring a paradigm shift in the understanding of the biology and translational applications of sEVs.","1407":null,"1408":"A number of new cell death processes have been discovered in recent years, including ferroptosis, which is characterized by the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products derived from iron metabolism. The evidence suggests that ferroptosis has a tumor-suppressor function. However, the mechanism by which ferroptosis mediates the response of tumor cells to oncolytic viruses remains poorly understood. The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can selectively replicate in tumor cells. We show that NDV-induced ferroptosis acts through p53-SLC7A11-GPX4 pathway. Meanwhile, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides increased in tumor cells. Ferritinophagy was induced by NDV promotion of ferroptosis through the release of ferrous iron and an enhanced Fenton reaction. Collectively, these observations demonstrated that the NDV can kill tumor cells through ferroptosis. Our study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of NDV-induced ferroptosis and highlights the critical role of viruses in treating therapy-resistant cancers.","1409":null,"1410":null,"1411":null,"1412":"Biophotoelectrochemistry (BPEC) is an interdisciplinary research field and combines bioelectrochemistry and photoelectrochemistry through the utilization of the catalytic abilities of biomachineries and light harvesters to accomplish the production of energy or chemicals driven by solar energy.

This review provides the state-of-the-art introduction of BPEC basics and systems, with a focus on light harvesters and biocatalysts, configurations, photoelectron transfer mechanisms, and the potential applications in energy and environment. Several examples of BPEC applications are discussed including H2 production, CO2 reduction, chemical synthesis, pollution control, and biogeochemical cycle of elements. The challenges about BPEC systems are identified and potential solutions are proposed. The review aims to encourage further research of BPEC toward development of practical BPEC systems for energy and environmental applications.","1413":"Global deployment of an effective and safe vaccine is necessary to curtail the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, we evaluated a Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-based vectored-vaccine in mice and hamsters for its immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal administration of recombinant (r)NDV-S vaccine expressing spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 to mice induced high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG2a antibodies and T-cell-mediated immunity. Hamsters immunized with two doses of vaccine showed complete protection from lung infection, inflammation, and pathological lesions following SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Importantly, administration of two doses of intranasal rNDV-S vaccine significantly reduced the SARS-CoV-2 shedding in nasal turbinate and lungs in hamsters. Collectively, intranasal vaccination has the potential to control infection at the site of inoculation, which should prevent both clinical disease and virus transmission to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.","1414":"Current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) serological tests are based on the full-length spike (S), the receptor-binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrates. Here, we used samples from healthcare workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using a research-grade RBD and spike-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a commercial RBD and spike-based ELISA, and a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. Seroprevalence ranged around 28% early during the pandemic and a good correlation was observed between RBD and spike-based ELISAs. Modest correlations were observed between NP and both RBD and spike-based assays. The antibody levels in HCWs declined over time; however, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD and spike-based assays remained unchanged, while the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Moreover, RBD and spike-based assays effectively detected seroconversion in vaccinees. Overall, our results consolidate the strength of different serological assays to assess the magnitude and duration of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.","1415":"The Hippo pathway is a conserved signaling network that regulates organ growth and cell fate. One such cell fate decision is that of R8 photoreceptor cells in the Drosophila eye, where Hippo specifies whether cells sense blue or green light. We show that only a subset of proteins that control organ growth via the Hippo pathway also regulate R8 cell fate choice, including the STRIPAK complex, Tao, Pez, and 14-3-3 proteins. Furthermore, key Hippo pathway proteins were primarily cytoplasmic in R8 cells rather than localized to specific membrane domains, as in cells of growing epithelial organs. Additionally, Warts was the only Hippo pathway protein to be differentially expressed between R8 subtypes, while central Hippo pathway proteins were expressed at dramatically lower levels in adult and pupal eyes than in growing larval eyes. Therefore, we reveal several important differences in Hippo signaling in the contexts of organ growth and cell fate.","1416":"In perceptual decision-making, prior knowledge of action outcomes is essential, especially when sensory inputs are insufficient for proper choices. Signal detection theory (SDT) shows that optimal choice bias depends not only on the prior but also the sensory uncertainty; however, it is unclear how animals integrate sensory inputs with various uncertainties and reward expectations to optimize choices. We developed a tone-frequency discrimination task for head-fixed mice in which we randomly presented either a long or short sound stimulus and biased the choice outcomes. The choice was less accurate and more biased toward the large-reward side in short- than in long-stimulus trials. Analysis with SDT found that mice did not use a separate, optimal choice threshold in different sound durations. Instead, mice updated one threshold for short and long stimuli with a simple reinforcement-learning rule. Our task in head-fixed mice helps understanding how the brain integrates sensory inputs and prior.","1417":null,"1418":"Chronic low-grade inflammation is a subclinical condition directly and indirectly linked to the development of a wide range of diseases responsible for the vast majority of morbidity. To examine mechanisms coupled to chronic disease, a group of overweight and obese human subjects without known inflammatory diseases participated in a high-fat meal challenge as an acute inflammation stimulus. Analysis of serum metabolites grouped by baseline cytokine levels revealed that single samples had little power in differentiating groups. However, an analysis that incorporated temporal response separated inflammatory response phenotypes and allowed us to create a metabolic signature of inflammation which revealed metabolic components that are crucial to a cytokine-mediated inflammation response. The use of temporal response, rather than a single time point, improved metabolomic prediction of high postprandial inflammation responses and led to the development of a dynamic biosignature as a potential tool for stratifying risk to a wide range of diseases.","1419":"Keratin is a highly multifunctional biopolymer serving various roles in nature due to its diverse material properties, wide spectrum of structural designs, and impressive performance. Keratin-based materials are mechanically robust, thermally insulating, lightweight, capable of undergoing reversible adhesion through van der Waals forces, and exhibit structural coloration and hydrophobic surfaces. Thus, they have become templates for bioinspired designs and have even been applied as a functional material for biomedical applications and environmentally sustainable fiber-reinforced composites. This review aims to highlight keratin's remarkable capabilities as a biological component, a source of design inspiration, and an engineering material. We conclude with future directions for the exploration of keratinous materials.","1420":null,"1421":"Dew water, mostly ignored until now, can provide clean freshwater resources, just by extracting the atmospheric vapor available in surrounding air. Inspired by silicon-based solar panels, the vapor can be harvested by a concept of water condensing panels. Efficient water harvesting requires not only a considerable yield but also a timely water removal from the surface since the very beginning of condensation to avoid the huge evaporation losses. This translates into strict surface properties, which are difficult to simultaneously realize. Herein, we study various functionalized silicon surfaces, including the so-called Black Silicon, which supports two droplet motion modes-out-of-plane jumping and in-plane sweeping, due to its unique surface morphology, synergistically leading to a pioneering combination of above two required characteristics. According to silicon material's scalability, the proposed silicon-based water panels would benefit from existing infrastructures toward dual functions of energy harvesting in daytime and water harvesting in nighttime.","1422":null,"1423":"We have established experimental systems to assess the effects of early-life exposures to antibiotics on the intestinal microbiota and gene expression in the brain. This model system is highly relevant to human exposure and may be developed into a preclinical model of neurodevelopmental disorders in which the gut-brain axis is perturbed, leading to organizational effects that permanently alter the structure and function of the brain. Exposing newborn mice to low-dose penicillin led to substantial changes in intestinal microbiota population structure and composition. Transcriptomic alterations implicate pathways perturbed in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. There also were substantial effects on frontal cortex and amygdala gene expression by bioinformatic interrogation, affecting multiple pathways underlying neurodevelopment. Informatic analyses established linkages between specific intestinal microbial populations and the early-life expression of particular affected genes. These studies provide translational models to explore intestinal microbiome roles in the normal and abnormal maturation of the vulnerable central nervous system.","1424":"We developed and analyzed a single cell scale anatomical map of the rat intrinsic cardiac nervous system (ICNS) across four male and three female hearts. We find the ICNS has a reliable structural organizational plan across individuals that provide the foundation for further analyses of the ICNS in cardiac function and disease. The distribution of the ICNS was evaluated by 3D visualization and data-driven clustering. The pattern, distribution, and clustering of ICNS neurons across all male and female rat hearts is highly conserved, demonstrating a coherent organizational plan where distinct clusters of neurons are consistently localized. Female hearts had fewer neurons, lower packing density, and slightly reduced distribution, but with identical localization. We registered the anatomical data from each heart to a geometric scaffold, normalizing their 3D coordinates for standardization of common anatomical planes and providing a path where multiple experimental results and data types can be integrated and compared.","1425":"There are plenty publications providing guidance for resistant taxa selection by experimental researches while the number of experimental taxa is often restricted. In this study, we presented a concise method to predict the temperature tolerance of wild Lilium in China based on open access botanical and associated environmental datasets. We divided all taxa into five groups to present an overview of Lilium's adaptability to temperature stress. Furthermore, according to the environmental conditions, the prediction of heat and cold tolerance in Lilium was made based on the combined multi-sources data at taxon level. Thirteen taxa with potential temperature tolerance were predicted of 42 taxa. The results showed that not only is tolerance prediction created by large-scale data analysis possible, but that it may supplement traditional laboratory researches with a comprehensive list of taxa.","1426":null,"1427":"Circadian protein oscillations are maintained by the lifelong repetition of protein production and degradation in daily balance. It comes at the cost of ever-replayed, futile protein synthesis each day. This biosynthetic cost with a given oscillatory protein profile is relievable by a rhythmic, not constant, degradation rate that selectively peaks at the right time of day but remains low elsewhere, saving much of the gross protein loss and of the replenishing protein synthesis. Here, our mathematical modeling reveals that the rhythmic degradation rate of proteins with circadian production spontaneously emerges under steady and limited activity of proteolytic mediators and does not necessarily require rhythmic post-translational regulation of previous focus. Additional (yet steady) post-translational modifications in a proteolytic pathway can further facilitate the degradation's rhythmicity in favor of the biosynthetic cost saving. Our work is supported by animal and plant circadian data, offering a generic mechanism for potentially widespread, time-dependent protein turnover.","1428":"Besides relying heavily on sensory and reinforcement feedback, motor skill learning may also depend on the level of motivation experienced during training. Yet, how motivation by reward modulates motor learning remains unclear. In 90 healthy subjects, we investigated the net effect of motivation by reward on motor learning while controlling for the sensory and reinforcement feedback received by the participants. Reward improved motor skill learning beyond performance-based reinforcement feedback. Importantly, the beneficial effect of reward involved a specific potentiation of reinforcement-related adjustments in motor commands, which concerned primarily the most relevant motor component for task success and persisted on the following day in the absence of reward. We propose that the long-lasting effects of motivation on motor learning may entail a form of associative learning resulting from the repetitive pairing of the reinforcement feedback and reward during training, a mechanism that may be exploited in future rehabilitation protocols.","1429":"Bacterial chemotaxis is a major testing ground for systems biology, including the role of fluctuations and individual variation. Individual bacteria vary in their tumbling frequency and adaptation time. Recently, large cell-cell variation was also discovered in chemotaxis gain, which determines the sensitivity of the tumbling rate to attractant gradients. Variation in gain is puzzling, because low gain impairs chemotactic velocity. Here, we provide a functional explanation for gain variation by establishing a formal analogy between chemotaxis and algorithms for sampling probability distributions. We show that temporal fluctuations in gain implement simulated tempering, which allows sampling of attractant distributions with many local peaks. Periods of high gain allow bacteria to detect and climb gradients quickly, and periods of low gain allow them to move to new peaks. Gain fluctuations thus allow bacteria to thrive in complex environments, and more generally they may play an important functional role for organism navigation.","1430":"SARS-CoV-2 infections initiate cytokine storms and activate genetic programs leading to progressive hyperinflammation in multiple organs of patients with COVID-19. While it is known that COVID-19 impacts kidney function, leading to increased mortality, cytokine response of renal epithelium has not been studied in detail. Here, we report on the genetic programs activated in human primary proximal tubule (HPPT) cells by interferons and their suppression by ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor used in COVID-19 treatment. Integration of our data with those from patients with acute kidney injury and COVID-19, as well as other tissues, permitted the identification of kidney-specific interferon responses. Additionally, we investigated the regulation of the recently discovered isoform (dACE2) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Using ChIP-seq, we identified candidate interferon-activated enhancers controlling the ACE2 locus, including the intronic dACE2 promoter. Taken together, our study provides an in-depth understanding of genetic programs activated in kidney cells.","1431":null,"1432":null,"1433":"The electrochemical reduction of CO2 has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional fossil-based technologies for the synthesis of chemicals. Its industrial implementation could lead to a reduction in the carbon footprint of chemicals and the mitigation of climate change impacts caused by hard-to-decarbonize industrial applications, among other benefits. However, the current low technology readiness levels of such emerging technologies make it hard to predict their performance at industrial scales. During the past few years, researchers have developed diverse techniques to model and assess the electrochemical reduction of CO2 toward its industrial implementation. The aim of this literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of techno-economic and life cycle assessment methods and pave the way for future assessment approaches. First, we identify which modeling approaches have been conducted to extend analysis to the production scale. Next, we explore the metrics used to evaluate such systems, regarding technical, environmental, and economic aspects. Finally, we assess the challenges and research opportunities for the industrial implementation of CO2 reduction via electrolysis.","1434":null,"1435":"The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis forms a complex neuroendocrine system that regulates the body's response to stress such as starvation. In contrast with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 32 (ZBTB32) is a transcription factor with poorly described functional relevance in physiology. This study shows that ZBTB32 is essential for the production of glucocorticoids (GCs) in response to starvation, since ZBTB32-\/- mice fail to increase their GC production in the absence of nutrients. In terms of mechanism, GR-mediated upregulation of adrenal Scarb1 gene expression was absent in ZBTB32-\/- mice, implicating defective cholesterol import as the cause of the poor GC synthesis. These lower GC levels are further associated with aberrations in the metabolic adaptation to starvation, which could explain the progressive weight gain of ZBTB32-\/- mice. In conclusion, ZBTB32 performs a crosstalk with the GR in the metabolic adaptation to starvation via regulation of adrenal GC production.","1436":"We present Raptor, a system for approximately searching many queries such as next-generation sequencing reads or transcripts in large collections of nucleotide sequences. Raptor uses winnowing minimizers to define a set of representative k-mers, an extension of the interleaved Bloom filters (IBFs) as a set membership data structure and probabilistic thresholding for minimizers. Our approach allows compression and partitioning of the IBF to enable the effective use of secondary memory. We test and show the performance and limitations of the new features using simulated and real datasets. Our data structure can be used to accelerate various core bioinformatics applications. We show this by re-implementing the distributed read mapping tool DREAM-Yara.","1437":"","1438":"Base editing (BE) is a promising genome engineering tool for modifying DNA or RNA and has been widely used in various microorganisms as well as eukaryotic cells. Despite the proximal protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) is critical to the targeting range and off-target effect of BE, there is still lack of a specific approach to analyze the PAM pattern in BE systems. Here, we developed a base editing-coupled survival screening method. Using dCas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpdCas9) and its variants xdCas9 3.7 and dCas9 NG as example, their PAM patterns in BE systems were extensively characterized using the NNNN PAM library with high sensitivity. In addition to the typical PAM recognition features, we observed more unique PAMs exhibiting BE activity. These PAM patterns will boost the finding of potential off-target editing event arising from non-canonical PAMs and provide the guidelines for PAM usage in the BE system.","1439":"To infer a \"live\" protein network in single cells, we developed a novel Protein Localization and Modification-based Covariation Network (PLOM-CON) analysis method using a large set of quantitative data on the abundance (quantity), post-translational modification state (quality), and localization\/morphological information of target proteins from microscope immunostained images. The generated network exhibited synchronized time-dependent behaviors of the target proteins to visualize how a live protein network develops or changes in cells under specific experimental conditions. As a proof of concept for PLOM-CON analysis, we applied this method to elucidate the role of actin scaffolds, in which actin fibers and signaling molecules accumulate and form membrane-associated protein condensates, in insulin signaling in rat hepatoma cells. We found that the actin scaffold in cells may function as a platform for glycogenesis and protein synthesis upon insulin stimulation.","1440":"We developed a spatially-tracked single neuron transcriptomics map of an intrinsic cardiac ganglion, the right atrial ganglionic plexus (RAGP) that is a critical mediator of sinoatrial node (SAN) activity. This 3D representation of RAGP used neuronal tracing to extensively map the spatial distribution of the subset of neurons that project to the SAN. RNA-seq of laser capture microdissected neurons revealed a distinct composition of RAGP neurons compared to the central nervous system and a surprising finding that cholinergic and catecholaminergic markers are coexpressed, suggesting multipotential phenotypes that can drive neuroplasticity within RAGP. High-throughput qPCR of hundreds of laser capture microdissected single neurons confirmed these findings and revealed a high dimensionality of neuromodulatory factors that contribute to dynamic control of the heart. Neuropeptide-receptor coexpression analysis revealed a combinatorial paracrine neuromodulatory network within RAGP informing follow-on studies on the vagal control of RAGP to regulate cardiac function in health and disease.","1441":"","1442":"The current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a significant threat to global health. While respiratory aerosols or droplets are considered as the main route of human-to-human transmission, secretions expelled by infected individuals can also contaminate surfaces and objects, potentially creating the risk of fomite-based transmission. Consequently, frequently touched objects such as paper currency and coins have been suspected as potential transmission vehicle. To assess the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by banknotes and coins, we examined the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and bovine coronavirus, as surrogate with lower biosafety restrictions, on these different means of payment and developed a touch transfer method to examine transfer efficiency from contaminated surfaces to fingertips. Although we observed prolonged virus stability, our results indicate that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via contaminated coins and banknotes is unlikely and requires high viral loads and a timely order of specific events.","1443":null,"1444":null,"1445":null,"1446":"The critical minerals and elements are natural substances that are essential to modern life but have insecure supply. This lack of a secure supply clashes with the increasing importance of these elements, especially given their use in technologies needed to reduce global CO2 emissions and mitigate against anthropogenic climate change. In this contribution we review the by-product nature of the critical minerals and elements and the inherant uncertainties in reported critical mineral and element annual production as well as the relationships between these commodities and main-product metals and associated concentrates. We explore the geological and geographical barriers to critical mineral and element supplies, as well as how the lack of available data and the uncertainties in the data that are available hinder our ability to estimate global resources with confidence.","1447":"Water treatment based on advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) supplies clean water to rural areas lacking electric power supply and\/or during natural disasters and pandemics. Considering the abundance of solar energy in the ambient environment, the solar-driven AOPs show an interesting potential to driving the water purification process. Involving the energy harvester (EH) that harvests mechanical or thermal energy into electricity to the solar-driven AOPs can achieve sustainable and self-powered water purification. Herein, we summarize the recent progress in the application of solar-induced hybrid EHs that harvest solar and mechanical\/thermal energy simultaneously to drive AOP water treatment. A detailed discussion of the solar-induced hybrid EHs enabling AOP water treatment based on the mechanisms of piezo-, tribo-, pyro-, and thermo-assisted photocatalysis is provided. In addition, this paper explores future opportunities and strategies of the solar-induced hybrid EHs to drive the AOP water treatment in actual situations with unstable and fluctuating environmental conditions.","1448":"Forecasting pharmacokinetics (PK) for individual patients is a fundamental problem in clinical pharmacology. One key challenge is that PK models constructed using data from one dosing regimen must predict PK data for different dosing regimen(s). We propose a deep learning approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (neural-ODE) and tested its generalizability against a variety of alternative models. Specifically, we used the PK data from two different treatment regimens of trastuzumab emtansine. The models performed similarly when the training and the test sets come from the same dosing regimen. However, for predicting a new treatment regimen, the neural-ODE model showed substantially better performance. To date, neural-ODE is the most accurate PK model in predicting untested treatment regimens. This study represents the first time neural-ODE has been applied to PK modeling and the results suggest it is a widely applicable algorithm with the potential to impact future studies.","1449":null,"1450":null,"1451":"Cell type-specific pathway-based polygenic risk scores (PRSs) may better inform disease biology and improve the precision of PRS-based clinical prediction. For microRNA-137 (MIR137), a leading neuropsychiatric risk gene and a post-transcriptional master regulator, we conducted a cell type-specific gene set PRS analysis in both European and Han Chinese schizophrenia (SZ) samples. We found that the PRS of neuronal MIR137 -target genes better explains SZ risk than PRS derived from MIR137 -target genes in iPSC or from the reported gene sets showing MIR137 -altered expression. Compared with the PRS derived from the whole genome or the target genes of TCF4, the PRS of neuronal MIR137 -target genes explained a disproportionally larger (relative to SNP number) SZ risk in the European sample, but with a more modest advantage in the Han Chinese sample. Our study demonstrated a cell type-specific polygenic contribution of MIR137 -target genes to SZ risk, highlighting the value of cell type-specific pathway-based PRS analysis for uncovering disease-relevant biological features.","1452":"Day length in conjunction with seasonal cycles affects many aspects of animal biology. We have studied photoperiod-dependent alterations of complex behavior in the teleost, medaka (Oryzias latipes), a photoperiodic breeder, in a learning paradigm whereby fish have to activate a sensor to obtain a food reward. Medaka were tested under a long (14:10 LD) and short (10:14 LD) photoperiod in three different groups: mixed-sex, all-males, and all-females. Under long photoperiod, medaka mixed-sex groups learned rapidly with a stable response. Unexpectedly, males-only groups showed a strong learning deficit, whereas females-only groups performed efficiently. In mixed-sex groups, female individuals drove group learning, whereas males apparently prioritized mating over feeding behavior resulting in strongly reduced learning performance. Under short photoperiod, where medaka do not mate, male performance improved to a level similar to that of females. Thus, photoperiod has sex-specific effects on the learning performance of a seasonal vertebrate.","1453":"Despite increasing knowledge on primed and naive pluripotency, the cell signaling that regulates the pluripotency type in stem cells remains not fully understood. Here we show that AMP kinase (AMPK) activators can induce the reversion of primed mouse epiblast stem cells (mEpiSCs) to the naive pluripotent state. The addition of AMPK activators alone or together with leukemia inhibitory factor to primed mEpiSCs induced the appearance of naive-like cells. After passaging in naive culture conditions, the colony morphology, protein expression, and global gene expression profiles indicated the naive state, as did germline transmission ability. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies suggested that p38 is a critical downstream target in AMPK activation. Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that the reversion process through AMPK signaling passes an intermediate naive-like population. In conclusion, the AMPK pathway is a critical driving force in the reversion of primed to naive pluripotency.","1454":"Owing to its versatility, biomass can be used for a range of CO2 mitigation and removal options. The recent adoption of end-of-century temperature targets at the global scale, along with mid-century economy-wide net zero emission targets in Europe, has boosted demand forecasts for this valuable resource. Given the limited nature of sustainable biomass supply, it is important to understand most efficient uses of biomass, both in terms of avoided CO2 emissions (i.e., substituted energy and economic services) and CO2 removal. Here, we quantify the mitigation and removal potential of key bio-based CO2 removal pathways for the transport, power, construction, and iron and steel sectors in Europe. By combining the carbon balance of these pathways with their economics, the optimal use of biomass in terms of CO2 avoidance and removal costs is quantified, and how these evolve with the decarbonization of the European energy system is discussed.","1455":"Saccadic eye movements may not stop steadily but fluctuate briefly, known as saccadic dynamic overshoot (SDO). The reported relationships between SDO and saccadic parameters of main saccade and the effect of aging on SDO are controversial. In addition, it is not clear whether aging-related disease, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Parkinson disease (PD), causes the specific change of SDO. To address these questions, we analyzed the spatiotemporal features of SDO in young healthy subjects, elderly healthy subjects, and subjects with PD and MCI in three oculomotor tasks. We found two types of SDOs-simple and complex SDO. We confirmed that the frequency and amplitude of SDO were positively correlated with the peak velocity and deceleration of main saccades and increased in elderly subjects; however, they were not significantly different among the three elderly groups. Our results support the previous argument that the oculomotor structure in brainstem and cerebellum directly develop SDO.","1456":null,"1457":null,"1458":"Addressing climate change with the rising global energy usage necessitates electricity sector decarbonization by rapidly moving toward flexible and efficient off-grid renewable energy systems (RESs). This paper analyzes the wind and solar micro-grids, with batteries and pumped hydro storage for a robust off-grid RES techno-economic operation, while considering diverse multi-objective optimization cases. This research has considered the RES variable operational losses in the developed methodology and relations between different indicators are evaluated, revealing a basic understanding between them. The results reveal that the reliability index is inversely related to the oversupply index, while directly related to the system self-sufficiency index. The cost of energy is more sensitive to technical indicators rather than the storage cost and so can be used as a primary monetary index. Energy and cost balance analysis showed that 16%-20% of the used energy was drained in RES operational losses, which were usually ignored in previous studies.","1459":"Wearable electronics are receiving increasing attention with the advances of human society and technologies. Among various types of wearable electronics, electronic fibers\/textiles, which integrate the comfort and appearance of conventional fibers\/textiles with the functions of electronic devices, are expected to play important roles in remote health monitoring, disease diagnosis\/treatment, and human-machine interface. This article aims to review the recent advances in electronic fibers\/textiles, thus providing a comprehensive guiding reference for future work. First, we review the selection of functional materials and fabrication strategies of fiber-shaped electronic devices with emphasis on the newly developed functional materials and technologies. Their applications in sensing, light emitting, energy harvest, and energy storage are discussed. Then, the fabrication strategies and applications of electronic textiles are summarized. Furthermore, the integration of multifunctional electronic textiles and their applications are summarized. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges and propose the future development of electronic fibers\/textiles.","1460":"Gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes allow new tests of general relativity (GR) to be performed on strong, dynamical gravitational fields. These tests require accurate waveform models of the gravitational-wave signal; otherwise waveform errors can erroneously suggest evidence for new physics. Existing waveforms are generally thought to be accurate enough for current observations, and each of the events observed to date appears to be individually consistent with GR. In the near future, with larger gravitational-wave catalogs, it will be possible to perform more stringent tests of gravity by analyzing large numbers of events together. However, there is a danger that waveform errors can accumulate among events: even if the waveform model is accurate enough for each individual event, it can still yield erroneous evidence for new physics when applied to a large catalog. This paper presents a simple linearized analysis, in the style of a Fisher matrix calculation that reveals the conditions under which the apparent evidence for new physics due to waveform errors grows as the catalog size increases. We estimate that, in the worst-case scenario, evidence for a deviation from GR might appear in some tests using a catalog containing as few as 10 - 30  events above a signal-to-noise ratio of 20. This is close to the size of current catalogs and highlights the need for caution when performing these sorts of experiments.","1461":null,"1462":null,"1463":"Male honeybees (drones) are thought to congregate in large numbers in particular \"drone congregation areas\" to mate. We used harmonic radar to record the flight paths of individual drones and found that drones favored certain locations within the landscape which were stable over two years. Drones often visit multiple potential lekking sites within a single flight and take shared flight paths between them. Flights between such sites are relatively straight and begin as early as the drone's second flight, indicating familiarity with the sites acquired during initial learning flights. Arriving at congregation areas, drones display convoluted, looping flight patterns. We found a correlation between a drone's distance from the center of each area and its acceleration toward the center, a signature of collective behavior leading to congregation in these areas. Our study reveals the behavior of individual drones as they navigate between and within multiple aerial leks.","1464":null,"1465":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging new type of coronavirus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented global health emergency. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a critical role in understanding the disease. Performance variation exists across SARS-CoV-2 viral WGS technologies, but there is currently no benchmarking study comparing different WGS sequencing protocols. We compared seven different SARS-CoV-2 WGS library protocols using RNA from patient nasopharyngeal swab samples under two storage conditions with low and high viral inputs. We found large differences in mappability and genome coverage, and variations in sensitivity, reproducibility, and precision of single-nucleotide variant calling across different protocols. For certain amplicon-based protocols, an appropriate primer trimming step is critical for accurate single-nucleotide variant calling. We ranked the performance of protocols based on six different metrics. Our findings offer guidance in choosing appropriate WGS protocols to characterize SARS-CoV-2 and its evolution.","1466":"Volatolomics is gaining consideration as a viable approach to diagnose several diseases, and it also shows promising results to discriminate COVID-19 patients via breath analysis. This paper extends the study of the relationship between volatile compounds (VOCs) and COVID-19 to blood serum. Blood samples were collected from subjects recruited at the emergency department of a large public hospital. The VOCs were analyzed with a gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC\/MS). GC\/MS data show that in more than 100 different VOCs, the pattern of abundances of 17 compounds identifies COVID-19 from non-COVID with an accuracy of 89% (sensitivity 94% and specificity 83%). GC\/MS analysis was complemented by an array of gas sensors whose data achieved an accuracy of 89% (sensitivity 94% and specificity 80%).","1467":"Many organisms use genetic self-recognition systems to distinguish themselves from conspecifics. In the cnidarian, Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, self-recognition is partially controlled by allorecognition 2 (Alr2). Alr2 encodes a highly polymorphic transmembrane protein that discriminates self from nonself by binding in trans to other Alr2 proteins with identical or similar sequences. Here, we focused on the N-terminal domain of Alr2, which can determine its binding specificity. We pair ancestral sequence reconstruction and experimental assays to show that amino acid substitutions can create sequences with novel binding specificities either directly (via one mutation) or via sequential mutations and intermediates with relaxed specificities. We also show that one side of the domain has experienced positive selection and likely forms the binding interface. Our results provide direct evidence that point mutations can generate Alr2 proteins with novel binding specificities. This provides a plausible mechanism for the generation and maintenance of functional variation in nature.","1468":"Contrary to the fact that capillary action is ubiquitous in our daily lives, its role in drug delivery has not attracted attention. Therefore, its application in medicine and disease treatment has not been actively developed. This perspective begins by reviewing the principles, advantages, and limitations of the three existing drug delivery strategies: non-covalent interaction, cavity loading, and covalent conjugation. Then, we discussed the principle of capillary action in drug delivery and the influencing factors that determine its performance. To illustrate the advantages of capillary action over existing drug delivery strategies and how the capillary action could potentially address the shortcomings of the existing drug delivery strategies, we described five examples of using capillary action to design drug delivery platforms for disease treatment: marker pen for topical and transdermal drug delivery, microneedle patch with a sponge container for pulsatile drug delivery, core-shell scaffold for sustained release of growth factors, oral bolus for insulin delivery to the esophagus, and semi-hollow floating ball for intravesical and gastroprotective drug delivery. Each of the five drug delivery platforms exhibits certain unique functions that existing drug delivery technologies cannot easily achieve, hence expected to solve specific practical medical problems that are not satisfactorily resolved. As people pay more attention to capillary action and develop more drug delivery platforms, more unique functions and characteristics of capillary action in drug delivery will be explored. Thus, capillary action could become an important choice for drug delivery systems to improve therapeutic drug efficacy, treat diseases, and improve human health.","1469":"Astrocytes are recognized to be a heterogeneous population of cells that differ morphologically, functionally, and molecularly. Whether this heterogeneity results from generation of distinct astrocyte cell lineages, each functionally specialized to perform specific tasks, remains an open question. In this study, we used RNA sequencing analysis to determine the global transcriptome profile of the Olig2-expressing astrocyte subtype (Olig2-AS), a specific spinal astrocyte subtype that segregates early during development from Olig2 progenitors and differs from other spinal astrocytes by the expression of Olig2. We identified 245 differentially expressed genes. Among them, 135 exhibit higher levels of expression when compared with other populations of spinal astrocytes, indicating that these genes can serve as a \"unique\" functional signature of Olig2-AS. Among them, we identify two genes, inka2 and kcnip3, as specific molecular markers of the Olig2-AS in the P7 spinal cord. Our work thus reveals that Olig2 progenitors produce a unique spinal astrocyte subtype.","1470":"Computational methods can transform healthcare. In particular, health informatics with artificial intelligence has shown tremendous potential when applied in various fields of medical research and has opened a new era for precision medicine. The development of reusable biomedical software for research or clinical practice is time-consuming and requires rigorous compliance with quality requirements as defined by international standards. However, research projects rarely implement such measures, hindering smooth technology transfer into the research community or manufacturers as well as reproducibility and reusability. Here, we present a guideline for quality management systems (QMS) for academic organizations incorporating the essential components while confining the requirements to an easily manageable effort. It provides a starting point to implement a QMS tailored to specific needs effortlessly and greatly facilitates technology transfer in a controlled manner, thereby supporting reproducibility and reusability. Ultimately, the emerging standardized workflows can pave the way for an accelerated deployment in clinical practice.","1471":null,"1472":"Studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis, have shown potential links between diet components, microbiome composition, and modulation of immune responses. In this review, we reanalyze and discuss findings in an outbred marmoset EAE model in which a yogurt-based dietary supplement decreased disease frequency and severity. We show that although diet has detectable effects on the fecal microbiome, microbiome changes are more strongly associated with the EAE development. Using an ecological framework, we further show that the dominant factors influencing the gut microbiota were marmoset sibling pair and experimental time point. These findings emphasize challenges in assigning cause-and-effect relationships in studies of diet-microbiome-host interactions and differentiating the diet effects from other environmental, stochastic, and host-related factors. We advocate for animal experiments to be designed to allow causal inferences of the microbiota's role in pathology while considering the complex ecological processes that shape microbial communities.","1473":"Bayesian optimization (BO) can accelerate material design requiring time-consuming experiments. However, although most material designs require tuning of multiple properties, the efficiency of multi-objective (MO) BO in time-consuming experimental material design remains unclear, due to the complexity of handling multiple objectives. This study introduces MO BO method that efficiently achieves predefined goals and shows that by focusing on achieving the goals, BO can efficiently accelerate realistic MO design problems with small efforts. Benchmarks showed that the proposed BO method dramatically reduced the number of experiments needed to achieve goals relative to a baseline method. Virtual MO inverse design experiments with realistic material design problems were also performed, during which the proposed method could achieve goals within only around ten experiments in average and showed over 1000-fold acceleration relative to the random sampling for the most difficult case. The introduction of goal-oriented BO will precede real-world application of BO.","1474":null,"1475":null,"1476":null,"1477":"Long-lived organisms are exposed to the risk of accumulating mutations due to DNA damage. Previous studies in animals have revealed the positive relationship between the copy number of DNA repair genes and longevity. However, the role of DNA repair in the lifespan of plants remains poorly understood. Using the recent accumulation of the complete genome sequences of diverse plant species, we performed systematic comparative analyses of the copy number variations of DNA repair genes in 61 plant species with different lifespans. Among 121 DNA repair gene families, PARP gene family was identified as a unique gene that exhibits significant expansion in trees compared to annual and perennial herbs. Among three paralogs of plant PARPs, PARP 1 showed a close association with growth rate. PARPs catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and play pivotal roles in DNA repair and antipathogen defense. Our study suggests the conserved role of PARPs in longevity between plants and animals.","1478":"Emerging evidence has shown that amino acids act as metabolic regulatory signals. Here, we showed that glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) mRNA levels in cultured hepatocyte models were downregulated in an amino-acid-depleted medium. Inversely, stimulation with amino acids increased G6Pase mRNA levels, demonstrating that G6Pase mRNA level is directly controlled by amino acids in a reversible manner. Promoter assay revealed that these amino-acid-mediated changes in G6Pase mRNA levels were attributable to transcriptional regulation, independent of canonical hormone signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis revealed that amino acid starvation induces a defect in the urea cycle, decreasing ornithine, a major intermediate, and supplementation of ornithine in an amino-acid-depleted medium fully rescued G6Pase mRNA transcription, similar to the effects of amino acid stimulation. This pathway was also independent of established mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 pathway. Collectively, we present a hypothetical concept of \"metabolic regulatory amino acid signal,\" possibly mediated by ornithine.","1479":null,"1480":"Land use in the United States (US) is driven by multiple forces operating at the global level, such as income and population growth, yield and productivity improvement, trade policy, climate change, and changing diets. Future land use has implications for biodiversity, run-off, carbon storage, ecosystem values, agriculture, and the broader economy. We investigate those forces and their implications from a multisector, multisystem dynamics (MSD) perspective focused on understanding dynamics and resilience in complex interdependent systems. Historical trends show slight increases in grassland and natural forest areas and decreases in cropland. We project these trends to intensify under higher pressures for agriculture land and reduce under lower pressures, with no evidence of tipping points toward larger agricultural land abandonment or deforestation. However, US sectoral output and trade, fertilizer use, N2O and CH4 emissions from agriculture activities, and CO2 emissions from land use changes are substantially impacted under land use forcing scenarios.","1481":"Saliva is a complex bodily fluid composed of metabolites secreted by major and minor glands, as well as by-products of host oral cells, oral bacteria, gingival crevicular fluid, and exogenous compounds. Major salivary glands include the paired parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The secreted fluids of the salivary glands vary in composition, flow rate, site of release, and clearance suggesting that different types of saliva fulfill different functions and therefore can provide unique biological information. Consequently, for the comprehension of the functionality of the salivary components, spatially resolved investigations are warranted. To understand and comprehensively map the highly heterogeneous environment of the oral cavity, advanced spatial sampling techniques for metabolomics analysis are needed. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of collection devices for spatially resolved sampling aimed at untargeted metabolomics and propose a comprehensive and reproducible collection and analysis protocol for the spatially resolved analysis of the human oral metabolome.","1482":"Human pluripotent stem cells have ushered in an exciting new era for disease modeling, drug discovery, and cell therapy development. Continued progress toward realizing the potential of human pluripotent stem cells will be facilitated by robust data sets and complementary resources that are easily accessed and interrogated by the stem cell community. In this context, we present SISTEMA, a quality-controlled curated gene expression database, built on a valuable catalog of human pluripotent stem cell lines, and their derivatives for which transcriptomic analyses have been generated using a single experimental pipeline. SISTEMA functions as a one-step resource that will assist the stem cell community to easily evaluate the expression level for genes of interest, while comparing them across different hPSC lines, cell types, pathological conditions, or after pharmacological treatments.","1483":"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) sustain spermatogenesis and fertility throughout adult male life. The conserved RNA-binding protein NANOS2 is essential for the maintenance of SSCs, but its targets and mechanisms of function are not fully understood. Here, we generated a fully functional epitope-tagged Nanos2 mouse allele and applied the highly stringent cross-linking and analysis of cDNAs to define NANOS2 RNA occupancy in SSC lines. NANOS2 recognizes the AUKAAWU consensus motif, mostly found in the 3' untranslated region of defined messenger RNAs (mRNAs). We find that NANOS2 is a regulator of key signaling and metabolic pathways whose dosage or activity are known to be critical for SSC maintenance. NANOS2 interacts with components of CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex in SSC lines, and consequently, NANOS2 binding reduces the half-lives of target transcripts. In summary, NANOS2 contributes to SSC maintenance through the regulation of target mRNA stability and key self-renewal pathways.","1484":null,"1485":null,"1486":"Enriched tumor epithelium, tumor-associated stroma, and whole tissue were collected by laser microdissection from thin sections across spatially separated levels of ten high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) and analyzed by mass spectrometry, reverse phase protein arrays, and RNA sequencing. Unsupervised analyses of protein abundance data revealed independent clustering of an enriched stroma and enriched tumor epithelium, with whole tumor tissue clustering driven by overall tumor \"purity.\" Comparing these data to previously defined prognostic HGSOC molecular subtypes revealed protein and transcript expression from tumor epithelium correlated with the differentiated subtype, whereas stromal proteins (and transcripts) correlated with the mesenchymal subtype. Protein and transcript abundance in the tumor epithelium and stroma exhibited decreased correlation in samples collected just hundreds of microns apart. These data reveal substantial tumor microenvironment protein heterogeneity that directly bears on prognostic signatures, biomarker discovery, and cancer pathophysiology and underscore the need to enrich cellular subpopulations for expression profiling.","1487":"Age is a major risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, but few studies have explored the contribution of key hallmarks of aging, namely DNA methylation changes and heterochromatin destructuration, in the neurodegenerative process. Here, we investigated the consequences of viral overexpression of Gadd45b, a multifactorial protein involved in DNA demethylation, in the mouse midbrain. Gadd45b overexpression induced global and stable changes in DNA methylation, particularly in introns of genes related to neuronal functions, as well as on LINE-1 transposable elements. This was paralleled by disorganized heterochromatin, increased DNA damage, and vulnerability to oxidative stress. LINE-1 de-repression, a potential source of DNA damage, preceded Gadd45b-induced neurodegeneration, whereas prolonged Gadd45b expression deregulated expression of genes related to heterochromatin maintenance, DNA methylation, or Parkinson's disease. Our data indicates that aging-related alterations contribute to dopaminergic neuron degeneration with potential implications for Parkinson's disease.","1488":"The need to include the genetic variation within a population into a reference genome led to the concept of a genome sequence graph. Nodes of such a graph are labeled with DNA sequences occurring in represented genomes. Due to double-stranded nature of DNA, each node may be oriented in one of two possible ways, resulting in marking one end of the labeling sequence as in-side and the other as out-side. Edges join pairs of sides and reflect adjacency between node sequences in genomes constituting the graph. Linearization of a sequence graph aims at orienting and ordering graph nodes in a way that makes it more efficient for visualization and further analysis, e.g. access and traversal. We propose a new linearization algorithm, called ALIBI - Algorithm for Linearization by Incremental graph BuIlding. The evaluation shows that ALIBI is computationally very efficient and generates high-quality results.","1489":"In this paper, we propose a low-cost method to capture and purify CO2 from ocean water indirectly from the atmosphere. Atmospheric CO2 dissolves in seawater following Henry's law. In open-cycle ocean thermal energy conversion (OC-OTEC), being a heat engine, large quantities of water are used to generate electricity from temperature differences in the ocean. CO2 and other gases dissolved in seawater are extracted from seawater by a vacuum compressor, being essential for heat transfer in OC-OTEC. Non-condensable gases containing CO2 from OC-OTEC are currently considered a waste gas stream. Based on literature, we calculate cold water non-condensables containing up to 14% CO2. These non-condensables can be refined further to 80-90% purity with a water absorption process, inspired by those as used in the biogas industry. Levelized CO2 capture and purification costs were estimated to be 15-35 euro per ton, as only refinement costs are allocated of a waste gas stream of OC-OTEC.","1490":"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key post-transcriptional regulators that play a substantial role during stress adaptation. Recent proteome-wide surveys have uncovered a large number of new and \"unconventional\" RBPs such as metabolic enzymes, yet little is known about the reconfiguration of the RNA-binding proteome (RBPome) and RNA-enzyme interactions in response to cellular stress. Here, we applied RNA-interactome capture to monitor the dynamics of the mRBPome upon mild oxidative stress in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among the 257 proteins that significantly changed RNA associations, we observed the coordinated remodeling of RNA-binding enzymes - particularly of the central carbon metabolism - that complemented known metabolic responses. Furthermore, we recognized the propensity for paralogous specific alterations of enzyme-RNA interactions. Our results suggest coordinated cross talk between RNA-enzyme interactions and intermediary metabolism to maintain the physiological and molecular balance upon oxidative stress, perhaps through specialization of paralogous during evolution.","1491":null,"1492":null,"1493":null,"1494":null,"1495":null,"1496":"Large-scale algal oil production requires continuous outputs and a trade-off between growth and oil content. Two unrelated marine algae (Nannochloropsis oceanica [CCAP 849\/10] and Chlorella vulgaris [CCAP 211\/21A]) that showed high oil production under batch culture were studied under controlled semicontinuous cultivation conditions. Three essential attributes maximized oil productivity: (i) downregulation of cell size to maximize light absorption under N limitation; (ii) low nutrient-depletion thresholds to trigger oil induction; (iii) a means of carbohydrate suppression in favor of oil. N. oceanica responded better to input N\/P variations and is more suited to continuous oil production. A low N\/P ratio was effective in both suppressing carbohydrate and reducing cell size concomitant with oil production. In C. vulgaris, nutrient starvation thresholds for oil were higher and carbohydrate was preferentially induced, which impeded stress-level optimization for oil. These differences, which impact continuous oil production at scale, are driven by species adaptation to specific marine habitats.   ","1497":"Decision makers in contexts as diverse as medical, judicial, and political decision making are known to differ substantially in response bias and accuracy, and these differences are a major factor undermining the reliability and fairness of the respective decision systems. Using theoretical modeling and empirical testing across five domains, we show that collective systems based on pooling decisions robustly overcome this important but as of now unresolved problem of experts' heterogeneity. In breast and skin cancer diagnostics and fingerprint analysis, we find that pooling the decisions of five experts reduces the variation in sensitivity among decision makers by 52%, 54%, and 41%, respectively. Similar reductions are achieved for specificity and response bias, and in other domains. Thus, although outcomes in individual decision systems are highly variable and at the mercy of individual decision makers, collective systems based on pooling decrease this variation, thereby promoting reliability, fairness, and possibly even trust.","1498":"Turnover of the primary cilium (PC) is critical for proliferation and tissue homeostasis. Each key component of the PC resorption machinery, the HEF1\/Aurora kinase A (AurA)\/HDAC6 pathway harbors cis-elements potentially targeted by the transcriptional co-activator myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) and\/or its partner serum response factor (SRF). Thus we investigated if MRTF and\/or SRF regulate PC turnover. Here we show that (1) both MRTF and SRF are indispensable for serum-induced PC resorption, and (2) they act via both transcriptional and local mechanisms. Intriguingly, MRTF and SRF are present in the basal body and\/or the PC, and serum facilitates ciliary MRTF recruitment. MRTF promotes the stability and ciliary accumulation of AurA and facilitates SRF phosphorylation. Ciliary SRF interacts with AurA and HDAC6. MRTF also inhibits ciliogenesis. It interacts with and is required for the correct localization of the ciliogenesis modulator CEP290. Thus, MRTF and SRF are critical regulators of PC assembly and\/or disassembly, acting both as transcription factors and as PC constituents.","1499":"Skin-interfaced wearable electronics can find a broad spectrum of applications in healthcare, human-machine interface, robotics, and others. The state-of-the-art wearable electronics usually suffer from costly and complex fabrication procedures and nonbiodegradable polymer substrates. Paper, comprising entangled micro- or nano-scale cellulose fibers, is compatible with scalable fabrication techniques and emerges as a sustainable, inexpensive, disposable, and biocompatible substrate for wearable electronics. Given various attractive properties (e.g., breathability, flexibility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability) and rich tunability of surface chemistry and porous structures, paper offers many exciting opportunities for wearable electronics. In this review, we first introduce the intriguing properties of paper-based wearable electronics and strategies for cellulose modifications to satisfy specific demands. We then overview the applications of paper-based devices in biosensing, energy storage and generation, optoelectronics, soft actuators, and several others. Finally, we discuss some challenges that need to be addressed before practical uses and wide implementation of paper-based wearable electronics.","1500":"Bivalent chromatin is characterized by occupation of both activating and repressive histone modifications. Here, we develop a mathematical model that involves antagonistic histone modifications H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 to capture the key features of bivalent chromatin. Three necessary conditions for the emergence of bivalent chromatin are identified, including advantageous methylating activity over demethylating activity, frequent noise conversions of modifications, and sufficient nonlinearity. The first condition is further confirmed by analyzing the existing experimental data. Investigation of the composition of bivalent chromatin reveals that bivalent nucleosomes carrying both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 account for no more than half of nucleosomes at the bivalent chromatin domain. We identify that bivalent chromatin not only allows transitions to multiple states but also serves as a stepping stone to facilitate a stepwise transition between repressive chromatin state and activating chromatin state and thus elucidate crucial roles of bivalent chromatin in mediating phenotypical plasticity during cell fate determination.","1501":"This research addresses one of the most compelling issues in the field of photosynthesis, namely, the role of the accessory chlorophyll molecules in primary charge separation. Using a combination of empirical and computational methods, we demonstrate that the primary acceptor of photosystem (PS) I is a dimer of accessory and secondary chlorophyll molecules, Chl2A and Chl3A, with an asymmetric electron charge density distribution. The incorporation of highly coupled donors and acceptors in PS I allows for extensive delocalization that prolongs the lifetime of the charge-separated state, providing for high quantum efficiency. The discovery of this motif has widespread implications ranging from the evolution of naturally occurring reaction centers to the development of a new generation of highly efficient artificial photosynthetic systems.

During the viral replication and transcription, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase \"jumps\" along the genome template, resulting in discontinuous negative-stranded transcripts. Although the sense-mRNA architectures of SARS-CoV-2 were reported, its negative strand was unexplored. Here, we deeply sequenced both strands of RNA and found SARS-CoV-2 transcription is strongly biased to form the sense strand with variable transcription efficiency for different genes. During negative strand synthesis, numerous non-canonical fusion transcripts are also formed, driven by 3-15 nt sequence homology scattered along the genome but more prone to be inhibited by SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase inhibitor remdesivir. The drug also represses more of the negative than the positive strand synthesis as supported by a mathematic simulation model and experimental quantifications. Overall, this study opens new sights into SARS-CoV-2 biogenesis and may facilitate the antiviral vaccine development and drug design.","1503":null,"1504":null,"1505":"Numerous observations demonstrate that microorganisms can survive very long periods of nutrient deprivation and starvation. Moreover, it is evident that prolonged periods of starvation are a feature of many habitats, and many cells in all kingdoms of life are found in prolonged starvation conditions. Bacteria exhibit a range of responses to long-term starvation. These include genetic adaptations such as the long-term stationary phase and the growth advantage in stationary phase phenotypes characterized by mutations in stress-signaling genes and elevated mutation rates. Here, we suggest using the term \"endurance of prolonged nutrient prevention\" (EPNP phase), to describe this phase, which was also recently described in eukaryotes. Here, we review this literature and describe the current knowledge about the adaptations to very long-term starvation conditions in bacteria and eukaryotes, its conceptual and structural conservation across all kingdoms of life, and point out possible directions that merit further research.","1506":"Motion tracking provides unique insights into motor, cognitive, and social development by capturing subtle variations into how movements are planned and controlled. Here, we present a low-cost, wearable movement measurement platform, KiD, specifically designed for tracking the movements of infants and children in a variety of natural settings. KiD consists of a small, lightweight sensor containing a nine-axis inertial measurement unit plus an integrated processor for computing rotations. Measurements of three-dimensional acceleration using KiD compare well with those of current state-of-the-art optical motion capture systems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate successful classification of different types of sinusoidal right arm movements using KiD.","1507":null,"1508":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102199.].","1509":null,"1510":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative motor neuron disease characterized by the formation of cytoplasmic ubiquitinated TDP-43 protein aggregates in motor neurons. Stress granules (SGs) are stress-induced cytoplasmic protein aggregates containing various neuropathogenic proteins, including TDP-43. Several studies have suggested that SGs are the initial site of the formation of pathogenic ubiquitinated TDP-43 aggregates in ALS neurons. Mutations in the optineurin (OPTN) and TIA1 genes are causative factors of familial ALS with TDP-43 aggregation pathology. We found that both OPTN depletion and ALS-associated OPTN mutations upregulated the TIA1 level in cells recovered from heat shock, and this upregulated TIA1 increased the amount of ubiquitinated TDP-43. Ubiquitinated TDP-43 induced by OPTN depletion was localized in SGs. Our study suggests that ALS-associated loss-of-function mutants of OPTN increase the amount of ubiquitinated TDP-43 in neurons by increasing the expression of TIA1, thereby promoting the aggregation of ubiquitinated TDP-43.","1511":"Rapid urbanization has tremendously changed the global landscape with profound impacts on our society. Nighttime light (NTL) data can provide valuable information about human activities and socioeconomic conditions thus has become an effective proxy to measure urban development. By using NTL-derived urban measures from 1992 to 2018, we analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of global urban development from country to region to city scales, which presented a distinct North-South divergence characterized by the rising and declining patterns. A global North-South division line was identified to partition the globe into the Line-North and the Line-South geographically, which accorded with the socioeconomic difference from the aspects of urban population and economy. This line may keep a certain degree of stability deriving from the trends of population and economic information but also bears uncertainties in the long term.","1512":null,"1513":"Amblyopia (lazy eye) is a neurodevelopmental disorder of vision with no ocular pathology. The loss of vision in the amblyopic eye is assumed to be the main deficit in amblyopia, which has resulted in visual acuity (VA) being the primary outcome measure for treatment. Here we used a binocular orientation combination task to quantitatively assess the binocular status by measuring the binocular balance. We set out to determine whether amblyopes who reach the acuity-based end point have a residual binocular imbalance. Our results suggest that even amblyopes who have regained normal acuity have residual binocular deficits over a wide range of spatial frequencies. A further control study suggests that these binocular deficits could not be explained by any residual contrast sensitivity deficits of the amblyopic eye. Consequently, amblyopia is not the primary problem and VA is not the appropriate end point measure.","1514":null,"1515":"Many social species are able to perform collective decisions and reach consensus. However, how the interplay between social interactions, the diversity of preferences among the group members and the group size affects these dynamics is usually overlooked. The collective choice between odourous and odorless shelters is tested for the following three groups of social cockroaches (Periplaneta americana) which are solitary foragers: naive (individuals preferring the odorous shelter), conditioned (individuals without preference), and mixed (combining, unevenly, conditioned, and naive individuals). The robustness of the consensus is not affected by the naive individuals' proportion, but the rate and the frequency of selection of the odorous shelter are correlated to this proportion. In mixed groups, the naive individuals act as influencers. Simulations based on the mechanisms highlighted in our experiments predict that the consensus emerges only for intermediate group sizes. The universality of these mechanisms suggests that such phenomena are widely present in social systems.","1516":null,"1517":null,"1518":"Tumor multiregion sequencing reveals intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and clonal evolution playing a key role in tumor progression and metastases. Large-scale high-depth multiregional sequencing of colorectal cancer, comparative analysis among patients with right-sided colon cancer (RCC), left-sided colon cancer (LCC), and rectal cancer (RC), as well as the study of lymph node metastasis (LN) with extranodal tumor deposits (ENTDs) from evolutionary perspective remain weakly explored. Here, we recruited 68 patients with RCC (18), LCC (20), and RC (30). We performed high-depth whole-exome sequencing of 206 tumor regions including 176 primary tumors, 19 LN, and 11 ENTD samples. Our results showed ITH with a Darwinian pattern of evolution and the evolution pattern of LCC and RC was more complex and divergent than RCC. Genetic and evolutionary evidences found that both LN and ENTD originated from different clones. Moreover, ENTD was a distinct entity from LN and evolved later.","1519":null,"1520":"Imaging of cells and tissues has improved significantly over the last decade. Dual-beam instruments with a focused ion beam mounted on a scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM), offering high-resolution 3D imaging of large volumes and fields-of-view are becoming widely used in the life sciences. FIB-SEM has most recently been implemented on fully hydrated, cryo-immobilized, biological samples. Correlative light and electron microscopy workflows combining fluorescence microscopy (FM) with FIB-SEM imaging exist, whereas workflows combining cryo-FM and cryo-FIB-SEM imaging are not yet commonly available. Here, we demonstrate that fluorescently labeled lipid droplets can serve as in situ fiducial markers for correlating cryo-FM and FIB-SEM datasets and that this approach can be used to target the acquisition of large FIB-SEM stacks spanning tens of microns under cryogenic conditions. We also show that cryo-FIB-SEM imaging is particularly informative for questions related to organelle structure and inter-organellar contacts, nuclear organization, and mineral deposits in cells.","1521":null,"1522":"Lysosome functions mainly rely on their ability to either degrade substrates or release them into the extracellular space. Lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) are commonly characterized by a chronic lysosomal accumulation of different substrates, thereby causing lysosomal dysfunctions and secretion defects. However, the early effects of substrate accumulation on lysosomal homeostasis have not been analyzed so far. Here, we describe how the acute accumulation of a single substrate determines a rapid centripetal redistribution of the lysosomes, triggering their expansion and reducing their secretion, by limiting the motility of these organelles toward the plasma membrane. Moreover, we provide evidence that such defects could be explained by a trapping mechanism exerted by the extensive contacts between the enlarged lysosomes and the highly intertwined membrane structures of the endoplasmic reticulum which might represent a crucial biological cue ultimately leading to the clinically relevant secondary defects observed in the LSD experimental models and patients.","1523":"A huge amount of agricultural wastes and waste activated-sludge are being generated every year around the world. Anaerobic co-digestion (AcD) has been considered as an alternative for the utilization of organic matters from such organic wastes by producing bioenergy and biochemicals to realize a circular bioeconomy. Despite recent advancement in AcD processes, the effect of feedstock compositions and operating conditions on the biomethane production processe has not been critically explored. In this paper, we have reviewed the effects of feedstock (organic wastes) characteristics, including particle size, carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, and pretreatment options, on the performance of an anaerobic digestion process. In addition, we provided an overview of the effect of key control parameters, including retention time, temperature, pH of digestate, volatile fatty acids content, total solids content, and organic loading rate. Lastly, based on the findings from the literature, we have presented several perspectives and prospects on priority research to promote AcD to a steppingstone for a circular bioeconomy.","1524":"In order to understand ecologically meaningful social behaviors and their neural substrates in humans and other animals, researchers have been using a variety of social stimuli in the laboratory with a goal of extracting specific processes in real-life scenarios. However, certain stimuli may not be sufficiently effective at evoking typical social behaviors and neural responses. Here, we review empirical research employing different types of social stimuli by classifying them into five levels of naturalism. We describe the advantages and limitations while providing selected example studies for each level. We emphasize the important trade-off between experimental control and ecological validity across the five levels of naturalism. Taking advantage of newly emerging tools, such as real-time videos, virtual avatars, and wireless neural sampling techniques, researchers are now more than ever able to adopt social stimuli at a higher level of naturalism to better capture the dynamics and contingency of real-life social interaction.","1525":null,"1526":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101800.].","1527":"The infant-caregiver relationship involves physical contact for feeding, moving, and other cares, and such contact also encourages the infant to form an attachment, an emotional bond with the caregivers. Physical contact always accompanies somatosensory perception, which is detected by mechanosensory neurons and processed in the brain. Physical contact triggers sensorimotor reflexes such as Transport Response in rodent infants, and calm human infants while being carried. Tactile sensation and deep pressure in physical interactions, such as hugging, can function as emotional communication between infant and caregiver, which can alter the behavior and mood of both the infant and caregiver. This review summarizes the findings related to physical contact between the infant and the caregiver in terms of pleasant, noxious, and neutral somatosensation and discusses how somatosensory perceptions foster a feeling of safety that is important for infant's psychosocial development.","1528":"The major lineages of nectar-feeding birds (hummingbirds, sunbirds, honeyeaters, flowerpiercers, and lorikeets) are considered examples of convergent evolution. We compared sucrose digestion capacity and sucrase enzymatic activity per unit intestinal surface area among 50 avian species from the New World, Africa, and Australia, including 20 nectarivores. With some exceptions, nectarivores had smaller intestinal surfaces, higher sucrose hydrolysis capacity, and greater sucrase activity per unit intestinal area. Convergence analysis showed high values for sucrose hydrolysis and sucrase activity per unit intestinal surface area in specialist nectarivores, matching the high proportion of sucrose in the nectar of the plants they pollinate. Plants pollinated by generalist nectar-feeding birds in the Old and New Worlds secrete nectar in which glucose and fructose are the dominant sugars. Matching intestinal enzyme activity in birds and nectar composition in flowers appears to be an example of convergent coevolution between plants and pollinators on an intercontinental scale.","1529":"Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is a central defect in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Here, we analyzed skeletal muscle proteome in 148 vastus lateralis muscle biopsies obtained from men covering all glucose tolerance phenotypes: normal, impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and T2D. Skeletal muscle proteome was analyzed by a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra (SWATH-MS) proteomics technique. Our data indicate a downregulation in several proteins involved in mitochondrial electron transport or respiratory chain complex assembly already in IFG and IGT muscles, with most profound decreases observed in T2D. Additional phosphoproteomic analysis reveals altered phosphorylation in several signaling pathways in IFG, IGT, and T2D muscles, including those regulating glucose metabolic processes, and the structure of muscle cells. These data reveal several alterations present in skeletal muscle already in prediabetes and highlight impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism in the trajectory from prediabetes into T2D.","1530":"Previous studies have revealed the importance of inter-tissue communications for lifespan regulation. However, the inter-tissue network responsible for lifespan regulation is not well understood, even in a simple organism Caenorhabditis elegans. To understand the mechanisms underlying systemic lifespan regulation, we focused on lifespan regulation by the insulin\/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS) pathway; IIS reduction activates the DAF-16\/FOXO transcription factor, which results in lifespan extension. Our tissue-specific knockdown and knockout analyses demonstrated that IIS reduction in neurons and the intestine markedly extended lifespan. DAF-16 activation in neurons resulted in DAF-16 activation in the intestine and vice versa. Our dual gene manipulation method revealed that intestinal and neuronal DAF-16 mediate longevity induced by daf-2 knockout in neurons and the intestine, respectively. In addition, the systemic regulation of intestinal DAF-16 required the IIS pathway in intestinal and neurons.

Conversely, nutlin-mediated activation of p53 led to the repression of MCOLN1. Elevated MCOLN1 expression in p53-deficient cancer cells, though not sufficient for bolstering proliferation, augmented the effects of oncogenic HRAS on proliferation, cytokine production, and invasion. Our data suggest that owing to derepression of MCOLN1, urothelial cells lacking p53 are poised for tumorigenesis driven by oncogenic HRAS. Given our prior findings that HRAS mutations predict addiction to TRPML1, this study points to the utility of TRPML1 inhibitors for mitigating the growth of a subset of urothelial tumors that lack p53.","1535":null,"1536":"Polarity-reversal catalysts enable otherwise sluggish or completely ineffective reactions which are characterized by unfavorable polar effects between radicals and substrates. We herein disclose that when irradiated by visible light, bromine can behave as a polarity-reversal catalyst. Hydroacylation of vinyl arenes, a three-component cascade transformation and deuteration of aldehydes were each achieved in a metal-free manner without initiators by using inexpensive N-bromosuccinimide as the precatalyst. Light is essential to generate and maintain the active bromine radical during the reaction process. Another key to success is that HBr can behave as an effective hydrogen donor to turn over the catalytic cycles.","1537":null,"1538":"Recent advancements in bidimensional nanoparticles production such as graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO) have the potential to meet the need for highly functional personal protective equipment (PPE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ability of G and GO to interact with microorganisms provides an opportunity to develop engineered textiles for use in PPE and limit the spread of COVID-19. PPE in current use in high-risk settings for COVID transmission provides only a physical barrier that decreases infection likelihood and does not inactivate the virus. Here, we show that virus pre-incubation with soluble GO inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO cells. Furthermore, when G\/GO-functionalized polyurethane or cotton was in contact SARS-CoV-2, the infectivity of the fabric was nearly completely inhibited. The findings presented here constitute an important innovative nanomaterial-based strategy to significantly increase PPE efficacy in protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus that may implement water filtration, air purification, and diagnostics methods.","1539":"Soft wearable electronics are rapidly developing through exploration of new materials, fabrication approaches, and design concepts. Although there have been many efforts for decades, a resurgence of interest in liquid metals (LMs) for sensing and wiring functional properties of materials in soft wearable electronics has brought great advances in wearable electronics and materials. Various forms of LMs enable many routes to fabricate flexible and stretchable sensors, circuits, and functional wearables with many desirable properties. This review article presents a systematic overview of recent progresses in LM-enabled wearable electronics that have been achieved through material innovations and the discovery of new fabrication approaches and design architectures. We also present applications of wearable LM technologies for physiological sensing, activity tracking, and energy harvesting. Finally, we discuss a perspective on future opportunities and challenges for wearable LM electronics as this field continues to grow.","1540":"Redox couples coordinate cellular function, but the consequences of their imbalances are unclear. This is somewhat associated with the limitations of their experimental quantification. Here we circumvent these difficulties by presenting an approach that characterizes fitness-based tolerance profiles to redox couple imbalances using an in silico representation of metabolism. Focusing on the NADH\/NAD+ redox couple in yeast, we demonstrate that reductive disequilibria generate metabolic syndromes comparable to those observed in cancer cells. The tolerance of yeast mutants to redox disequilibrium can also explain 30% of the variability in their experimentally measured chronological lifespan. Moreover, by predicting the significance of some metabolites to help stand imbalances, we correctly identify nutrients underlying mechanisms of pathology, lifespan-protecting molecules, or caloric restriction mimetics. Tolerance to redox imbalances becomes, in this way, a sound framework to recognize properties of the aging phenotype while providing a consistent biological rationale to assess anti-aging interventions.","1541":"Nanopore sequencing is an increasingly powerful tool for genomics. Recently, computational advances have allowed nanopores to sequence in a targeted fashion; as the sequencer emits data, software can analyze the data in real time and signal the sequencer to eject \"nontarget\" DNA molecules. We present a novel method called SPUMONI, which enables rapid and accurate targeted sequencing using efficient pan-genome indexes. SPUMONI uses a compressed index to rapidly generate exact or approximate matching statistics in a streaming fashion. When used to target a specific strain in a mock community, SPUMONI has similar accuracy as minimap2 when both are run against an index containing many strains per species. However SPUMONI is 12 times faster than minimap2. SPUMONI's index and peak memory footprint are also 16 to 4 times smaller than those of minimap2, respectively. This could enable accurate targeted sequencing even when the targeted strains have not necessarily been sequenced or assembled previously.","1542":"Topological insulators (TIs) are bulk insulators with metallic surface states that can be described by a single Dirac cone. However, low-dimensional solids such as nanowires (NWs) are a challenge, due to the difficulty of separating surface contributions from bulk carriers. Fabrication of NWs with high surface-to-volume ratio can be realized by different methods such as chemical vapor transport, molecular beam epitaxy, and electrodeposition. The last method is used in the present work allowing the growth of structures such as p-n junctions, intercalation of magnetic or superconducting dots. We report the synthesis of high-quality TI NW: Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 and p-n junction via electrodeposition. Structural, morphological, and nanostructure properties of NWs have been investigated by various characterization techniques. Interface structures and lateral heterojunctions (LHJ) in p-n junction NWs has also been made.","1543":"The endeavors to develop manufacturing methods that can enhance polymer and composite structures in spacecraft have led to much research and innovation over many decades. However, the thermal stability, intrinsic material stress, and anisotropic substrate properties pose significant challenges and inhibit the use of previously proposed solutions under extreme space environment. Here, we overcome these issues by developing a custom-designed, plasma-enhanced cross-linked poly(p-xylylene):diamond-like carbon superlattice material that enables enhanced mechanical coupling with the soft polymeric and composite materials, which in turn can be applied to large 3D engineering structures. The superlattice structure developed forms an integral part with the substrate and results in a space qualifiable carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer featuring 10-20 times greater resistance to cracking without affecting the stiffness of dimensionally stable structures. This innovation paves the way for the next generation of advanced ultra-stable composites for upcoming optical and radar instrument space programs and advanced engineering applications.","1544":"Pregravid obesity is associated with several adverse maternal health outcomes, such as increased risk of infection, suggesting an altered immunological state. However, the mechanisms by which obesity disrupts the pregnancy \"immune clock\" are still unknown. Here, we profiled circulating immune mediators, immune cell subset frequencies, and peripheral immune responses during the first and third trimesters of pregnancy in lean and obese mothers. While both Th1 and Th2 cytokines were elevated with pregnancy regardless of BMI, obese subjects had dysregulated myeloid factors in circulation at term. Pregnancy in lean subjects was associated with enhanced monocyte activation, augmented chromatin accessibility at inflammatory loci, and heightened responses to LPS. Pregravid obesity disrupted this trajectory, resulting in a lack of transcriptional, epigenetic, and metabolic changes strongly suggesting a skewing toward innate immune tolerance. These findings provide novel insight into the increased susceptibility to infections in women with obesity during pregnancy and following cesarean delivery.","1545":null,"1546":"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can generate a multiplicity of organoids, yet no compelling evidence currently exists as to whether or not these contain tissue-specific, holoclone-forming stem cells. Here, we show that a subpopulation of cells in a hiPSC-derived corneal epithelial cell sheet is positive for ABCB5 (ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B, member 5), a functional marker of adult corneal epithelial stem cells. These cells possess remarkable holoclone-forming capabilities, which can be suppressed by an antibody-mediated ABCB5 blockade. The cell sheets are generated from ABCB5+ hiPSCs that first emerge in 2D eye-like organoids around six weeks of differentiation and display corneal epithelial immunostaining characteristics and gene expression patterns, including sustained expression of ABCB5. The findings highlight the translational potential of ABCB5-enriched, hiPSC-derived corneal epithelial cell sheets to recover vision in stem cell-deficient human eyes and represent the first report of holoclone-forming stem cells being directly identified in an hiPSC-derived organoid.","1547":null,"1548":null,"1549":null,"1550":"","1551":null,"1552":"Insights into the genomic consequences of symbiosis for basidiomycete fungi associated with social insects remain sparse. Capitalizing on viability of spores from centuries-old herbarium specimens of free-living, facultative, and specialist termite-associated Podaxis fungi, we obtained genomes of 10 specimens, including two type species described by Linnaeus &gt;240 years ago. We document that the transition to termite association was accompanied by significant reductions in genome size and gene content, accelerated evolution in protein-coding genes, and reduced functional capacities for oxidative stress responses and lignin degradation. Functional testing confirmed that termite specialists perform worse under oxidative stress, while all lineages retained some capacity to cleave lignin. Mitochondrial genomes of termite associates were significantly larger; possibly driven by smaller population sizes or reduced competition, supported by apparent loss of certain biosynthetic gene clusters. Our findings point to relaxed selection that mirrors genome traits observed among obligate endosymbiotic bacteria of many insects.","1553":"We cooperate with other people despite the risk of being exploited or hurt. If future artificial intelligence (AI) systems are benevolent and cooperative toward us, what will we do in return? Here we show that our cooperative dispositions are weaker when we interact with AI. In nine experiments, humans interacted with either another human or an AI agent in four classic social dilemma economic games and a newly designed game of Reciprocity that we introduce here. Contrary to the hypothesis that people mistrust algorithms, participants trusted their AI partners to be as cooperative as humans. However, they did not return AI's benevolence as much and exploited the AI more than humans. These findings warn that future self-driving cars or co-working robots, whose success depends on humans' returning their cooperativeness, run the risk of being exploited. This vulnerability calls not just for smarter machines but also better human-centered policies.","1554":"Guided by a multi-level \"deconstruction\" of omental metastases, we developed a tetra (four cell)-culture model of primary human mesothelial cells, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cell lines. This multi-cellular model replicated key elements of human metastases and allowed malignant cell invasion into the artificial omental structure. Prompted by findings in patient biopsies, we used the model to investigate the role of platelets in malignant cell invasion and extracellular matrix, ECM, production. RNA (sequencing and quantitative polymerase-chain reaction), protein (proteomics and immunohistochemistry) and image analysis revealed that platelets stimulated malignant cell invasion and production of ECM molecules associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, we found that platelet activation of mesothelial cells was critical in stimulating malignant cell invasion. Whilst platelets likely activate both malignant cells and mesothelial cells, the tetra-culture model allowed us to dissect the role of both cell types and model the early stages of HGSOC metastases.","1555":null,"1556":null,"1557":"Members of a disintegrin and metalloproteinases with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTS) family have been implicated in various vascular diseases. However, their functional roles in early embryonic vascular development are unknown. In this study, we showed that Adamts18 is highly expressed at E11.5-E14.5 in cells surrounding the embryonic aortic arch (AOAR) and the common carotid artery (CCA) during branchial arch artery development in mice. Adamts18 deficiency was found to cause abnormal development of AOAR, CCA, and the third and fourth branchial arch appendages, leading to hypoplastic carotid body, thymus, and variation of middle cerebral artery. Adamts18 was shown to affect the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components, in particular fibronectin (Fn), around AOAR and CCA. As a result of increased Fn accumulation, the Notch3 signaling pathway was activated to promote the differentiation of cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs) to vascular smooth muscle cells. These data indicate that Adamts18-mediated ECM homeostasis is crucial for the differentiation of CNCCs.","1558":null,"1559":null,"1560":null,"1561":null,"1562":"Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) causes anorexia and weight loss in animal models, and higher circulating levels are associated with cachexia and reduced survival in cancer and other chronic diseases such as sepsis. To investigate the role of sepsis-induced GDF15, we examined whether GDF15 neutralization via a validated and highly potent monoclonal antibody, mAB2, modulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced anorexia, weight loss, and mortality in rodents. LPS injection transiently increased circulating GDF15 in wild-type mice, decreased food intake and body weight, and increased illness behavior and mortality at a high dose. GDF15 neutralization with mAB2 did not prevent or exacerbate any of the effects of LPS. Similarly, in GDF15 knockout mice, the LPS effect on appetite and survival was comparable with that observed in wild-type controls. Therefore, effective inhibition of circulating active GDF15 via an antibody or via gene knockout demonstrated that survival in the LPS acute inflammation model was independent of GDF15.","1563":null,"1564":null,"1565":null,"1566":"During chicken skin development, each feather bud exhibits its own polarity, but a population of buds organizes with a collective global orientation. We used embryonic dorsal skin, with buds aligned parallel to the rostral-caudal body axis, to explore whether exogenous electric fields affect feather polarity. Interestingly, brief exogenous current exposure prior to visible bud formation later altered bud orientations. Applying electric pulses perpendicular to the body rostral-caudal axis realigned bud growth in a collective swirl, resembling an electric field pointing toward the anode. Perturbed buds show normal molecular expression and morphogenesis except for their altered orientation. Epithelial-mesenchymal recombination demonstrates the effects of exogenous electric fields are mediated through the epithelium. Small-molecule channel inhibitor screens show Ca2+ channels and PI3 Kinase are involved in controlling feather bud polarity. This work reveals the importance of bioelectricity in organ development and regeneration and provides an explant culture platform for experimentation.","1567":"COVID-19 is a respiratory tract infection that can affect multiple organ systems. Predicting the severity and clinical outcome of individual patients is a major unmet clinical need that remains challenging due to intra- and inter-patient variability. Here, we longitudinally profiled and integrated more than 150 clinical, laboratory, and immunological parameters of 173 patients with mild to fatal COVID-19. Using systems biology, we detected progressive dysregulation of multiple parameters indicative of organ damage that correlated with disease severity, particularly affecting kidneys, hepatobiliary system, and immune landscape. By performing unsupervised clustering and trajectory analysis, we identified T and B cell depletion as early indicators of a complicated disease course. In addition, markers of hepatobiliary damage emerged as robust predictor of lethal outcome in critically ill patients. This allowed us to propose a novel clinical COVID-19 SeveriTy (COST) score that distinguishes complicated disease trajectories and predicts lethal outcome in critically ill patients.","1568":"Severe COVID-19 is accompanied by rampant immune dysregulation in the lung and periphery, with immune cells of both compartments contributing to systemic distress. The extent to which immune cells of the lung and blood enter similar or distinct pathological states during severe disease remains unknown. Here, we leveraged 96 publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets to elucidate common and compartment-specific features of severe to critical COVID-19 at the levels of transcript expression, biological pathways, and ligand-receptor signaling networks. Comparing severe patients to milder and healthy donors, we identified distinct differential gene expression signatures between compartments and a core set of co-directionally regulated surface markers. A majority of severity-enriched pathways were shared, whereas TNF and interferon responses were polarized. Severity-specific ligand-receptor networks appeared to be differentially active in both compartments. Overall, our results describe a nuanced response during severe COVID-19 where compartment plays a role in dictating the pathological state of immune cells.","1569":"Macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR1) plays an important role in host defense to bacterial infections, M2 macrophage polarization, and lipid homeostasis. However, its physiological function in viral pathogenesis remains poorly defined. Herein, we report that MSR1 facilitates vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection in the central nervous system. Msr1-deficient (Msr1 -\/-) mice presented reduced morbidity, mortality, and viral loads in the spinal cord following lethal VSV infection, along with normal viremia and innate immune responses, compared to Msr1 +\/- littermates and wild-type mice. Msr1 expression was most significantly upregulated in the spinal cord, the predominant target of VSV. Mechanistically, through its extracellular domains, MSR1 interacted with VSV surface glycoprotein and facilitated its cellular entry in a low-density lipoprotein receptor-dependent manner. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that MSR1 serves as a cofactor for VSV cellular entry and facilitates its infection preferentially in the spinal cord.","1570":"The kidneys maintain homeostasis by controlling the amount of water and electrolytes in the blood. That function is accomplished by the nephrons, which transform glomerular filtrate into urine by a transport process mediated by membrane transporters. We postulate that the distribution of renal transporters along the nephron is markedly different between men and women, as recently shown in rodents. We hypothesize that the larger abundance of a renal Na+ transport in the proximal tubules in females may also better prepare them for the fluid retention adaptations required during pregnancy and lactation. Also, kidneys play a key role in blood pressure regulation, and a popular class of anti-hypertensive medications and angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to be less effective in women. Model simulations suggest that the blunted natriuretic and diuretic effects of ACE inhibition in women can be attributed, in part, to their higher distal baseline transport capacity.","1571":null,"1572":null,"1573":null,"1574":null,"1575":null,"1576":"","1577":null,"1578":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101950.].","1579":"As the country with the world's largest coal power capacity, China is launching a national carbon market. How the carbon pricing may contribute to phasing out China's coal power is a great concern. We collect full-sample data set of China's 4540 operating coal plant units and develop a stochastic Monte-Carlo financial model to assess the financial sustainability of the plant operation. Although China's coal plants have long residual technical lifetime, their operations are close to the break-even state. Even with low carbon price of 50 CNY\/tCO2 growing at 4%\/y and the permits being fully auctioned, the average residual lifetime of all the plants will be reduced by 5.43 years, and the cumulative CO2 emission from 2020 to 2050 will be reduced by 22.73 billion ton. The spatial disparity in the carbon pricing effect is significant, and the western regions are more vulnerable to the carbon pricing risk than the eastern regions.","1580":null,"1581":"Despite the remarkable success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells against hematologic malignancies, severe off-tumor effects have constrained their use against solid tumors. Recently, CAR-engineered natural killer (NK) cells have emerged as an effective and safe alternative. Here, we demonstrate that HER2 CAR-expression in NK cells from healthy donors and patients with breast cancer potently enhances their anti-tumor functions against various HER2-expressing cancer cells, regardless of MHC class I expression. Moreover, HER2 CAR-NK cells exert higher cytotoxicity than donor-matched HER2 CAR-T cells against tumor targets. Importantly, unlike CAR-T cells, HER2 CAR-NK cells do not elicit enhanced cytotoxicity or inflammatory cytokine production against non-malignant human lung epithelial cells with basal HER2 expression. Further, HER2 CAR-NK cells maintain high cytotoxic function in the presence of immunosuppressive factors enriched in solid tumors. These results show that CAR-NK cells may be a highly potent and safe source of immunotherapy in the context of solid tumors.","1582":"Microbes can invade as whole communities, but the ecology of whole community invasions is poorly understood. Here, we investigate how invader propagule pressure (the number of invading organisms) affects the composition and function of invaded laboratory methanogenic communities. An invading community was equally successful at establishing itself in a resident community regardless of propagule pressure, which varied between 0.01 and 10% of the size resident community. Invasion resulted in enhanced biogas production (to the level of the pure invading community) but only when propagule pressure was 1% or greater. This inconsistency between invasion success and changes in function can be explained by a lower richness of invading taxa at lower propagule pressures, and an important functional role of the taxa that were absent. Our results highlight that whole community invasion ecology cannot simply be extrapolated from our understanding of single species invasions. Moreover, we show that methane production can be enhanced by invading poorly performing reactors with a better performing community at levels that may be practical in industrial settings.","1583":"Central gain compensation for reduced auditory nerve output has been hypothesized as a mechanism for tinnitus with a normal audiogram. Here, we investigate if gain compensation occurs with aging. For 94 people (aged 12-68 years, 64 women, 7 tinnitus) with normal or close-to-normal audiograms, the amplitude of wave I of the auditory brainstem response decreased with increasing age but was not correlated with wave V amplitude after accounting for age-related subclinical hearing loss and cochlear damage, a result indicative of age-related gain compensation. The correlations between age and wave I\/III or III\/V amplitude ratios suggested that compensation occurs at the wave III generator site. For each one of the seven participants with non-pulsatile tinnitus, the amplitude of wave I, wave V, and the wave I\/V amplitude ratio were well within the confidence limits of the non-tinnitus participants. We conclude that increased central gain occurs with aging and is not specific to tinnitus.","1584":"Low temperatures can be fatal to insects, but many species have evolved the ability to cold acclimate, thereby increasing their cold tolerance. It has been previously shown that Drosophila melanogaster larvae perform cold-evoked behaviors under the control of noxious cold-sensing neurons (nociceptors), but it is unknown how the nervous system might participate in cold tolerance. Herein, we describe cold-nociceptive behavior among 11 drosophilid species; we find that the predominant cold-evoked larval response is a head-to-tail contraction behavior, which is likely inherited from a common ancestor, but is unlikely to be protective. We therefore tested the hypothesis that cold nociception functions to protect larvae by triggering cold acclimation. We found that Drosophila melanogaster Class III nociceptors are sensitized by and critical to cold acclimation and that cold acclimation can be optogenetically evoked, sans cold. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that cold nociception constitutes a peripheral neural basis for Drosophila larval cold acclimation.","1585":null,"1586":"A hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the inability of self-renewing malignant cells to mature into a non-dividing terminally differentiated state. This differentiation block has been linked to dysregulation of multiple cellular processes, including transcriptional, chromatin, and metabolic regulation. The transcription factor HOXA9 and the histone demethylase LSD1 are examples of such regulators that promote differentiation blockade in AML. To identify metabolic targets that interact with LSD1 inhibition to promote myeloid maturation, we screened a small molecule library to identify druggable substrates. We found that differentiation caused by LSD1 inhibition is enhanced by combined perturbation of purine nucleotide salvage and de novo lipogenesis pathways, and identified multiple lines of evidence to support the specificity of these pathways and suggest a potential basis of how perturbation of these pathways may interact synergistically to promote myeloid differentiation. In sum, these findings suggest potential drug combination strategies in the treatment of AML.","1587":"Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) of large tissue samples does not require mechanical sectioning and allows efficient visualization of spatially complex or rare structures. Therefore, LSFM has become invaluable in developmental and biomedical research. Because sample size may limit whole-mount staining, LSFM benefits from transgenic reporter organisms expressing fluorescent proteins (FPs) and, however, requires optical clearing and computational data visualization and analysis. The former often interferes with FPs, while the latter requires massive computing resources. Here, we describe 3D-polymerized cell dispersions, a rapid and straightforward method, based on recombinant FP expression in freely selectable tester cells, to evaluate and compare fluorescence retention in different tissue-clearing protocols. For the analysis of large LSFM data, which usually requires huge computing resources, we introduce a refined, interactive, hierarchical random walker approach that is capable of efficient segmentation of the vasculature in data sets even on a consumer grade PC.","1588":"Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells can create metabolic liabilities. KEAP1-mutant lung cancer is refractory to most current therapies. Here we show that KEAP1 deficiency promotes glucose dependency in lung cancer cells, and KEAP1-mutant\/deficient lung cancer cells are more vulnerable to glucose deprivation than their WT counterparts. Mechanistically, KEAP1 inactivation in lung cancer cells induces constitutive activation of NRF2 transcription factor and aberrant expression of NRF2 target cystine transporter SLC7A11; under glucose limitation, high cystine uptake in KEAP1-inactivated lung cancer cells stimulates toxic intracellular disulfide buildup, NADPH depletion, and cell death, which can be rescued by genetic ablation of NRF2-SLC7A11 axis or treatments inhibiting disulfide accumulation. Finally, we show that KEAP1-inactivated lung cancer cells or xenograft tumors are sensitive to glucose transporter inhibitor. Together, our results reveal that KEAP1 deficiency induces glucose dependency in lung cancer cells and uncover a therapeutically relevant metabolic liability.","1589":"Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators directly convert mechanical energy to electrical energy. However, due to production of low amplitude voltages at low fluid velocities, they are not useful for electronic devices requiring power at watt scale. This work introduces vortex MHD, capable of producing voltages on scale of volts and generating power on a scale of watts. This is achieved by using Galinstan, a highly conductive metallic fluid, which remains liquid at room temperature. The proposed device comprises an impeller and set of copper coils positioned in a ferromagnetic housing. Three-phase AC current is passed in the coils producing a rotating magnetic field. The interaction of a moving conductive fluid and rotating magnetic field governed by Faraday's law of induction serves as a mechanism of electrical current generation. The study investigates the system performance and, in particular, variation of power with respect to system parameters like fluid inlet velocity and stator current.","1590":"Soybean, one of the most valuable oilseed crops, is under constant pressure from pathogens. bZIP transcription factors (TFs) composing one of the largest TF families in plants have diverse functions. Biochemical and physiological analyses were performed to characterize the regulatory roles of soybean bZIP TF GmbZIP15 in response to pathogens. We found that transgenic soybean plants overexpressing GmbZIP15 has increased resistance against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Phytophthora sojae. Besides, GmbZIP15 regulates pathogen response by modulating the antioxidant defense system and phytohormone signaling. In addition, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to identify the downstream genes of GmbZIP15 in response to S. sclerotiorum and found that GmbZIP15 can activate or repress the expression of defense-related genes through direct promoter binding. Taken together, these results indicate that GmbZIP15 plays a positive role in pathogen resistance in soybean, and this activity may be dependent on phytohormone signaling.","1591":"Enzymes are promising catalysts with high selectivity and activity under mild reaction conditions. However, their practical application has largely been hindered by their high cost and poor stability. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as host materials show potential in protecting proteins against denaturing conditions, but a systematic study investigating the stabilizing mechanism is still lacking. In this study, we stabilized enzyme cytochrome c (cyt c) by encapsulating it in a hierarchical mesoporous zirconium-based MOF, NU-1000 against denaturing organic solvents. Cyt c@NU-1000 showed a significantly enhanced activity compared to the native enzyme, and the composite retained this enhanced activity after treatment with five denaturing organic solvents. Moreover, the composite was recyclable without activity loss for at least three cycles. Our cyt c@NU-1000 model system demonstrates that enzyme@MOF composites prepared via post-synthetic encapsulation offer a promising route to overcome the challenges of enzyme stability and recyclability that impede the widespread adoption of biocatalysis.","1592":"","1593":null,"1594":"Periodic delamination patterns in multilayer structures have exhibited extensive applications in microelectronics and optics devices. However, delamination behaviors of a closed thin shell on spherical substrates are still elusive. Herein, a unique instability mechanism of buckle delamination in a closed thin film weakly bonded to spherical substrates is studied by experiments, simulations, and theoretical analyses. The system of an Al film depositing on polystyrene spheres subjected to thermal mismatch strain is used for demonstration. Unlike traditional phenomena of wrinkling and wrinkle-induced delamination under increasing misfit strain, the weak adhesion between the core and shell results in a periodic pattern of delaminated hexagonal dimples that emerges directly from the smooth sphere configuration, before which no wrinkling occurs. Both substrate curvature and interfacial adhesion are revealed to control the dimple size and delamination width. These findings open a new venue for manifesting new controllable features for surface microfabrication.","1595":null,"1596":null,"1597":"Retinal stem cells (RSCs) are rare pigmented cells found in the pigmented ciliary layer of the mammalian retina. Studies show that RSCs can replicate to maintain the stem cell pool and produce retinal progenitors that differentiate into all retinal cell types. We classified RSCs based on their level and distribution of pigment into heavily pigmented (HP), lightly pigmented (LP), and centrally pigmented (CP) spheres. We report that CP spheres are capable of generating large cobblestone lawns of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. The other clonal sphere types (HP and LP) primarily produce cells with neural morphology and fewer RPE cells. The RSCs are homogeneous, but their downstream progenitors are different. We found that CP spheres contain highly proliferative populations of early RPE progenitors that respond to proliferative signals from the surrounding non-pigmented cells. HP and LP spheres contain late RPE progenitors which are not affected by proliferative signals.","1598":"The central engines of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are powered by accreting supermassive black holes, and while AGNs are known to play an important role in galaxy evolution, the key physical processes occur on scales that are too small to be resolved spatially (aside from a few exceptional cases). Reverberation mapping is a powerful technique that overcomes this limitation by using echoes of light to determine the geometry and kinematics of the central regions. Variable ionizing radiation from close to the black hole drives correlated variability in surrounding gas\/dust but with a time delay due to the light travel time between the regions, allowing reverberation mapping to effectively replace spatial resolution with time resolution. Reverberation mapping is used to measure black hole masses and to probe the innermost X-ray emitting region, the UV\/optical accretion disk, the broad emission line region, and the dusty torus. In this article, we provide an overview of the technique and its varied applications.","1599":null,"1600":"Pulmonary mesenchymal cells are critical players in both the mouse and human during lung development and disease states. They are increasingly recognized as highly heterogeneous, but there is no consensus on subpopulations or discriminative markers for each subtype.

We consistently identified and delineated the transcriptome of lipofibroblasts, myofibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, mesothelial cells, and a novel population characterized by Ebf1 expression. Subtype selective transcription factors and putative divergence of the clusters during development were described. Comparative analysis revealed orthologous subpopulations with conserved transcriptomic signatures in murine and human lung mesenchymal cells. All mesenchymal subpopulations contributed to matrix gene expression in fibrosis. This analysis would enhance our understanding of mesenchymal cell heterogeneity in lung development, homeostasis and fibrotic disease conditions.","1601":"Harnessing cost-efficient printable semiconductor materials as near-infrared (NIR) emitters in light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is extremely attractive for sensing and diagnostics, telecommunications, and biomedical sciences. However, the most efficient NIR LEDs suitable for printable electronics rely on emissive materials containing precious transition metal ions (such as platinum), which have triggered concerns about their poor biocompatibility and sustainability. Here, we review and highlight the latest progress in NIR LEDs based on non-toxic and low-cost functional materials suitable for solution-processing deposition. Different approaches to achieve NIR emission from organic and hybrid materials are discussed, with particular focus on fluorescent and exciplex-forming host-guest systems, thermally activated delayed fluorescent molecules, aggregation-induced emission fluorophores, as well as lead-free perovskites. Alternative strategies leveraging photonic microcavity effects and surface plasmon resonances to enhance the emission of such materials in the NIR are also presented. Finally, an outlook for critical challenges and opportunities of non-toxic NIR LEDs is provided.","1602":null,"1603":null,"1604":"[This retracts the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101845.].","1605":"N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) is emerging as a vital factor regulating neural differentiation. Here, we report that deficiency of Arhgef2, a novel cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder we identified recently, impairs neurogenesis, neurite outgrowth, and synaptic formation by regulating m6A methylation. Arhgef2 knockout decreases expression of Mettl14 and total m6A level significantly in the cerebral cortex. m6A sequencing reveals that loss of Arhgef2 reduces m6A methylation of 1,622 mRNAs, including Npdc1 and Cend1, which are both strongly associated with cell cycle exit and terminal neural differentiation. Arhgef2 deficiency decreases m6A methylations of the Npdc1 and Cend1 mRNAs via down-regulation of Mettl14, and thereby inhibits the translation of Npdc1 and nuclear export of Cend1 mRNAs. Overexpression of Mettl14, Npdc1, and Cend1 rescue the abnormal phenotypes in Arhgef2 knockout mice, respectively. Our study provides a critical insight into a mechanism by which defective Arhgef2 mediates m6A-tagged target mRNAs to impair neural differentiation.","1606":"Synovial macrophages that are activated by cartilage fragments initiate synovitis, a condition that promotes hypertrophic changes in chondrocytes leading to cartilage degeneration in OA. In this study, we analyzed the molecular response of chondrocytes under condition of this type of stimulation to identify a molecular therapeutic target. Stimulated macrophages promoted hypertrophic changes in chondrocytes resulting in production of matrix-degrading enzymes of cartilage. Among the top-upregulated genes, FliI was found to be released from activated chondrocytes and exerted autocrine\/paracrine effects on chondrocytes leading to an increase in expression of catabolic and hypertrophic factors. Silencing FliI in stimulated cells significantly reduced expression of catabolic and hypertrophic factors in cocultured chondrocytes. Our further results demonstrated that the FliI-TLR4-ERK1\/2 axis is involved in the hypertrophic signaling of chondrocytes and catabolism of cartilage. Our findings provide a new insight into the pathogenesis of OA and identify a potentially new molecular target for diagnostics and therapeutics.","1607":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101974.].","1608":"Recent data suggest that therapy-resistant quiescent cancer stem cells (qCSCs) are the source of relapse in colon cancer. Here, using colon cancer patient-derived organoids and xenografts, we identify rare long-term label-retaining qCSCs that can re-enter the cell cycle to generate new tumors. RNA sequencing analyses demonstrated that these cells display the molecular hallmarks of quiescent tissue stem cells, including expression of p53 signaling genes, and are enriched for transcripts common to damage-induced quiescent revival stem cells of the regenerating intestine. In addition, we identify negative regulators of cell cycle, downstream of p53, that we show are indicators of poor prognosis and may be targeted for qCSC abolition in both p53 wild-type and mutant tumors. These data support the temporal inhibition of downstream targets of p53 signaling, in combination with standard-of-care treatments, for the elimination of qCSCs and prevention of relapse in colon cancer.","1609":"It is well established that the formation of episodic memories requires multiple hippocampal mechanisms operating on different time scales. Early mechanisms of memory formation (synaptic consolidation) have been extensively characterized. However, delayed mechanisms, which maintain hippocampal activity as memories stabilize in cortical circuits, are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that contrary to the transient expression of early- and delayed-response genes, the expression of cytoskeleton- and extracellular matrix-associated genes remains dynamic even at remote time points. The most profound expression changes clustered around primary cilium-associated and collagen genes. These genes most likely contribute to memory by stabilizing perineuronal nets in the dorsohippocampal CA1 subfield, as revealed by targeted disruptions of the primary cilium or perineuronal nets. The findings show that nonsynaptic, primary cilium-mediated mechanisms are required for the persistence of context memory.","1610":null,"1611":"The design of artificial solid electrolyte interphases (ASEIs) that overcome the traditional instability of Li metal anodes can accelerate the deployment of high-energy Li metal batteries (LMBs).

This review analyzes the structure-performance relationship of several organic, inorganic, and hybrid materials used as ASEIs in academic and industrial research. The electrochemical performance of ASEI-coated electrodes in symmetric and full cells was compared to identify the ASEI and cell designs that enabled to approach practical targets for high-energy LMBs. The comparative performance and the examined relation between ASEI thickness and cell-level specific energy emphasize the necessity of employing testing conditions aligned with practical battery systems.","1612":null,"1613":null,"1614":null,"1615":null,"1616":null,"1617":null,"1618":"Flexible viscoelastic sensors have gained significant attention in wearable devices owing to their exceptional strain-dependent electrical resistance. Most of the strain sensors are elastic composites, thus the internal stress is often preserved during the deformation when they are attached to the uneven target. Therefore, there is a pressing need for viscoelastic composites with highly self-adapted electromechanical properties sensitive to multiexternal circumstances. This work reports a liquid-metal-filled magnetorheological plastomer (LMMRP) that shows a high response behavior to the external stimulus such as magnetic field, temperature, and force. The shape-deformable LMMRP can transform from an insulator to a conductor under applying a magnetic field, thus the further viscoelastic sensor possesses a magnetic field \"on-off\" switch effect. The microstructure-dependent magnetic\/thermal\/mechanical-electrical coupling characteristics are investigated, and several proof-of-concept sensor applications, such as magnetic control, environment recognition, and motion monitoring, are demonstrated. These LMMRP composites show a broad potential in flexible sensors and soft electronics.","1619":null,"1620":null,"1621":null,"1622":null,"1623":"Ivacaftor (VX-770) was the first cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulatory drug approved for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis. Electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) studies of detergent-solubilized CFTR indicated that VX-770 bound to a site at the interface between solvent and a hinge region in the CFTR protein conferred by transmembrane (tm) helices: tm4, tm5, and tm8. We re-evaluated VX-770 binding to CFTR in biological membranes using photoactivatable VX-770 probes. One such probe covalently labeled CFTR at two sites as determined following trypsin digestion and analysis by tandem-mass spectrometry. One labeled peptide resides in the cytosolic loop 4 of CFTR and the other is located in tm8, proximal to the site identified by cryo-EM. Complementary data from functional and molecular dynamic simulation studies support a model, where VX-770 mediates potentiation via multiple sites in the CFTR protein.","1624":"Large-scale mapping of antigens and epitopes is pivotal for developing immunotherapies but challenging, especially for eukaryotic pathogens, owing to their large genomes. Here, we developed an integrated platform for genome phage display (gPhage) to show that unbiased libraries of the eukaryotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi enable the identification of thousands of antigens recognized by serum samples from patients with Chagas disease. Because most of these antigens are hypothetical proteins, gPhage provides evidence of their expression during infection. We built and validated a comprehensive map of Chagas disease antibody response to show how linear and putative conformation epitopes, many rich in repetitive elements, allow the parasite to evade a buildup of neutralizing antibodies directed against protein domains that mediate infection pathogenesis. Thus, the gPhage platform is a reproducible and effective tool for rapid simultaneous identification of epitopes and antigens, not only in Chagas disease but perhaps also in globally emerging\/reemerging acute pathogens.","1625":"The high variability and intermittency of wind and solar farms raise questions of how to operate electrolyzers reliably, economically, and sustainably using predominantly or exclusively variable renewables. To address these questions, we develop a comprehensive cost framework that extends to include factors such as performance degradation, efficiency, financing rates, and indirect costs to assess the economics of 10 MW scale alkaline and proton-exchange membrane electrolyzers to generate hydrogen. Our scenario analysis explores a range of operational configurations, considering (i) current and projected wholesale electricity market data from the Australian National Electricity Market, (ii) existing solar\/wind farm generation curves, and (iii) electrolyzer capital costs\/performance to determine costs of H2 production in the near (2020-2040) and long term (2030-2050). Furthermore, we analyze dedicated off-grid integrated electrolyzer plants as an alternate operating scenario, suggesting oversizing renewable nameplate capacity with respect to the electrolyzer to enhance operational capacity factors and achieving more economical electrolyzer operation.","1626":null,"1627":"DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) is essential for ensuring genome stability. Abnormal spindle-like microcephaly-associated (ASPM) gene encodes a spindle protein that is commonly implicated in primary microcephaly. We found that ASPM is recruited to sites of DNA damage in a PARP2-dependent manner. ASPM interacts with BRCA1 and its E3 ligase HERC2, preventing HERC2 from accessing to BRCA1 and ensuring BRCA1 stability. Inhibition of ASPM expression promotes HERC2-mediated BRCA1 degradation, compromises HR repair efficiency and chromosome stability, and sensitizes cancer cells to ionizing radiation. Moreover, we observed a synergistic effect between ASPM and PARP inhibition in killing cancer cells. This research has uncovered a novel function for ASPM in facilitating HR-mediated repair of DSBs by ensuring BRCA1 stability. ASPM might constitute a promising target for synthetic lethality-based cancer therapy.","1628":null,"1629":null,"1630":null,"1631":null,"1632":"Growing evidence suggests that renal purinergic signaling undergoes significant remodeling during pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes.

A dramatic increase in the ATP-mediated intracellular calcium flux in podocytes was observed in both models. Pharmacological inhibition established that P2X4 and P2X7 are the major receptors contributing to the augmented ATP-mediated intracellular calcium signaling in diabetic podocytes. The transition in purinergic receptor composition from metabotropic to ionotropic may disrupt intracellular calcium homeostasis in podocytes resulting in their dysfunction and potentially further aggravating DKD progression.","1633":"An interdisciplinary approach to sensory information combination shows a correspondence between perceptual and neural measures of nonlinear multisensory integration. In psychophysics, sensory information combinations are often characterized by the Minkowski formula, but the neural substrates of many psychophysical multisensory interactions are unknown. We show that audiovisual interactions - for both psychophysical detection threshold data and cortical bimodal neurons - obey similar vector-like Minkowski models, suggesting that cortical bimodal neurons could underlie multisensory perceptual sensitivity. An alternative Bayesian model is not a good predictor of cortical bimodal response. In contrast to cortex, audiovisual data from superior colliculus resembles the 'City-Block' combination rule used in perceptual similarity metrics. Previous work found a simple power law amplification rule is followed for perceptual appearance measures and by cortical subthreshold multisensory neurons. The two most studied neural cell classes in cortical multisensory interactions may provide neural substrates for two important perceptual modes: appearance-based and performance-based perception.","1634":null,"1635":"With the development of modern industries, the sustainability of critical resources has attracted worldwide attention considering the entire supply chain. With a large industrial sector size in China, a safe supply of metal resources is crucial to ensure the effective operation of the whole industry. Although specific criticality analyses have been applied to identify critical resources in some regions, including Europe and the USA, they are not ready to be directly applied in the case of China because the structure of China's industry is remarkably different from other areas. In this research, a three-dimensional methodology considering supply safety, domestic economy, and environmental risk is demonstrated, where Chinese industrial conditions are specifically considered. In total, 64 materials were introduced to perform the criticality assessment, and 18 metals were classified with a high criticality degree in the three-dimensional criticality space.

Pinhead (Pnhd), a cystine-knot-containing secreted protein, is expressed in the ventrolateral mesoderm during Xenopus gastrulation; however, its molecular targets and signaling mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Our mass spectrometry-based screen of the gastrula secretome identified Admp as Pnhd-associated protein. We show that Pnhd binds Admp and inhibits its ventralizing activity by reducing Smad1 phosphorylation and its transcriptional targets. Importantly, Pnhd depletion further increased phospho-Smad1 levels in the presence of Admp. Furthermore, Pnhd synergized with Chordin and a truncated BMP4 receptor in the induction of notochord markers in ectoderm cells, and Pnhd-depleted embryos displayed notochord defects. Our findings suggest that Pnhd binds and inactivates Admp to promote notochord development. We propose that the interaction between Admp and Pnhd refines Smad1 activity gradients during vertebrate gastrulation.","1639":"During inflammatory diseases, cancer, and infection, the cGAS\/STING pathway is known to recognize foreign or self-DNA in the cytosol and activate an innate immune response. Here, we report that negative-strand RNA paramyxoviruses, Nipah virus (NiV), and measles virus (MeV), can also trigger the cGAS\/STING axis. Although mice deficient for MyD88, TRIF, and MAVS still moderately control NiV infection when compared with wild-type mice, additional STING deficiency resulted in 100% lethality, suggesting synergistic roles of these pathways in host protection. Moreover, deletion of cGAS or STING resulted in decreased type I interferon production with enhanced paramyxoviral infection in both human and murine cells. Finally, the phosphorylation and ubiquitination of STING, observed during viral infections, confirmed the activation of cGAS\/STING pathway by NiV and MeV. Our data suggest that cGAS\/STING activation is critical in controlling paramyxovirus infection and possibly represents attractive targets to develop countermeasures against severe disease induced by these pathogens.","1640":null,"1641":"Propionate and propionyl-CoA accumulation have been associated with the development of mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we show that propionate induces intestinal damage in zebrafish when fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The intestinal damage was associated with oxidative stress owing to compromised superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) activity. Global lysine propionylation analysis of the intestinal samples showed that Sod2 was propionylated at lysine 132 (K132), and further biochemical assays demonstrated that K132 propionylation suppressed Sod2 activity. In addition, sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) played an important role in regulating Sod2 activity via modulating de-propionylation. Finally, we revealed that intestinal oxidative stress resulting from Sod2 propionylation contributed to compositional change of gut microbiota. Collectively, our results in this study show that there is a link between Sod2 propionylation and oxidative stress in zebrafish intestines and highlight the potential mechanism of intestinal problems associated with high propionate levels.","1642":"The chemical industry needs to significantly decrease carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in order to meet the 2050 carbon neutrality goal. Utilization of CO2 as a chemical feedstock for bulk products is a promising way to mitigate industrial emissions; however, CO2-based manufacturing is currently not competitive with the established petrochemical methods and its deployment requires creation of a new value chain. Here, we show that an alternative approach, using CO2 conversion as an add-on to existing manufactures, can disrupt the global carbon cycle while minimally perturbing the operation of chemical plants. Proposed closed-loop on-site CO2 recycling processes are economically viable in the current market and have the potential for rapid introduction in the industries. Retrofit-based CO2 recycling can reduce annually between 4 and 10 Gt CO2 by 2050 and contribute to achieving up to 50% of the industrial carbon neutrality goal.","1643":"Carbon neutrality by 2060 is the recent expression of China's international commitment to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions.

Herein, a possible route to the carbon neutral target based on energy-chemical nexus for electricity generation as well as methanol and ammonia production is proposed in this study. The most cost-effective solution for meeting the commitment is identified by considering regional variations in renewable and non-renewable resources and adopting an optimized regional cooperation.

We utilized high-resolution imaging to show that the zebrafish gut contains bona fide muscularis and mucosal macrophages, as well as surprisingly large subsets intimately associated with enteric neural processes. Interestingly, most muscularis macrophages span multiple gut layers in stark contrast to their mammalian counterparts typically restricted to a single layer. Using macrophage-deficient irf8 zebrafish, we found a depletion of muscularis but not mucosal macrophages, and that they may be dispensable for gross intestinal transit in adults but not during development. These characterizations provide first insights into intestinal macrophages and their association with the enteric nervous system from development to adulthood in teleosts.","1649":"Superconducting materials hold great potential to bring radical changes for electric power and high-field magnet technology, enabling high-efficiency electric power generation, high-capacity loss-less electric power transmission, small lightweight electrical equipment, high-speed maglev transportation, ultra-strong magnetic field generation for high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems, future advanced high energy particle accelerators, nuclear fusion reactors, and so on.

However, en masse mitigation has come with substantial socioeconomic costs. In this paper, we demonstrate how individualized policies based on disease status can reduce transmission risk while minimizing impacts on economic outcomes. We design feedback control policies informed by optimal control solutions to modulate interaction rates of individuals based on the epidemic state. We identify personalized interaction rates such that recovered\/immune individuals elevate their interactions and susceptible individuals remain at home before returning to pre-lockdown levels. As we show, feedback control policies can yield similar population-wide infection rates to total shutdown but with significantly lower economic costs and with greater robustness to uncertainty compared to optimal control policies. Our analysis shows that test-driven improvements in isolation efficiency of infectious individuals can inform disease-dependent interaction policies that mitigate transmission while enhancing the return of individuals to pre-pandemic economic activity.","1652":"High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are a group of different subpopulations of sialylated particles that have an essential role in the reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway. Importantly, changes in the protein and lipid composition of HDLs may lead to the formation of particles with reduced atheroprotective properties. Here, we show that Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin (PLY) and neuraminidase A (NanA) impair HDL function by causing chemical and structural modifications of HDLs. The proteomic, lipidomic, cellular, and biochemical analysis revealed that PLY and NanA induce significant changes in sialic acid, protein, and lipid compositions of HDL. The modified HDL particles have reduced cholesterol acceptor potential from activated macrophages, elevated levels of malondialdehyde adducts, and show significantly increased complement activating capacity. These results suggest that accumulation of these modified HDL particles in the arterial intima may present a trigger for complement activation, inflammatory response, and thereby promote atherogenic disease progression.","1653":"More than 100 million people have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We validated this model using a previously described synthetic DNA vaccine plasmid, INO-4800 (pS). Intranasal instillation of AAV6.2FF-hACE2 resulted in robust hACE2 expression in the respiratory tract. pS induced robust cellular and humoral responses. Vaccinated animals were challenged with 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19\/Canada\/ON-VIDO-01\/2020) and euthanized four days post-challenge to assess viral load. One immunization resulted in 50% protection and two immunizations were completely protective.

Mucosa-attached microbial communities were significantly associated with segmental inflammation status. Interaction-related transcription factors (TFs) are the panel nodes for cross-talk between the gene patterns and microbiome for terminal ileal CD. The transcriptome and microbiome in terminal ileal CD can be differently related to the local inflammatory status, and specific differentially expressed genes may be targeted for mucosal healing. TFs connect gene patterns with the microbiome by reflecting environmental stimuli and signals from microbiota.","1656":null,"1657":null,"1658":"The stability of protein structures and biological functions at normal temperature is closely linked with the universal aqueous environment of organisms.

Triggered by this, here we describe a general method to stabilize mesophilic proteins in hyperthermia water. The mesophilic proteins, protected by amphiphilic polymers with multiple binding sites, maintain their secondary and tertiary structures after incubation even in boiling water. This approach, outside the conventional environment for bioactivities of mesophilic proteins, provides a general strategy to dramatically increase the Tm (melting temperature) of mesophilic proteins without any changes to amino sequences of the native proteins.

Based on the circuit, TENG's output can be transformed into a stable voltage with tunable amplitude, while an enhanced short-circuit current of 94 mA with an energy loss lower than 5% is achieved. For demonstrations, three different types of TENGs, respectively, targeting at ocean energy, wind energy, and walking energy have been prepared to reveal the capability of the circuit.

We investigated assemblies of RCs on an electrode that range from monolayer to multilayers by measuring the photocurrent produced when illuminated by an intensity-modulated excitation light source. In addition, atomic force microscopy and modeling of the photocurrent with the Marcus-Hush-Chidsey theory detailed the reorganization energy for the electron transfer process, which also revealed changes in the RC local environment due to the adsorbed conformations.

We first discovered that human RPA efficiently prevents G4 formation by preempting ssDNA before its folding. RPA also differentially interacts with the folded G4s. However, helicases such as human BLM and yeast Pif1 have different G4 preferences from RPA mainly based on loop lengths. More importantly, both RPA and these helicases are required for the stable G4 unfolding, as RPA promotes helicase-mediated repetitive unfolding into durative linear state. Furthermore, BLM can traverse G4 obstacles temporarily disrupted by RPA and continue to unwind downstream duplex. We finally proposed the mechanisms underlying above functions of RPA in preventing, resolving, and assisting helicases to eliminate G4s.","1665":null,"1666":null,"1667":"The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by spasticity and weakness in the lower body.

The mechanistic investigations revealed that SAA1\/TLR2 axis stimulates the Rac GTPases through PI3K-dependent pathways and induces phosphorylation of MLC (pSer19). Genetic deletion of TLR2 and pharmacological inhibition of PI3K diminished the phosphorylation of MLCpSer19 and migration of HSCs. In brief, SAA1 serves as a hepatic endogenous chemokine for the TLR2 receptor on HSCs, thereby initiating PI3K-dependent signaling and its effector, Rac GTPases, which consequently regulates actin filament remodeling and cell directional migration.

The steady state and time-resolved spectroscopies reveal that the reaction intermediate (pairs of AQH-SDS radicals) can undergo two distinct pathways depending on whether it is spin singlet or triplet, and the field is beneficial to the conversion between spin configurations of RPs. The applied field not only affects the reaction rate constant but also changes the final products.

The allometric exponents for icosahedral dsDNA bacteriophages and NCDLVs were found to be 1 and 2, respectively, indicating that with increasing capsid size DNA packaging density remains the same in bacteriophages but decreases for NCLDVs. We argue that the exponents are largely shaped by their entry mechanism and capsid mechanical stability. We further show that these allometric size parameters are also intricately linked to the relative energy costs of translation and replication in viruses and can have further implications on viral life history.","1679":"Top-down, context-dependent modulation of visual processing has been a topic of wide interest, including in mouse primary visual cortex (V1).

We identified more than 24 brain areas that provide inputs to V1 and quantified the relative strength of their projections. We also assessed the organization of the projections, based on either the organization of cell bodies in the source area (topography) or the distribution of projections across V1 (bias). Projections from most higher visual and some nonvisual areas to V1 showed both topography and bias. Such organization of feedback projections to V1 suggests that parts of the visual field are differentially modulated by context, which can be ethologically relevant for a navigating animal.","1680":null,"1681":"Unlike the conceptual models, the natural hydrate spatial distribution in sediments is multitype and presents different coalescence degrees.

Correspondingly, the localized deformation develops more slowly, and the shear band is steeper and thinner. The cementation failure in the specimen with a more dispersed hydrate distribution develops more slowly. However, the changing rate of the pore space characteristic does not seem to be affected by the hydrate spatial distribution. Moreover, the specimen with a more dispersed hydrate distribution has a larger hydrate-sand interfacial area, and further axial loading would increase it rapidly firstly, and then the increasing rate would be slowed down since the cementation structure failure.","1682":"Tumor suppressor PTEN, the second most highly mutated protein in cancer, dephosphorylates signaling lipid PIP3 produced by PI3Ks.

We observed its interaction with membranes composed of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, anionic phosphatidylserine, and phosphoinositides, including signaling lipids PIP2 and PIP3. We tracked its moving away from the zwitterionic and getting absorbed onto anionic membrane that harbors PIP3. We followed it localizing on microdomains enriched in signaling lipids, as PI3K does, and observed PIP3 allosterically unfolding the N-terminal PIP2 binding domain, positioning it favorably for the polybasic motif interaction with PIP2.

However, current reported controllable IR-reflection systems suffer from utilizing rigid materials, complicated devices, or high working temperature\/voltage, which are not suitable for their widespread applications toward soft systems. Herein, inspired by cephalopods, we demonstrate a facile and scalable method for adaptive IR reflection based on a Janus rubber film, which is composed of aluminum-coated microsheets (AMSs)\/rubber composite top and a rubber only bottom. Expansion of the Janus rubber film causes random arrangement of AMSs to stay planar, resulting in the change from IR scattering to concentrated IR reflection. By fixing the Janus rubber films upon the arranged tubes, as-prepared arrays could display complex and changeable patterns by selectively pumping tubes. Being facile and of general validity, our strategies broaden the scope of future controllable IR reflecting applications for environmental IR camouflages and displays.","1686":null,"1687":null,"1688":"Sea turtles are an important umbrella species in marine ecosystems. The populations of all five species of sea turtles in China have dropped sharply due to massive illegal trade and habitat loss. The fast-growing demand for sea turtle displays from Chinese aquariums and private individuals has led to a large-scale illegal trade domestically and internationally. Captive sea turtles are also frequently kept in harsh environments with severe injuries and high mortality rates. Sea turtles have only recently been upgraded from level II to level I on the \"List of Wildlife under Special State Protection\", this protection level has therefore not matched the real status of sea turtles over the past three decades. The additional collusion between the government and business corporations encourages illegal trade. We argue that the commercial use of sea turtles must be completely prohibited to guarantee their future survival in Chinese waters.","1689":null,"1690":"Many animals that lose neural tissue to injury or disease can maintain behavioral repertoires by regenerating new neurons or reorganizing existing neural circuits. However, most neuroscience small model organisms lack this high degree of neural plasticity. We show that Hydra vulgaris can maintain stable sensory-motor behaviors despite 2-fold changes in neuron count, due to naturally occurring size variation or surgical resection. Specifically, we find that both behavioral and neural responses to rapid temperature changes are maintained following these perturbations. We further describe possible mechanisms for the observed neural activity and argue that Hydra's radial symmetry may allow it to maintain stable behaviors when changes in the numbers of neurons do not selectively eliminate any specific neuronal cell type. These results suggest that Hydra provides a powerful model for studying how animals maintain stable sensory-motor responses within dynamic neural circuits and may lead to the development of general principles for injury-tolerant neural architectures.","1691":"","1692":null,"1693":"We report relations between nitrogen-binding-energy descriptors obtained from experimental thermochemical data and limiting potentials from density functional theory data.

Using experimental exchange current densities of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and Pourbaix diagrams we have identified conditions at which Mn, Ga, and In remain stable in water and selectively catalyze NRR over HER. We found that Fe, Au, Cu, Bi, and Pd, on contrary to what was reported earlier, need smaller applied potentials to start the onset of HER than NRR in water. We make a critical discussion about them and other candidates and we believe our results can be used to identify false positive measurements in the research field.","1694":null,"1695":null,"1696":"Predicting the microRNA-disease associations by using computational methods is conductive to the efficiency of costly and laborious traditional bio-experiments.

Specifically, the integrated features are extracted by using deep stacked auto-encoder on the diverse orders of matrixes containing structure and attribute information and are then trained by using random forest classifier. Under 5-fold cross-validation experiments, DANE-MDA yielded average accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC at 85.59%, 84.23%, and 0.9264 in term of HMDD v3.0 dataset, and 83.21%, 80.39%, and 0.9113 in term of HMDD v2.0 dataset, respectively.

An engineering approach to this problem is the creation of novel synthetic living forms, greatly extending available model systems beyond evolved plant and animal lineages. Here, we review recent advances in the emerging field of synthetic morphogenesis, the bioengineering of novel multicellular living bodies. Emphasizing emergent self-organization, tissue-level guided self-assembly, and active functionality, this work is the essential next generation of synthetic biology.

Mesoamerican societies were multicultural in nature and also experienced significant admixture during Spanish colonization of the region. Despite these facts, Native Mexican Y chromosome diversity has been greatly understudied. To further elucidate their genetic history, we conducted a high-resolution Y chromosome analysis with Chichimecas, Nahuas, Otomies, Popolocas, Tepehuas, and Totonacas using 19 Y-short tandem repeat and 21 single nucleotide polymorphism loci. We detected enormous paternal genetic diversity in these groups, with haplogroups Q-MEH2, Q-M3, Q-Z768, Q-L663, Q-Z780, and Q-PV3 being identified. These data affirmed the southward colonization of the Americas via Beringia and connected Native Mexicans with indigenous populations from South-Central Siberia and Canada.

To identify such regulators, we conducted gain-of-function cDNA library screening to discover genes that foster prostate cancer cell colonization of mouse lungs as an experimental model. Our efforts identified the metabolic enzyme aldolase A (ALDOA) as a driver of cancer cell motility, anchorage-independent growth, and metastatic colonization, and as a prognosticator of adverse patient outcome across many malignancies, including prostate, breast, pancreatic, and liver cancers. Metabolomics coupled with biochemical and functional analyses revealed that ALDOA triggered the activation of adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which we demonstrate played essential promalignant activities in ALDOA-expressing cells. Collectively, these findings unveiled vivo approaches to identify metastatic colonization regulators and uncovered previously undescribed roles for ALDOA-AMPK pathway in tumor progression.","1706":null,"1707":"Electrochemistry is an established discipline with modern frontiers spanning energy conversion and storage, neuroscience, and organic synthesis.

In this perspective, we highlight the core concepts of electrochemistry and discuss ways in which it has been historically taught. We identify challenges faced when teaching inherently interdisciplinary electrochemical concepts and discuss how technology provides new tools for teaching, such as inexpensive electronics and open-source software, to help address these challenges. Finally, we outline example programs and discuss how new tools and approaches can be brought together to prepare scientists and engineers for careers in electrochemical technology where they can accelerate the research, development, and deployment of the clean energy technology essential to combat climate change in the coming decades.","1708":"Recent engineering technologies have transformed traditional perspectives of cancer to include the important role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in recapitulating the malignant behaviors of cancer cells.

Here, we review emerging technologies in cancer ECM biology and recent advances in engineered systems for evaluating cancer therapeutics and provide new perspectives on how engineering tools present an opportunity for advancing the modeling and treatment of cancer.

Materials can be modified by LAA in multiple aspects, such as morphology modulation, heterojunction fabrication, or defects engineering, which are desired features for energy-related catalytic reactions. We begin this perspective with a brief introduction of this technology, including the mechanism, the experimental setup, and the characteristic of laser-ablated materials. The recent works utilizing LAA are then summarized to prove the promising prospects of LAA in the energy field. Finally, several opportunities about the future usage of LAA are proposed and discussed.","1710":"Late-stage functionalization (LSF) has over the past years emerged as a powerful approach in the drug discovery process. At its best, it allows for rapid access to new analogues from a single drug-like molecule, bypassing the need for de novo synthesis. To be successful, methods able to tolerate the diverse functional groups present in drug-like molecules that perform under mild conditions are required. C-H methylation is of particular interest due to the magic methyl effect in medicinal chemistry. Herein we report an iridium-catalyzed carboxylate-directed ortho C-H methylation and d 3-methylation of benzoic acids. The method uses commercially available reagents and precatalyst and requires no inert atmosphere or exclusion of moisture. Substrates bearing electron-rich and electron-poor groups were successfully methylated, including compounds with competing directing\/coordinating groups. The method was also applied to the LSF of several marketed drugs, forming analogues with increased metabolic stability compared with the parent drug.","1711":"Promoting solar fuels as a viable alternative to hydrocarbons calls for technologies that couple efficiency, durability, and low cost. In this work we elucidate how hybrid organic-inorganic systems employing hybrid photocathodes (HPC) and perovskite solar cells (PSC) could eventually match these needs, enabling sustainable and clean hydrogen production. First, we demonstrate a system comprising an HPC, a PSC, and a Ru-based oxygen evolution catalyst reaching a solar-to-hydrogen (STH) efficiency above 2%. Moving from this experimental result, we elaborate a perspective for this technology by adapting the existing models to the specific case of an HPC-PSC tandem. We found two very promising scenarios: one with a 10% STH efficiency, achievable using the currently available semiconducting polymers and the widely used methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) PSC, and the other one with a 20% STH efficiency, requiring dedicated development for water-splitting applications of recently reported high-performing organic semiconductors and narrow band-gap perovskites.","1712":"","1713":"Super liquid repellent coatings are among the most promising candidates for self-cleaning surfaces for indoor and outdoor applications. However, the characteristic nano- and micro-scale protrusions can easily be damaged. Improving the durability of these coatings belongs to the most important challenges to increase the coating's application potential. Here, we show that commercial polyester fabrics coated with silicone nanofilaments maintain their self-cleaning properties throughout repeated freezing-unfreezing cycles, ironing, and mechanical stress. The coating improves the heat resistance of the fabric. The surface keeps its water repellency until the fabric is almost destroyed by scratching with sandpaper or a metal sponge. The excellent performance results from the synergetic effects of i) the interwoven structure of the fabric and ii) the intrinsic hydrophobic and flexible nature of the fabric and of the nanofilaments coating. The combination of these factors generates a product which overcomes the most claimed drawbacks of super liquid repellent coatings.","1714":null,"1715":"Cancer cells acquire genotypic and phenotypic changes over the course of the disease.

In this perspective, we explore the role of cell plasticity in tumor evolution through specific examples. We discuss epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming in \"disease progression\" of solid tumors, through the lens of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and \"treatment resistance\", in the context endocrine therapy in hormone-driven cancers. These examples offer a paradigm of the features and challenges of cell plastic evolution, and we investigate how recent technological advances can address these challenges.

Yet, utilizing bismuth as anodic electrocatalyst is hindered by the formation of a spreading Bi(OH)3 inhibitor layer during the anodic process. Herein, we report that bismuth nanoparticles, produced using laser ablation, can avoid such drawbacks. The production of Bi(V) species assists polyol electrooxidation. For glucose, instead of the commonly reported gluconic acid as the product, the Bi(V) species enables highly selective oxidation and C-C bond cleavage to produce arabinonic acid, erythronic acid, and eventually glyceric acid. We not only generate high-valent Bi(V) species for catalytic applications, especially for bioelectrocatalysis where the less toxic bismuth is highly appreciated, but also present Bi nanoparticle as a highly selective electrocatalyst that can break C-C bond. We believe that Bi electrocatalyst can find broader applications in electrochemical biomass conversion and electrosynthesis.","1717":"While several genes and clinical traits have been associated with higher risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), how host genetic variants may interact with these parameters and contribute to severe disease is still unclear. Herein, we performed phenome-wide association study, tissue and immune-cell-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL)\/splicing quantitative trait locus, and colocalization analyses for genetic risk loci suggestively associated with severe COVID-19 with respiratory failure. Thirteen phenotypes\/traits were associated with the severe COVID-19-associated loci at the genome-wide significance threshold, including monocyte counts, fat metabolism traits, and fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. In addition, we identified tissue and immune subtype-specific eQTL associations affecting 48 genes, including several ones that may directly impact host immune responses, colocalized with the severe COVID-19 genome-wide association study associations, and showed altered expression in single-cell transcriptomes.

Cytoplasmic accumulation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination and truncation of TDP-43 are the main hallmarks of TDP-43 proteinopathies. Among these processes, the pathways leading to TDP-43 fragmentation remain poorly understood. We review here the molecular and biochemical properties of several TDP-43 fragments, the mechanisms and factors mediating their production, and their potential role in disease progression.

In this work, we report a flowable aqueous carbon dispersion which exhibits a viscosity of only 2 Pa.s at a shear rate of 5 s-1 for a concentration of particles of 7 wt%. This suspension displays an electronic conductivity of 65 mS\/cm, nearly two orders of magnitude greater than previously investigated related materials.

A comparative analysis of long-term lion data from Serengeti and Ngorongoro in Tanzania, and Gir in India, reveals that male-female associations are contingent upon male and female group size, prey-size and availability, and the number of prides that each male coalition currently resides. Males maintain proximity with females, whereas females are responsible for segregation except at large kills. Lions feed on the largest prey in Ngorongoro and the smallest in Gir, and females spend the most time with males in Ngorongoro and the least in Gir. Females roar less often in prey-scarce circumstances in Serengeti and throughout the year in Gir possibly to prevent being tracked by males that parasitize on female kills. However, females readily associate with males when available prey is large and abundant. Contrasting availability of resources between Gir and Serengeti\/Ngorongoro helps explain the varying degrees of sexual segregation and appears to drive differences in mating systems between these lion populations.","1726":"We aimed to identify triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) drivers that regulate survival time as predictive signatures that improve TNBC prognostication. Breast cancer (BrCa) transcriptomic tumor biopsies were analyzed, identifying network communities enriched with TNBC-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and correlated strongly to TNBC status. Two anticorrelated modules correlated strongly to TNBC subtype and survival. Querying module-specific hubs and DEGs revealed transcriptional changes associated with high survival. Transcripts were nominated as biomarkers and tested as combinatoric ratios using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess survival prediction. ROC test rounds integrated genes with established interactions to hubs and DEGs of key modules, improving prediction. Finally, we tested whether integration of literature-derived genes for implicated hallmark cancer processes could improve prediction of survival. Complementary coexpression, differential expression, genetic interaction, and survival stratification integrated by ROC optimization uncovered a panel of \"linchpin survival genes\" predictive of patient survival, representing gene interactions in hallmark cancer processes.","1727":null,"1728":"","1729":"Recent theoretical studies have predicted that adiabatic compressed air energy storage (ACAES) can be an effective energy storage option in the future. However, major experimental projects and commercial ventures have so far failed to yield any viable prototypes. Here we explore the underlying reasons behind this failure. By developing an analytical idealized model of a typical ACAES design, we derive a design-dependent efficiency limit for a system with hypothetical, perfect components. This previously overlooked limit, equal to 93.6% under continuous cycling for a typical design, arises from irreversibility associated with the transient pressure in the system. Although the exact value is design dependent, the methodology we present for finding the limit is applicable for a wide range of designs. Turning to real systems, the limit alone does not fully explain the failure of practical ACAES research. However, reviewing the available evidence alongside our analytical model, we reason that underestimation of the system complexity, difficulty with the integration of off-the-shelf components, and a number of misleading performance claims are the primary reasons hindering ACAES development.","1730":null,"1731":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2021.102175.].","1732":null,"1733":null,"1734":"The gut microbiota metabolizes the nutrients to produce various metabolites that play crucial roles in host metabolism.

Comparison of plasma lipidomic analysis between germ-free and colonized mice revealed significant impacts of the microbiota on various lipid classes, and of note, the microbiota established by the SO diet, which was associated with the greatest degree of glucose intolerance, caused the maximum alteration of the plasma lipid profile.

Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on murine fetal cerebral cortical cells from six timed pregnancies, to decipher persistent cell- and sex-specific effects of an episode of PAE during early neurogenesis. We found, in an analysis of 38 distinct neural subpopulations across 8 lineage subtypes, that PAE altered neural maturation and cell cycle and disrupted gene co-expression networks. Whereas most differentially regulated genes were inhibited, particularly in females, PAE also induced sex-independent neural expression of fetal hemoglobin, a presumptive epigenetic stress adaptation. PAE inhibited Bcl11a, Htt, Ctnnb1, and other upstream regulators of differentially expressed genes and inhibited several autism-linked genes, suggesting that neurodevelopmental disorders share underlying mechanisms. PAE females exhibited neural loss of X-inactivation, with correlated activation of autosomal genes and evidence for spliceosome dysfunction. Thus, episodic PAE persistently alters the developing neural transcriptome, contributing to sex- and cell-type-specific teratology.","1737":"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been proven as an enabling technology for consumer electronics, electro mobility, and stationary storage systems, and the steadily increasing demand for LIBs raises new challenges regarding their sustainability. The rising demand for comprehensive assessments of this technology's environmental impacts requires the identification of energy and materials consumed for its production, on lab to industrial scale. There are no studies available that provide a detailed picture of lab scale cell production, and only a few studies provide detailed analysis of the actual consumption, with large deviations. Thus, the present work provides an analysis of the energy flows for the production of an LIB cell. The analyzed energy requirements of individual production steps were determined by measurements conducted on a laboratory scale lithium-ion cell production and displayed in a transparent and traceable manner. For the comparison with literature values a distinction is made between the different production scales.","1738":null,"1739":"While protein ADP-ribosylation was reported to regulate differentiation and dedifferentiation, it has so far not been studied during transdifferentiation. Here, we found that MyoD-induced transdifferentiation of fibroblasts to myoblasts promotes the expression of the ADP-ribosyltransferase ARTD1. Comprehensive analysis of the genome architecture by Hi-C and RNA-seq analysis during transdifferentiation indicated that ARTD1 locally contributed to A\/B compartmentalization and coregulated a subset of MyoD target genes that were however not sufficient to alter transdifferentiation. Surprisingly, the expression of ARTD1 was accompanied by the continuous synthesis of nuclear ADP ribosylation that was neither dependent on the cell cycle nor induced by DNA damage. Conversely to the H2O2-induced ADP-ribosylation, the MyoD-dependent ADP-ribosylation was not associated to chromatin but rather localized to the nucleoplasm. Together, these data describe a MyoD-induced nucleoplasmic ADP-ribosylation that is observed particularly during transdifferentiation and thus potentially expands the plethora of cellular processes associated with ADP-ribosylation.","1740":"Iron deposition is one of the key factors in the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Iron-free-apoferritin has the ability to store iron by combining with a ferric hydroxide-phosphate compound to form ferritin. In this study, we investigated the role of apoferritin in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mice models and elucidated the possible underlying mechanisms. Results showed that apoferritin remarkably improved MPTP-induced motor deficits by rescuing dopaminergic neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra. Apoferritin inhibited MPTP-induced iron aggregation by down-regulating iron importer divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Meanwhile, we also showed that apoferritin prevented MPTP-induced ferroptosis effectively by inhibiting the up-regulation of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) and the down-regulation of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1). These results indicate that apoferritin exerts a neuroprotective effect against MPTP by inhibiting iron aggregation and modulating ferroptosis. This provides a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of PD.","1741":"The emergence of lipid membranes and embedded proteins was essential for the evolution of cells. Translocon complexes mediate cotranslational recruitment and membrane insertion of nascent proteins, but they already contain membrane-integral proteins. Therefore, a simpler mechanism must exist, enabling spontaneous membrane integration while preventing aggregation of unchaperoned protein in the aqueous phase. Here, we used giant unilamellar vesicles encapsulating minimal translation components to systematically interrogate the requirements for insertion of the model protein proteorhodopsin (PR) - a structurally ubiquitous membrane protein. We show that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain of PR is both necessary and sufficient for cotranslational recruitment of ribosomes to the membrane and subsequent membrane insertion of PR. Insertion of N-terminally truncated PR was restored by artificially attaching ribosomes to the membrane. Our findings offer a self-sufficient protein-inherent mechanism as a possible explanation for effective membrane protein biogenesis in a \"pretranslocon\" era, and they offer new opportunities for generating artificial cells.","1742":"Communication constitutes a fundamental component of mammalian social behavior. Rats are highly social animals and emit 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USV), which function as social contact calls. Playback of 50-kHz USV leads to strong and immediate social approach responses in receiver rats, but this response is weak or even absent during repeated 50-kHz USV playback. Given the important role of 50-kHz USV in initiating social contact and coordinating social interactions, the occurrence of habituation is highly unexpected. It is not clear why a social signal characterized by significant incentive salience loses its power to change the behavior of the receiver so rapidly. Here, we show that the habituation phenomenon displayed by rats in response to repeated playback of 50-kHz USV (1) is characterized by limited generalizability because it is present in Wistar but not Sprague-Dawley rats, (2) can be overcome by amphetamine treatment, and (3) depends on the subject's internal state.","1743":null,"1744":"Serine-arginine (SR) protein kinases (SRPKs) regulate the functions of the SR-rich splicing factors by phosphorylating multiple serines within their C-terminal arginine-serine-rich domains.

In particular, aberrant SRPK1 expression alters the balances of proangiogenic (VEGF165) and antiangiogenic (VEGF165b) splicing isoforms of the key angiogenesis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), through the phosphorylation of prototypic SR protein SRSF1. Here, we report a protein-protein interaction (PPI) inhibitor of SRPKs, docking blocker of SRPK1 (DBS1), that specifically blocks a conserved substrate docking groove unique to SRPKs. DBS1 is a cell-permeable inhibitor that effectively inhibits the binding and phosphorylation of SRSF1 and subsequently switches VEGF splicing from the proangiogenic to the antiangiogenic isoform. Our findings thus provide a new direction for the development of SRPK inhibitors through targeting a unique PPI site to combat angiogenic diseases.","1745":null,"1746":null,"1747":null,"1748":null,"1749":null,"1750":"Solar and wind energy harvesting technology is increasingly an economical and efficient energy form and receives excellent support from government policies worldwide.

However, non-APL types of AML respond poorly to ATRA-induced differentiation, and the mechanism underlying cell-type-specific resistance against ATRA remains unclear. Here, we use single-cell transcriptome analysis to compare the differentiation trajectories of two AML cell types during ATRA treatment. We show that in NB4 (APL\/AML-M3) cells, ATRA activates canonical myeloid lineage factors-including SPI1, CEBPE, and STAT1-to direct near-normal differentiation toward mature granulocytes. By contrast, in HL60 (AML-M2) cells, ATRA-induced differentiation is incomplete and promiscuous, which is characterized by coinduction of both myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis gene expression programs, as well as transient activation of cis-regulatory elements associated with myeloid differentiation. Our study suggests that the differentiation inducing capacity of ATRA in certain subtypes of AML may be compromised by therapy-induced lineage promiscuity.","1754":null,"1755":"Nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) are a class of highly abundant DNA-binding proteins in bacteria and archaea. While both the composition and relative abundance of the NAPs change during the bacterial growth cycle, surprisingly little is known about their crosstalk in mutually binding and stabilizing higher-order nucleoprotein complexes in the bacterial chromosome. Here, we use atomic force microscopy and solid-state nanopores to investigate long-range nucleoprotein structures formed by the binding of two major NAPs, FIS and H-NS, to DNA molecules with distinct binding site arrangements. We find that spatial organization of the protein binding sites can govern the higher-order architecture of the nucleoprotein complexes. Based on sequence arrangement the complexes differed in their global shape and compaction as well as the extent of FIS and H-NS binding. Our observations highlight the important role the DNA sequence plays in driving structural differentiation within the bacterial chromosome.","1756":"When approaching a landing surface, many flying animals use visual feedback to control their landing. Here, we studied how foraging bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) use radial optic expansion cues to control in-flight decelerations during landing. By analyzing the flight dynamics of 4,672 landing maneuvers, we showed that landing bumblebees exhibit a series of deceleration bouts, unlike landing honeybees that continuously decelerate. During each bout, the bumblebee keeps its relative rate of optical expansion constant, and from one bout to the next, the bumblebee tends to shift to a higher, constant relative rate of expansion. This modular landing strategy is relatively fast compared to the strategy described for honeybees and results in approach dynamics that is strikingly similar to that of pigeons and hummingbirds. The here discovered modular landing strategy of bumblebees helps explaining why these important pollinators in nature and horticulture can forage effectively in challenging conditions; moreover, it has potential for bio-inspired landing strategies in flying robots.","1757":"Teeth exert fundamental functions related to mastication and speech.

Our study identified great cellular heterogeneity in the dental pulp and the periodontium. Unexpectedly, we found that the molecular signatures of the stem cell populations were very similar, while their respective microenvironments strongly diverged. Our findings suggest that the microenvironmental specificity is a potential source for functional differences between highly similar stem cells located in the various tooth compartments and open new perspectives toward cell-based dental therapeutic approaches.","1758":"Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are traditionally subdivided into cDC1 and cDC2 lineages. Batf3 is a cDC1-required transcription factor, and we observed that Batf3-\/- mice harbor a population of cDC1-like cells co-expressing cDC2-associated surface molecules. Using single-cell RNA sequencing with integrated cell surface protein expression (CITE-seq), we found that Batf3-\/- mitotic immature cDC1-like cells showed reduced expression of cDC1 features and increased levels of cDC2 features. In wild type, we also observed a proportion of mature cDC1 cells expressing surface features characteristic to cDC2 and found that overall cDC cell state heterogeneity was mainly driven by developmental stage, proliferation, and maturity. We detected population diversity within Sirpa+ cDC2 cells, including a Cd33+ cell state expressing high levels of Sox4 and lineage-mixed features characteristic to cDC1, cDC2, pDCs, and monocytes. In conclusion, these data suggest that multiple cDC cell states can co-express lineage-overlapping features, revealing a level of previously unappreciated cDC plasticity.","1759":"Lithium-ion batteries are applied in electric vehicles to mitigate climate change. However, their practical applications are impeded by poor safety performance owing mainly to the cell eruption gas (CEG) fire triangle. Here, we report quantitatively the three fire boundaries corresponding to the CEG fire triangle of four types of mainstream cells with the state of charge (SOC) values ranging from 0% to 143% based on 29 thermal runaway tests conducted in an inert atmosphere in open literature. Controlling the SOC and\/or selecting a reasonable cell type can alter the minimum CEG and oxygen concentrations required for ignition, thereby changing the probability of a battery fire. The ignition temperature varies greatly according to the type of ignition source type. Temperature and ignition source type play a leading role in the ignition mode. Breaking any fire boundary will stop the ignition of CEG, thus significantly improving the battery safety performance.","1760":null,"1761":"Blink reflex has long been considered closely related to physiological states, from which abundant information on ocular health and activities can be revealed. In this study, a smart glasses wearable has been developed, incorporating a flexible and sensitive pressure sensor, to monitor blink patterns by continuously detecting ocular muscular movements, referred to as blink-sensing glasses. By applying the emerging flexible iontronic sensing (FITS) sensor with the sensitivity of 340 pF\/mmHg, the skin pressure variations induced by movements of the orbicularis oculi muscles can be monitored in real time. The blink-sensing glasses can successfully capture blink patterns with a high accuracy of 96.3% and have been used to differentiate the blink features from both dry-eye subjects and healthy controls. This device can be potentially used as a new clinical and research monitoring tool for continuous eye blink analysis, while providing patients with high comfortableness in long-term ambulatory and home settings.","1762":"The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical reaction for energy-related applications, yet suffers from its slow kinetics and large overpotential. It is desirable to develop effective OER electrocatalysts, such as single-atom catalysts (SACs). Here, we demonstrate machine learning (ML)-accelerated prediction of OER overpotential of all transition metals. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations of 15 species of SACs, we design a topological information-based ML model to map the OER overpotentials with atomic properties of the corresponding SACs. The trained ML model not only yields remarkable prediction precision (relative error of 6.49%) but also enables a 130,000-fold reduction of prediction time in comparison with pure DFT calculation. Furthermore, an intrinsic descriptor that correlates the overpotential of an SAC with its atomic properties is revealed. The approach and results from this study can be readily applicable to screen other SACs and significantly accelerate the design of high-performance catalysts for many other reactions.","1763":null,"1764":null,"1765":"Microbial research in space is being conducted for almost 50 years now. The closed system of the International Space Station (ISS) has acted as a microbial observatory for the past 10 years, conducting research on adaptation and survivability of microorganisms exposed to space conditions. This adaptation can be either beneficial or detrimental to crew members and spacecraft. Therefore, it becomes crucial to identify the impact of two primary stress conditions, namely, radiation and microgravity, on microbial life aboard the ISS. Elucidating the mechanistic basis of microbial adaptation to space conditions aids in the development of countermeasures against their potentially detrimental effects and allows us to harness their biotechnologically important properties. Several microbial processes have been studied, either in spaceflight or using devices that can simulate space conditions. However, at present, research is limited to only a few microorganisms, and extensive research on biotechnologically important microorganisms is required to make long-term space missions self-sustainable.","1766":null,"1767":"Single-cell RNA sequencing technology promotes the profiling of single-cell transcriptomes at an unprecedented throughput and resolution. However, in scRNA-seq studies, only a low amount of sequenced mRNA in each cell leads to missing detection for a portion of mRNA molecules, i.e. the dropout problem which hinders various downstream analyses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop robust and effective imputation methods for the increasing scRNA-seq data. In this study, we have developed an imputation method (GraphSCI) to impute the dropout events in scRNA-seq data based on the graph convolution networks. Extensive experiments demonstrated that GraphSCI outperforms other state-of-the-art methods for imputation on both simulated and real scRNA-seq data. Meanwhile, GraphSCI is able to accurately infer gene-to-gene relationships and the inferred gene-to-gene relationships could also provide powerful assistance for imputation dynamically during the training process, which is a key promotion of GraphSCI compared with other imputation algorithms.","1768":"Cognitive processes-from basic sensory analysis to language understanding-are typically contextualized. While the importance of considering context for understanding cognition has long been recognized in psychology and philosophy, it has not yet had much impact on cognitive neuroscience research, where cognition is often studied in decontextualized paradigms. Here, we present examples of recent studies showing that context changes the neural basis of diverse cognitive processes, including perception, attention, memory, and language. Within the domains of perception and language, we review neuroimaging results showing that context interacts with stimulus processing, changes activity in classical perception and language regions, and recruits additional brain regions that contribute crucially to naturalistic perception and language. We discuss how contextualized cognitive neuroscience will allow for discovering new principles of the mind and brain.","1769":"Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem, but bacteria can evade antibiotic treatment via tolerance and persistence. Antibiotic persisters are a small subpopulation of bacteria that tolerate antibiotics due to a physiologically dormant state. Hence, persistence is considered a major contributor to the evolution of antibiotic-resistant and relapsing infections. Here, we used the synthetically developed minimal cell Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-Syn3B to examine essential mechanisms of antibiotic survival. The minimal cell contains only 473 genes, and most genes are essential. Its reduced complexity helps to reveal hidden phenomenon and fundamental biological principles can be explored because of less redundancy and feedback between systems compared to natural cells. We found that Syn3B evolves antibiotic resistance to different types of antibiotics expeditiously. The minimal cell also tolerates and persists against multiple antibiotics. It contains a few already identified persister-related genes, although lacking many systems previously linked to persistence (e.g. toxin-antitoxin systems, ribosome hibernation genes).","1770":"Here we identify human Kinesin-5, Kif11\/HsEg5, as a cellular target of Zika protease. We show that Zika NS2B-NS3 protease targets several sites within the motor domain of HsEg5 irrespective of motor binding to microtubules. The native integral ER-membrane protease triggers mitotic spindle positioning defects and a prolonged metaphase delay in cultured cells. Our data support a model whereby loss of function of HsEg5 is mediated by Zika protease and is spatially restricted to the ER-mitotic spindle interface during mitosis. The resulting phenotype is distinct from the monopolar phenotype that typically results from uniform inhibition of HsEg5 by RNAi or drugs. In addition, our data reveal novel inter-organelle interactions between the mitotic apparatus and the surrounding reticulate ER network. Given that Kif11 is haplo-insufficient in humans, and reduced dosage results in microcephaly, we propose that Zika protease targeting of HsEg5 may be a key event in the etiology of Zika syndrome microcephaly.","1771":"We investigated soil organic carbon dynamics at three freshwater coastal sites in the Laurentian Great Lakes using a simple carbon budget box model. Long-term carbon budgets (1939-2018) were developed using aerial photography and then compared to short-term carbon export (2018-2019) developed using drone data. This study puts forth a refined coastal carbon budget model that advances previous model iterations by: (1) examining spatial variability in carbon budgets, (2) including a temporally dynamic carbon inventory term, and (3) updating the erosional term. Half of the initial carbon stock of the combined sites was lost in the 80-year study period, which is severely imbalanced with the age of those coastal habitats (400-2000 cal years BP). Major periods of carbon loss corresponded to periods of elevated water level. Short-term loss of carbon during 2018-2019 corresponded to northeasterly extreme wave events during a period of above-average water level.","1772":"Critical minerals are essential for the ever-increasing urban and industrial activities in modern society. The shift to cost-efficient and ecofriendly urban mining can be an avenue to replace the traditional linear flow of virgin-mined materials. Electrochemical separation technologies provide a sustainable approach to metal recovery, through possible integration with renewable energy, the minimization of external chemical input, as well as reducing secondary pollution. In this review, recent advances in electrochemically mediated technologies for metal recovery are discussed, with a focus on rare earth elements and other key critical materials for the modern circular economy. Given the extreme heterogeneity of hydrometallurgically-derived media of complex feedstocks, we focus on the nature of molecular selectivity in various electrochemically assisted recovery techniques. Finally, we provide a perspective on the challenges and opportunities for process intensification in critical materials recycling, especially through combining electrochemical and hydrometallurgical separation steps.","1773":"The inner speech is thoroughly studied in humans, and it represents an interdisciplinary research issue involving psychology, neuroscience, and pedagogy. A few papers only, mostly theoretical, analyze the role of inner speech in robots. The present study investigates the potential of the robot's inner speech while cooperating with human partners. A cognitive architecture is designed and integrated with standard robot routines into a complex framework. Two threads of interaction are discussed by setting the robot operations with and without inner speech. Thanks to the robotic self-dialog, the partner can easily trace the robot's processes. Moreover, the robot can better solve conflicts leading to successful goal achievements. The results show that functional and transparency requirements, according to the international standards ISO\/TS:2016 and COMEST\/Unesco for collaborative robots, are better met when inner speech accompanies human-robot interaction. The inner speech could be applied in many robotics contexts, such as learning, regulation, and attention.","1774":"The hippocampal formation displays a wide range of physiological responses to different spatial manipulations of the environment. However, very few attempts have been made to identify core computational principles underlying those hippocampal responses. Here, we capitalize on the observation that the entorhinal-hippocampal complex (EHC) forms a closed loop and projects inhibitory signals \"countercurrent\" to the trisynaptic pathway to build a self-supervised model that learns to reconstruct its own inputs by error backpropagation. The EHC is then abstracted as an autoencoder, with the hidden layers acting as an information bottleneck. With the inputs mimicking the firing activity of lateral and medial entorhinal cells, our model is shown to generate place cells and to respond to environmental manipulations as observed in rodent experiments. Altogether, we propose that the hippocampus builds conjunctive compressed representations of the environment by learning to reconstruct its own entorhinal inputs via gradient descent.","1775":"Within comparative psychology, the evolution of animal cognition is typically studied either by comparing indirect measures of cognitive abilities (e.g., relative brain size) across many species or by conducting batteries of decision-making experiments among (typically) a few captive species. Here, we propose a third, complementary approach: inferring and comparing cognitive abilities through observational field records of natural information gradients and the associated variation in decision-making outcomes, using the ranging behavior of wild animals. To demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we present the results of a global survey assessing the availability of long-term ranging data sets from wild primates and the willingness of primatologists to share such data. We explore three ways in which such ranging data, with or without the associated behavioral and ecological data often collected by primatologists, might be used to infer and compare spatial cognition. Finally, we suggest how ecological complexity may be best incorporated into comparative analyses.","1776":"Azhdarchid pterosaurs, the largest flying vertebrates, remain poorly understood, with fundamental aspects of their palaeobiology unknown. X-ray computed tomography reveals a complex internal micro-architecture for three-dimensionally preserved, hyper-elongate cervical vertebrae of the Cretaceous azhdarchid pterosaur, Alanqa sp. Incorporation of the neural canal within the body of the vertebra and elongation of the centrum result in a \"tube within a tube\" supported by helically distributed trabeculae. Linear elastic static analysis and linearized buckling analysis, accompanied with a finite element model, reveal that as few as 50 trabeculae increase the buckling load by up to 90%, implying that a vertebra without the trabeculae is more prone to elastic instability due to axial loads. Subsuming the neural tube into the centrum tube adds considerable stiffness to the cervical series, permitting the uptake of heavy prey items without risking damage to the cervical series, while at the same time allowing considerable skeletal mass reduction.","1777":null,"1778":"","1779":"Broad-scale, quantitative assessments of insect biodiversity and the factors shaping it remain particularly poorly explored. Here we undertook a spatial phylogenetic analysis of North American butterflies to test whether climate stability and temperature gradients have shaped their diversity and endemism. We also performed the first quantitative comparisons of spatial phylogenetic patterns between butterflies and flowering plants. We expected concordance between the two groups based on shared historical environmental drivers and presumed strong butterfly-host plant specializations. We instead found that biodiversity patterns in butterflies are strikingly different from flowering plants, especially warm deserts. In particular, butterflies show different patterns of phylogenetic clustering compared with flowering plants, suggesting differences in habitat conservation between the two groups. These results suggest that shared biogeographic histories and trophic associations do not necessarily assure similar diversity outcomes. The work has applied value in conservation planning, documenting warm deserts as a North American butterfly biodiversity hotspot.","1780":null,"1781":null,"1782":"","1783":"Nucleocapsid (N) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus packages the viral genome into well-defined ribonucleoprotein particles, but the molecular pathway is still unclear. N-protein is dimeric and consists of two folded domains with nucleic acid (NA) binding sites, surrounded by intrinsically disordered regions that promote liquid-liquid phase separation. Here, we use biophysical tools to study N-protein interactions with oligonucleotides of different lengths, examining the size, composition, secondary structure, and energetics of the resulting states. We observe the formation of supramolecular clusters or nuclei preceding growth into phase-separated droplets. Short hexanucleotide NA forms compact 2:2 N-protein\/NA complexes with reduced disorder. Longer oligonucleotides expose additional N-protein interactions and multi-valent protein-NA interactions, which generate higher-order mixed oligomers and simultaneously promote growth of droplets. Phase separation is accompanied by a significant change in protein secondary structure, different from that caused by initial NA binding, which may contribute to the assembly of ribonucleoprotein particles within macromolecular condensates.","1784":null,"1785":null,"1786":null,"1787":"Tissue imaging in 3D using visible light is limited and various clearing techniques were developed to increase imaging depth, but none provides universal solution for all tissues at all developmental stages. In this review, we focus on different tissue clearing methods for 3D imaging of heart and vasculature, based on chemical composition (solvent-based, simple immersion, hyperhydration, and hydrogel embedding techniques). We discuss in detail compatibility of various tissue clearing techniques with visualization methods: fluorescence preservation, immunohistochemistry, nuclear staining, and fluorescent dyes vascular perfusion. We also discuss myocardium visualization using autofluorescence, tissue shrinking, and expansion. Then we overview imaging methods used to study cardiovascular system and live imaging. We discuss heart and vessels segmentation methods and image analysis. The review covers the whole process of cardiovascular system 3D imaging, starting from tissue clearing and its compatibility with various visualization methods to the types of imaging methods and resulting image analysis.","1788":"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) undergo a slowing of waking electroencephalographic (EEG) rhythms since prodromal stages, which could be ascribed to poor sleep quality. We examined the relationship between wake and sleep alterations by assessing EEG activity during sleep and (pre-sleep\/post-sleep) wakefulness in AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls. AD and MCI show high sleep latency and less slow-wave sleep. Reduced sigma activity characterizes non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, reflecting sleep spindles loss. The EEG slowing characterizes REM sleep and wakefulness of AD and MCI, with strong correlations among the two phenomena suggesting common neuropathological mechanisms. Evening-to-morning variations in waking EEG revealed the gradual disappearance in MCI and AD of overnight changes in delta activity, indicating a progressive decay of sleep restorative functions on diurnal activity that correlates with the impairment of sleep high-frequency activity in AD. Our findings support a linkage between wake and sleep alterations, and the importance of sleep-related processes in Alzheimer's disease progression.","1789":"Voluntary exercise is well known to benefit brain performance. In contrast, forced exercise induces inflammation-related stress responses and may cause psychiatric disorders. Here, we unexpectedly found that rotarod testing, a frequently applied assay for evaluating rodent motor coordination, induces anxiety and alters spatial learning\/memory performance of mice. Rotarod testing upregulated genes involved in the unfolded protein response and stress responses and downregulated genes associated with neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation. It impacts two downstream pathways. The first is the IL-6-dependent pathway, which mediates rotarod-induced anxiety. The second is the Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-dependent pathway, which is involved in the effect of rotarod exercise on gene expression and its impact on contextual learning and memory of mice. Thus, although rotarod exercise does not induce systemic inflammation, it influences innate immunity-related responses in the brain, controls gene expression and, consequently, regulates anxiety and contextual learning and memory.","1790":null,"1791":"The nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract (NLOT) is not only a part of the olfactory cortex that receives olfactory sensory inputs but also a part of the cortical amygdala, which regulates motivational behaviors. To examine how neural activity of the NLOT is modulated by decision-making processes that occur during various states of learned goal-directed behaviors, we recorded NLOT spike activities of mice performing odor-guided go\/no-go tasks to obtain a water reward. We observed that several NLOT neurons exhibited sharp go-cue excitation and persistent no-go-cue suppression responses triggered by an odor onset. The bidirectional cue encoding introduced NLOT population response dynamics and provided a high odor decoding accuracy before executing cue-odor-evoked behaviors. The go-cue responsive neurons were also activated in the reward drinking state, indicating context-based odor-outcome associations. These findings suggest that NLOT neurons play an important role in the translation from context-based odor information to appropriate behavior.","1792":"Motor tics, the hallmark of Tourette syndrome (TS), are modulated by different behavioral and environmental factors. A major modulating factor is the sleep-wake cycle in which tics are attenuated to a large extent during sleep. This study demonstrates a similar reduction in tic expression during sleep in an animal model of chronic tic disorders and investigates the underlying neural mechanism. We recorded the neuronal activity during spontaneous sleep-wake cycles throughout continuous GABAA antagonist infusion into the striatum. Analysis of video streams and concurrent kinematic assessments indicated tic reduction during sleep in both frequency and intensity. Extracellular recordings in the striatum revealed a state-dependent dissociation between motor tic expression and their macro-level neural correlates (\"LFP spikes\") during the sleep-wake cycle. Local field potential (LFP) spikes, which are highly correlated with tic expression during wakefulness, persisted during tic-free sleep and did not change their properties despite the reduced behavioral expression. Local, micro-level, activity near the infusion site was time-locked to the LFP spikes during wakefulness, but this locking decreased significantly during sleep. These results suggest that whereas LFP spikes encode motor tic generation and feasibility, the behavioral expression of tics requires local striatal neural activity entrained to the LFP spikes, leading to the propagation of the activity to downstream targets and consequently their motor expression. These findings point to a possible mechanism for the modulation of tic expression in patients with TS during sleep and potentially during other behavioral states.","1793":null,"1794":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used reliable, non-invasive approach for cardiovascular disease diagnosis. With the rapid growth of ECG examinations and the insufficiency of cardiologists, accurate and automatic diagnosis of ECG signals has become a hot research topic. In this paper, we developed a deep neural network for automatic classification of cardiac arrhythmias from 12-lead ECG recordings. Experiments on a public 12-lead ECG dataset showed the effectiveness of our method. The proposed model achieved an average F1 score of 0.813. The deep model showed superior performance than 4 machine learning methods learned from extracted expert features. Besides, the deep models trained on single-lead ECGs produce lower performance than using all 12 leads simultaneously. The best-performing leads are lead I, aVR, and V5 among 12 leads. Finally, we employed the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to interpret the model's behavior at both the patient level and population level.","1795":"The SARS-CoV-2 viral pandemic has induced a global health crisis, which requires more in-depth investigation into immunological responses to develop effective treatments and vaccines. To understand protective immunity against COVID-19, we screened over 60,000 asymptomatic individuals in the Southeastern United States for IgG antibody positivity against the viral Spike protein, and approximately 3% were positive. Of these 3%, individuals with the highest anti-S or anti-RBD IgG level showed a strong correlation with inhibition of ACE2 binding and cross-reactivity against non-SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus S-proteins. We also analyzed samples from 94 SARS-CoV-2 patients and compared them with those of asymptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic patients had decreased antibody responses, ACE2 binding inhibition, and antibody cross-reactivity. Our study shows that healthy individuals can mount robust immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms. Furthermore, IgG antibody responses against S and RBD may correlate with high inhibition of ACE2 binding in individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection or post vaccination.","1796":"Photobiocatalysis uses light to perform specific chemical transformations in a selective and efficient way. The intention is to couple a photoredox cycle with an enzyme performing multielectronic catalytic activities. Laccase, a robust multicopper oxidase, can be envisioned to use dioxygen as a clean electron sink when coupled to an oxidation photocatalyst. Here, we provide a detailed study of the coupling of a [Ru(bpy)3]2+ photosensitizer to laccase. We demonstrate that efficient laccase reduction requires an electron relay like methyl viologen. In the presence of dioxygen, electrons transiently stored in superoxide ions are scavenged by laccase to form water instead of H2O2. The net result is the photo accumulation of highly oxidizing [Ru(bpy)3]3+. This study provides ground for the use of laccase in tandem with a light-driven oxidative process and O2 as one-electron transfer relay and as four-electron substrate to be a sustainable final electron acceptor in a photocatalytic process.","1797":"When individuals face collective action problems, their expectations about others' willingness to contribute affect their motivation to cooperate. Individuals, however, often misperceive the cooperation levels in a population. In the context of climate action, people underestimate the pro-climate positions of others. Designing incentives to enable cooperation and a sustainable future must thereby consider how social perception biases affect collective action. We propose a theoretical model and investigate the effect of social perception bias in non-linear public goods games. We show that different types of bias play a distinct role in cooperation dynamics. False uniqueness (underestimating own views) and false consensus (overestimating own views) both explain why communities get locked in suboptimal states. Such dynamics also impact the effectiveness of typical monetary incentives, such as fees. Our work contributes to understanding how targeting biases, e.g., by changing the information available to individuals, can comprise a fundamental mechanism to prompt collective action.","1798":null,"1799":null,"1800":"Neutralizing antibodies represent a valuable therapeutic approach to countermeasure the current COVID-19 pandemic. Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants emphasizes the notion that antibody treatments need to rely on highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), targeting several distinct epitopes for circumventing therapy escape mutants. Previously, we reported efficient human therapeutic mAbs recognizing epitopes on the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the isolation, characterization, and recombinant production of 12 neutralizing human mAbs, targeting three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain of the virus. Neutralization mechanism of these antibodies involves receptors other than the canonical hACE2 on target cells, relying both on amino acid and N-glycan epitope recognition, suggesting alternative viral cellular portals. Two selected mAbs demonstrated full protection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice when administered at low doses and late post-exposure, demonstrating the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","1801":null,"1802":"The ventral pallidum (VP) is interfacing striatopallidal and limbic circuits, conveying information about salience and valence crucial to adjusting behavior. However, how VP neuron populations with distinct electrophysiological properties (e-types) represent these variables is not fully understood. Therefore, we trained mice on probabilistic Pavlovian conditioning while recording the activity of VP neurons. Many VP neurons responded to punishment (54%), reward (48%), and outcome-predicting auditory stimuli (32%), increasingly differentiating distinct outcome probabilities through learning. We identified e-types based on the presence of bursts or fast rhythmic discharges and found that non-bursting, non-rhythmic neurons were the most sensitive to reward and punishment. Some neurons exhibited distinct responses of their bursts and single spikes, suggesting a multiplexed coding scheme in the VP. Finally, we demonstrate synchronously firing neuron assemblies, particularly responsive to reinforcing stimuli. These results suggest that electrophysiologically defined e-types of the VP differentially participate in transmitting reinforcement signals during learning.","1803":"The CorC\/CNNM family of Na+-dependent Mg2+ transporters is ubiquitously conserved from bacteria to humans. CorC, the bacterial CorC\/CNNM family of proteins, is involved in resistance to antibiotic exposure and in the survival of pathogenic microorganisms in their host environment. The CorC\/CNNM family proteins possess a cytoplasmic region containing the regulatory ATP-binding site. CorC and CNNM have attracted interest as therapeutic targets, whereas inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site have not been identified. Here, we performed a virtual screening of CorC by targeting its ATP-binding site, identified a compound named IGN95a with inhibitory effects on ATP binding and Mg2+ export, and determined the cytoplasmic domain structure in complex with IGN95a. Furthermore, a chemical cross-linking experiment indicated that with ATP bound to the cytoplasmic domain, the conformational equilibrium of CorC was shifted more toward the inward-facing state of the transmembrane domain. In contrast, IGN95a did not induce such a shift.","1804":"Inflammation during neonatal brain infections leads to significant secondary sequelae such as hydrocephalus, which often follows neonatal sepsis in the developing world. In 100 African hydrocephalic infants we identified the biological pathways that account for this response. The dominant bacterial pathogen was a Paenibacillus species, with frequent cytomegalovirus co-infection. A proteogenomic strategy was employed to confirm host immune response to Paenibacillus and to define the interplay within the host immune response network. Immune activation emphasized neuroinflammation, oxidative stress reaction, and extracellular matrix organization. The innate immune system response included neutrophil activity, signaling via IL-4, IL-12, IL-13, interferon, and Jak\/STAT pathways. Platelet-activating factors and factors involved with microbe recognition such as Class I MHC antigen-presenting complex were also increased. Evidence suggests that dysregulated neuroinflammation propagates inflammatory hydrocephalus, and these pathways are potential targets for adjunctive treatments to reduce the hazards of neuroinflammation and risk of hydrocephalus following neonatal sepsis.","1805":null,"1806":"Interfacial polymerization (IP) is a platform technology for ultrathin membranes. However, most efforts in regulating the IP process have been focused on short-range H-bond interaction, often leading to low-permselective membranes. Herein, we report an electrostatic-modulated interfacial polymerization (eIP) via supercharged phosphate-rich substrates toward ultra-permselective polyamide membranes. Phytate, a natural strongly charged organophosphate, confers high-density long-range electrostatic attraction to aqueous monomers and affords tunable charge density by flexible metal-organophosphate coordination. The electrostatic attraction spatially enriches amine monomers and temporally decelerates their diffusion into organic phase to be polymerized with acyl chloride monomers, triggering membrane sealing and inhibiting membrane growth, thus generating polyamide membranes with reduced thickness and enhanced cross-linking. The optimized nearly 10-nm-thick and highly cross-linked polyamide membrane displays superior water permeance and ionic selectivity. This eIP approach is applicable to the majority of conventional IP processes and can be extended to fabricate a variety of advanced membranes from polymers, supermolecules, and organic framework materials.","1807":null,"1808":"Transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) has essential iron transport and proposed signal transduction functions. Proper TfR1 regulation is a requirement for hematopoiesis, neurological development, and the homeostasis of tissues including the intestine and muscle, while dysregulation is associated with cancers and immunodeficiency. TfR1 mRNA degradation is highly regulated, but the identity of the degradation activity remains uncertain. Here, we show with gene knockouts and siRNA knockdowns that two Roquin paralogs are major mediators of iron-regulated changes to the steady-state TfR1 mRNA level within four different cell types (HAP1, HUVEC, L-M, and MEF). Roquin is demonstrated to destabilize the TfR1 mRNA, and its activity is fully dependent on three hairpin loops within the TfR1 mRNA 3'-UTR that are essential for iron-regulated instability. We further show in L-M cells that TfR1 mRNA degradation does not require ongoing translation, consistent with Roquin-mediated instability. We conclude that Roquin is a major effector of TfR1 mRNA abundance.","1809":"We present a methodological phylogenetic reconstruction approach combining Maximum Parsimony and Phylogenetic Networks methods for the study of human evolution applied to phenotypic craniodental characters of 22 hominin species. The approach consists in selecting and validating a tree-like most parsimonious scenario out of several parsimony runs based on various numerical constraints. An intermediate step from tree to network methods is implemented by running an analysis with a reduced apomorphous character dataset that generates multiple parsimonious trees. These most parsimonious trees are then used as input for a Phylogenetic Networks analysis that results in consensus and reticulate networks. We show here that the phylogenetic tree-like definition of the genus Homo is a relative concept linked to craniodental characters that come in support of hypothetical Last Common Ancestors of the most parsimonious scenario and infer that the Homo reticulate network concords with recent findings in paleogenomic research regarding its mode of evolution.","1810":"Splenic Ly6Chigh monocytes are innate immune cells involved in the regulation of central nervous system-related diseases. Recent studies have reported the shaping of peripheral immune responses by the gut microbiome via mostly unexplored pathways. In this study, we report that a 4-day antibiotic treatment eliminates certain families of the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Tenericutes, and Actinobacteria phyla in the gut and reduces the levels of multiple pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands in the serum. Reduction of PRR ligands was associated with reduced numbers and perturbed function of splenic Ly6Chigh monocytes, which acquired an immature phenotype producing decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines and exhibiting increased phagocytic and anti-microbial abilities. Addition of PRR ligands in antibiotic-treated mice restored the number and functions of splenic Ly6Chigh monocytes. Our data identify circulating PRR ligands as critical regulators of the splenic Ly6Chigh monocyte behavior and suggest possible intervention pathways to manipulate this crucial immune cell subset.","1811":"Any proposed mechanism for organelle size control should be able to account not only for average size but also for the variation in size. We analyzed cell-to-cell variation and within-cell variation of length for the two flagella in Chlamydomonas, finding that cell-to-cell variation is dominated by cell size, whereas within-cell variation results from dynamic fluctuations. Fluctuation analysis suggests tubulin assembly is not directly coupled with intraflagellar transport (IFT) and that the observed length fluctuations reflect tubulin assembly and disassembly events involving large numbers of tubulin dimers. Length variation is increased in long-flagella mutants, an effect consistent with theoretical models for flagellar length regulation. Cells with unequal flagellar lengths show impaired swimming but improved gliding, raising the possibility that cells have evolved mechanisms to tune biological noise in flagellar length. Analysis of noise at the level of organelle size provides a way to probe the mechanisms determining cell geometry.","1812":null,"1813":"Processing time-dependent information requires cells to quantify the duration of past regulatory events and program the time span of future signals. At the single-cell level, timer mechanisms can be implemented with genetic circuits. However, such systems are difficult to implement in single cells due to saturation in molecular components and stochasticity in the limited intracellular space. In contrast, multicellular implementations outsource some of the components of information-processing circuits to the extracellular space, potentially escaping these constraints. Here, we develop a theoretical framework, based on trilinear coordinate representation, to study the collective behavior of populations composed of three cell types under stationary conditions. This framework reveals that distributing different processes (in our case the production, detection and degradation of a time-encoding signal) across distinct strains enables the implementation of a multicellular timer. Our analysis also shows that the circuit can be easily tunable by varying the cellular composition of the consortium.","1814":null,"1815":"The commonly used laboratory cell lines are the first line of experimental models to study the pathogenicity and performing antiviral assays for emerging viruses. Here, we assessed the tropism and cytopathogenicity of the first Swedish isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in six different human cell lines, compared their growth characteristics, and performed quantitative proteomics for the susceptible cell lines. Overall, Calu-3, Caco2, Huh7, and 293FT cell lines showed a high-to-moderate level of susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. In Caco2 cells, the virus can achieve high titers in the absence of any prominent cytopathic effect. The protein abundance profile during SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed cell-type-specific regulation of cellular pathways. Type-I interferon signaling was identified as the common dysregulated cellular response in Caco2, Calu-3, and Huh7 cells. Together, our data show cell-type specific variability for cytopathogenicity, susceptibility, and cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 and provide important clues to guide future studies.","1816":"The role of oncoviral genotype and co-infection driving oncogenesis remains unclear. We have developed a scalable, high throughput tool for sensitive and precise oncoviral genotype deconvolution. Using tumor RNA sequencing data, we applied it to 537 virally infected liver, cervical, and head and neck tumors, providing the first comprehensive integrative landscape of tumor-viral gene expression, viral antigen immunogenicity, patient survival, and mutational profiling organized by tumor oncoviral genotype. We find that HBV and HPV genotype and co-infection serve as significant predictors of patient survival and immune activation. Finally, we demonstrate that HPV genotype is more associated with viral oncogene expression than cancer type, implying that expression may be similar across episomal and stochastic integration-based infections. While oncoviral infections are known risk factors for oncogenesis, viral genotype and co-infection are shown to strongly associate with disease progression, patient survival, mutational signatures, and putative tumor neoantigen immunogenicity, facilitating novel clinical associations with infections.","1817":"Multilayer networks allow interpreting the molecular basis of diseases, which is particularly challenging in rare diseases where the number of cases is small compared with the size of the associated multi-omics datasets. In this work, we develop a dimensionality reduction methodology to identify the minimal set of genes that characterize disease subgroups based on their persistent association in multilayer network communities. We use this approach to the study of medulloblastoma, a childhood brain tumor, using proteogenomic data. Our approach is able to recapitulate known medulloblastoma subgroups (accuracy &gt;94%) and provide a clear characterization of gene associations, with the downstream implications for diagnosis and therapeutic interventions. We verified the general applicability of our method on an independent medulloblastoma dataset (accuracy &gt;98%). This approach opens the door to a new generation of multilayer network-based methods able to overcome the specific dimensionality limitations of rare disease datasets.","1818":"Epidemiological studies have reported an inverse correlation between cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, and increasing evidence shows that similar genes and pathways are dysregulated in both diseases but in a contrasting manner. Given the genetic convergence of the neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs), a family of rare neurodegenerative disorders commonly known as Batten disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases, we sought to explore the relationship between cancer and the NCLs. In this review, we survey data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and available literature on the roles of NCL genes in different oncogenic processes to reveal links between all the NCL genes and cancer-related processes. We also discuss the potential contributions of NCL genes to cancer immunology. Based on our findings, we propose that further research on the relationship between cancer and the NCLs may help shed light on the roles of NCL genes in both diseases and possibly guide therapy development.","1819":null,"1820":"Time of eating synchronizes circadian rhythms of metabolism and physiology. Inverted feeding can uncouple peripheral circadian clocks from the central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. However, system-wide changes of circadian metabolism and physiology entrained to inverted feeding in peripheral tissues remain largely unexplored. Here, we performed a 24-h global profiling of transcripts and metabolites in mouse peripheral tissues to study the transition kinetics during inverted feeding, and revealed distinct kinetics in phase entrainment of diurnal transcriptomes by inverted feeding, which graded from fat tissue (near-completely entrained), liver, kidney, to heart. Phase kinetics of tissue clocks tracked with those of transcriptomes and were gated by light-related cues. Integrated analysis of transcripts and metabolites demonstrated that fatty acid oxidation entrained completely to inverted feeding in heart despite the slow kinetics\/resistance of the heart clock to entrainment by feeding. This multi-omics resource defines circadian signatures of inverted feeding in peripheral tissues (www.CircaMetDB.org.cn).","1821":"Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become one of the main energy storage solutions in modern society. The application fields and market share of LIBs have increased rapidly and continue to show a steady rising trend. The research on LIB materials has scored tremendous achievements. Many innovative materials have been adopted and commercialized by the industry. However, the research on LIB manufacturing falls behind. Many battery researchers may not know exactly how LIBs are being manufactured and how different steps impact the cost, energy consumption, and throughput, which prevents innovations in battery manufacturing. Here in this perspective paper, we introduce state-of-the-art manufacturing technology and analyze the cost, throughput, and energy consumption based on the production processes. We then review the research progress focusing on the high-cost, energy, and time-demand steps of LIB manufacturing. Finally, we share our views of challenges in LIB manufacturing and propose future development directions for manufacturing research in LIBs.","1822":null,"1823":"Adipic acid production by yeast fermentation is gaining attention as a renewable source of platform chemicals for making nylon products. However, adipic acid toxicity inhibits yeast growth and fermentation. Here, we performed a chemogenomic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to understand the cellular basis of adipic acid toxicity. Our screen revealed that KGD1 (a key gene in the tricarboxylic acid cycle) deletion improved tolerance to adipic acid and its toxic precursor, catechol. Conversely, disrupting ergosterol biosynthesis as well as protein trafficking and vacuolar transport resulted in adipic acid hypersensitivity. Notably, we show that adipic acid disrupts the Membrane Compartment of Can1 (MCC) on the plasma membrane and impacts endocytosis. This was evidenced by the rapid internalization of Can1 for vacuolar degradation. As ergosterol is an essential component of the MCC and protein trafficking mechanisms are required for endocytosis, we highlight the importance of these cellular processes in modulating adipic acid toxicity.","1824":"Human hematopoiesis is surprisingly resilient to disruptions, providing suitable responses to severe bleeding, long-lasting immune activation, and even bone marrow transplants. Still, many blood disorders exist which push the system past its natural plasticity, resulting in abnormalities in the circulating blood. While proper treatment of such diseases can benefit from understanding the underlying cell dynamics, these are non-trivial to predict due to the hematopoietic system's hierarchical nature and complex feedback networks. To characterize the dynamics following different types of perturbations, we investigate a model representing hematopoiesis as a sequence of compartments covering all maturation stages-from stem to mature cells-where feedback regulates cell production to ongoing necessities. We find that a stable response to perturbations requires the simultaneous adaptation of cell differentiation and self-renewal rates, and show that under conditions of continuous disruption-as found in chronic hemolytic states-compartment cell numbers evolve to novel stable states.","1825":null,"1826":"Mitochondria are key organelles inside the cell that house a wide range of molecular pathways involved in energy metabolism, ions homeostasis, and cell death. Several databases characterize the different mitochondrial aspects and thus support basic and clinical research. Here we present MitopatHs, a web-based data set that allows navigating among the biochemical signaling pathways (PatHs) of human (H) mitochondria (Mito). MitopatHs is designed to visualize and comprehend virtually all types of pathways in two complementary ways: a logical view, where the sequence of biochemical reactions is presented as logical deductions, and an intuitive graphical visualization, which enables the examination and the analysis of each step of the pathway. MitopatHs is a manually curated, open access and collaborative tool, whose goal is to enable the visualization and comprehension of complicated molecular routes in an easy and fast way.","1827":null,"1828":"Neuroblastoma is a highly heterogeneous embryonal solid tumor of the sympathetic nervous system. As some tumors can be treated to undergo differentiation, investigating this process can guide differentiation-based therapies of neuroblastoma. Here, we studied the role of E3 ubiquitin ligases Cbl and Cbl-b in regulation of long-term signaling responses associated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth, a morphological marker of neuroblastoma cell differentiation. Using quantitative mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, we analyzed how the neuroblastoma cell line proteome, phosphoproteome, and ubiquitylome were affected by Cbl and Cbl-b depletion. To quantitatively assess neurite outgrowth, we developed a high-throughput microscopy assay that was applied in combination with inhibitor studies to pinpoint signaling underlying neurite outgrowth and to functionally validate proteins identified in the MS data sets. Using this combined approach, we identified a role for SHP-2 and CDK16 in Cbl\/Cbl-b-dependent regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth, highlighting their involvement in neuroblastoma cell differentiation.","1829":"Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an equally important mechanical energy harvesting technology as electromagnetic generator (EMG). Here, the input mechanical torques and energy conversion efficiencies of the rotating EMG and TENG are systematically measured, respectively. At constant rotation rates, the input mechanical torque of EMG is balanced by the friction resisting torque and electromagnetic resisting torque, which increases with the increasing rotation rate due to Ampere force. While the input mechanical torque of TENG is balanced by the friction resisting torque and electrostatic resisting torque, which is nearly constant at different rotation rates. The energy conversion efficiency of EMG increases with the increasing input mechanical power, while that of the TENG remains nearly constant. Compared with the EMG, the TENG has a higher conversion efficiency at a low input mechanical power, which demonstrates a remarkable merit of the TENG for efficiently harvesting weak ambient mechanical energy.","1830":null,"1831":"In modern society, the natural drive to behave impulsively in order to obtain rewards must often be curbed. A continued failure to do so is associated with a range of outcomes including drug abuse, pathological gambling, and obesity. Here, we used virtual reality technology to investigate whether spatial proximity to rewards has the power to exacerbate the drive to behave impulsively toward them. We embedded two behavioral tasks measuring distinct forms of impulsive behavior, impulsive action, and impulsive choice, within an environment rendered in virtual reality. Participants responded to three-dimensional cues representing food rewards located in either near or far space. Bayesian analyses revealed that participants were significantly less able to stop motor actions when rewarding cues were near compared with when they were far. Since factors normally associated with proximity were controlled for, these results suggest that proximity plays a distinctive role in driving impulsive actions for rewards.","1832":null,"1833":"The cross talk between adipose tissue and the heart has an increasing importance for cardiac function under physiological and pathological conditions. This study characterizes the role of fat body lipolysis for cardiac function in Drosophila melanogaster. Perturbation of the function of the key lipolytic enzyme, brummer (bmm), an ortholog of the mammalian ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) exclusively in the fly's fat body, protected the heart against starvation-induced dysfunction. We further provide evidence that this protection is caused by the preservation of glycerolipid stores, resulting in a starvation-resistant maintenance of energy supply and adequate cardiac ATP synthesis. Finally, we suggest that alterations of lipolysis are tightly coupled to lipogenic processes, participating in the preservation of lipid energy substrates during starvation. Thus, we identified the inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis and subsequent energy preservation as a protective mechanism against cardiac dysfunction during catabolic stress.","1834":null,"1835":null,"1836":"Hypothalamic regulation of lipid and glucose homeostasis is emerging, but whether the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) senses nutrients and regulates hepatic nutrient metabolism remains unclear. Here, we found in rats DVC oleic acid infusion suppressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride-rich very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL-TG), which was disrupted by inhibiting DVC long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase that in parallel disturbed lipid homeostasis during intravenous lipid infusion. DVC glucose infusion elevated local glucose levels similarly as intravenous glucose infusion and suppressed hepatic glucose production. This was independent of lactate metabolism as inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase failed to disrupt glucose sensing and neither could DVC lactate infusion recapitulate glucose effect. DVC oleic acid and glucose infusion failed to lower VLDL-TG secretion and glucose production in high-fat fed rats, while inhibiting DVC farnesoid X receptor enhanced oleic acid but not glucose sensing. Thus, an impairment of DVC nutrient sensing may lead to the disruption of lipid and glucose homeostasis in metabolic syndrome.","1837":null,"1838":"With the development of transcriptomic technologies, we are able to quantify precise changes in gene expression profiles from astronauts and other organisms exposed to spaceflight. Members of NASA GeneLab and GeneLab-associated analysis working groups (AWGs) have developed a consensus pipeline for analyzing short-read RNA-sequencing data from spaceflight-associated experiments. The pipeline includes quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps, culminating in the detection of differentially expressed genes. This data analysis pipeline and the results of its execution using data submitted to GeneLab are now all publicly available through the GeneLab database. We present here the full details and rationale for the construction of this pipeline in order to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of pipeline data; to provide a template for data processing of future spaceflight-relevant datasets; and to encourage cross-analysis of data from other databases with the data available in GeneLab.","1839":"Microglia play a key role in brain development, normal homeostasis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Single-cell technologies have led to important findings about microglia, with many animal model studies using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), whereas most human specimen studies using archived frozen brains for single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). However, microglia compose a small proportion of the total brain tissue; snRNAseq depletes expression of microglia activation genes that characterize many diseases. Here we examine the use of purified, cryopreserved microglia for scRNA-seq. Comparison of scRNA-seq on paired fresh and cryopreserved microglia from rhesus monkeys revealed a high level of correlation of gene expression between the two conditions. Disease-related genes were relatively unaffected, but an increase in immediate-early gene expression was present in cryopreserved cells. Regardless, changes in immediate-early gene expression are still detectable. Cryopreservation of microglia is a suitable procedure for prospectively archiving samples.","1840":"The rapid increase of multi-drug resistant bacteria has led to a greater emphasis on multi-drug combination treatments. However, some combinations can be suppressive-that is, bacteria grow faster in some drug combinations than when treated with a single drug. Typically, when studying interactions, the overall effect of the combination is only compared with the single-drug effects. However, doing so could miss \"hidden\" cases of suppression, which occur when the highest order is suppressive compared with a lower-order combination but not to a single drug. We examined an extensive dataset of 5-drug combinations and all lower-order-single, 2-, 3-, and 4-drug-combinations. We found that a majority of all combinations-54%-contain hidden suppression. Examining hidden interactions is critical to understanding the architecture of higher-order interactions and can substantially affect our understanding and predictions of the evolution of antibiotic resistance under multi-drug treatments.","1841":null,"1842":null,"1843":null,"1844":"High expression levels of mitochondria-associated hexokinase-II (HKII) represent a hallmark of metabolically highly active cells such as fast proliferating cancer cells. Typically, the enzyme provides a crucial metabolic switch towards aerobic glycolysis. By imaging metabolic activities on the single-cell level with genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors, we here demonstrate that HKII activity requires intracellular K+. The K+ dependency of glycolysis in cells expressing HKII was confirmed in cell populations using extracellular flux analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics. Reductions of intracellular K+ by gramicidin acutely disrupted HKII-dependent glycolysis and triggered energy stress pathways, while K+ re-addition promptly restored glycolysis-dependent adenosine-5'-triphosphate generation. Moreover, expression and activation of KV1.3, a voltage-gated K+ channel, lowered cellular K+ content and the glycolytic activity of HEK293 cells. Our findings unveil K+ as an essential cofactor of HKII and provide a mechanistic link between activities of distinct K+ channels and cell metabolism.","1845":null,"1846":null,"1847":"Less than half of all hypertensive patients receiving treatment are successful in normalizing their blood pressure. Despite the complexity and heterogeneity of hypertension, the current antihypertensive guidelines are not tailored to the individual patient. As a step toward individualized treatment, we develop a quantitative systems pharmacology model of blood pressure regulation in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and generate sex-specific virtual populations of SHRs to account for the heterogeneity between the sexes and within the pathophysiology of hypertension. We then used the mechanistic model integrated with machine learning tools to study how variability in these mechanisms leads to differential responses in rodents to the four primary classes of antihypertensive drugs. We found that both the sex and the pathophysiological profile of the individual play a major role in the response to hypertensive treatments. These results provide insight into potential areas to apply precision medicine in human primary hypertension.","1848":"Global coordination is required to solve a wide variety of challenging collective action problems from network colorings to the tragedy of the commons. Recent empirical study shows that the presence of a few noisy autonomous agents can greatly improve collective performance of humans in solving networked color coordination games. To provide analytical insights into the role of behavioral randomness, here we study myopic artificial agents attempting to solve similar network coloring problems using decision update rules that are only based on local information but allow random choices at various stages of their heuristic reasonings. We show that the resulting efficacy of resolving color conflicts is dependent on the implementation of random behavior of agents and specific population characteristics. Our work demonstrates that distributed greedy optimization algorithms exploiting local information should be deployed in combination with occasional exploration via random choices in order to overcome local minima and achieve global coordination.","1849":"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 executes a form of regulated necrosis called necroptosis. Upon induction of an altered conformation by chemical inhibitors or via mutations in its kinase site, RIPK3 associates with a multiprotein complex called the ripoptosome-a signaling platform containing FADD, RIPK1, caspase 8, and cFLIP-and becomes decisive in the execution of apoptosis. Surprisingly, in contexts not completely understood, the ripoptosome itself cleaves RIPK3, highlighting an apparent conundrum on how RIPK3 fulfills its role via the complex responsible for its own degradation. Recently, ripoptosome assembly was found to occur in mitosis where we found elevated RIPK3 levels. We now report that PLK1 directly associates with RIPK3 and phosphorylates it at S369 as cells enter mitosis. G2\/M phase RIPK3 has pro-apoptotic activity but upon release from ripoptosome, can trigger necroptosis. Taken together, phosphorylation of RIPK3 at S369 prevents its ripoptosome-mediated cleavage thereby retaining its pro-death activity during mitosis.","1850":null,"1851":"Visuospatial neglect (VSN) is a neurological syndrome of higher brain functions in which an individual fails to detect stimuli on a space that is contralateral to a hemispheric lesion. We performed a comprehensive multivariate analysis based on the principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis in patients with right hemisphere stroke and then performed a determination of different elements of VSN. PCA-based cluster analysis detected distinct aspects of VSN as follows: cluster 1: low arousal and attention state, cluster 2: exogenous neglect, cluster 3: spatial working memory (SWM) deficit. Lesion analysis revealed neural correlates for each cluster and highlighted \"disturbance of the ventral attention network\" for the stagnation of exogenous attention and \"parietal damage\" for SWM deficit. Our results reveal a pathological structure of VSN as multiple components of an attention network deficit, and they contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying VSN.","1852":"The acetylation of ATG9A within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen regulates the induction of reticulophagy. ER acetylation is ensured by AT-1\/SLC33A1, a membrane transporter that maintains the cytosol-to-ER flux of acetyl-CoA. Defective AT-1 activity, as caused by heterozygous\/homozygous mutations and gene duplication events, results in severe disease phenotypes. Here, we show that although the acetylation of ATG9A occurs in the ER lumen, the induction of reticulophagy requires ATG9A to engage FAM134B and SEC62 on the cytosolic side of the ER. To address this conundrum, we resolved the ATG9A interactome in two mouse models of AT-1 dysregulation: AT-1 sTg, a model of systemic AT-1 overexpression with hyperacetylation of ATG9A, and AT-1S113R\/+, a model of AT-1 haploinsufficiency with hypoacetylation of ATG9A. We identified CALR and HSPB1 as two ATG9A partners that regulate the induction of reticulophagy as a function of ATG9A acetylation and discovered that ATG9A associates with several proteins that maintain ER proteostasis.","1853":null,"1854":"Exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with cancer risk. Although multiple types of DNA damage are caused by radiation, it remains unknown how this damage is associated with cancer risk. Here, we show that after repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) directly caused by radiation (dir-DSBs), irradiated cells enter a state at higher risk of genomic destabilization due to accumulation of replication-stress-associated DSBs (rs-DSBs), ultimately resulting in clonal evolution of cells with abrogated defense systems. These effects were observed over broad ranges of radiation doses (0.25-2 Gy) and dose rates (1.39-909 mGy\/min), but not upon high-dose irradiation, which caused permanent cell-cycle arrest. The resultant genomic destabilization also increased the risk of induction of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), including radiation-associated SNVs, as well as structural alterations in chromosomes. Thus, the radiation-associated risk can be attributed to rs-DSB accumulation and resultant genomic destabilization.","1855":null,"1856":null,"1857":null,"1858":"Androgens have a robust effect on skeletal muscles to increase muscle mass and strength. The molecular mechanism of androgen\/androgen receptor (AR) action on muscle strength is still not well known, especially for the regulation of sarcomeric genes. In this study, we generated androgen-induced hypertrophic model mice, myofiber-specific androgen receptor knockout (cARKO) mice supplemented with dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT treatment increased grip strength in control mice but not in cARKO mice. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq, using skeletal muscles obtained from control and cARKO mice treated with or without DHT, identified a fast-type muscle-specific novel splicing variant of Myosin light-chain kinase 4 (Mylk4) as a target of AR in skeletal muscles. Mylk4 knockout mice exhibited decreased maximum isometric torque of plantar flexion and passive stiffness of myofibers due to reduced phosphorylation of Myomesin 1 protein. This study suggests that androgen-induced skeletal muscle strength is mediated with Mylk4 and Myomesin 1 axis.","1859":"Grid cells provide a metric representation of self-location. They are organized into modules, showing discretized scales of grid spacing, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. In this modeling study, we propose that the hexagonal lattice of pyramidal cell patches may underlie the discretization of grid spacing and orientation. In the continuous attractor network composed of interneurons, stellate and pyramidal cells, the hexagonal lattice of bump attractors is specifically aligned to the patch lattice under 22 conditions determined by the geometry of the patch lattice, while pyramidal cells exhibit synchrony to diverse extents. Given the bump attractor lattice in each module originates from those 22 scenarios, the experimental data on the grid spacing ratio and orientation difference between modules can be reproduced. This work recapitulates the patterns of grid spacing versus orientation in individual animals and reveals the correlation between microstructures and firing fields, providing a systems-level mechanism for grid modularity.","1860":null,"1861":"Single-cell sequencing of environmental microorganisms is an essential component of the microbial ecology toolkit. However, large-scale targeted single-cell sequencing for the whole-genome recovery of uncultivated eukaryotes is lagging. The key challenges are low abundance in environmental communities, large complex genomes, and cell walls that are difficult to break. We describe a pipeline composed of state-of-the art single-cell genomics tools and protocols optimized for poorly studied and uncultivated eukaryotic microorganisms that are found at low abundance. This pipeline consists of seven distinct steps, beginning with sample collection and ending with genome annotation, each equipped with quality review steps to ensure high genome quality at low cost. We tested and evaluated each step on environmental samples and cultures of early-diverging lineages of fungi and Chromista\/SAR. We show that genomes produced using this pipeline are almost as good as complete reference genomes for functional and comparative genomics for environmental microbial eukaryotes.","1862":null,"1863":"Nature-inspired superamphiphilic surfaces have drawn tremendous attention owing to its extreme liquid-loving behaviors. Herein, a micro-organized nano-channel (Mo-Na) superamphiphilic anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) surface with long-lasting superamphiphilic property is prepared by a facile one-step anodization method with controllable temperature change. Analysis of dynamic wetting behaviors on superamphiphilic Mo-Na AAO surfaces for various liquids reveals that the spreading factor is in negative correlation with the surface tension and liquid polarity. Detailed observation of the three-phase contact line shows a micro-scale capillary film on superamphiphilic Mo-Na AAO surfaces, which results from the horizontal component of the capillary force. Taking advantage of the superamphiphilic property, water droplets can spread completely on these Mo-Na AAO surfaces within a short time, which can be applied for efficient heat dissipation. Moreover, the unique AAO surface with Mo-Na structures also offers an effective template for future efforts in AAO-based composite devices.","1864":null,"1865":"RASopathies represent a family of mostly autosomal dominant diseases that are caused by missense variants in the rat sarcoma viral oncogene\/mitogen activated protein kinase (RAS\/MAPK) pathway including KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, RAF1, and SHP2. These variants are associated with overlapping but distinct phenotypes that affect the heart, craniofacial, skeletal, lymphatic, and nervous systems. Here, we report an analysis of 13 Drosophila transgenic lines, each expressing a different human RASopathy isoform. Similar to their human counterparts, each Drosophila line displayed common aspects but also important differences including distinct signaling pathways such as the Hippo and SAPK\/JNK signaling networks. We identified multiple classes of clinically relevant drugs-including statins and histone deacetylase inhibitors-that improved viability across most RASopathy lines; in contrast, several canonical RAS pathway inhibitors proved less broadly effective. Overall, our study compares and contrasts a large number of RASopathy-associated variants including their therapeutic responses.","1866":"The collective motion of swarms depends on adaptations at the individual level. We explored these and their effects on swarm formation and maintenance in locusts. The walking kinematics of individual insects were monitored under laboratory settings, before, as well as during collective motion in a group, and again after separation from the group. It was found that taking part in collective motion induced in the individual unique behavioral kinematics, suggesting the existence of a distinct behavioral mode that we term a \"collective-motion-state.\" This state, characterized by behavioral adaptation to the social context, is long lasting, not induced by crowding per se, but only by experiencing collective motion. Utilizing computational models, we show that this adaptability increases the robustness of the swarm. Overall, our findings suggest that collective motion is not only an emergent property of the group but also depends on a behavioral mode, rooted in endogenous mechanisms of the individual.","1867":null,"1868":"It is increasingly apparent that bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria and more commonly referred to as simply phages, have tropisms outside their bacterial hosts. Using live tissue culture cell imaging, we demonstrate that cell type, phage size, and morphology play a major role in phage internalization. Uptake was validated under physiological conditions using a microfluidic device. Phages adhered to mammalian tissues, with adherent phages being subsequently internalized by macropinocytosis, with functional phages accumulating intracellularly. We incorporated these results into a pharmacokinetic model demonstrating the potential impact of phage accumulation by cell layers, which represents a potential sink for circulating phages in the body. During phage therapy, high doses of phages are directly administered to a patient in order to treat a bacterial infection, thereby facilitating broad interactions between phages and mammalian cells. Understanding these interactions will have important implications on innate immune responses, phage pharmacokinetics, and the efficacy of phage therapy.","1869":"It has been shown that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors hold considerable therapeutic potentials for treating neurodegeneration-related diseases including Parkinson disease (PD). Here, we synthesized an HDAC inhibitor named as HGC and examined its neuroprotective roles in PD models. Our results showed that HGC protects dopaminergic neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced insults. Furthermore, in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD model mice, HGC application rectifies behavioral defects, improves tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the midbrain, and maintains mitochondrial integrity and functions. Mechanistically, mass spectrometry data revealed that HGC stimulates acetylation modification at lysine 28 of NDUFV1. Inhibition of HDAC6 by HGC is responsible for this acetylation modification. Functional tests showed that, as well as HGC, NDUFV1 exhibits beneficial roles against MPP+ injuries. Moreover, knockdown of NDUFV1 abolishes the neuroprotective roles of HGC. Taken together, our data indicate that HGC has a great therapeutic potential for treating PD and NDUFV1 might be a target for developing drugs against PD.","1870":null,"1871":"Goal of sustainable carbon neutral economy can be achieved by designing an efficient CO2 reduction system to generate biofuels, in particular, by mimicking the mechanism of natural photosynthesis using semiconducting nanomaterials interfaced with electroactive bacteria (EAB) in a photosynthetic microbial electrosynthesis (PMES) system. This review paper presents an overview of the recent advancements in the biohybrid photoanode and photocathode materials. We discuss the reaction mechanism observed at photoanode and photocathode to enhance our understanding on the solar driven MES. We extend the discussion by showcasing the potential activity of EABs toward high selectivity and production rates for desirable products by manipulating their genomic sequence. Additionally, the critical challenges associated in scaling up the PMES system including the strategies for diminution of reactive oxygen species, low solubility of CO2 in the typical electrolytes, low selectivity of product species are presented along with the suggestions of alternative strategies to achieve economically viable generation of (bio)commodities.","1872":null,"1873":null,"1874":"Noncoding DNA sequences occupy more than 98% of the human genome; however, few cancer noncoding drivers have been identified compared with cancer coding drivers, probably because cancer noncoding drivers have a distinct mutation pattern due to the distinct function of noncoding DNA. Here we performed pan-cancer whole genome mutation analysis to screen for functional noncoding mutations that influence protein factor binding. Recurrent mutations were identified in the promoter of CDC20 gene. These CDC20 promoter hotspot mutations disrupt the binding of ELK4 transcription repressor, lead to the up-regulation of CDC20 transcription. Physiologically ELK4 binds to the unmutated hotspot sites and is involved in DNA damage-induced CDC20 transcriptional repression. Overall, our study not only identifies a detailed mechanism for CDC20 gene deregulation in human cancers but also finds functional noncoding genetic alterations, with implications for the further development of function-based noncoding driver discovery pipelines.","1875":"VLGR1 (very large G protein-coupled receptor-1) is by far the largest adhesion G protein-coupled receptor in humans. Homozygous pathologic variants of VLGR1 cause hereditary deaf blindness in Usher syndrome 2C and haploinsufficiency of VLGR1 is associated with epilepsy. However, its molecular function remains elusive. Herein, we used affinity proteomics to identify many components of focal adhesions (FAs) in the VLGR1 interactome. VLGR1 is localized in FAs and assembles in FA protein complexes in situ. Depletion or loss of VLGR1 decreases the number and length of FAs in hTERT-RPE1 cells and in astrocytes of Vlgr1 mutant mice. VLGR1 depletion reduces cell spread and migration kinetics as well as the response to mechanical stretch characterizing VLGR1 as a metabotropic mechanosensor in FAs. Our data reveal a critical role of VLGR1 in the FA function and enlighten potential pathomechanisms in diseases related to VLGR1.","1876":null,"1877":"In the mammalian cerebral neocortex, different regions have different cytoarchitecture, neuronal birthdates, and functions. In most regions, neuronal migratory profiles are speculated similar based on observations using thymidine analogs. Few reports have investigated regional migratory differences from mitosis at the ventricular surface. In this study, we applied FlashTag technology, in which dyes are injected intraventricularly, to describe migratory profiles. We revealed a mediolateral regional difference in the migratory profiles of neurons that is dependent on developmental stage; for example, neurons labeled at embryonic day 12.5-15.5 reached their destination earlier dorsomedially than dorsolaterally, even where there were underlying ventricular surfaces, reflecting sojourning below the subplate. This difference was hardly recapitulated by thymidine analogs, which visualize neurogenic gradients, suggesting a biological significance different from the neurogenic gradient. These observations advance our understanding of cortical development and the power of FlashTag in studying migration and are thus resources for future neurodevelopmental studies.","1878":"DNA methyl transferase-1 or DNMT1 maintains DNA methylation in the genome and is important for regulating gene expression in cells. Aberrant changes in DNMT1 activity and DNA methylation are commonly observed in cancers and many other diseases. Recently, a number of long intergenic non-protein-coding RNAs or lincRNAs have been shown to play a role in regulating DNMT1 activity. CCDC26 is a nuclear lincRNA that is frequently mutated in cancers and is a hotbed for disease-associated single nucleotide changes. However, the functional mechanism of CCDC26 is not understood. Here, we show that this lincRNA is concentrated on the nuclear periphery. Strikingly, in the absence of CCDC26 lincRNA, DNMT1 is mis-located in the cytoplasm, and the genomic DNA is significantly hypomethylated. This is accompanied by double-stranded DNA breaks and increased cell death. These results point to a previously unrecognized mechanism of lincRNA-mediated subcellular localization of DNMT1 and regulation of DNA methylation.","1879":"With the advent of deep generative models in computational chemistry, in-silico drug design is undergoing an unprecedented transformation. Although deep learning approaches have shown potential in generating compounds with desired chemical properties, they disregard the cellular environment of target diseases. Bridging systems biology and drug design, we present a reinforcement learning method for de novo molecular design from gene expression profiles. We construct a hybrid Variational Autoencoder that tailors molecules to target-specific transcriptomic profiles, using an anticancer drug sensitivity prediction model (PaccMann) as reward function. Without incorporating information about anticancer drugs, the molecule generation is biased toward compounds with high predicted efficacy against cell lines or cancer types. The generation can be further refined by subsidiary constraints such as toxicity. Our cancer-type-specific candidate drugs are similar to cancer drugs in drug-likeness, synthesizability, and solubility and frequently exhibit the highest structural similarity to compounds with known efficacy against these cancer types.","1880":"Cell-cell communication is necessary for cellular immune response. Hemichannel closure disrupts communication between intracellular and extracellular environments during polydnavirus-induced immunosuppression in invertebrates. However, the effects of hemichannel closure on cellular immune response are unclear. Here, we examined apoptotic body formation triggered by hemichannel closure in hemocytes of Spodoptera litura infected with bracovirus from the parasitic wasp, Microplitis bicoloratus. We showed that Microplitis bicoloratus bracovirus (MbBV) induced apoptotic cell disassembly, accompanied by hemichannel closure. Hemocyte apoptotic body formation was caused by the dysregulation of the innexins (Inxs), Inx1, Inx2, Inx3, and Inx4, during the MbBV-mediated inhibition of pI3K\/AKT signaling and activation of caspase-3, which cleaved gap junction Inx proteins. Our results showed that hemichannel opening or closure in response to various stimuli, which induces the modulation of Inx levels, could inhibit or activate apoptotic body formation, respectively. Therefore, the \"hemichannel open and close\" model may regulate the cellular immune response.","1881":"Larger easily visible animals and plants are negatively affected by agrochemicals used for intensive food production, but we do not understand the general spatial and temporal effects of agrochemicals on the multitudes of bacteria, fungi, and small invertebrate animals that underpin ecosystem productivity. We sequenced the 16S, ITS2, and COI DNA barcode regions from 648 New Zealand vineyard soil samples managed under either conventional or low-agrochemical-input conservation approaches across two regions and three seasons in 1 year and discovered at least 170,000 phylotypes (taxa) with &gt;97% genetic identity. Management approach correlated with a significant 2%-10% difference in the abundances of phylotypes that differed over regions and seasons. Although the data show that agrochemicals do not have a large effect on soil biodiversity on average, the important finding is that the magnitude of impact differs between taxa types and locations, and some taxa most affected also influence the quality of agricultural produce.","1882":"","1883":"Nanotwin structures in materials engender fascinating exotic properties. However, twinning usually alter the crystal orientation, resulting in random orientation and limited performances. Here, we report a well-aligned rutile TiO2 nanotwin film with superior preferential orientation than its isostructural substrate. By means of the synchrotron X-ray Laue nanodiffraction technique, the crystal orientation, twin boundaries, and deviatoric stresses of the film were quantitatively imaged at unprecedented spatial resolution to unravel the underlying mechanism of this anomalous alignment. Massive {101}-type rutile nanotwins were observed, and a crystallographic relationship of the heteroepitaxy was proposed. The rapid twinning and twin-controlled heteroepitaxy are responsible for the texture improvement. This work would open up opportunities for rational design of better twin-based functional materials, and implies the powerful capabilities of X-ray nanodiffraction technique for multidisciplinary applications.","1884":null,"1885":"Epithelia form protective permeability barriers that selectively allow the exchange of material while maintaining tissue integrity under extreme mechanical, chemical, and bacterial loads. Here, we report in the Drosophila follicular epithelium a developmentally regulated and evolutionarily conserved process \"patency\", wherein a breach is created in the epithelium at tricellular contacts during mid-vitellogenesis. In Drosophila, patency exhibits a strict temporal range potentially delimited by the transcription factor Tramtrack69 and a spatial pattern influenced by the dorsal-anterior signals of the follicular epithelium. Crucial for growth and lipid uptake by the oocyte, patency is also exploited by endosymbionts such as Spiroplasma pulsonii. Our findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved and developmentally regulated non-typical epithelial function in a classic model system.","1886":"As a new sustainable energy source, ubiquitous mechanical energy has received great attention and was successfully harvested by different types of nanogenerators. Among them, biocompatible nanogenerators are of particular interests due to their potential for biomedical applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the recent achievements in the fabrication and application of biocompatible nanogenerators. The development process and working mechanism of nanogenerators are introduced. Different biocompatible materials for energy harvesting, such as amino acids, peptide, silk protein, and cellulose, are discussed and compared. We then discuss different applications of biocompatible nanogenerators. We conclude with the challenges and potential research directions in this emerging field.","1887":null,"1888":null,"1889":null,"1890":null,"1891":"Optical clearing has emerged as a powerful tool for volume imaging. Although volume imaging with immunostaining have been successful in many protocols, yet obtaining homogeneously stained thick samples remains challenging. Here, we propose a method for label-free imaging of brain slices by enhancing the regional heterogeneity of the optical properties using the tissue clearing principle. We used FxClear, a method for delipidation of brain tissue, to retain a larger proportion of lipids at the white matter (WM). Furthermore, the embedding media affected the contrasts for the lipid-rich or extracellular matrix-rich areas, depending on their chemical properties. Thus, we tailored clearing conditions for the enhancement of the refractive indices (RIs) differences between gray and WM, or several pathological features. RI differences can be imaged using conventional light microscopy or optical coherence tomography. We propose that our protocol is simple, reliable, and flexible for label-free imaging, easily implementable to routine histology laboratory.","1892":"Ebola virus (EBOV) is responsible for outbreaks with case fatality rates of up to 90% and for an epidemic in West Africa with more than ten thousand deaths. EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) is the only viral surface protein and is responsible for viral entry into cells. Here, by employing pseudotyped EBOV-GP viral particles, we uncover a critical role for sphingolipids in inhibiting viral entry. Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). The administration of the SphK1 activator, K6PC-5, or S1P, or the overexpression of SphK1 consistently exhibited striking inhibitory effects in EBOV-GP-driven entry in diverse cell lines. Finally, K6PC-5 markedly reduced the EBOV titer in infected cells and the de novo production of viral proteins. These data present K6PC-5 as an efficient tool to inhibit EBOV infection in endothelial cells and suggest further studies to evaluate its systemic effects.","1893":null,"1894":"Autonomous experimentation (AE) accelerates research by combining automation and machine learning to perform experiments intelligently and rapidly in a sequential fashion. While AE systems are most needed to study properties that cannot be predicted analytically or computationally, even imperfect predictions can in principle be useful. Here, we investigate whether imperfect data from simulation can accelerate AE using a case study on the mechanics of additively manufactured structures. Initially, we study resilience, a property that is well-predicted by finite element analysis (FEA), and find that FEA can be used to build a Bayesian prior and experimental data can be integrated using discrepancy modeling to reduce the number of needed experiments ten-fold. Next, we study toughness, a property not well-predicted by FEA and find that FEA can still improve learning by transforming experimental data and guiding experiment selection. These results highlight multiple ways that simulation can improve AE through transfer learning.","1895":"Viruses interact extensively with the host molecular machinery, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Bacteriophage T7 recruits the small protein thioredoxin of the Escherichia coli host as an essential processivity factor for the viral DNA polymerase. We challenged the phage to propagate in a host in which thioredoxin had been extensively modified to hamper its recruitment. The virus adapted to the engineered host without losing the capability to propagate in the original host, but no genetic mutations were fixed in the thioredoxin binding domain of the viral DNA polymerase. Virus adaptation correlated with mutations in the viral RNA polymerase, supporting that promiscuous thioredoxin recruitment was enabled by phenotypic mutations caused by transcription errors. These results point to a mechanism of virus adaptation that may play a role in cross-species transmission. We propose that phenotypic mutations may generally contribute to the capability of viruses to evade antiviral strategies.","1896":"Seasonal disease outbreaks are perennial features of human infectious disease but the factors generating these patterns are unclear. Here we investigate seasonal and daytime variability in multiple immune parameters in 329,261 participants in UK Biobank and test for associations with a wide range of environmental and lifestyle factors, including changes in day length, outdoor temperature and vitamin D at the time the blood sample was collected. Seasonal patterns were evident in lymphocyte and neutrophil counts, and C-reactive protein CRP, but not monocytes, and these were independent of lifestyle, demographic, and environmental factors. All the immune parameters assessed demonstrated significant daytime variation that was independent of confounding factors. At a population level, human immune parameters vary across season and across time of day, independent of multiple confounding factors. Both season and time of day are fundamental dimensions of immune function that should be considered in all studies of immuno-prophylaxis and disease transmission.","1897":null,"1898":null,"1899":"Gpr52 is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor of unknown physiological function. We found that Gpr52-deficient (Gpr52 -\/- ) mice exhibit leanness associated with reduced liver weight, decreased hepatic de novo lipogenesis, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Treatment of the hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells with c11, the synthetic GPR52 agonist, increased fatty acid biosynthesis, and GPR52 knockdown (KD) abolished the lipogenic action of c11. In addition, c11 induced the expressions of lipogenic enzymes (SCD1 and ELOVL6), whereas these inductions were attenuated by GPR52-KD. In contrast, cholesterol biosynthesis was not increased by c11, but its basal level was significantly suppressed by GPR52-KD. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced increase in hepatic expression of Pparg2 and its targets (Scd1 and Elovl6) was absent in Gpr52 -\/- mice with alleviated hepatosteatosis. Our present study showed that hepatic GPR52 promotes the biosynthesis of fatty acid and cholesterol in a ligand-dependent and a constitutive manner, respectively, and Gpr52 participates in HFD-induced fatty acid synthesis in liver.","1900":"Ectodomain shedding is a proteolytic process that regulates the levels and functions of membrane proteins. Dysregulated shedding is linked to severe diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease. However, the exact cleavage sites of shedding substrates remain largely unknown. Here, we explore the landscape of ectodomain shedding by generating large-scale, cell-type-specific maps of shedding cleavage sites. By means of N- and C-terminal peptide enrichment and quantitative mass spectrometry, we quantified protein termini in the culture media of 10 human cell lines and identified 489 cleavage sites on 163 membrane proteins whose proteolytic terminal fragments are downregulated in the presence of a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor. A major fraction of the presented cleavage sites was identified in a cell-type-specific manner and mapped onto receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and protein kinases and phosphatases. We confidently identified 86 cleavage sites as metalloprotease substrates by means of knowledge-based scoring.","1901":"The fundamental morphology of the endometrial glands is not sufficiently understood by 2D observation because these glands have complicated winding and branching patterns. To construct a large picture of the endometrial gland structure, we performed tissue-clearing-based 3D imaging of human uterine endometrial tissue. Our 3D immunohistochemistry and layer analyses revealed that the endometrial glands form a plexus network in the stratum basalis and expand horizontally along the muscular layer, similar to the rhizome of grass. We then extended our method to assess the 3D morphology of tissue affected by adenomyosis, a representative \"endometrium-related disease,\" and observed its 3D morphological features, including the direct invasion of endometrial glands into the myometrium and an ant colony-like network of ectopic endometrial glands within the myometrium. Thus, further understanding of the morphology of the human endometrium based on 3D analysis will lead to the identification of the pathogenesis of endometrium-related diseases.","1902":null,"1903":"A long-standing constraint on organoid culture is the need to add exogenous substances to provide hydrogel matrix, which limits the study of fully human or fully native organoids. This paper introduces an approach to culture reconstituted mammary organoids without the impediment of exogenous matrix. We enclose organoids in nanoliter-scale, topologically enclosed, fluid compartments surrounded by agar. Organoids cultured in these \"microcontainers\" appear to secrete enough extracellular matrix to yield a self-sufficient microenvironment without exogenous supplements. In microcontainers, mammary organoids exhibit contractility and a high-level, physiological, myoepithelial (MEP) behavior that has not been previously reported in reconstituted organoids. The presence of contractility suggests that microcontainers elicit MEP functional differentiation, an important milestone. Microcontainers yield thousands of substantially identical and individually trackable organoids within a single culture vessel, enabling longitudinal studies and statistically powerful experiments, such as the evaluation of small effect sizes. Microcontainers open new doors for researchers who rely on organoid models.","1904":"Automated vehicles (AVs) have made huge strides toward large-scale deployment. Despite this progress, AVs continue to make mistakes, some resulting in death. Although some mistakes are avoidable, others are hard to avoid even by highly skilled drivers. As these mistakes continue to shape attitudes toward AVs, we need to understand whether people differentiate between them. We ask the following two questions. When an AV makes a mistake, does the perceived difficulty or novelty of the situation predict blame attributed to it? How does that blame attribution compare to a human driving a car? Through two studies, we find that the amount of blame people attribute to AVs and human drivers is sensitive to situation difficulty. However, while some situations could be more difficult for AVs and others for human drivers, people blamed AVs more, regardless. Our results provide novel insights in understanding psychological barriers influencing the public's view of AVs.","1905":null,"1906":null,"1907":null,"1908":"Aging is associated with impairments in the circadian rhythms, and with energy deregulation that affects multiple metabolic pathways. The goal of this study is to unravel the complex interactions among aging, metabolism, and the circadian clock. We seek to identify key factors that inform the liver circadian clock of cellular energy status and to reveal the mechanisms by which variations in food intake may disrupt the clock. To address these questions, we develop a comprehensive mathematical model that represents the circadian pathway in the mouse liver, together with the insulin\/IGF-1 pathway, mTORC1, AMPK, NAD+, and the NAD+ -consuming factor SIRT1. The model is age-specific and can simulate the liver of a young mouse or an aged mouse. Simulation results suggest that the reduced NAD+ and SIRT1 bioavailability may explain the shortened circadian period in aged rodents. Importantly, the model identifies the dosing schedules for maximizing the efficacy of anti-aging medications.","1909":null,"1910":"Right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) occurs in high pressure afterload, e.g., tetralogy of Fallot\/pulmonary stenosis (TOF\/PS). Such RVH is associated with alterations in energy metabolism, neurohormonal and epigenetic dysregulation (e.g., microRNA), and fetal gene reprogramming in animal models. However, comprehensive expression profiling of competing endogenous RNA in human RVH has not been performed. Here, we unravel several previously unknown circular, long non-coding, and microRNAs, predicted to regulate expression of genes specific to human RVH in the non-failing heart (TOF\/PS). These genes are significantly overrepresented in pathways related to regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism (SIK1, FABP4), cell surface interactions (THBS2, FN1), apoptosis (PIK3IP1, SIK1), extracellular matrix composition (CTGF, IGF1), and other biological events. This is the first unbiased RNA sequencing study of human compensated RVH encompassing coding and non-coding RNA expression and predicted sponging of miRNAs by non-coding RNAs. These findings advance our understanding of adaptive RVH and highlight future therapeutic targets.","1911":null,"1912":null,"1913":null,"1914":"Today's increased availability of large amounts of human behavioral data and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are contributing to a growing reliance on algorithms to make consequential decisions for humans, including those related to access to credit or medical treatments, hiring, etc. Algorithmic decision-making processes might lead to more objective decisions than those made by humans who may be influenced by prejudice, conflicts of interest, or fatigue. However, algorithmic decision-making has been criticized for its potential to lead to privacy invasion, information asymmetry, opacity, and discrimination. In this paper, we describe available technical solutions in three large areas that we consider to be of critical importance to achieve a human-centric AI: (1) privacy and data ownership; (2) accountability and transparency; and (3) fairness. We also highlight the criticality and urgency to engage multi-disciplinary teams of researchers, practitioners, policy makers, and citizens to co-develop and evaluate in the real-world algorithmic decision-making processes designed to maximize fairness, accountability, and transparency while respecting privacy.","1915":"The composition of the secretome depends on the combined action of cargo receptors that facilitate protein transport and sequential checkpoints that restrict it to native conformers. Acting after endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident chaperones, ERp44 retrieves its clients from downstream compartments. To guarantee efficient quality control, ERp44 should exit the ER as rapidly as its clients, or more. Here, we show that appending ERp44 to different cargo proteins increases their secretion rates. ERp44 binds the cargo receptor ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)-53 in the ER to negotiate preferential loading into COPII vesicles. Silencing ERGIC-53, or competing for its COPII binding with 4-phenylbutyrate, causes secretion of Prdx4, an enzyme that relies on ERp44 for intracellular localization. In more acidic, zinc-rich downstream compartments, ERGIC-53 releases its clients and ERp44, which can bind and retrieve non-native conformers via KDEL receptors. By coupling the transport of cargoes and inspector proteins, cells ensure efficiency and fidelity of secretion.","1916":null,"1917":"Balance between cell proliferation and elimination is critical in handling threats both exogenous and of internal dysfunction. Recent work has implicated a conserved but poorly understood endoglycosidase heparanase (HPSE) in the restriction of innate defense responses, yet biochemical mediators of these key functions remained unclear. Here, an unbiased immunopurification proteomics strategy is employed to identify and rank uncharacterized interactions between HPSE and mediators of canonical signaling pathways linking cell cycle and stress responses. We demonstrate with models of genotoxic stress including herpes simplex virus infection and chemotherapeutic treatment that HPSE dampens innate responses to double-stranded DNA breakage by interfering with signal transduction between initial sensors and downstream mediators. Given the long-standing recognition of HPSE in driving late-stage inflammatory disease exemplified by tissue destruction and cancer metastasis, modulation of this protein with control over the DNA damage response imparts a unique strategy in the development of unconventional multivalent therapy.","1918":"Genome-wide association studies for calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) previously reported strong signal for noncoding variants at 1p21.2. Previous study using Mendelian randomization suggested that the locus controls the expression of PALMD encoding Palmdelphin (PALMD). However, the molecular regulation at the locus and the impact of PALMD on the biology of the aortic valve is presently unknown. 3D genetic mapping and CRISPR activation identified rs6702619 as being located in a distant-acting enhancer, which controls the expression of PALMD. DNA-binding assay showed that the risk variant modified the DNA shape, which prevented the recruitment of NFATC2 and lowered the expression of PALMD. In co-expression network analysis, a module encompassing PALMD was enriched in actin-based process. Mass spectrometry and functional assessment showed that PALMD is a regulator of actin polymerization. In turn, lower level of PALMD promoted the activation of myocardin-related transcription factor and fibrosis, a key pathobiological process underpinning CAVS.","1919":"The long-standing performance-stability contradiction issue of high energy density materials (HEDMs) is of extremely complex and multi-parameter nature. Herein, machine learning was employed to handle 28 feature descriptors and 5 properties of detonation and stability of 153 HEDMs, wherein all 21,648 data used were obtained through high-throughput crystal-level quantum mechanics calculations on supercomputers. Among five models, namely, extreme gradient boosting regression tree (XGBoost), adaptive boosting, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and kernel ridge regression, were respectively trained and evaluated by stratified sampling and 5-fold cross-validation method. Among them, XGBoost model produced the best scoring metrics in predicting the detonation velocity, detonation pressure, heat of explosion, decomposition temperature, and lattice energy of HEDMs, and XGBoost predictions agreed best with the 1,383 experimental data collected from massive literatures. Feature importance analysis was conducted to obtain data-driven insight into the causality of the performance-stability contradiction and delivered the optimal range of key features for more efficient rational design of advanced HEDMs.","1920":"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive type of brain tumor with poor survival rate. Temozolomide (TMZ) is used as standard chemotherapy to treat GBM, but a large number of patients either respond poorly and\/or develop resistance after long-term use, emphasizing the need to develop potent drugs with novel mechanisms of action. Here, using high-throughput compound screening (HTS), we found that azathioprine, an immunosuppressant, is a promising therapeutic agent to treat TMZ-resistant GBM. Through integrative genome-wide analysis and global proteomic analysis, we found that elevated lipid metabolism likely due to hyperactive EGFR\/AKT\/SREBP-1 signaling was inhibited by azathioprine. Azathioprine also promoted ER stress-induced apoptosis. Analysis of orthotopic xenograft models injected with patient-derived GBM cells revealed reduced tumor volume and increased apoptosis after azathioprine and TMZ co-treatment. These data indicate that azathioprine could be a powerful therapeutic option for TMZ-resistant GBM patients.","1921":"Material depletion over reliance of linear economies and environmental pollution may be resolved by applying the principles and practices of anthropogenic circularity science. Here we systematically review the emergence of anthropogenic circularity science in the interdisciplinary development of green chemistry, supply chain, and industrial ecology at different scales. The first, second, and third laws of circularity chemistry are proposed as forming the basic principles of circularity science. To close the loop on critical materials, these three basic principles have been exemplified in the anthropogenic circularity practices. We highlight the spatial distribution of critical metal, waste generation, and recycling rate. Future opportunities and challenges for a circular economy and urban mining will predominate in anthropogenic circularity. Therefore, anthropogenic circularity science will play an increasing role in enabling a smooth transition to a circular society.","1922":null,"1923":null,"1924":null,"1925":null,"1926":"Functional telomeres in yeast lacking telomerase can be restored by rare Rad51- or Rad59-dependent recombination events that lead to type I and type II survivors, respectively. We previously proposed that polySUMOylation of proteins and the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5-Slx8 are key factors in type II recombination. Here, we show that SUMOylation of Rad52 favors the formation of type I survivors. Conversely, preventing Rad52 SUMOylation partially bypasses the requirement of Slx5-Slx8 for type II recombination. We further report that SUMO-dependent proteasomal degradation favors type II recombination. Finally, inactivation of Rad59, but not Rad51, impairs the relocation of eroded telomeres to the Nuclear Pore complexes (NPCs). We propose that Rad59 cooperates with non-SUMOylated Rad52 to promote type II recombination at NPCs, resulting in the emergence of more robust survivors akin to ALT cancer cells. Finally, neither Rad59 nor Rad51 is required by itself for the survival of established type II survivors.","1927":"Renewable CO2 electrosynthesis is a potentially promising tool to utilize unwanted greenhouse gas. The greatest barrier to its adoption is rendering the production of CO2-derived chemicals cost-competitive, such that they have higher net value than their fossil-derived equivalents. Among the commodities that have been made using CO2, H2O, and electricity, CH4 is one of the simplest and most researched products. Technoeconomic studies of CO2 methanation make it clear that its high-value applications are limited without significant subsidy on Earth, where it competes with low-cost natural gas. In space, however, CO2 methanation via the Sabatier reaction is already used on the International Space Station to recycle atomic oxygen, and propulsion systems employing cryogenic liquid methane are in development for reusable rocket engines. Comparative analysis of power-to-gas using either CO2 electrosynthesis or the Sabatier reaction from an aerospace perspective identifies research priorities and parameters for deployment. Given its atmospheric CO2 concentration over 95%, Mars may present future opportunities for technology that could also help overcome our climate challenges on Earth.","1928":null,"1929":"Patterns of gene expressions play a key role in determining cell state. Although correlations in gene expressions have been well documented, most of the current methods treat them as independent variables. One way to take into account gene correlations is to find a low-dimensional curved geometry that describes variation in the data. Here we develop such a method and find that gene expression across multiple cell types exhibits a low-dimensional hyperbolic structure. When more genes are taken into account, hyperbolic effects become stronger but representation remains low dimensional. The size of the hyperbolic map, which indicates the hierarchical depth of the data, was the largest for human cells, the smallest for mouse embryonic cells, and intermediate in differentiated cells from different mouse organs. We also describe how hyperbolic metric can be incorporated into the t-SNE method to improve visualizations compared with leading methods.","1930":null,"1931":null,"1932":null,"1933":"In this study, six bacterial isolates with variable GC, including Escherichia coli as mesophilic reference strain, were selected to compare hybrid assembly strategies based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) of short reads, single-tube long-fragment reads (stLFR) sequencing, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms. We obtained the complete genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler based on the NGS and ONT reads; others were de novo assembled using NGS, stLFR, and ONT reads by using different strategies. The contiguity, accuracy, completeness, sequencing costs, and DNA material requirements of the investigated strategies were compared systematically. Although all sequencing data could be assembled into accurate whole-genome sequences, the stLFR sequencing data yield a scaffold with more contiguity with more completeness of gene function than NGS sequencing assemblies. Our research provides a low-cost chromosome-level genome assembly strategy for large-scale sequencing of extremophile genomes with different GC contents.","1934":null,"1935":"Systemic metabolic homeostasis is regulated by inter-organ metabolic cycles involving multiple organs. Obesity impairs inter-organ metabolic cycles, resulting in metabolic diseases. The systemic landscape of dysregulated inter-organ metabolic cycles in obesity has yet to be explored. Here, we measured the transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome in the liver and skeletal muscle and the metabolome in blood of fasted wild-type and leptin-deficient obese (ob\/ob) mice, identifying components with differential abundance and differential regulation in ob\/ob mice. By constructing and evaluating the trans-omic network controlling the differences in metabolic reactions between fasted wild-type and ob\/ob mice, we provided potential mechanisms of the obesity-associated dysfunctions of metabolic cycles between liver and skeletal muscle involving glucose-alanine, glucose-lactate, and ketone bodies. Our study revealed obesity-associated systemic pathological mechanisms of dysfunction of inter-organ metabolic cycles.","1936":null,"1937":"Autosomal recessive mutations in G6PC3 cause isolated and syndromic congenital neutropenia which includes congenital heart disease and atypical inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a highly consanguineous pedigree with novel mutations in G6PC3 and MPL, we performed comprehensive multi-omics analyses. Structural analysis of variant G6PC3 and MPL proteins suggests a damaging effect. A distinct molecular cytokine profile (cytokinome) in the affected proband with IBD was detected. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of the G6PC3-deficient plasma samples identified 460 distinct proteins including 75 upregulated and 73 downregulated proteins. Specifically, the transcription factor GATA4 and LST1 were downregulated while platelet factor 4 (PF4) was upregulated. GATA4 and PF4 have been linked to congenital heart disease and IBD respectively, while LST1 may have perturbed a variety of essential cell functions as it is required for normal cell-cell communication. Together, these studies provide potentially novel insights into the pathogenesis of syndromic congenital G6PC3 deficiency.","1938":"In this paper, we report a finding that substrate affects the adhesion of charged super-repellent surfaces. Water droplet impacting on a super-repellent surface produces surface charge, whose expression depends on the substrate. The charged super-repellent surface is sticky to droplets for a suspended substrate made of dielectric materials, while it has low adhesion for a conducting substrate or stage attached at the bottom because of electrostatic induction. Theoretical analysis and simulation are conducted to elucidate the mechanism of substrate effect on surface adhesion. Finally, we develop a new approach to reversibly tune the adhesion of super-repellent surface by combining surface-charge-induced adhesion increase and electrostatic-induction-regulated express of net surface charge. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate that droplet sorting and manipulations can be realized by using this controllable surface adhesion tuning approach, which has potential applications in advanced lab-on-a-drop platform.","1939":"In contrast to the conventional pulsatile neuromodulation that excites neurons, galvanic or direct current stimulation can excite, inhibit, or sensitize neurons. The vestibular system presents an excellent system for studying galvanic neural interface due to the spontaneously firing afferent activity that needs to be either suppressed or excited to convey head motion sensation. We determine the cellular mechanisms underlying the beneficial properties of galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) by creating a computational model of the vestibular end organ that elicits all experimentally observed response characteristics to GVS simultaneously. When GVS was modeled to affect the axon alone, the complete experimental data could not be replicated. We found that if GVS affects hair cell vesicle release and axonal excitability simultaneously, our modeling results matched all experimental observations. We conclude that contrary to the conventional belief that GVS affects only axons, the hair cells are likely also affected by this stimulation paradigm.","1940":"Soiling is the process whereby dirt, dust, and organic\/inorganic contaminants deposit on the surface of a photovoltaic (PV) module. It causes significant economic losses and can have a substantial impact on the expansion of photovoltaic technologies for energy generation. The first step to address soiling adequately is monitoring, as soiling mitigation has to be tailored to the specific conditions of each PV system and no universally valid strategy exists. The main focus of this study is to assess the current state of the art in soiling monitoring, in order to help the community better understand the needs and the challenges in this area. The potentials and the limitations of each monitoring method are discussed thoroughly in the paper, with the support of original experimental data. An estimation of the future soiling monitoring market trends is also presented, with a forecasted need for tens of thousands of new soiling monitors every year.","1941":null,"1942":null,"1943":"The established risk factors of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are advanced age, male sex, and comorbidities, but they do not fully explain the wide spectrum of disease manifestations.

We performed an in-depth genetic analysis of chromosome 21 exploiting the genome-wide association study data, including 6,406 individuals hospitalized for COVID-19 and 902,088 controls with European genetic ancestry from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. We found that five single nucleotide polymorphisms within TMPRSS2 and near MX1 gene show associations with severe COVID-19. The minor alleles of the five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) correlated with a reduced risk of developing severe COVID-19 and high level of MX1 expression in blood. Our findings demonstrate that host genetic factors can influence the different clinical presentations of COVID-19 and that MX1 could be a potential therapeutic target.","1944":null,"1945":null,"1946":"Pain is a negative affective state arising from tissue damage or inflammation. Because pain is aversive and its relief is innately rewarding, animals may learn to avoid a context in which pain is experienced and prefer one where pain relief occurs. It is generally accepted that vertebrate animals experience pain; however, there is currently inconclusive evidence that the affective component of pain occurs in any invertebrate. Here, we show that octopuses, the most neurologically complex invertebrates, exhibit cognitive and spontaneous behaviors indicative of affective pain experience. In conditioned place preference assays, octopuses avoided contexts in which pain was experienced, preferred a location in which they experienced relief from pain, and showed no conditioned preference in the absence of pain. Injection site grooming occurred in all animals receiving acetic acid injections, but this was abolished by local anesthesia. Thus, octopuses are likely to experience the affective component of pain.","1947":null,"1948":"Electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is an important energy-related process requiring alternative catalysts to expensive platinum-based ones. Although recently some advancements in carbon catalysts have been reported, there is still a lack of understanding which surface features might enhance their efficiency for ORR. Through a detailed study of oxygen adsorption on carbon molecular sieves and using inelastic neutron scattering, we demonstrated here that the extent of oxygen adsorption\/interactions with surface is an important parameter affecting ORR. It was found that both the strength of O2 physical adsorption in small pores and its specific interactions with surface ether functionalities in the proximity of pores positively influence the ORR efficiency. We have shown that ultramicropores and hydrophobic surface rich in ether-based groups and\/or electrons enhance ORR on carbon electrocatalysts and the performance parameters are similar to those measured on Pt\/C with the number of electron transfer equal to 4.","1949":"Morphine is commonly used to relieve moderate to severe pain, but repeated doses cause opioid tolerance. Here, we used ATP sensor and fiber photometry to detect prefrontal ATP level. It showed that prefrontal ATP level decreased after morphine injection and the event amplitude tended to decrease with continuous morphine exposure. Morphine had little effect on prefrontal ATP due to its tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesized that the analgesic effect of morphine might be related to ATP in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Moreover, local infusion of ATP partially antagonized morphine analgesia. Then we found that inhibiting P2X7R in the mPFC mimicked morphine analgesia. In morphine-tolerant mice, pretreatment with P2X4R or P2X7R antagonists in the mPFC enhanced analgesic effect. Our findings suggest that reduction of prefrontal purinergic signaling is necessary for the morphine analgesia, which help elucidate the mechanism of morphine analgesia and may lead to the development of new clinical treatments for neuropathic pain.","1950":null,"1951":"Lignin, the richest source of renewable aromatics on the planet, is an intriguing raw material for the construction of value-added aromatics. In the past decade, much progress has been made regarding the development of efficient lignin depolymerization methods, able to produce specific monophenol derivatives in high-enough selectivity and yields. This now serves as an excellent basis for developing powerful downstream conversion strategies toward a wide range of products, including fine chemical building blocks. The inherent structural features of lignin-derived platform chemicals undoubtedly inspire the development of novel, creative, atom-economic synthetic routes toward biologically active molecules or natural products. In this perspective we attempt to bridge the structural features of lignin-derived platform chemicals with existing synthetic strategies toward the construction of heterocycles and provide a summary of efforts for the production of natural products from aromatics that can be, in principle, obtained from lignin. Last, we comment on the latest efforts that present entire value-chains from wood to valuable pharmaceutically relevant compounds.","1952":"Transcription factors are key players in a broad range of cellular processes such as cell-fate decision. Understanding how they act to control these processes is of critical importance for therapy purposes. FLI-1 controls several hematopoietic lineage differentiation including megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis. Its aberrant expression is often observed in cancer and is associated with poor prognosis. We showed that FLI-1 interacts with the LDB1 complex, which also plays critical roles in erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. In this study, we aimed to unravel how FLI-1 and the LDB1 complex act together in murine erythroleukemia cells and in megakaryocyte. Combining omics techniques, we show that FLI-1 enables the recruitment of the LDB1 complex to regulatory sequences of megakaryocytic genes and to enhancers. We show as well for the first time that FLI-1 is able to modulate the 3D chromatin organization by promoting chromatin looping between enhancers and promoters most likely through the LDB1 complex.","1953":"Visible light photocatalysis has become a powerful tool in organic synthesis that uses photons as traceless, sustainable reagents. Most of the activities in the field focus on the development of new reactions via common photoredox cycles, but recently a number of exciting new concepts and strategies entered less charted territories. We survey approaches that enable the use of longer wavelengths and show that the wavelength and intensity of photons are import parameters that enable tuning of the reactivity of a photocatalyst to control or change the selectivity of chemical reactions. In addition, we discuss recent efforts to substitute strong reductants, such as elemental lithium and sodium, by light and technological advances in the field.","1954":null,"1955":"Emerging new concepts, such as magnetic charge dynamics in two-dimensional magnetic material, can provide novel mechanism for spin-based electrical transport at macroscopic length. In artificial spin ice of single domain elements, magnetic charge's relaxation can create an efficient electrical pathway for conduction by generating fluctuations in local magnetic field that couple with conduction electron spins. In a first demonstration, we show that the electrical conductivity is propelled by more than an order of magnitude at room temperature due to magnetic charge defects sub-picosecond relaxation in artificial magnetic honeycomb lattice. The direct evidence to the proposed electrical conduction mechanism in two-dimensional frustrated magnet points to the untapped potential for spintronic applications in this system.","1956":null,"1957":"Functional healing of tendon injuries remains a great challenge. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have received attention as pro-regenerative agents. H19 overexpression could bring tendon regenerative ability, but the mechanism is still not fully elucidated, and reliable method for delivery of long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) was demanded. We identified the downstream mechanism of H19, the activation of yes-associated protein (YAP) via the H19-PP1-YAP axis. We established tendon stem\/progenitor cells (TSPCs) stably overexpressing H19 with CRISPR-dCas9-based hnRNP A2\/B1 activation (H19-CP-TSPCs). H19-OL-sEVs (H19 \"overloading\" sEVs) could be produced effectively from H19-CP-TSPCs. Only H19-OL-sEVs were able to significantly load large amounts of H19 rather than other competitors, and the potential of H19-OL-sEVs to promote tendon healing was far better than that of other competitors. Our study established a relatively reliable method for enrichment of LncRNAs into sEVs, providing new hints for modularized sEV-based therapies, and modularized sEVs represented a potential strategy for tendon regeneration.","1958":null,"1959":"Matrin3 (MATR3) is a nuclear RNA\/DNA-binding protein that plays pleiotropic roles in gene expression regulation by directly stabilizing target RNAs and supporting the activity of transcription factors by modulating chromatin architecture. MATR3 is involved in the differentiation of neural cells, and, here, we elucidate its critical functions in regulating pluripotent circuits in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). MATR3 downregulation affects hiPSCs' differentiation potential by altering key pluripotency regulators' expression levels, including OCT4, NANOG, and LIN28A by pleiotropic mechanisms. MATR3 binds to the OCT4 and YTHDF1 promoters favoring their expression. YTHDF1, in turn, binds the m6A-modified OCT4 mRNA. Furthermore, MATR3 is recruited on ribosomes and controls pluripotency regulating the translation of specific transcripts, including NANOG and LIN28A, by direct binding and favoring their stabilization. These results show that MATR3 orchestrates the pluripotency circuitry by regulating the transcription, translational efficiency, and epitranscriptome of specific transcripts.","1960":"The search for human cognitive uniqueness often relied on low ecological tests with subjects experiencing unnatural ontogeny. Recently, neuroscience demonstrated the significance of a rich environment on the development of brain structures and cognitive abilities. This stresses the importance to consider the prior knowledge that subjects bring in any experiment. Second, recent developments in multivariate statistics control precisely for a number of factors and their interactions. Making controls in natural observations equivalent and sometimes superior to captive experimental studies without the drawbacks of the latter methods. Thus, we can now investigate complex cognition by accounting for many different factors, as required when solving tasks in nature. Combining both progresses allows us to move toward an \"experience-specific cognition\", recognizing that cognition varies extensively in nature as individuals adapt to the precise challenges they experience in life. Such cognitive specialization makes cross-species comparisons more complex, while potentially identifying human cognitive uniqueness.","1961":"Fireflies are known for emitting light signals for intraspecific communication. However, in doing so, they reveal themselves to many potential nocturnal predators from a large distance. Therefore, many fireflies evolved unpalatable compounds and probably use their light signals as anti-predator aposematic signals. Fireflies are occasionally attacked by predators despite their warning flashes. Bats are among the most substantial potential firefly predators. Using their echolocation, bats might detect a firefly from a short distance and attack it in between two flashes. We thus aimed to examine whether fireflies use additional measures of warning, specifically focusing on sound signals. We recorded four species from different genera of fireflies in Vietnam and Israel and found that all of them generated ultrasonic clicks centered around bats' hearing range. Clicks were synchronized with the wingbeat and are probably produced by the wings. We hypothesize that ultrasonic clicks can serve as part of a multimodal aposematic display.","1962":"Social tolerance is generally treated as a stable, species-specific characteristic. Recent research, however, has questioned this position and emphasized the importance of intraspecific variation. We investigate the temporal stability of social tolerance in four groups of sanctuary-housed chimpanzees over eight years using a commonly employed measure: experimental cofeeding tolerance. We then draw on longitudinal data on the demographic composition of each group to identify the factors associated with cofeeding tolerance. We find appreciable levels of variation in cofeeding tolerance across both groups and years that correspond closely to changes in group-level demographic composition. For example, cofeeding tolerance is lower when there are many females with young infants. These results suggest that social tolerance may be a \"responding trait\" of chimpanzee sociality, reflecting individual-level behavioral responses to social changes. Additional, experimental research is needed to better model the causal drivers of social tolerance within and among species.","1963":null,"1964":"Recently, COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has brought great challenges to the world. More and more studies have shown that patients with severe COVID-19 may suffer from cytokine storm syndrome; however, there are few studies on its pathogenesis. Here we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 coding protein open reading frame 8 (ORF8) acted as a contributing factor to cytokine storm during COVID-19 infection. ORF8 could activate IL-17 signaling pathway and promote the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. Moreover, we demonstrated that treatment of IL17RA antibody protected mice from ORF8-induced inflammation. Our findings are helpful to understand the pathogenesis of cytokine storm caused by SARS-CoV-2 and provide a potential target for the development of COVID-19 therapeutic drugs.","1965":"Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is an important second messenger and one of the products of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC)-mediated phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. However, the function of IP3 in cotton is unknown. Here, we characterized the function of GhPIPLC2D in cotton fiber elongation. GhPIPLC2D was preferentially expressed in elongating fibers. Suppression of GhPIPLC2D transcripts resulted in shorter fibers and decreased IP3 accumulation and ethylene biosynthesis. Exogenous application of linolenic acid (C18:3) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), the precursor of IP3, improved IP3 and myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6) accumulation, as well as ethylene biosynthesis. Moreover, fiber length in GhPIPLC2D-silenced plant was reduced after exogenous application of IP6 and ethylene. These results indicate that GhPIPLC2D positively regulates fiber elongation and IP3 promotes fiber elongation by enhancing ethylene biosynthesis. Our study broadens our understanding of the function of IP3 in cotton fiber elongation and highlights the possibility of cultivating better cotton varieties by manipulating GhPIPLC2D in the future.","1966":"Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) made in mitochondria has long been recognized as an important precursor for phosphatidylcholine production that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Recently, the strict mitochondrial localization of the enzyme that makes PE in the mitochondrion, phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1), was questioned. Since a dual localization of Psd1 to the ER would have far-reaching implications, we initiated our study to independently re-assess the subcellular distribution of Psd1. Our results support the unavoidable conclusion that the vast majority, if not all, of functional Psd1 resides in the mitochondrion. Through our efforts, we discovered that mutant forms of Psd1 that impair a self-processing step needed for it to become functional are dually localized to the ER when expressed in a PE-limiting environment. We conclude that severely impaired cellular PE metabolism provokes an ER-assisted adaptive response that is capable of identifying and resolving nonfunctional mitochondrial precursors.","1967":null,"1968":null,"1969":"The \"Wet Tropics\" of Australia host a unique variety of plant lineages that trace their origins to the super-continent of Gondwanaland. While these \"ancient\" evolutionary records are rightly emphasized in current management of the region, multidisciplinary research and lobbying by Rainforest Aboriginal Peoples have also demonstrated the significance of the cultural heritage of the \"Wet Tropics.\" Here, we evaluate the existing archeological, paleoenvironmental, and historical evidence to demonstrate the diverse ways in which these forests are globally significant, not only for their ecological heritage but also for their preservation of traces of millennia of anthropogenic activities, including active burning and food tree manipulation. We argue that detailed paleoecological, ethnobotanical, and archeological studies, working within the framework of growing national and world heritage initiatives and active application of traditional knowledge, offer the best opportunities for sustainable management of these unique environments in the face of increasingly catastrophic climate change and bushfires.","1970":null,"1971":"Microglia are ubiquitous central nervous system (CNS)-resident macrophages that maintain homeostasis of neural tissues and protect them from pathogen attacks. Yet, their differentiation in different compartments remains elusive. We performed single-cell RNA-seq to compare microglial subtypes in the cortex and the spinal cord. A multi-way comparative analysis was carried out on samples from C57\/BL and HIV gp120 transgenic mice at two, four, and eight months of age. The results revealed overlapping but distinct microglial populations in the cortex and the spinal cord. The differential heterogeneity of microglia in these CNS regions was further suggested by their disparity of plasticity in response to life span progression and HIV-1 pathogenic protein gp120. Our findings indicate that microglia in different CNS compartments are adapted to their local environments to fulfill region-specific biological functions.","1972":"The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix strongly influence tumor progression and invasion. Yes-associated protein (YAP) has been shown to be a key regulator of this process translating mechanical cues from the extracellular matrix into intracellular signals. Despite its apparent role in tumor progression and metastasis, it is not clear yet, whether YAP activation can actively trigger the onset of invasion. To address this question, we designed a photo-activatable YAP (optoYAP), which allows for spatiotemporal control of its activation. The activation mechanism of optoYAP is based on optically triggered nuclear translocation of the protein. Activation of optoYAP induces downstream signaling for several hours and leads to increased proliferation in two- and three-dimensional cultures. Applied to cancer spheroids, optoYAP activation induces invasion. Site-selective activation of optoYAP in cancer spheroids strikingly directs invasion into the activated direction. Thus, nuclear translocation of YAP may be enough to trigger the onset of invasion.","1973":null,"1974":"Nanoneuromedicine investigates nanotechnology to target the brain and treat neurological diseases. In this work, we biofabricated heterocellular spheroids comprising human brain microvascular endothelial cells, brain vascular pericytes and astrocytes combined with primary cortical neurons and microglia isolated from neonate rats. The structure and function are characterized by confocal laser scanning and light sheet fluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, western blotting, and RNA sequencing. The spheroid bulk is formed by neural cells and microglia and the surface by endothelial cells and they upregulate key structural and functional proteins of the blood-brain barrier. These cellular constructs are utilized to preliminary screen the permeability of polymeric, metallic, and ceramic nanoparticles (NPs). Findings reveal that penetration and distribution patterns depend on the NP type and that microglia would play a key role in this pathway, highlighting the promise of this platform to investigate the interaction of different nanomaterials with the central nervous system in nanomedicine, nanosafety and nanotoxicology.","1975":null,"1976":"Perturbation of mitochondrial proteostasis provokes cell autonomous and cell non-autonomous responses that contribute to homeostatic adaptation. Here, we demonstrate distinct metabolic effects of hepatic metabokines as cell non-autonomous factors in mice with mitochondrial OxPhos dysfunction. Liver-specific mitochondrial stress induced by a loss-of-function mutation in Crif1 (LKO) leads to aberrant oxidative phosphorylation and promotes the mitochondrial unfolded protein response. LKO mice are highly insulin sensitive and resistant to diet-induced obesity. The hepatocytes of LKO mice secrete large quantities of metabokines, including GDF15 and FGF21, which confer metabolic benefits. We evaluated the metabolic phenotypes of LKO mice with global deficiency of GDF15 or FGF21 and show that GDF15 regulates body and fat mass and prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis, whereas FGF21 upregulates insulin sensitivity, energy expenditure, and thermogenesis in white adipose tissue. This study reveals that the mitochondrial integrated stress response (ISRmt) in liver mediates metabolic adaptation through hepatic metabokines.","1977":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101834.].","1978":"Most cancer deaths are due to tumor metastasis rather than the primary tumor. Metastasis is a highly complex and dynamic process that requires orchestration of signaling between the tumor, its local environment, distant tissue sites, and immune system. Animal models of cancer metastasis provide the necessary systemic environment but lack control over factors that regulate cancer progression and often do not recapitulate the properties of human cancers. Bioengineered \"organs-on-a-chip\" that incorporate the primary tumor, metastatic tissue targets, and microfluidic perfusion are now emerging as quantitative human models of tumor metastasis. The ability of these systems to model tumor metastasis in individualized, patient-specific settings makes them uniquely suitable for studies of cancer biology and developmental testing of new treatments. In this review, we focus on human multi-organ platforms that incorporate circulating and tissue-resident immune cells in studies of tumor metastasis.","1979":null,"1980":"High-entropy materials (HEMs), including high-entropy alloys (HEAs), high-entropy oxides (HEOs), and other high-entropy compounds, have gained significant interests over the past years. These materials have unique structures with the coexistence of antisite disordering and crystal periodicity, which were originally investigated as structural materials. Recently, they have emerged for energy-related applications, such as catalysis, energy storage, etc. In this work, we review the research progress of energy-related applications of HEMs. After an introduction on the background, theory, and syntheses of HEMs, we survey their applications including electrocatalysis, batteries, and others, aiming to retrieve the correlations between their structures and performances. In the end, we discussed the challenges and future directions for developing HEMs.","1981":null,"1982":"Cementitious structures exhibit high compression strength but suffer from inherent brittleness. Conversely, nature creates structures using mostly brittle phases that overcome the strength-toughness trade-off, mainly through internalized packaging of brittle phases with soft organic binders. Here, we develop complex architectures of cementitious materials using an inverse replica approach where a soft polymer phase emerges as an external conformal coating. Architected polymer templates are printed, cement pastes are molded into these templates, and cementitious structures with thin polymer surface coating are achieved after the solubilization of sacrificial templates. These polymer-coated architected cementitious structures display unusual mechanical behavior with considerably higher toughness compared to conventional non-porous structures. They resist catastrophic failure through delayed damage propagation. Most interestingly, the architected structures show significant deformation recovery after releasing quasi-static loading, atypical in conventional cementitious structures. This approach allows a simple strategy to build more deformation resilient cementitious structures than their traditional counterparts.","1983":null,"1984":null,"1985":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been associated with multiple direct and indirect cardiovascular complications. We sought to analyze the association of host co-morbidities (chronic respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease [CVD], hypertension or diabetes mellitus [DM]) with the acute cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Individual analyses of the majority of studies found median age was higher by ~10 years in patients with cardiovascular complications. Pooled analyses showed development of SARS-CoV-2 cardiovascular complications was significantly increased in patients with chronic respiratory illness (odds ratio (OR): 1.67 [1.48, 1.88]), CVD (OR: 3.37 [2.57, 4.43]), hypertension (OR: 2.68 [2.11, 3.41]), DM (OR: 1.60 [1.31, 1.95]) and male sex (OR: 1.31 [1.21, 1.42]), findings that were mostly conserved during sub-analysis of studies stratified into global geographic regions. Age, chronic respiratory illness, CVD, hypertension, DM, and male sex may represent prognostic factors for the development of cardiovascular complications in COVID-19 disease, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to chronic disease patient management.","1986":"Fuel cells are highly efficient and green power sources. The typical membrane electrode assembly is necessary for common electrochemical devices. Recent research and development in solid oxide fuel cells have opened up many new opportunities based on the semiconductor or its heterostructure materials. Semiconductor-based fuel cells (SBFCs) realize the fuel cell functionality in a much more straightforward way. This work aims to discuss new strategies and scientific principles of SBFCs by reviewing various novel junction types\/interfaces, i.e., bulk and planar p-n junction, Schottky junction, and n-i type interface contact. New designing methodologies of SBFCs from energy band\/alignment and built-in electric field (BIEF), which block the internal electronic transport while assisting interfacial superionic transport and subsequently enhance device performance, are comprehensively reviewed. This work highlights the recent advances of SBFCs and provides new methodology and understanding with significant importance for both fundamental and applied R&amp;D on new-generation fuel cell materials and technologies.","1987":null,"1988":"Electrosynthesis is to use electricity to drive chemical reactions for chemical synthesis and is potentially a green approach to fuel and energy sustainability.

It then outlines the common strategies used to develop nanocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, and biomass upgrading. The perspective further summarizes the current methodologies that have been developed for scaling-up synthesis of nanocatalysts, which will be essential for the electrosynthesis to become a viable industry approach.","1989":"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) play critical roles in the nuclear export, splicing, and sensing of RNA. However, the role of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A\/B (hnRNPAB) is poorly understood. In this study, we report that hnRNPAB cooperates with nucleoprotein (NP) to restrict viral mRNA nuclear export via inhibiting viral mRNA binding to ALY and NXF1. HnRNPAB restricts mRNA transfer from ALY to NXF1, inhibiting the mRNA nuclear export. Moreover, when cells are invaded by influenza A virus, NP interacts with hnRNPAB and interrupts the ALY-UAP56 interaction, leading to repression of ALY-viral mRNA binding, and then inhibits the viral mRNA binding to NXF1, leading to nuclear stimulation of viral mRNA. Collectively, these observations provide a new role of hnRNPAB to act as an mRNA nuclear retention factor, which is also effective for viral mRNA of influenza A virus, and NP cooperates with hnRNPAB to further restrict the viral mRNA nuclear export.","1990":null,"1991":"Proximity and size of the nearest market ('market gravity') have been shown to have strong negative effects on coral reef fish communities that can be mitigated by the establishment of closed areas. However, moray eels are functionally unique predators that are generally not subject to targeted fishing and should therefore not directly be affected by these factors. We used baited remote underwater video systems to investigate associations between morays and anthropogenic, habitat, and ecological factors in the Caribbean region. Market gravity had a positive effect on morays, while the opposite pattern was observed in a predator group subject to exploitation (sharks). Environmental DNA analyses corroborated the positive effect of market gravity on morays. We hypothesize that the observed pattern could be the indirect result of the depletion of moray competitors and predators near humans.","1992":"Epidemiological data showing increased severity and mortality of COVID-19 in men suggests a potential role for androgen in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse and human cells. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. Furthermore, camostat-a TMPRSS2 inhibitor-blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction, thus providing evidence for the first time of a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens, or camostat attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cellular entry. Together, our data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of TMPRSS2 inhibitors and androgen-deprivation therapy\/androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with antiviral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent COVID-19 progression.","1993":"With the development of machine learning in recent years, it is possible to glean much more information from an experimental data set to study matter. In this perspective, we discuss some state-of-the-art data-driven tools to analyze latent effects in data and explain their applicability in natural science, focusing on two recently introduced, physics-motivated computationally cheap tools-latent entropy and latent dimension. We exemplify their capabilities by applying them on several examples in the natural sciences and show that they reveal so far unobserved features such as, for example, a gradient in a magnetic measurement and a latent network of glymphatic channels from the mouse brain microscopy data. What sets these techniques apart is the relaxation of restrictive assumptions typical of many machine learning models and instead incorporating aspects that best fit the dynamical systems at hand.","1994":null,"1995":null,"1996":null,"1997":null,"1998":null,"1999":null,"2000":"The proximity pattern and radial distribution of chromosome territories within spherical nuclei are random and non-random, respectively.

Here we use chromosome paint technology to examine the chromosome territories of all 46 chromosomes in hundreds of single human neutrophils - an abundant and famously polymorphonuclear immune cell. By comparing the distribution of chromosomes to randomly shuffled controls and validating with orthogonal chromosome conformation capture technology, we show for the first time that human chromosomes randomly distribute to neutrophil nuclear lobes, while maintaining a non-random radial distribution within these lobes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that chromosome length correlates with three-dimensional volume not only in neutrophils but other human immune cells. This work demonstrates that chromosomes are largely passive passengers during the neutrophil lobing process but are able to subsequently maintain their macro-level organization within lobes.","2001":null,"2002":null,"2003":"Near-infrared (NIR) luminescent materials have emerged as a growing field of interest, particularly for imaging and optics applications in biology, chemistry, and physics.

Recent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has provided a variety of tools for high-quality information extraction from unstructured text. These tools are primarily trained on non-technical text and struggle to produce accurate results when applied to scientific text, involving specific technical terminology. During the last years, significant efforts in information retrieval have been made for biomedical and biochemical publications. For materials science, text mining (TM) methodology is still at the dawn of its development.

Mutations in PBGD are associated with acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), a rare metabolic disorder. We used Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) to demonstrate that wild-type PBGD and AIP-associated mutant R167W both existed as holoenzymes (Eholo) covalently attached to the dipyrromethane cofactor, and three intermediate complexes, ES, ES2, and ES3, where S represents PBG. In contrast, only ES2 was detected in AIP-associated mutant R173W, indicating that the formation of ES3 is inhibited. The R173W crystal structure in the ES2-state revealed major rearrangements of the loops around the active site, compared to wild-type PBGD in the Eholo-state. These results contribute to elucidating the structural pathogenesis of two common AIP-associated mutations and reveal the important structural role of Arg173 in the polypyrrole elongation mechanism.","2008":"Black tea is the most widely consumed tea drink in the world and has consistently been reported to possess anti-aging benefits. However, whether theaflavins, one type of the characteristic phytochemicals in black tea extracts, are involved in regulating aging and lifespan in consumers remains largely unknown. In this study, we show that theaflavins play a beneficial role in preventing age-onset intestinal leakage and dysbiosis, thus delaying aging in Drosophila. Mechanistically, theaflavins regulate the condensate assembly of Imd to negatively govern the overactivation of Imd signals in fruit fly intestines. In addition, theaflavins prevent DSS-induced colitis in mice, suggesting theaflavins play a role in modulating intestinal integrity. Overall, our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which theaflavins regulate gut homeostasis likely through controlling Imd coalescence.","2009":null,"2010":"RNA viruses are responsible for many zoonotic diseases that post great challenges for public health. Effective therapeutics against these viral infections remain limited. Here, we deployed a computational framework for host-based drug repositioning to predict potential antiviral drugs from 2,352 approved drugs and 1,062 natural compounds embedded in herbs of traditional Chinese medicine. By systematically interrogating public genetic screening data, we comprehensively cataloged host dependency genes (HDGs) that are indispensable for successful viral infection corresponding to 10 families and 29 species of RNA viruses. We then utilized these HDGs as potential drug targets and interrogated extensive drug-target interactions through database retrieval, literature mining, and de novo prediction using artificial intelligence-based algorithms. Repurposed drugs or natural compounds were proposed against many viral pathogens such as coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), flaviviruses, and influenza viruses.

Here, we describe Constellation sequencing (Constellation-Seq), a molecular transcriptome filter that delivers two orders of magnitude sensitivity gains by maximizing read utility while reducing the data sparsity and sequencing costs. The technique reliably measures changes in gene expression and was demonstrated by resolving rare dendritic cell populations from a peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample sample and exploring their biology with extreme resolution. The simple and powerful method is fully compatible with standard scRNA-Seq library preparation protocols and can be used for hypothesis testing, marker validation or investigating pathways.","2012":"Stress-coupled NEDDylation potentially regulates the aggregation of nuclear proteins, which could protect the nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system from proteotoxic stress. However, it remains unclear how NEDDylation controls protein-aggregation responses to diverse stress conditions. Here, we identified HDAC6 as a direct NEDD8-binding partner that regulates the formation of aggresome-like bodies (ALBs) containing NEDDylated cytosolic protein aggregates during ubiquitin stress. HDAC6 colocalizes with stress-induced ALBs, and HDAC6 inhibition suppresses ALBs formation, but not stress-induced NEDDylation, suggesting that HDAC6 carries NEDDylated-proteins to generate ALBs. Then, we monitored the ALBs-associated proteostasis network and found that p62 directly controls ALBs formation as an acceptor of NEDDylated cytosolic aggregates. Interestingly, we also observed that ALBs are highly condensed in chloroquine-treated cells with impaired autophagic flux, indicating that ALBs rely on autophagy. Collectively, our data suggest that NEDD8, HDAC6, and p62 are involved in the management of proteotoxic stress by forming cytosolic ALBs coupled to the aggresome-autophagy flux.","2013":null,"2014":"Despite the recent availability of complete genome sequences of tumors from thousands of patients, isolating disease-causing (driver) non-coding mutations from the plethora of somatic variants remains challenging, and only a handful of validated examples exist. By integrating whole-genome sequencing, genetic data, and allele-specific gene expression from TCGA, we identified 320 somatic non-coding mutations that affect gene expression in cis (FDR&lt;0.25). These mutations cluster into 47 cis-regulatory elements that modulate expression of their subject genes through diverse molecular mechanisms. We further show that these mutations have hallmark features of non-coding drivers; namely, that they preferentially disrupt transcription factor binding motifs, are associated with a selective advantage, increased oncogene expression and decreased tumor suppressor expression.","2015":"Vagal stimulation is emerging as the next frontier in bioelectronic medicine to modulate peripheral organ health and treat disease. The neuronal molecular phenotypes in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) remain largely unexplored, limiting the potential for harnessing the DMV plasticity for therapeutic interventions. We developed a mesoscale single-cell transcriptomics data from hundreds of DMV neurons under homeostasis and following physiological perturbations. Our results revealed that homeostatic DMV neuronal states can be organized into distinguishable input-output signal processing units. Remote ischemic preconditioning induced a distinctive shift in the neuronal states toward diminishing the role of inhibitory inputs, with concomitant changes in regulatory microRNAs miR-218a and miR-495. Chronic cardiac ischemic injury resulted in a dramatic shift in DMV neuronal states suggestive of enhanced neurosecretory function. We propose a DMV molecular network mechanism that integrates combinatorial neurotransmitter inputs from multiple brain regions and humoral signals to modulate cardiac health.","2016":"Whether transdifferentiation of the biliary epithelial cells (BECs) to hepatocytes occurs under physiological conditions and contributes to liver homeostasis remains under long-term debate. Similar questions have been raised under pathological circumstances if a fibrotic liver is suffered from severe injuries. To address these questions in zebrafish, we established a sensitive lineage tracing system specific for the detection of BEC-derived hepatocytes. The BEC-to-hepatocyte transdifferentiation occurred and became minor contributors to hepatocyte homeostasis in a portion of adult individuals. The BEC-derived hepatocytes distributed in clusters in the liver. When a fibrotic liver underwent extreme hepatocyte damages, BEC-to-hepatocyte transdifferentiation acted as the major origin of regenerating hepatocytes. In contrast, partial hepatectomy failed to induce the BEC-to-hepatocyte conversion. In conclusion, based on a sensitive lineage tracing system, our results suggest that BECs are able to transdifferentiate into hepatocytes and contribute to both physiological hepatocyte homeostasis and pathological regeneration.","2017":"The emergence of pro-social behaviors remains a key open challenge across disciplines. In this context, there is growing evidence that expressing emotions may foster human cooperation. However, it remains unclear how emotions shape individual choices and interact with other cooperation mechanisms. Here, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis of the interplay of emotion expressions with two important mechanisms: direct and indirect reciprocity. We show that cooperation in an iterated prisoner's dilemma emerges from the combination of the opponent's initial reputation, past behaviors, and emotion expressions. Moreover, all factors influenced the social norm adopted when assessing the action of others - i.e., how their counterparts' reputations are updated - thus, reflecting longer-term consequences. We expose a new class of emotion-based social norms, where emotions are used to forgive those that defect but also punish those that cooperate. These findings emphasize the importance of emotion expressions in fostering, directly and indirectly, cooperation in society.","2018":null,"2019":"Cryo-EM grid preparation is an important bottleneck in protein structure determination, especially for membrane proteins, typically requiring screening of a large number of conditions. We systematically investigated the effects of buffer components, blotting conditions and grid types on the outcome of grid preparation of five different membrane protein samples. Aggregation was the most common type of problem which was addressed by changing detergents, salt concentration or reconstitution of proteins into nanodiscs or amphipols. We show that the optimal concentration of detergent is between 0.05 and 0.4% and that the presence of a low concentration of detergent with a high critical micellar concentration protects the proteins from denaturation at the air-water interface. Furthermore, we discuss the strategies for achieving an adequate ice thickness, particle coverage and orientation distribution on free ice and on support films. Our findings provide a clear roadmap for comprehensive screening of conditions for cryo-EM grid preparation of membrane proteins.","2020":null,"2021":"","2022":"Optical super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has enabled biologists to visualize cellular structures with near-molecular resolution, giving unprecedented access to details about the amounts, sizes, and spatial distributions of macromolecules in the cell. Precisely quantifying these molecular details requires large datasets of high-quality, reproducible SRM images. In this review, we discuss the unique set of challenges facing quantitative SRM, giving particular attention to the shortcomings of conventional specimen preparation techniques and the necessity for optimal labeling of molecular targets. We further discuss the obstacles to scaling SRM methods, such as lengthy image acquisition and complex SRM data analysis. For each of these challenges, we review the recent advances in the field that circumvent these pitfalls and provide practical advice to biologists for optimizing SRM experiments.","2023":null,"2024":"A core goal in cognitive neuroscience is identifying the physical substrates of the patterns of thought that occupy our daily lives. Contemporary views suggest that the landscape of ongoing experience is heterogeneous and can be influenced by features of both the person and the context. This perspective piece considers recent work that explicitly accounts for both the heterogeneity of the experience and context dependence of patterns of ongoing thought. These studies reveal that systems linked to attention and control are important for organizing experience in response to changing environmental demands. These studies also establish a role of the default mode network beyond task-negative or purely episodic content, for example, implicating it in the level of vivid detail in experience in both task contexts and in spontaneous self-generated experiential states. Together, this work demonstrates that the landscape of ongoing thought is reflected in the activity of multiple neural systems, and it is important to distinguish between processes contributing to how the experience unfolds from those linked to how these experiences are regulated.","2025":null,"2026":null,"2027":"The Ganga basin includes some of the most densely populated areas in the world, in a region characterized by extremely high demographic and economic growth rates. Although anthropogenic pressure in this area is increasing, the pollution status of the Ganga is still poorly studied and understood. In the light of this, we have carried out a systematic literature review of the sources, levels and spatiotemporal distribution of organic pollutants in surface water and sediment of the Ganga basin, including for the first time emerging contaminants (ECs). We have identified 61 publications over the past thirty years, with data on a total of 271 organic compounds, including pesticides, industrial chemicals, and by-products, artificial sweeteners, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products (PPCPs). The most studied organic contaminants are pesticides, whereas knowledge of industrial compounds and PPCPs, among which some of the major ECs, is highly fragmentary. Most studies focus on the main channel of the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Gomti, and the deltaic region, while most of the Ganga's major tributaries, and the entire southern part of the catchment, have not been investigated. Hotspots of contamination coincide with major urban agglomerations, including Delhi, Kolkata, Kanpur, Varanasi, and Patna. Pesticides levels have decreased at most of the sites over recent decades, while potentially harmful concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organotin compounds (OTCs), and some PPCPs have been detected in the last ten years. Considering the limited geographical coverage of sampling and number of analyzed compounds, this review highlights the need for a more careful selection of locations, compounds and environmental matrices, prioritizing PPCPs and catchment-scale, source-to-sink studies.","2028":null,"2029":null,"2030":"Robots are likely to become important social actors in our future and so require more human-like ways of assisting us. We state that collaboration between humans and robots is fostered by two cognitive skills: intention reading and trust. An agent possessing these abilities would be able to infer the non-verbal intentions of others and to evaluate how likely they are to achieve their goals, jointly understanding what kind and which degree of collaboration they require. For this reason, we propose a developmental artificial cognitive architecture that integrates unsupervised machine learning and probabilistic models to imbue a humanoid robot with intention reading and trusting capabilities. Our experimental results show that the synergistic implementation of these cognitive skills enable the robot to cooperate in a meaningful way, with the intention reading model allowing a correct goal prediction and with the trust component enhancing the likelihood of a positive outcome for the task.","2031":"Many metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, are rewired in tumors to support energy and biomass production and to allow adaptation to stressful environments. Neuroblastoma is the second deadliest solid tumor in children. Genetic aberrations, as the amplification of the MYCN-oncogene, correlate strongly with disease progression. Yet, there are only a few molecular targets successfully exploited in the clinic. Here we show that inhibition of fatty acid synthesis led to increased neural differentiation and reduced tumor burden in neuroblastoma xenograft experiments independently of MYCN-status. This was accompanied by reduced levels of the MYCN or c-MYC oncoproteins and activation of ERK signaling. Importantly, the expression levels of genes involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis showed prognostic value for neuroblastoma patients. Our findings demonstrate that inhibition of de novo fatty acid synthesis is a promising pharmacological intervention strategy for the treatment of neuroblastoma independently of MYCN-status.","2032":null,"2033":null,"2034":"Near-infrared (NIR) emission is useful for numerous practical applications, such as communication, biomedical sensors, night vision, etc., which encourages researchers to develop materials and devices for the realization of efficient NIR organic light-emitting devices. Recently, the emerging organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters have attracted wide attention because of the full utilization of electron-generated excitons, which is crucial for achieving high device efficiency. Up to now, the TADF emitters have shown their potential in the deep red\/NIR region. Considering the color purity and efficiency, however, the development of NIR TADF emitters still lags behind RGB TADF emitters, indicating that there is still much room to improve their performance. In this regard, this perspective mainly summarizes the past progress of molecular design on constructing TADF NIR emitters. We hope this perspective could provide a new vista in developing NIR materials and enlighten breakthroughs in both fundamental research and applications.","2035":"Insulin's activation of PI3K\/Akt signaling, stimulates glucose uptake by enhancing delivery of GLUT4 to the cell surface. Here we examined the origins of intercellular heterogeneity in insulin signaling. Akt activation alone accounted for ~25% of the variance in GLUT4, indicating that additional sources of variance exist. The Akt and GLUT4 responses were highly reproducible within the same cell, suggesting the variance is between cells (extrinsic) and not within cells (intrinsic). Generalized mechanistic models (supported by experimental observations) demonstrated that the correlation between the steady-state levels of two measured signaling processes decreases with increasing distance from each other and that intercellular variation in protein expression (as an example of extrinsic variance) is sufficient to account for the variance in and between Akt and GLUT4. Thus, the response of a population to insulin signaling is underpinned by considerable single-cell heterogeneity that is largely driven by variance in gene\/protein expression between cells.","2036":"Social learning, which is a mechanism that allows an individual to acquire skills from other individuals, occurs in a social context. Therefore, factors that influence social context, like social structure, will impact social learning opportunities. This review explores how features of social structure affect social learning opportunities in primates, either through their relationship with social tolerance or through the number of social learning models. Features that are investigated in this review and that we hypothesize affect social learning opportunities are parental investment, dominance hierarchy, nepotism, social bonds, dispersal, group size, fission-fusion dynamics, and sex ratio. For most of these features we find evidence, but support varies. Of all primate species, only humans show all the requirements of an optimal social structure to promote social learning. Future research into social learning and culture should not overlook the social context in which it takes place.","2037":null,"2038":"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), an evolutionary conserved phenomenon, has been extensively studied to address the unresolved variable treatment response across therapeutic regimes in cancer subtypes. EMT has long been envisaged to regulate tumor invasion, migration, and therapeutic resistance during tumorigenesis. However, recently it has been highlighted that EMT involves an intermediate partial EMT (pEMT) phenotype, defined by incomplete loss of epithelial markers and incomplete gain of mesenchymal markers. It has been further emphasized that pEMT transition involves a spectrum of intermediate hybrid states on either side of pEMT spectrum. Emerging evidence underlines bi-directional crosstalk between tumor cells and surrounding microenvironment in acquisition of pEMT phenotype. Although much work is still ongoing to gain mechanistic insights into regulation of pEMT phenotype, it is evident that pEMT plays a critical role in tumor aggressiveness, invasion, migration, and metastasis along with therapeutic resistance. In this review, we focus on important role of tumor-intrinsic factors and tumor microenvironment in driving pEMT and emphasize that engineered controlled microenvironments are instrumental to provide mechanistic insights into pEMT biology. We also discuss the significance of pEMT in regulating hallmarks of tumor progression i.e. cell cycle regulation, collective migration, and therapeutic resistance. Although constantly evolving, current progress and momentum in the pEMT field holds promise to unravel new therapeutic targets to halt tumor progression at early stages as well as tackle the complex therapeutic resistance observed across many cancer types.","2039":null,"2040":null,"2041":"The availability of complete sets of genes from many organisms makes it possible to identify genes unique to (or lost from) certain clades. This information is used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees; identify genes involved in the evolution of clade specific novelties; and for phylostratigraphy-identifying ages of genes in a given species. These investigations rely on accurately predicted orthologs. Here we use simulation to produce sets of orthologs that experience no gains or losses. We show that errors in identifying orthologs increase with higher rates of evolution. We use the predicted sets of orthologs, with errors, to reconstruct phylogenetic trees; to count gains and losses; and for phylostratigraphy. Our simulated data, containing information only from errors in orthology prediction, closely recapitulate findings from empirical data. We suggest published downstream analyses must be informed to a large extent by errors in orthology prediction that mimic expected patterns of gene evolution.","2042":null,"2043":null,"2044":"Achieving highly active and stable oxygen reduction reaction performance at low platinum-group-metal loadings remains one of the grand challenges in the proton-exchange membrane fuel cells community. Currently, state-of-the-art electrocatalysts are high-surface-area-carbon-supported nanoalloys of platinum with different transition metals (Cu, Ni, Fe, and Co). Despite years of focused research, the established structure-property relationships are not able to explain and predict the electrochemical performance and behavior of the real nanoparticulate systems. In the first part of this work, we reveal the complexity of commercially available platinum-based electrocatalysts and their electrochemical behavior. In the second part, we introduce a bottom-up approach where atomically resolved properties, structural changes, and strain analysis are recorded as well as analyzed on an individual nanoparticle before and after electrochemical conditions (e.g. high current density). Our methodology offers a new level of understanding of structure-stability relationships of practically viable nanoparticulate systems.","2045":"There is no efficient wastewater treatment solution for removing organic micropollutants (OMPs), which, therefore, are continuously introduced to the Earth's surface waters. This creates a severe risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health. In emerging water treatment processes based on ion-exchange membranes (IEM), transport of OMPs through membranes remains unknown. We performed a comprehensive investigation of the OMP transport through a single IEM under non-steady-state conditions. For the first time, positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy was used to study differences in the free volume element radius between anion- and cation-exchange membranes, and between their thicknesses. The dynamic diffusion-adsorption model was used to calculate the adsorption and diffusion coefficients of OMPs. Remarkably, diffusion coefficients increased with the membrane thickness, where its surface resistance was more evident in thinner membranes. Presented results will contribute to the improved design of next-generation IEMs with higher selectivity toward multiple types of organic compounds.","2046":null,"2047":"Mutations in coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing 10 (CHCHD10) have been identified in patients suffering from various degenerative diseases including mitochondrial myopathy, spinal muscular atrophy Jokela type, frontotemporal dementia, and\/or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The pathogenic mechanism underlying CHCHD10-linked divergent disorders remains largely unknown. Here we show that transgenic mice overexpressing an ALS-linked CHCHD10 p.R15L mutation leads to an abbreviated lifespan compared with CHCHD10-WT transgenic mice. The occurrence and severity of the phenotype correlates to transgene copy number. Central nervous system (CNS), skeletal muscle, and cardiac pathology is apparent in CHCHD10-R15L transgenic mice. Despite the pathology, CHCHD10-R15L transgenic mice perform comparably to control mice in motor behavioral tasks until very close to death. Although paralysis is not observed, these models provide insight into the pleiotropic nature of CHCHD10 and suggest a contribution of CNS, skeletal muscle, and cardiac pathology to CHCHD10 p.R15L-ALS pathogenesis.","2048":"Structural color attracts considerable scientific interests and industrial explorations in various fields for the eco-friendly, fade-resistant, and dynamic advantages. After the long-period evolution, nature has achieved the optimized color structures at various length scales, which has inspired people to learn and replicate them to improve the artificial structure color. In this review, we focus on the design of artificial structural colors based on colloidal particle assembly and summarize the functional bioinspired structure colors. We demonstrate the design principles of biomimetic structural colors via the precise structure engineering and typical bottom-up methods. Some main applications are outlined in the following chapter. Finally, we propose the existing challenges and promising prospects. This review is expected to introduce the recent design strategies about the artificial structure colors and provide the insights for its future development.","2049":"Remodeling of mitochondrial ultrastructure is a process that is critical for organelle physiology and apoptosis. Although the key players in this process-mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction organizing system (MICOS) and Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1)-have been characterized, the mechanisms behind its regulation remain incompletely defined. Here, we found that in addition to its role in mitochondrial division, metallopeptidase OMA1 is required for the maintenance of intermembrane connectivity through dynamic association with MICOS. This association is independent of OPA1, mediated via the MICOS subunit MIC60, and is important for stability of MICOS and the intermembrane contacts. The OMA1-MICOS relay is required for optimal bioenergetic output and apoptosis. Loss of OMA1 affects these activities; remarkably it can be alleviated by MICOS-emulating intermembrane bridge. Thus, OMA1-dependent ultrastructure support is required for mitochondrial architecture and bioenergetics under basal and stress conditions, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for OMA1 in mitochondrial physiology.","2050":"Two-pore channels (TPCs) are key components for regulating Ca2+ current from endosomes and lysosomes to the cytosol. This locally restricted Ca2+ current forms the basis for fusion and fission events between endolysosomal membranes and thereby for intracellular trafficking processes. Here, we study the function of TPC1 and TPC2 for uptake, recycling, and degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) using a set of TPC knockout cells. RNA sequencing analysis revealed multiple changes in the expression levels of EGFR pathway-related genes in TPC1-deficient cells. We propose that a prolonged presence of activated EGFRs in endolysosomal signaling platforms, caused by genetic inactivation of TPCs, does not only affect EGFR signaling pathways but also increases de novo synthesis of EGFR. Increased basal phospho-c-Jun levels contribute to the high EGFR expression in TPC-deficient cells. Our data point to a role of TPCs not only as important regulators for the EGFR transportation network but also for EGFR-signaling and expression.","2051":null,"2052":null,"2053":"Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Recent work has implicated chromosome end stability and the repair of DNA breaks through telomere healing as potent drivers of variant antigen diversification, thus associating basic mechanisms for maintaining genome integrity with aspects of host-parasite interactions. Here we applied long-read sequencing technology to precisely examine the dynamics of telomere addition and chromosome end stabilization in response to double-strand breaks within subtelomeric regions. We observed that the process of telomere healing induces the initial synthesis of telomere repeats well in excess of the minimal number required for end stability. However, once stabilized, these newly created telomeres appear to function normally, eventually returning to a length nearing that of intact chromosome ends. These results parallel recent observations in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for chromosome end repair.","2054":"Aloe vera is a species from Asphodelaceae family having characteristics like drought resistance and numerous medicinal properties. However, the genetic basis of these phenotypes is yet unknown primarily due to unavailability of its genome sequence. Thus, we report the first Aloe vera genome sequence comprising of 12.93 Gbp and harboring 86,177 protein-coding genes. It is the first genome from Asphodelaceae family and the largest angiosperm genome sequenced and assembled till date. We also report the first genome-wide phylogeny of monocots including Aloe vera to resolve its phylogenetic position. The comprehensive comparative analysis of Aloe vera with other available high-quality monocot genomes revealed adaptive evolution in several genes of drought stress response, CAM pathway, and circadian rhythm and positive selection in DNA damage response genes in Aloe vera. This study provides clues on the genetic basis of evolution of drought stress tolerance capabilities of Aloe vera.","2055":null,"2056":"Inheritance of chromatin-bound proteins theoretically plays a role in the epigenetic transmission of cellular phenotypes. Protein segregation during cell division is however poorly understood. We now describe TrIPP (Tracking the Inheritance Patterns of Proteins): a live cell imaging method for tracking maternal proteins during asymmetric cell divisions of budding yeast. Our analysis of the partitioning pattern of a test set of 18 chromatin-associated proteins reveals that abundant and moderately abundant maternal proteins segregate stochastically and symmetrically between the two cells with the exception of Rxt3p, Fpr4p, and Tup1p, which are preferentially retained in the mother. Low abundance proteins also tend to be retained in the mother cell with the exception of Sir2p and the linker histone H1. Our analysis of chromatin protein behavior in single cells reveals potentially general trends such as coupled protein synthesis and decay and a correlation between protein half-lives and cell-cycle duration.","2057":"The transcriptome analysis of injured Xenopus laevis tadpole and mice suggested that Neurod4L.S., a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was the most promising transcription factor to exert neuroregeneration after spinal cord injury (SCI) in mammals. We generated a pseudotyped retroviral vector with the neurotropic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) envelope to deliver murine Neurod4 to mice undergoing SCI. SCI induced ependymal cells to neural stem cells (NSCs) in the central canal. The LCMV envelope-based pseudotypedvector preferentially introduced Neurod4 into activated NSCs, which converted to neurons with axonal regrowth and suppressed the scar-forming glial lineage. Neurod4-induced inhibitory neurons predominantly projected to the subsynaptic domains of motor neurons at the epicenter, and Neurod4-induced excitatory neurons predominantly projected to subsynaptic domains of motor neurons caudal to the injury site suggesting the formation of functional synapses. Thus, Neurod4 is a potential therapeutic factor that can improve anatomical and functional recovery after SCI.","2058":"Granulosa cells (GCs) play a critical role in folliculogenesis. It remains unclear how GCs expand during follicle development and whether there is a subpopulation of cells that is responsible for GCs growth. Here, we observed that a small population of GCs expressed stem cell surface marker Procr (Protein C receptor). Procr GCs displayed higher proliferation ability and lower levels of hormone receptors compared with Procr- GCs. Knockdown of Procr inhibited proliferation. Lineage tracing experiments demonstrated that they contribute to increasing numbers of GCs during folliculogenesis. Targeted ablation of Procr+ cells disrupted ovarian follicle development, leading to phenotypes of polycystic ovary syndrome. Our findings suggest that Procr-expressing GCs are endowed with high proliferative capacity that is critical for follicle development.","2059":"Autonomous machines are poised to become pervasive, but most treat machines differently: we are willing to violate social norms and less likely to display altruism toward machines. Here, we report an unexpected effect that those impacted by COVID-19-as measured by a post-traumatic stress disorder scale-show a sharp reduction in this difference. Participants engaged in the dictator game with humans and machines and, consistent with prior research on disasters, those impacted by COVID-19 displayed more altruism to other humans. Unexpectedly, participants impacted by COVID-19 displayed equal altruism toward human and machine partners. A mediation analysis suggests that altruism toward machines was explained by an increase in heuristic thinking-reinforcing prior theory that heuristic thinking encourages people to treat machines like people-and faith in technology-perhaps reflecting long-term consequences on how we act with machines. These findings give insight, but also raise concerns, for the design of technology.","2060":null,"2061":null,"2062":"Recently, metasurface-based multichannel optical vortex arrays have attracted considerable interests due to its promising applications in high-dimensional information storage and high-secure information encryption. In addition to the well-known wavelength and polarization multiplexing technologies, the diffraction angle of light is an alternative typical physical dimension for multichannel optical vortex arrays. In this paper, based on angular multiplexing, we propose and demonstrate multichannel optical vortex arrays by using ultrathin geometric metasurface. For a circularly polarized incident light, the desired optical vortex arrays are successfully constructed in different diffraction regions. Moreover, the diffraction angle of the optical vortex array can be regulated by changing the illumination angle of incident light. Capitalizing on this advantage, the angular-multiplexed recombination of optical vortex array is further investigated. The combination of the diffraction angle of light and optical vortex array may have significant potential in applications of optical display, free-space optical communication, and optical manipulation.","2063":null,"2064":null,"2065":null,"2066":null,"2067":"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have a unique metabolic signature for maintenance of pluripotency, self-renewal, and survival. Although hPSCs could be potentially used in regenerative medicine, the prohibitive cost associated with large-scale cell culture presents a major barrier to the clinical application of hPSC. Moreover, without a fully characterized metabolic signature, hPSC culture conditions are not optimized. Here, we performed detailed amino acid profiling and found that tryptophan (TRP) plays a key role in the proliferation with maintenance of pluripotency. In addition, metabolome analyses revealed that intra- and extracellular kynurenine (KYN) is decreased under TRP-supplemented conditions, whereas N-formylkynurenine (NFK), the upstream metabolite of KYN, is increased thereby contributing to proliferation promotion. Taken together, we demonstrate that TRP is indispensable for survival and proliferation of hPSCs. A deeper understanding of TRP metabolism will enable cost-effective large-scale production of hPSCs, leading to advances in regenerative medicine.","2068":"The anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies rituximab and obinutuzumab differ in their mechanisms of action, with obinutuzumab evoking greater direct B cell death. To characterize the signaling processes responsible for improved B cell killing by obinutuzumab, we undertook a phosphoproteomics approach and demonstrate that rituximab and obinutuzumab differentially activate pathways downstream of the B cell receptor. Although both antibodies induce strong ERK and MYC activation sufficient to promote cell-cycle arrest and B cell death, obinutuzumab exceeds rituximab in supporting apoptosis induction by means of aberrant SYK phosphorylation. In contrast, rituximab elicits stronger anti-apoptotic signals by activating AKT, by impairing pro-apoptotic BAD, and by releasing membrane-bound NOTCH1 to up-regulate pro-survival target genes. As a consequence, rituximab appears to reinforce BCL2-mediated apoptosis resistance. The unexpected complexity and differences by which rituximab and obinutuzumab interfere with signaling pathways essential for lymphoma pathogenesis and treatment provide important impetus to optimize and personalize the application of different anti-CD20 treatments.","2069":"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exposed health care disparities in minority groups including Hispanics\/Latinxs (HL). Studies of COVID-19 risk factors for HL have relied on county-level data. We investigated COVID-19 risk factors in HL using individual-level, electronic health records in a Los Angeles health system between March 9, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Of 9,287 HL tested for SARS-CoV-2, 562 were positive. HL constituted an increasing percentage of all COVID-19 positive individuals as disease severity escalated. Multiple risk factors identified in Non-Hispanic\/Latinx whites (NHL-W), like renal disease, also conveyed risk in HL. Pre-existing nonrheumatic mitral valve disorder was a risk factor for HL hospitalization but not for NHL-W COVID-19 or HL influenza hospitalization, suggesting it may be a specific HL COVID-19 risk. Admission laboratory values also suggested that HL presented with a greater inflammatory response. COVID-19 risk factors for HL can help guide equitable government policies and identify at-risk populations.","2070":null,"2071":null,"2072":null,"2073":"Effective thermal regulation has shown great impacts on tremendous aspects of our life and manufacture. However, the invisible nature of thermal field brings us inconvenience or even security hazard. Herein, we present a method to visualize thermal distribution with the aid of a thermally active material. An ionic liquid with lower critical solution temperature is mixed within hydrogel to demonstrate a hydrogel confined ionic system (HCIS). This particular system turns turbid as the temperature exceeds an established temperature threshold, which is adjustable through applying different concentrations of HCl or NaCl. The system offers straightforward images of the spatial thermal distribution whether simple or sophisticated, which is fully in line with computational simulation. The system is further demonstrated with great promise for the application in fire warning to lower the threat induced by electrical failure. The HCIS opens a practical avenue to visualize thermal distribution and improve our thermal regulation efficiency.","2074":null,"2075":"Social hierarchy plays important roles in maintaining social structures. Despite similarity in concept, frameworks of human hierarchy have seldom been investigated in parallel with other animals. Moreover, the importance of subordination in hierarchical formation has been largely underestimated in previous research. Here we established, compared, and investigated hierarchy in children and weanling mice. Temperament assessments suggested that children who are less persistent, low emotional intensity, and withdrew easily were more likely to be subordinate in competitive scenarios independent of task characteristics and interaction experiences. The tube test further showed that conflicts between mice were not resolved by winner approach but by loser withdrawal, which was mainly determined by intrinsic subordinate status regardless of opponents. Our study presents evolutionary conserved hierarchical relationships in young and a critical role of the intrinsic subordinate characteristics in hierarchical determination. These findings provide a new perspective on social interactions with potential implications for preschool education.","2076":"Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are abundant and play important roles in the function of chromatin-associated proteins (CAPs). These regions are often found at the N- and C-termini of CAPs and between structured domains, where they can act as more than just linkers, directly contributing to function. IDRs have been shown to contribute to substrate binding, act as auto-regulatory regions, and drive liquid-liquid droplet formation. Their disordered nature provides increased functional diversity and allows them to be easily regulated through post-translational modification. However, these regions can be especially challenging to characterize on a structural level. Here, we review the prevalence of IDRs in CAPs, highlighting several studies that address their importance in CAP function and show progress in structural characterization of these regions. A focus is placed on the unique opportunity to apply nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy alongside cryo-electron microscopy to characterize IDRs in CAPs.","2077":null,"2078":"Dithiocarbamates (DTCs) have been used for various applications, including as hardening agents in rubber manufacturing, as fungicide in agriculture, and as medications to treat alcohol misuse disorder. The multi-faceted effects of DTCs rely mainly on metal binding abilities and a high reactivity with thiol groups. Therefore, the list of potential applications is still increasing, exemplified by the US Food and Drug Administration approval of disulfiram (Antabuse) and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate in clinical trials against cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, and Lyme disease, as well as new DTC-related compounds that have been synthesized to target diseases with unmet therapeutic needs. In this review, we will discuss the latest progress of DTCs as anti-cancer agents and provide a summary of the mechanisms of action. We will explain the expansion of DTCs' activity in the fields of microbiology, neurology, cardiology, and ophthalmology, thereby providing evidence for the important role and therapeutic potential of DTCs as innovative medical treatments.","2079":null,"2080":null,"2081":"Celastrol, a compound extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, has been reported as a potent anti-obesity agent with controversial mechanisms. Here both C57BL\/6J and leptin-deficient (ob\/ob) mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) displayed body weight loss after celastrol therapy, opposing the previous viewpoint that celastrol improves obesity by sensitizing leptin signaling. More importantly, celastrol downregulated lipid transporters in the intestine, increased lipid excretion in feces, and reduced body weight gain in HFD mice. Meanwhile, analysis of gut microbiota revealed that celastrol altered the gut microbiota composition in HFD-fed mice, and modulating gut microbiota by antibiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation blocked the celastrol effect on intestinal lipid transport and body weight gain, suggesting a critical role of the gut microbiota composition in mediating the anti-obesity role of celastrol under HFD. Together, the findings revealed that celastrol reduces intestinal lipid absorption to antagonize obesity by resetting the gut microbiota profile under HFD feeding.","2082":"Biofilms are surface-attached and matrix-enclosed microbial communities that dominate microbial life in numerous ecosystems. Using flumes and automated optical coherence tomography, we studied the morphogenesis of phototrophic biofilms along a gradient of hydraulic conditions. Compact and coalescent biofilms formed under elevated bed shear stress, whereas protruding clusters separated by troughs formed under reduced shear stress. This morphological differentiation did not linearly follow the hydraulic gradient, but a break point emerged around a shear stress of ~0.08 Pa. While community composition did not differ between high and low shear environments, our results suggest that the morphological differentiation was linked to biomass displacement and reciprocal interactions between the biofilm structure and hydraulics. Mapping oxygen concentrations within and around biofilm structures, we provide empirical evidence for biofilm-induced alterations of oxygen mass transfer. Our findings suggest that architectural plasticity, efficient mass transfer, and resistance to shear stress contribute to the success of phototrophic biofilms.","2083":null,"2084":null,"2085":"The altered molecular proteins and pathways in response to COVID-19 infection are still unclear. Here, we performed a comprehensive proteomics-based investigation of nasopharyngeal swab samples from patients with COVID-19 to study the host response by employing simple extraction strategies. Few of the host proteins such as interleukin-6, L-lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, Ferritin, and aspartate aminotransferase were found to be upregulated only in COVID-19-positive patients using targeted multiple reaction monitoring studies. The most important pathways identified by enrichment analysis were neutrophil degranulation, interleukin-12 signaling pathways, and mRNA translation of proteins thus providing the detailed investigation of host response in COVID-19 infection. Thus, we conclude that mass spectrometry-detected host proteins have a potential for disease severity progression; however, suitable validation strategies should be deployed for the clinical translation. Furthermore, the in silico docking of potential drugs with host proteins involved in the interleukin-12 signaling pathway might aid in COVID-19 therapeutic interventions.","2086":null,"2087":"Excessive consumption of high-fructose diets is associated with insulin resistance, obesity, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, fructose differentially affects hepatic regulation of lipogenesis in males and females. Hence, additional studies are necessary in order to find strategies taking gender disparities in fructose-induced liver damage into consideration. Although the eighth member of facilitated glucose transporters (GLUT8) has been linked to fructose-induced macrosteatosis in female mice, its contribution to the inflammatory state of NAFLD remains to be elucidated. Combining pharmacological, biochemical, and proteomic approaches, we evaluated the preventive effect of targeted liver GLUT8 silencing on liver injury in a mice female fructose-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis female mouse model. Liver GLUT8-knockdown attenuated fructose-induced ER stress, recovered liver inflammation, and dramatically reduced fatty acid content, in part, via the omega oxidation. Therefore, this study links GLUT8 with liver inflammatory response and suggests GLUT8 as a potential target for the prevention of NAFLD.","2088":"Glycolysis is a fundamental metabolic pathway for glucose catabolism across biology, and glycolytic enzymes are among the most abundant proteins in cells. Their expression at such levels provides a particular challenge. Here we demonstrate that the glycolytic mRNAs are localized to granules in yeast and human cells. Detailed live cell and smFISH studies in yeast show that the mRNAs are actively translated in granules, and this translation appears critical for the localization. Furthermore, this arrangement is likely to facilitate the higher level organization and control of the glycolytic pathway. Indeed, the degree of fermentation required by cells is intrinsically connected to the extent of mRNA localization to granules. On this basis, we term these granules, core fermentation (CoFe) granules; they appear to represent translation factories, allowing high-level coordinated enzyme synthesis for a critical metabolic pathway.","2089":null,"2090":null,"2091":null,"2092":null,"2093":"Lithium-ion battery technologies have conquered the current energy storage market as the most preferred choice thanks to their development in a longer lifetime. However, choosing the most suitable battery aging modeling methodology based on investigated lifetime characterization is still a challenge. In this work, a comprehensive aging dataset of nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide (NMC) cell is used to develop and\/or train different capacity fade models to compare output responses. The assessment is conducted for semi-empirical modeling (SeM) approach against a machine learning model and an artificial neural network model. Among all, the nonlinear autoregressive network (NARXnet) can predict the capacity degradation most precisely minimizing the computational effort as well. This research work signifies the importance of lifetime methodological choice and model performance in understanding the complex and nonlinear Li-ion battery aging behavior.","2094":"In natural habitats, plants have developed sophisticated regulatory mechanisms to optimize the photosynthetic electron transfer rate at the maximum efficiency and cope with the changing environments. Maintaining proper P700 oxidation at photosystem I (PSI) is the common denominator for most regulatory processes of photosynthetic electron transfers. However, the molecular complexes and cofactors involved in these processes and their function(s) have not been fully clarified. Here, we identified a redox-active chloroplast protein, the triplet-cysteine repeat protein (TCR). TCR shared similar expression profiles with known photosynthetic regulators and contained two triplet-cysteine motifs (CxxxCxxxC). Biochemical analysis indicated that TCR localizes in chloroplasts and has a [3Fe-4S] cluster. Loss of TCR limited the electron sink downstream of PSI during dark-to-light transition. Arabidopsis pgr5-tcr double mutant reduced growth significantly and showed unusual oxidation and reduction of plastoquinone pool. These results indicated that TCR is involved in electron flow(s) downstream of PSI, contributing to P700 oxidation.","2095":null,"2096":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101887.].","2097":null,"2098":"Complexity metrics and machine learning (ML) models have been utilized to analyze the lengths of segmental genomic entities of DNA sequences (exonic, intronic, intergenic, repeat, unique) with the purpose to ask questions regarding the segmental organization of the human genome within the size distribution of these sequences. For this we developed an integrated methodology that is based upon the reconstructed phase space theorem, the non-extensive statistical theory of Tsallis, ML techniques, and a technical index, integrating the generated information, which we introduce and named complexity factor (COFA). Our analysis revealed that the size distribution of the genomic regions within chromosomes are not random but follow patterns with characteristic features that have been seen through its complexity character, and it is part of the dynamics of the whole genome. Finally, this picture of dynamics in DNA is recognized using ML tools for clustering, classification, and prediction with high accuracy.","2099":null,"2100":null,"2101":"Reaching the climate targets set in the Paris Agreement on climate change requires decarbonizing all parts of the global economy. The electrification of industry processes-and more specifically, electrosynthesis (ES)-is an important decarbonization mechanism. To tap into this mechanism's potential and accelerate the decarbonization of these processes, I argue that public policy needs to perform two tasks. First, energy policy needs to enable the provision of CO2 emissions-free baseload electricity. Second, innovation policy needs to accelerate cost reductions for ES. Here, I discuss why this is the case, what the challenges are, how policy makers can address them, and how political ambition can be increased.","2102":"Human mitochondrial NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme (ME2) is well recognized to associate with cancer cell metabolism, and the single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of ME2 may play a role in enzyme regulation. Here we reported that the SNVs of ME2 occurring in the allosteric sites lead to inactivation or overactivation of ME2. Two ME2-SNVs, ME2_R67Q and ME2-R484W, that demonstrated inactivating or overactivating enzyme activities of ME2, respectively, have different impact toward the cells. The cells with overactivating SNV enzyme, ME2_R484W, grow more rapidly and are more resistant to cellular senescence than the cells with wild-type or inactivating SNV enzyme, ME2_R67Q. Crystal structures of these two ME2-SNVs reveal that ME2_R67Q was an inactivating \"dead form,\" and ME2_R484W was an overactivating \"closed form\" of the enzyme. The resolved ME2-SNV structures provide a molecular basis to explain the abnormal kinetic properties of these SNV enzymes.","2103":null,"2104":"The transition from liquid organic electrolytes to solid-state electrolytes promises safer and more energy-dense lithium ion batteries.

The method is compatible with existing lithium-ion battery electrode manufacturing lines and is able to produce uniform electrolyte films with thicknesses below 15 micrometers.","2105":null,"2106":null,"2107":null,"2108":null,"2109":"E-cigarette usage continues to rise, yet the safety of e-cigarette aerosols is questioned. Using murine models of acute and chronic e-cigarette aerosol inhalation, murine colon transcriptomics, and murine and human gut-derived organoids in co-culture models, we assessed the effects of e-cigarette use on the gut barrier. Histologic and transcriptome analyses revealed that chronic, but not acute, nicotine-free e-cigarette use increased inflammation and reduced expression of tight junction (TJ) markers. Exposure of murine and human enteroid-derived monolayers (EDMs) to nicotine-free e-cigarette aerosols alone or in co-culture with bacteria also causes barrier disruption, downregulation of TJ protein, and enhanced inflammation in response to infection. These data highlight the harmful effects of \"non-nicotine\" component of e-cigarettes on the gut barrier. Considering the importance of an intact gut barrier for host fitness and the impact of gut mucosal inflammation on a multitude of chronic diseases, these findings are broadly relevant to both medicine and public health.","2110":"Virtual and physical embodiments of interactive artificial agents utilize similar core technologies for perception, planning, and interaction and engage with people in similar ways. Thus, designers have typically considered these embodiments to be broadly interchangeable, and the choice of embodiment primarily depends on the practical demands of an application. This paper makes the case that virtual and physical embodiments elicit fundamentally different \"frames of mind\" in the users of the technology and follow different metaphors for interaction, resulting in diverging expectations, forms of engagement, and eventually interaction outcomes. It illustrates these differences through the lens of five key mechanisms: \"situativity, interactivity, agency, proxemics, and believability\". It also outlines the design implications of the two frames of mind, arguing for different domains of interaction serving as appropriate context for virtual and physical embodiments.","2111":"Cellular factories engage numerous highly complex \"molecular machines\" to perform pivotal biological functions. 3D structural visualization is an effective way to understand the functional mechanisms of these biomacromolecules. The \"resolution revolution\" has established cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) as a preferred structural biology tool. In parallel with the advances in cryo-EM methodologies aiming at atomic resolution, several innovative approaches have started emerging where other techniques are sensibly integrated with cryo-EM to obtain additional insights into the biological processes. For example, combining the time-resolved technique with high-resolution cryo-EM enables discerning structures of short-lived intermediates in the functional pathway of a biomolecule. Likewise, integrating mass spectrometry (MS) techniques with cryo-EM allows deciphering structural organizations of large molecular assemblies. Here, we discuss how the data generated upon combining either time resolve or MS techniques with cryo-EM supplement structural elucidations with in-depth understanding of the function of cellular macromolecules when they participate in fundamental biological processes.","2112":"Controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the mainstay of glaucoma therapy. The trabecular meshwork (TM), the key tissue responsible for aqueous humor (AH) outflow and IOP maintenance, is very sensitive to mechanical forces. However, it is not understood whether Piezo channels, very sensitive mechanosensors, functionally influence AH outflow. Here, we characterize the role of Piezo1 in conventional AH outflow. Immunostaining and western blot analysis showed that Piezo1 is widely expressed by TM. Patch-clamp recordings in TM cells confirmed the activation of Piezo1-derived mechanosensitive currents. Importantly, the antagonist GsMTx4 for mechanosensitive channels significantly decreased steady-state facility, yet activation of Piezo1 by the specific agonist Yoda1 did not lead to a facility change. Furthermore, GsMTx4, but not Yoda1, caused a significant increase in ocular compliance, a measure of the eye's transient response to IOP perturbation. Our findings demonstrate a potential role for Piezo1 in conventional outflow, likely under pathological and rapid transient conditions.","2113":null,"2114":null,"2115":null,"2116":"Gephyrin is critical for the structure, function, and plasticity of inhibitory synapses. Gephyrin mutations have been linked to various neurological disorders; however, systematic analyses of the functional consequences of these mutations are lacking. Here, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of gephyrin to predict how six reported point mutations might change the structural stability and\/or function of gephyrin. Additional in silico analyses revealed that the A91T and G375D mutations reduce the binding free energy of gephyrin oligomer formation. Gephyrin A91T and G375D displayed altered clustering patterns in COS-7 cells and nullified the inhibitory synapse-promoting effect of gephyrin in cultured neurons. However, only the G375D mutation reduced gephyrin interaction with GABAA receptors and neuroligin-2 in mouse brain; it also failed to normalize deficits in GABAergic synapse maintenance and neuronal hyperactivity observed in hippocampal dentate gyrus-specific gephyrin-deficient mice. Our results provide insights into biochemical, cell-biological, and network-activity effects of the pathogenic G375D mutation.","2117":"The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) are a group of 13 rare neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of cellular storage bodies. There are few therapeutic options, and existing tests do not monitor disease progression and treatment response. However, urine biomarkers could address this need. Proteomic analysis of CLN2 patient urine revealed activation of immune response pathways and pathways associated with the unfolded protein response. Analysis of CLN5 and CLN6 sheep model urine showed subtle changes. To confirm and investigate the relevance of candidate biomarkers a targeted LC-MS\/MS proteomic assay was created. We applied this assay to additional CLN2 samples as well as other patients with NCL (CLN1, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, and CLN7) and demonstrated that hexosaminidase-A, aspartate aminotransferase-1, and LAMP1 are increased in NCL samples and betaine-homocysteine S-methyltransferase-1 was specifically increased in patients with CLN2. These proteins could be used to monitor the effectiveness of future therapies aimed at treating systemic NCL disease.","2118":"Bacterial membrane vesicles (MVs) are attracting considerable attention in diverse fields of life science and biotechnology due to their potential for various applications. Although there has been progress in determining the mechanisms of MV formation in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, the mechanisms in mycolic acid-containing bacteria remain an unsolved question due to its complex cell envelope structure. Here, by adapting super-resolution live-cell imaging and biochemical analysis, we show that Corynebacterium glutamicum form distinct types of MVs via different routes in response to environmental conditions. DNA-damaging stress induced MV formation through prophage-triggered cell lysis, whereas envelope stress induced MV formation through mycomembrane blebbing. The MV formation routes were conserved in other mycolic acid-containing bacteria. Our results show how the complex cell envelope structure intrinsically generates various types of MVs and will advance our knowledge on how different types of MVs can be generated from a single cell organism.","2119":"We estimate the effects of transportation network companies (TNCs) Uber and Lyft on vehicle ownership, fleet average fuel economy, and transit use in U.S. urban areas using a set of difference-in-difference propensity score-weighted regression models that exploit staggered market entry across the U.S. from 2011 to 2017. We find evidence that TNC entry into urban areas causes an average 0.7% increase in vehicle registrations with significant heterogeneity in these effects across urban areas: TNC entry produces larger vehicle ownership increases in urban areas with higher initial ownership (car-dependent cities) and in urban areas with lower population growth (where TNC-induced vehicle adoption outpaces population growth). We also find no statistically significant average effect of TNC entry on fuel economy or transit use but find evidence of heterogeneity in these effects across urban areas, including larger transit ridership reductions after TNC entry in areas with higher income and more childless households.","2120":null,"2121":"To dissect the mechanisms underlying the inflation of variants in the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome, we present a large-scale analysis of intra-host genomic diversity, which reveals that most samples exhibit heterogeneous genomic architectures, due to the interplay between host-related mutational processes and transmission dynamics. The decomposition of minor variants profiles unveils three non-overlapping mutational signatures related to nucleotide substitutions and likely ruled by APOlipoprotein B Editing Complex (APOBEC), Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR), highlighting heterogeneous host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. A corrected-for-signatures dN\/dS analysis demonstrates that such mutational processes are affected by purifying selection, with important exceptions. In fact, several mutations appear to transit toward clonality, defining new clonal genotypes that increase the overall genomic diversity. Furthermore, the phylogenomic analysis shows the presence of homoplasies and supports the hypothesis of transmission of minor variants. This study paves the way for the integrated analysis of intra-host genomic diversity and clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infections.","2122":"The availability of a safe and effective vaccine would be the eventual measure to deal with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) threat. Here, we have assessed the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates BBV152A, BBV152B, and BBV152C in Syrian hamsters. Three dose vaccination regimes with vaccine candidates induced significant titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies. BBV152A and BBV152B vaccine candidates remarkably generated a quick and robust immune response. Post-SARS-CoV-2 infection, vaccinated hamsters did not show any histopathological changes in the lungs. The protection of the hamster was evident by the rapid clearance of the virus from lower respiratory tract, reduced virus load in upper respiratory tract, absence of lung pathology, and robust humoral immune response. These findings confirm the immunogenic potential of the vaccine candidates and further protection of hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Of the three candidates, BBV152A showed the better response.","2123":null,"2124":null,"2125":"Bile acids are metabolites of cholesterol that facilitate lipid digestion and absorption in the small bowel. Bile acids work as agonists of receptors to regulate their own metabolism. Bile acids also regulate other biological systems such as sugar metabolism, intestinal multidrug resistance, and adaptive immunity. However, numerous physiological roles of bile acids remain undetermined. In this study, we solved the crystal structure of human serine hydroxymethyltransferase (hSHMT) in complex with an endogenous secondary bile acid glycine conjugate. The specific interaction between hSHMT and the ligand was demonstrated using mutational analyses, biophysical measurements, and structure-activity relationship studies, suggesting that secondary bile acid conjugates may act as modulators of SHMT activity.","2126":"Behavioral flexibility is a critical ability allowing animals to respond to changes in their environment. Previous studies have found evidence of inflexibility when captive chimpanzees are faced with changing task parameters. We provided two groups of sanctuary-housed chimpanzees with a foraging task in which solutions were restricted over time. Initially, juice could be retrieved from within a tube by hand or by using tool materials, but effective solutions were then restricted by narrowing the tube, necessitating the abandonment of previous solutions and adoption of new ones. Chimpanzees responded flexibly, but one group increased their use of effective techniques to a greater extent than the other. Tool-composite techniques emerged in both groups, but primarily in the more flexible group. The more flexible group also showed higher rates of socio-positive behaviors at the task. In conjunction, these findings support the hypothesis that social tolerance may facilitate the emergence and spread of novel behaviors.","2127":"Although recent evidence suggests the involvement of iron accumulation in the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Previously, we reported a unique histological structure termed \"crown-like structure (CLS),\" where liver-resident macrophages (Kupffer cells) surround dead hepatocytes, scavenge their debris, and induce inflammation and fibrosis in NASH. In this study, using magnetic column separation, we show that iron-rich Kupffer cells exhibit proinflammatory and profibrotic phenotypic changes during the development of NASH, at least partly, through activation of MiT\/TFE transcription factors. Activation of MiT\/TFE transcription factors is observed in Kupffer cells forming CLSs in murine and human NASH. Iron chelation effectively attenuates liver fibrosis in a murine NASH model. This study provides insight into the pathophysiologic role of iron in NASH. Our data also shed light on a unique macrophage subset rich in iron that contributes to CLS formation and serves as a driver of liver fibrosis.","2128":"Mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction is linked to rare diseases (RDs) such as respiratory chain complex (RCC) deficiency, MELAS, and ARSACS. Yet, how altered mt protein networks contribute to these ailments remains understudied. In this perspective article, we identified 21 mt proteins from public repositories that associate with RCC deficiency, MELAS, or ARSACS, engaging in a relatively small number of protein-protein interactions (PPIs), underscoring the need for advanced proteomic and interactomic platforms to uncover the complete scope of mt connectivity to RDs. Accordingly, we discuss innovative untargeted label-free proteomics in identifying RD-specific mt or other macromolecular assemblies and mapping of protein networks in complex tissue, organoid, and stem cell-differentiated neurons. Furthermore, tag- and label-based proteomics, genealogical proteomics, and combinatorial affinity purification-mass spectrometry, along with advancements in detecting and integrating transient PPIs with single-cell proteomics and transcriptomics, collectively offer seminal follow-ups to enrich for RD-relevant networks, with implications in RD precision medicine.","2129":null,"2130":"Plasmonic metal nanostructures (PMNs) are characterized by the plasmon oscillation of conduction band electron in response to external radiation, enabling strong light absorption and scattering capacities and near-field amplification. Owing to these enhanced light-matter interactions, PMNs have garnered extensive research interest in the past decades. Notably, a growingly large number of reports show that the energetics and kinetics of chemical transformations on PMNs can be modified upon photoexcitation of their plasmons, giving rise to a new paradigm of manipulating the reaction rate and selectivity of chemical reactions. On the other hand, there is urgent need to achieve clear understanding of the mechanism underlying the photo-mediated chemical transformations on PMNs for unleashing their full potential in converting solar energy to chemicals. In this perspective, we review current fundamental concepts of photo-mediated chemical transformations executed at PMNs. Three pivotal mechanistic questions, i.e., thermal and nonthermal effects, direct and indirect charge transfer processes, and the specific impacts of plasmon-induced potentials, are explored based on recent studies. We highlight the critical aspects in which major advancements should be made to facilitate the rational design and optimization of photo-mediated chemical transformations on PMNs in the future.","2131":"A growing advocacy of healthy and quality life makes wearable electronics spring up. Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has developed as an energy harvesting technology and as an advanced sensor technology in wearable electronics. The triboelectric sensor (TS) is sensitive to the mechanical motion and driven by the motion itself. Therefore, TS is capable of monitoring certain vital signs and kinds of movements of human body. Based on these monitoring, novel human-machine interfaces (HMIs) can be established. In this review, a comprehensive overview of some key progresses in this field over last 5 years are presented. Several main aspects of biomedical monitoring based on TSs are classified: pulse\/cardiac\/micro-motion, respiration\/airflow\/vibration, and pressure\/tactile\/body movement. The major types of HMIs taking these biomedical monitoring as basis are introduced accordingly: eye movement, voice\/auditory, gesture\/joint movement, and touch\/tactile based HMIs. Finally, the current limitations and future trends are put forward for biomedical monitoring and HMIs based on TSs.","2132":"Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1)-positive pancreatic cancer stem cells develop at a precancerous stage and may contribute to the lack of efficacy of pancreatic cancer therapy. Although PanIN cells express oncogenic KRas and have an increased activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we demonstrate that, in DCLK1+ PanIN cells, EGFR signaling is not propagated to the nucleus. Mimicking blockage of EGFR with erlotinib in PanIN organoid culture or in p48cre;KrasG12D mice led to a significant increase in DCLK1+ PanIN cells. As a mechanism of how EGFR inhibition leads to formation of DCLK1+ cells, we identify an increase in hydrogen peroxide contributing to activation of Protein Kinase D1 (PKD1). Active PKD1 then drives stemness and abundance of DCLK1+ cells in lesions. Our data suggest a signaling mechanism that leads to the development of DCLK1+ pancreatic cancer stem cells, which can be exploited to target this population in potential therapeutic approaches.","2133":null,"2134":"Eukaryotic cells position the nucleus within the proper intracellular space, thereby safeguarding a variety of cellular processes. In fission yeast, the interphase nucleus is placed in the cell middle in a microtubule-dependent manner. By contrast, how the mitotic nucleus is positioned remains elusive. Here we show that several cell-cycle mutants that arrest in mitosis all displace the nucleus toward one end of the cell. Intriguingly, the actin cytoskeleton is responsible for nuclear movement. Time-lapse live imaging indicates that mitosis-specific F-actin cables possibly push the nucleus through direct interaction with the nuclear envelope, and subsequently actomyosin ring constriction further shifts the nucleus away from the center. This nuclear movement is beneficial, because if the nuclei were retained in the center, unseparated chromosomes would be intersected by the contractile actin ring and the septum, imposing the lethal cut phenotype. Thus, fission yeast escapes from mitotic catastrophe by means of actin-dependent nuclear movement.","2135":null,"2136":"Electronic devices play vital role in modern civilization.

More uniquely, liquid metal printing allows customize electronic products on demand to fabricate electronics spanning from 2D plane surface to 3D structure and on any desired substrates. This deems it to reshape modern electronics and integrated circuits field. So far, a variety of technological breakthroughs in this new generation electronic engineering area have been made in the process of developing various liquid metal functional inks, printing machines and applications, which significantly stimulate the quick incubation and formation of a new electronic industry. Clearly, sorting out the major R&amp;D directions and clarifying future challenges is crucial for the large scale industrialization of LMPE.

Among these genes, AMBN and ENAM are found in both sarcopterygians and actinopterygians, whereas AMEL and SCPP5 are found only in sarcopterygians and actinopterygians, respectively. Actinopterygian AMBN, ENAM, and SCPP5 are expressed during the formation of hypermineralized tissues on scales and teeth: ganoin, acrodin, and collar enamel in gar, and acrodin and collar enameloid in zebrafish. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate the emergence of an ancestral enamel in stem-osteichthyans, whereas ganoin emerged in stem-actinopterygians and true enamel in stem-sarcopterygians. Thus, AMBN and ENAM originated in concert with ancestral enamel, SCPP5 evolved in association with ganoin, and AMEL evolved with true enamel. Shifts in gene expression domain and timing explain the evolution of different hypermineralized tissues. We propose that hypermineralized tissues in osteichthyans coevolved with matrix SCPP genes.","2138":"Chaperonins play an important role in folding newly synthesized or translocated proteins in all organisms. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL has served as a model system for the understanding of these proteins. In comparison, its human homolog, known as mitochondrial heat shock protein family member D1 (HSPD1) is poorly understood. Here, we present the structure of HSPD1 in the apo state determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Unlike GroEL, HSPD1 forms mostly single ring assemblies in the absence of co-chaperonin (HSPE1). Comparison with GroEL shows a rotation and increased flexibility of the apical domain. Together with published structures of the HSPD1\/HSPE1 co-chaperonin complex, this work gives insight into the structural changes that occur during the catalytic cycle. This new understanding of HSPD1 structure and its rearrangements upon complex formation may provide new insights for the development of HSPD1-targeting treatments against a diverse range of diseases including glioblastoma.","2139":null,"2140":"Innovation in clean-energy technologies is central toward a net-zero energy system. One key determinant of technological innovation is the integration of external knowledge, i.e., knowledge spillovers.

We ask how knowledge from other technologies, sectors, or scientific disciplines is integrated into the innovation process in an important technology for a net-zero future: lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), based on a qualitative case study using extant literature and an elite interview campaign with key inventors in the LIB field and R&amp;D\/industry experts. We identify the breakthrough innovations in LIBs, discuss the extent to which breakthrough innovations-plus a few others-have resulted from spillovers, and identify different mechanisms and enablers underlying these spillovers, which can be leveraged by policymakers and R&amp;D managers who are interested in facilitating spillovers in LIBs and other clean-energy technologies.","2141":null,"2142":"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has increased concern about people's mental health under such serious stressful situation, especially depressive symptoms.

An out-expectation result showed that a more negative memory bias was associated with a greater decrease in future depressive indices in nonclinical depressed participants during the COVID-19 pandemic, which might be due to decreased social stress. These data enhance our understanding of how the depressive degree of nonclinical depressed populations will change during the COVID-19 pandemic and also provide support for social distancing policies from a psychological perspective.","2143":null,"2144":"Metal-consuming countries depend on mining activity in other countries, which may impose potential pressure on sustainable metal supply. This study proposes an approach to analyze the responsibility of consuming countries for mining activities based on the decomposition analysis of scarcity-weighted metal footprints (S-MFs) of Japan. The application results to the Japanese final demand (iron, copper, and nickel) demonstrate the significance of country- and metal-specific conditions in terms of metal footprints and mining capacity in assessing the responsibility of consuming countries. Consuming countries can identify influential factors to reduce their S-MFs based on the decomposition analysis by discriminating the directly controllable and uncontrollable factors for consuming countries, which can help to plan different countermeasures depending on the types of the identified influential factors. The proposed approach supports metal-consuming countries to determine the effective options for reducing the responsibility for the sustainability of metal supply.","2145":"Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is considered as a potential solution to harvest distributed energy for the sustainable and reliable power supply of the internet of things. Although numerous researches on alternating current (AC) output TENG from fundamental physics to potential applications have been widely promoted in recent years, the studies about direct current (DC) output TENG is just beginning, especially for a constant current output. This work gives the summary of recent key researches from AC-TENG to DC-TENG, especially a constant current TENG, as well as the design of AC\/DC-TENG. In addition, some new DC generators will also be summarized toward a wide range of readers.

Here, we combined stable isotope-assisted metabolomics (SIAM) and 13C-DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) to investigate bisphenol S (BPS) enhanced degradation by electroactive mixed-culture biofilms (EABs). Using SIAM, six 13C fully labeled transformation products were detected originating via hydrolysis, oxidation, alkylation, or aromatic ring-cleavage reactions from 13C-BPS, suggesting hydrolysis and oxidation as the initial and key degradation pathways for the electrochemical degradation process. The DNA-SIP results further displayed high 13C-DNA accumulation in the genera Bacteroides and Cetobacterium from the EABs and indicated their ability in the assimilation of BPS or its metabolites. Collectively, network analysis showed that the collaboration between electroactive microbes and BPS assimilators played pivotal roles the improvement in bioelectrochemically enhanced BPS degradation.","2149":"It is an ultimate goal in chemistry to predict reaction without recourse to experiment. Reaction prediction is not just the reaction rate determination of known reactions but, more broadly, the reaction exploration to identify new reaction routes. This review briefly overviews the theory on chemical reaction and the current methods for computing\/estimating reaction rate and exploring reaction space. We particularly focus on the atomistic simulation methods for reaction exploration, which are benefited significantly by recently emerged machine learning potentials. We elaborate the stochastic surface walking global pathway sampling based on the global neural network (SSW-NN) potential, developed in our group since 2013, which can explore complex reactions systems unbiasedly and automatedly. Two examples, molecular reaction and heterogeneous catalytic reactions, are presented to illustrate the current status for reaction prediction using SSW-NN.","2150":"Secreted chemokines are critical mediators of cellular communication that elicit intracellular signaling by binding membrane-bound receptors. Here we demonstrate the development and use of a sensitive real-time approach to quantify secretion and receptor binding of native chemokines in live cells to better understand their molecular interactions and function. CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing was used to tag the chemokine CXCL12 with the nanoluciferase fragment HiBiT. CXCL12 secretion was subsequently monitored and quantified by luminescence output. Binding of tagged CXCL12 to either chemokine receptors or membrane glycosaminoglycans could be monitored due to the steric constraints of nanoluciferase complementation. Furthermore, binding of native CXCL12-HiBiT to AlexaFluor488-tagged CXCR4 chemokine receptors could also be distinguished from glycosaminoglycan binding and pharmacologically analyzed using BRET. These live cell approaches combine the sensitivity of nanoluciferase with CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing to detect, quantify, and monitor binding of low levels of native secreted proteins in real time.","2151":"Hypoxia is one of the critical stressors encountered by various cells of the human body under diverse pathophysiologic conditions including cancer and has profound impacts on several metabolic and physiologic processes. Hypoxia prompts internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation of key genes, such as VEGF, that are vital for tumor progression. Here, we describe that hypoxia remarkably upregulates RNA Polymerase I activity. We discovered that in hypoxia, rRNA shows a different methylation pattern compared to normoxia. Heterogeneity in ribosomes due to the diversity of ribosomal RNA and protein composition has been postulated to generate \"specialized ribosomes\" that differentially regulate translation. We find that in hypoxia, a sub-set of differentially methylated ribosomes recognizes the VEGF-C IRES, suggesting that ribosomal heterogeneity allows for altered ribosomal functions in hypoxia.","2152":"Circadian rhythms regulate adaptive alterations in mammalian physiology and are maximally entrained by the short wavelength blue spectrum; cataracts block the transmission of light, particularly blue light. Cataract surgery is performed with two types of intraocular lenses (IOL): (1) conventional IOL that transmit the entire visible spectrum and (2) blue-light-filtering (BF) IOL that block the short wavelength blue spectrum. We hypothesized that the transmission properties of IOL are associated with long-term survival. This retrospective cohort study of a 15-hospital healthcare system identified 9,108 participants who underwent bilateral cataract surgery; 3,087 were implanted with conventional IOL and 6,021 received BF-IOL. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models that included several a priori determined subgroup and sensitivity analyses yielded estimates supporting that conventional IOL compared with BF-IOL may be associated with significantly reduced risk of long-term death. Confirming these differences and identifying any potential causal mechanisms await the conduct of appropriately controlled prospective translational trials.","2153":"Implant devices have = proven a successful treatment modality in reconstructive surgeries. However, increasing rates of peri-implant diseases demand further examination of their pathogenesis. Polymicrobial biofilm formation on titanium surfaces has been considered the main risk factor for inflammatory processes on tissues surrounding implant devices, which often lead to implant failure. To overcome microbial accumulation on titanium surfaces biofilm targeting strategies have been developed to modify the surface and incorporate antimicrobial coatings. Because antibiotics are widely used to treat polymicrobial infections, these agents have recently started to be incorporated on titanium surface. This review discusses the biofilm formation on titanium dental implants and key factors to be considered in therapeutic and preventative strategies. Moreover, a systematic review was conducted on coatings developed for titanium surfaces using different antibiotics. This review will also shed light on potential alternative strategies aiming to reduce microbial loads and control polymicrobial infection on implanted devices.","2154":null,"2155":null,"2156":null,"2157":null,"2158":null,"2159":"The biological carbon pump, in which carbon fixed by photosynthesis is exported to the deep ocean through sinking, is a major process in Earth's carbon cycle. The proportion of primary production that is exported is termed the carbon export efficiency (CEE). Based on in-lab or regional scale observations, viruses were previously suggested to affect the CEE (i.e., viral \"shunt\" and \"shuttle\"). In this study, we tested associations between viral community composition and CEE measured at a global scale. A regression model based on relative abundance of viral marker genes explained 67% of the variation in CEE. Viruses with high importance in the model were predicted to infect ecologically important hosts. These results are consistent with the view that the viral shunt and shuttle functions at a large scale and further imply that viruses likely act in this process in a way dependent on their hosts and ecosystem dynamics.","2160":"Although high-performance carbon materials are widely used in surface engineering, with emphasis on carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the application of CNT nanocomposites on medical surfaces is poorly documented. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of CNT-based surfaces. For this purpose, a PRISMA-oriented systematic review was conducted based on predefined criteria and 59 studies were selected for the qualitative analysis. Results from the analyzed studies suggest that surfaces containing modified CNTs, and specially CNTs conjugated with different polymers, exhibited strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities. These composites seem to preserve the CNT toxicity to microorganisms and promote CNT-cell interactions, as well as to protect them from nonspecific protein adsorption. However, CNTs cannot yet compete with the conventional strategies to fight biofilms as their toxicity profile on the human body has not been thoroughly addressed. This review can be helpful for the development of new engineered medical surfaces.","2161":"Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor are frequent causes of cancer. Because p53 aggregates appear in some tumor cells, it has been suggested that p53 could also cause cancer by forming self-replicating protein aggregates (prions). Here, using yeast, we show that transient p53 overexpression induced the formation of p53 prion aggregates that were transmitted for &gt;100 generations, found in lysate pellets, stained with Thioflavin T, and transmitted by cytoplasmic transfer, or transfection with lysates of cells carrying the prion or with p53 amyloid peptide. As predicted for a prion, transient interruption of p53 expression caused permanent p53 prion loss. Importantly, p53 transcription factor activity was reduced by prion formation suggesting that prion aggregation could cause cancer. p53 has also been found in liquid-like nuclear droplets in animal cell culture. In yeast, we found that liquid-like p53 foci appear in response to stress and disappear with stress removal.","2162":"The transcription factor Aristaless-related X-linked gene (Arx) is a monogenic factor in early onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) and a fundamental regulator of early stages of brain development. However, Arx expression persists in mature GABAergic neurons with an unknown role. To address this issue, we generated a conditional knockout (CKO) mouse in which postnatal Arx was ablated in parvalbumin interneurons (PVIs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings in CKO mice revealed an increase in theta oscillations and the occurrence of occasional seizures. Behavioral analysis uncovered an increase in anxiety. Genome-wide sequencing of fluorescence activated cell sorted (FACS) PVIs revealed that Arx impinged on network excitability via genes primarily associated with synaptic and extracellular matrix pathways. Whole-cell recordings revealed prominent hypoexcitability of various intrinsic and synaptic properties. These results revealed important roles for postnatal Arx expression in PVIs in the control of neural circuits and that dysfunction in those roles alone can cause EOEE-like network abnormalities.","2163":"Siglecs (sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig)-like lectins) constitute a group of 15 human and 9 murine cell-surface transmembrane receptors belonging to the I-type lectin family, mostly expressed on innate immune cells and characterized by broadly similar structural features. Here, the prominent inhibitory CD22 (Siglec-2), well known in maintaining tolerance and preventing autoimmune responses on B cells, is studied in its human and murine forms in complex with sialoglycans. In detail, the role of the N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) moiety in the interaction with both orthologues was explored. The analysis of the binding mode was carried out by the combination of NMR spectroscopy, computational approaches, and CORCEMA-ST calculations. Our findings provide a first model of Neu5Gc recognition by h-CD22 and show a comparable molecular recognition profile by h- and m-CD22. These data open the way to innovative diagnostic and\/or therapeutic methodologies to be used in the modulation of the immune responses.","2164":"Automated seizure detection in long-term video-EEG recordings is far from being integrated into common clinical practice. Here, we leverage classical and state-of-the-art complexity measures to robustly and automatically detect seizures from scalp recordings. Brain activity is scored through eight features, encompassing traditional time domain and novel measures of recurrence. A binary classification algorithm tailored to treat unbalanced dataset is used to determine whether a time window is ictal or non-ictal from its features. The application of the algorithm on a cohort of ten adult patients with focal refractory epilepsy indicates sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 90%, along with a true alarm rate of 95% and less than four false alarms per day. The proposed approach emphasizes ictal patterns against noisy background without the need of data preprocessing. Finally, we benchmark our approach against previous studies on two publicly available datasets, demonstrating the good performance of our algorithm.","2165":"Histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) play critical roles in oncogenesis and therefore may be effective targets for anticancer therapy. Using a time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer demethylation screen assay, in combination with multiple orthogonal validation approaches, we identified geldanamycin and its analog 17-DMAG as KDM inhibitors. In addition, we found that these Hsp90 inhibitors increase degradation of the alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (aRMS) driver oncoprotein PAX3-FOXO1 and induce the repressive epigenetic mark H3K9me3 and H3K36me3 at genomic loci of PAX3-FOXO1 targets. We found that as monotherapy 17-DMAG significantly inhibits expression of PAX3-FOXO1 target genes and multiple oncogenic pathways, induces a muscle differentiation signature, delays tumor growth and extends survival in aRMS xenograft mouse models. The combination of 17-DMAG with conventional chemotherapy significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy, indicating that targeting KDM in combination with chemotherapy may serve as a therapeutic approach to PAX3-FOXO1-positive aRMS.","2166":"Social robots that can interact and communicate with people are growing in popularity for use at home and in customer-service, education, and healthcare settings. Although growing evidence suggests that co-operative and emotionally aligned social robots could benefit users across the lifespan, controversy continues about the ethical implications of these devices and their potential harms. In this perspective, we explore this balance between benefit and risk through the lens of human-robot relationships. We review the definitions and purposes of social robots, explore their philosophical and psychological status, and relate research on human-human and human-animal relationships to the emerging literature on human-robot relationships. Advocating a relational rather than essentialist view, we consider the balance of benefits and harms that can arise from different types of relationship with social robots and conclude by considering the role of researchers in understanding the ethical and societal impacts of social robotics.","2167":"The use of remdesivir to treat COVID-19 will likely continue before clinical trials are completed. Due to the lengthening pandemic and evolving nature of the virus, predicting potential residues prone to mutation is crucial for the management of remdesivir resistance. Using a rational ligand-based interface design complemented with mutational mapping, we generated a total of 100,000 mutations and provided insight into the functional outcomes of mutations in the remdesivir-binding site in nsp12 subunit of RdRp. After designing 46 residues in the remdesivir-binding site of nsp12, the designs retained 97%-98% sequence identity, suggesting that very few mutations in nsp12 are required for SARS-CoV-2 to attain remdesivir resistance. Several mutants displayed decreased binding affinity to remdesivir, suggesting drug resistance. These hotspot residues had a higher probability of undergoing selective mutation and thus conferring remdesivir resistance. Identifying the potential residues prone to mutation improves our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 drug resistance and COVID-19 pathogenesis.","2168":null,"2169":null,"2170":null,"2171":null,"2172":"Wearable electronics are becoming increasingly important for medical applications as they have revolutionized the way physiological parameters are monitored. Ferroelectric materials show spontaneous polarization below the Curie temperature, which changes with electric field, temperature, and mechanical deformation. Therefore, they have been widely used in sensor and actuator applications. In addition, these materials can be used for conversion of human-body energy into electricity for powering wearable electronics. In this paper, we review the recent advances in flexible ferroelectric materials for wearable human energy harvesting and sensing. To meet the performance requirements for medical applications, the most suitable materials and manufacturing techniques are reviewed. The approaches used to enhance performance and achieve long-term sustainability and multi-functionality by integrating other active sensing mechanisms (e.g. triboelectric and piezoresistive effects) are discussed. Data processing and transmission as well as the contribution of wearable piezoelectric devices in early disease detection and monitoring vital signs are reviewed.","2173":null,"2174":null,"2175":"Semiconductor-in-glass composites are an exciting class of photonic materials for various fundamental applications. The significant challenge is the scalable elaboration of composite with the desirable combination of tunable structure, high semiconductor loading ratio, and excellent transparency. Here we report that the topological engineering strategy via hybridization of the glass network former enables to surmount the aforementioned challenge. It not only facilitates the in situ precipitation of (Ga2-xAlx)O3 domains with continuously tunable composition but also allows to simultaneously refine the grain size and enhance the crystallinity. In addition, the composites exhibit excellent transparency and can host various active dopants. We demonstrate the attractive broadband optical response of the composite and achieve the pulse laser operation in mid-infrared waveband. The findings are expected to provide a fundamental principle of in situ modification in hybrid system for generation of high-performance semiconductor-in-glass composites.","2176":"Classical conditioning plays a critical role in the learning process of biological brains, and many computational models have been built to reproduce the related classical experiments. However, these models can reproduce and explain only a limited range of typical phenomena in classical conditioning. Based on existing biological findings concerning classical conditioning, we build a brain-inspired classical conditioning (BICC) model. Compared with other computational models, our BICC model can reproduce as many as 15 classical experiments, explaining a broader set of findings than other models have, and offers better computational explainability for both the experimental phenomena and the biological mechanisms of classical conditioning. Finally, we validate our theoretical model on a humanoid robot in three classical conditioning experiments (acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition) and a speed generalization experiment, and the results show that our model is computationally feasible as a foundation for brain-inspired robot classical conditioning.","2177":"Brain neurons play a central role in organismal aging, but there is conflicting evidence about the role of neuronal glucose availability because glucose uptake and metabolism are associated with both aging and extended life span. Here, we analyzed metabolic changes in the brain neurons of Drosophila during aging. Using a genetically encoded fluorescent adenosine triphosphate (ATP) biosensor, we found decreased ATP concentration in the neuronal somata of aged flies, correlated with decreased glucose content, expression of glucose transporter and glycolytic enzymes and mitochondrial quality. The age-associated reduction in ATP concentration did not occur in brain neurons with suppressed glycolysis or enhanced glucose uptake, suggesting these pathways contribute to ATP reductions. Despite age-associated mitochondrial damage, increasing glucose uptake maintained ATP levels, suppressed locomotor deficits, and extended the life span. Increasing neuronal glucose uptake during dietary restriction resulted in the longest life spans, suggesting an additive effect of enhancing glucose availability during a bioenergetic challenge on aging.","2178":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are naturally produced by several redox reactions during plant regular metabolism such as photosynthesis and respiration. Due to their chemical properties and high reactivity, ROS were initially described as detrimental for cells during oxidative stress. However, they have been further recognized as key players in numerous developmental and physiological processes throughout the plant life cycle. Recent studies report the important role of ROS as growth regulators during plant root developmental processes such as in meristem maintenance, in root elongation, and in lateral root, root hair, endodermis, and vascular tissue differentiation. All involve multifaceted interplays between steady-state levels of ROS with transcriptional regulators, phytohormones, and nutrients. In this review, we attempt to summarize recent findings about how ROS are involved in multiple stages of plant root development during cell proliferation, elongation, and differentiation.","2179":null,"2180":null,"2181":null,"2182":null,"2183":"Bioelectronic devices that convert biochemical signals to electronic readout enable biosensing with high spatiotemporal resolution. These technologies have been primarily applied in biomedicine while in plants sensing is mainly based on invasive methods that require tissue sampling, hindering in-vivo detection and having poor spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we developed enzymatic biosensors based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) for in-vivo and real-time monitoring of sugar fluctuations in the vascular tissue of trees. The glucose and sucrose OECT-biosensors were implanted into the vascular tissue of trees and were operated through a low-cost portable unit for 48hr. Our work consists a proof-of-concept study where implantable OECT-biosensors not only allow real-time monitoring of metabolites in plants but also reveal new insights into diurnal sugar homeostasis. We anticipate that this work will contribute to establishing bioelectronic technologies as powerful minimally invasive tools in plant science, agriculture and forestry.","2184":null,"2185":"Social insects exhibit extensive phenotypic diversities among the genetically similar individuals, suggesting a role for the epigenetic regulations beyond the genome level. The ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, facilitates adaptive evolution by expanding proteomic diversities. Here, we characterize the A-to-I RNA editome of honeybees (Apis mellifera), identifying 407 high-confidence A-to-I editing sites. Editing is most abundant in the heads and shows signatures for positive selection. Editing behavior differs between foragers and nurses, suggesting a role for editing in caste differentiation. Although only five sites are conserved between bees and flies, an unexpectedly large number of genes exhibit editing in both species, albeit at different locations, including the nonsynonymous auto-editing of Adar. This convergent evolution, where the same target genes independently acquire recoding events in distant diverged clades, together with the signals of adaptation observed in honeybees alone, further supports the notion of recoding being adaptive.","2186":null,"2187":"Cell-cell communication is an essential attribute of multicellular organisms. The effects of perturbed communication were studied in septal protein mutants of the heterocyst-forming filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 model organism. Strains bearing sepJ and sepJ\/fraC\/fraD deletions showed differences in growth, pigment absorption spectra, and spatial patterns of expression of the hetR gene encoding a heterocyst differentiation master regulator. Global changes in gene expression resulting from deletion of those genes were mapped by RNA sequencing analysis of wild-type and mutant strains, both under nitrogen-replete and nitrogen-poor conditions. The effects of sepJ and fraC\/fraD deletions were non-additive, and perturbed cell-cell communication led to significant changes in global gene expression. Most significant effects, related to carbon metabolism, included increased expression of genes encoding carbon uptake systems and components of the photosynthetic apparatus, as well as decreased expression of genes encoding cell wall components related to heterocyst differentiation and to polysaccharide export.","2188":"Chloride-ion battery (CIB) is regarded as a promising electrochemical storage device due to their high theoretical volumetric capacities, low cost, and high abundance. However, low-cycle life limits its application in the energy storage field. Herein, we report a rechargeable CIB composed of a \"water-in-salt\" electrolyte, a zinc anode, and a carbon cathode (graphene, carbon nanotubes, carbon black). These cathodes exhibit initial reversible specific capacities of 136, 108, and 102 mAh g-1, respectively. Especially, a reversible discharge capacity of 95 mAh g-1 was retained after 2000 cycles when graphene is used as the cathode. Such high cycling stability was first reported in CIBs. Furthermore, the use of \"water-in-salt\" electrolytes has improved the discharge platform of aqueous CIBs to 2.6V. The charge and discharge mechanism of the carbon cathode was investigated by TEM, FTIR, Raman, and XPS, proving the chloride ions reversible absorption\/desorption in carbon cathodes.","2189":"Vitamin D is an essential steroid hormone that regulates systemic calcium homeostasis and cell fate decisions. The prostate gland is hormonally regulated, requiring steroids for proliferation and differentiation of secretory luminal cells. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of lethal prostate cancer, which exhibits a dedifferentiated pathology, linking vitamin D sufficiency to epithelial differentiation. To determine vitamin D regulation of prostatic epithelial differentiation, patient-derived benign prostate epithelial organoids were grown in vitamin D-deficient or -sufficient conditions. Organoids were assessed by phenotype and single-cell RNA sequencing. Mechanistic validation demonstrated that vitamin D sufficiency promoted organoid growth and accelerated differentiation by inhibiting canonical Wnt activity and suppressing Wnt family member DKK3. Wnt and DKK3 were also reduced by vitamin D in prostate tissue explants by spatial transcriptomics. Wnt dysregulation is a known contributor to aggressive prostate cancer, thus findings further link vitamin D deficiency to lethal disease.","2190":null,"2191":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) mediates persistent infection, chronic hepatitis, and liver disease. HBV covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA is central to viral persistence such that its elimination is considered the cornerstone for HBV cure. Inefficient detection by pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) in the infected hepatocyte facilitates HBV persistence via avoidance of innate immune activation and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)3 induction of antiviral gene expression. We evaluated a small molecule compound, F7, and 5'-triphosphate-poly-U\/UC pathogen-associated-molecular-pattern (PAMP) RNA agonists of RIG-I, a PRR that signals innate immunity, for ability to suppress cccDNA. F7 and poly-U\/UC PAMP treatment of HBV-infected cells induced RIG-I signaling of IRF3 activation to induce antiviral genes for suppression of cccDNA formation and accelerated decay of established cccDNA, and were additive to the actions of entecavir. Our study shows that activation of the RIG-I pathway and IRF3 to induce innate immune actions offers therapeutic benefit toward elimination of cccDNA.","2192":"Dopamine (DA) plays many roles in the brain, especially in movement, motivation, and reinforcement of behavior; however, its role in regulating innate immunity is not clear. Here, we show that DA can induce DNA-based extracellular traps in primary, adult, human microglia and BV2 microglia cell line. These DNA-based extracellular traps are formed independent of reactive oxygen species, actin polymerization, and cell death. These traps are functional and capture fluorescein (FITC)-tagged Escherichia coli even when reactive oxygen species production or actin polymerization is inhibited. We show that microglial extracellular traps are present in Glioblastoma multiforme. This is crucial because Glioblastoma multiforme cells are known to secrete DA. Our findings demonstrate that DA plays a significant role in sterile neuro-inflammation by inducing microglia extracellular traps.","2193":"The Nernst effect generates a voltage transverse to the temperature gradient in the magnetic field. Although the Nernst effect has the potential to realize novel devices in the field of thermoelectric generators and sensors, thermoelectric modules that operate with the Nernst effect have not yet been implemented. Therefore, in this study, a thermoelectric module utilizing the Nernst effect was developed as a prototype, and its performance was evaluated to identify technical issues. The proposed module is fabricated by arranging four rectangular bars of a BiSb-based sintered alloy on an AlN substrate and connecting all the bars in series with Cu plates. As a result of the measurement, when the magnetic field was 5 T, an output power of 0.48 mW was obtained with a temperature difference of 149 K, and a temperature difference of 82 mK occurred as a cooling operation with an applied electrical current of 100 mA.","2194":"Many technical and psychological challenges make it difficult to design machines that effectively cooperate with people. To better understand these challenges, we conducted a series of studies investigating human-human, robot-robot, and human-robot cooperation in a strategically rich resource-sharing scenario, which required players to balance efficiency, fairness, and risk. In these studies, both human-human and robot-robot dyads typically learned efficient and risky cooperative solutions when they could communicate. In the absence of communication, robot dyads still often learned the same efficient solution, but human dyads achieved a less efficient (less risky) form of cooperation. This difference in how people and machines treat risk appeared to discourage human-robot cooperation, as human-robot dyads frequently failed to cooperate without communication. These results indicate that machine behavior should better align with human behavior, promoting efficiency while simultaneously considering human tendencies toward risk and fairness.","2195":"Thought insertion (TI) is characterized by the experience that certain thoughts, occurring in one's mind, are not one's own, but the thoughts of somebody else and suggestive of a psychotic disorder. We report a robotics-based method able to investigate the behavioral and subjective mechanisms of TI in healthy participants. We used a robotic device to alter body perception by providing online sensorimotor stimulation, while participants performed cognitive tasks implying source monitoring of mental states attributed to either oneself or another person. Across several experiments, conflicting sensorimotor stimulation reduced the distinction between self- and other-generated thoughts and was, moreover, associated with the experimentally generated feeling of being in the presence of an alien agent and subjective aspects of TI. Introducing a new robotics-based approach that enables the experimental study of the brain mechanisms of TI, these results link TI to predictable self-other shifts in source monitoring and specific sensorimotor processes.","2196":null,"2197":null,"2198":null,"2199":null,"2200":"An effective approach based on the principle of maximum entropy is developed to analyze reliability in systems with dynamics of electric circuits and infectious diseases like coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","2201":"Technology advancement demands energy storage devices (ESD) and systems (ESS) with better performance, longer life, higher reliability, and smarter management strategy. Designing such systems involve a trade-off among a large set of parameters, whereas advanced control strategies need to rely on the instantaneous status of many indicators. Machine learning can dramatically accelerate calculations, capture complex mechanisms to improve the prediction accuracy, and make optimized decisions based on comprehensive status information. The computational efficiency makes it applicable for real-time management. This paper reviews recent progresses in this emerging area, especially new concepts, approaches, and applications of machine learning technologies for commonly used energy storage devices (including batteries, capacitors\/supercapacitors, fuel cells, other ESDs) and systems (including battery ESS, hybrid ESS, grid and microgrid-containing energy storage units, pumped-storage system, thermal ESS). The perspective on future directions is also discussed.","2202":"Materials science literature has grown exponentially in recent years making it difficult for individuals to master all of this information. This constrains the formulation of new hypotheses that scientists can come up with. In this work, we explore whether materials science knowledge can be automatically inferred from textual information contained in journal papers. Using a data set of 0.5 million polymer papers, we show, using natural language processing methods that vector representations trained for every word in our corpus can indeed capture this knowledge in a completely unsupervised manner. We perform time-based studies through which we track popularity of various polymers for different applications and predict new polymers for novel applications based solely on the domain knowledge contained in our data set. Using co-relations detected automatically from literature in this manner thus, opens up a new paradigm for materials discovery.","2203":"The expeditious development of information technology has led to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). However, conventional computing systems are prone to volatility, high power consumption, and even delay between the processor and memory, which is referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck, in implementing AI. To address these issues, memristor-based neuromorphic computing systems inspired by the human brain have been proposed. A memristor can store numerous values by changing its resistance and emulate artificial synapses in brain-inspired computing. Here, we introduce six types of memristors classified according to their operation mechanisms: ionic migration, phase change, spin, ferroelectricity, intercalation, and ionic gating. We review how memristor-based neuromorphic computing can learn, infer, and even create, using various artificial neural networks. Finally, the challenges and perspectives in the competing memristor technology for neuromorphic computing systems are discussed.","2204":null,"2205":"There is evidence that ATM mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) plays a key role in protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction, the mechanism for which remains unresolved. We demonstrate here that ATM-deficient cells are exquisitely sensitive to nutrient deprivation, which can be explained by defective cross talk between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondrion. Tethering between these two organelles in response to stress was reduced in cells lacking ATM, and consistent with this, Ca2+ release and transfer between ER and mitochondria was reduced dramatically when compared with control cells. The impact of this on mitochondrial function was evident from an increase in oxygen consumption rates and a defect in mitophagy in ATM-deficient cells. Our findings reveal that ER-mitochondrial connectivity through IP3R1-GRP75-VDAC1, to maintain Ca2+ homeostasis, as well as an abnormality in mitochondrial fusion defective in response to nutrient stress, can account for at least part of the mitochondrial dysfunction observed in A-T cells.","2206":null,"2207":"In social species, decision-making is both influenced by, and in turn influences, the social context. This reciprocal feedback introduces coupling across scales, from the neural basis of sensing, to individual and collective decision-making. Here, we adopt an integrative approach investigating decision-making in dynamical social contexts. When choosing shelters, isolated cockroaches prefer vanillin-scented (food-associated) shelters over unscented ones, yet in groups, this preference is inverted. We demonstrate that this inversion can be replicated by replacing the full social context with social odors: presented alone food and social odors are attractive, yet when presented as a mixture they are avoided. Via antennal lobe calcium imaging, we show that neural activity in vanillin-responsive regions reduces as social odor concentration increases. Thus, we suggest that the mixture is evaluated as a distinct olfactory object with opposite valence, providing a mechanism that would naturally result in individuals avoiding what they perceive as recently exploited resources.","2208":"Accurate prediction of the solubility of chemical substances in solvents remains a challenge. The sparsity of high-quality solubility data is recognized as the biggest hurdle in the development of robust data-driven methods for practical use. Nonetheless, the effects of the quality and quantity of data on aqueous solubility predictions have not yet been scrutinized. In this study, the roles of the size and the quality of data sets on the performances of the solubility prediction models are unraveled, and the concepts of actual and observed performances are introduced. In an effort to curtail the gap between actual and observed performances, a quality-oriented data selection method, which evaluates the quality of data and extracts the most accurate part of it through statistical validation, is designed. Applying this method on the largest publicly available solubility database and using a consensus machine learning approach, a top-performing solubility prediction model is achieved.","2209":null,"2210":null,"2211":"DNA and RNA sequencing is a core technology in biological and medical research.

However, it is less clear whether or how nutritional deficiency and genetic variations influence each other under pathogenic conditions. \"Valosin-containing protein\" (VCP, also known as p97) is associated with multiple neurological disorders and regulates dendritic spine formation by controlling endoplasmic reticulum formation and protein synthesis efficiency. Increased protein synthesis ameliorates the dendritic spine defects of Vcp-deficient neurons. Therefore, we investigated if Vcp-deficient mice are sensitive to nutritional conditions. Here, we show that social interaction and contextual memory of Vcp-deficient mice are indeed influenced by different dietary protein levels. Moreover, leucine supplementation ameliorates the behavioral deficits and dendritic spine density of Vcp-deficient mice, strengthening evidence for the role of protein synthesis in VCP function. Our study illustrates that genetic variation and nutrient factors cross-talk to influence neuronal and behavioral phenotypes.","2214":null,"2215":"Chaos behavior has been observed in various cellular and molecular processes. Here, we modeled reversible phosphorylation dynamics to elucidate a design principle for autonomous chaos generation that may arise from generic enzymatic reactions. A comprehensive parameter search demonstrated that the reaction system composed of a set of kinases and phosphatases and two substrates with two modification sites exhibits chaos behavior. All reactions are described according to the Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme without exotic functions being applied to enzymes and substrates. Clustering analysis of parameter sets that can generate chaos behavior revealed the existence of motif structures. These chaos motifs allow the two-substrate species to interact via enzyme availability and constrain the two substrates' dynamic changes in phosphorylation status so that they occur at different timescales. This chaos motif structure is found in several enzymatic reactions, suggesting that chaos behavior may underlie cellular autonomy in a variety of biochemical systems.","2216":"A ceramic-based coating with a hierarchical surface structure was synthesized via solid-state reaction enabled by a double cathode glow discharge technique.

This coating exhibits superhydrophobicity and, yet, a very strong adhesion to water, i.e., the so-called \"rose petal effect\". This coating also exhibits highly efficient antibacterial ability against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria under both dark and visible light conditions. The excellent antibacterial property originates from the synergistic effects through the release of Cu ions coupled with photothermal activity upon light activation.","2217":null,"2218":null,"2219":null,"2220":null,"2221":"The unparalleled global effort to combat the continuing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic over the last year has resulted in promising prophylactic measures.

Here, we leverage our recently developed, ultra-large-scale in silico screening platform, VirtualFlow, to search for inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. In this unprecedented structure-based virtual campaign, we screened roughly 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also targeted critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interactions.","2222":"Genetic variation of the 16p11.2 deletion locus containing the KCTD13 gene and of CUL3 is linked with autism. This genetic connection suggested that substrates of a CUL3-KCTD13 ubiquitin ligase may be involved in disease pathogenesis. Comparison of Kctd13 mutant (Kctd13 -\/- ) and wild-type neuronal ubiquitylomes identified adenylosuccinate synthetase (ADSS), an enzyme that catalyzes the first step in adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthesis, as a KCTD13 ligase substrate. In Kctd13 -\/- neurons, there were increased levels of succinyl-adenosine (S-Ado), a metabolite downstream of ADSS. Notably, S-Ado levels are elevated in adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, a metabolic disorder with autism and epilepsy phenotypes. The increased S-Ado levels in Kctd13 -\/- neurons were decreased by treatment with an ADSS inhibitor. Lastly, functional analysis of human KCTD13 variants suggests that KCTD13 variation may alter ubiquitination of ADSS. These data suggest that succinyl-AMP metabolites accumulate in Kctd13 -\/- neurons, and this observation may have implications for our understanding of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome.","2223":"Sexual selection can favor production of exaggerated features, but the high cost of such features in terms of energy consumption and enemy avoidance makes them go to extinction under the influence of natural selection. However, fossils preserved with specialized features are very rare. Here, we report a new nymph from Burmese amber, Magnusantena wuae Du &amp; Chen gen. et sp. nov., which has exaggerated leaf-like expanded antennae. Such bizarre antennae indicate that sensitive and delicate sensory system and magnificent appearance in Hemiptera have been already established in mid-Cretaceous. Our findings may provide evidence for Darwin's view that sensory organs play an important role in sexual selection. This nymph with the leaf-like antennae may also represents a new camouflage pattern. However, the oversized antennae are costly to develop and maintain, increasing the risks from predators. Such unparalleled expanded antennae might be the key factor for the evolutionary fate of the coreid.","2224":"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most prevalent form of liver disease worldwide. This term encompasses a spectrum of pathologies, from benign hepatic steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which have, to date, been challenging to model in the laboratory setting. Here, we present a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived model of hepatic steatosis, which overcomes inherent challenges of current models and provides insights into the metabolic rewiring associated with steatosis. Following induction of macrovesicular steatosis in hepatocyte-like cells using lactate, pyruvate, and octanoate (LPO), respirometry and transcriptomic analyses revealed compromised electron transport chain activity. 13C isotopic tracing studies revealed enhanced TCA cycle anaplerosis, with concomitant development of a compensatory purine nucleotide cycle shunt leading to excess generation of fumarate. This model of hepatic steatosis is reproducible, scalable, and overcomes the challenges of studying mitochondrial metabolism in currently available models.","2225":"Epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord is an emergent strategy for the neurological recovery of lower-extremity motor function. Motoneuron pools are thought to be recruited by stimulation of posterior roots. Here, we linked electromyographic data of epidurally evoked lower-extremity responses of 34 individuals with upper motoneuron disorders to a population model of the spinal cord constructed using anatomical parameters of thousands of individuals. We identified a relationship between segmental stimulation sites and activated spinal cord segments, which made spinal motor mapping from epidural space possible despite the complex anatomical interface imposed by the posterior roots. Our statistical approach provided evidence for low-threshold sites of posterior roots and effects of monopolar and bipolar stimulation previously predicted by computer modeling and allowed us to test the impact of different upper motoneuron disorders on the evoked responses. Finally, we revealed a statistical association between intraoperative and postoperative mapping of the spinal cord.","2226":null,"2227":"Functional dissociations in the brain observed during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep have been associated with reduced information integration and impaired consciousness that accompany increasing sleep depth. Here, we explored the dynamical properties of large-scale functional brain networks derived from transient brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Spatial brain maps generally display significant modifications in terms of their tendency to occur across wakefulness and NREM sleep. Unexpectedly, almost all networks predominated in activity during NREM stage 2 before an abrupt loss of activity is observed in NREM stage 3. Yet, functional connectivity and mutual dependencies between these networks progressively broke down with increasing sleep depth. Thus, the efficiency of information transfer during NREM stage 2 is low despite the high attempt to communicate. Critically, our approach provides relevant data for evaluating functional brain network integrity and our findings robustly support a significant advance in our neural models of human sleep and consciousness.","2228":null,"2229":"The small 3-O-sulfated galactose head group of sulfatides, an abundant glycosphingolipid class, poses the (sphinx-like) riddle on involvement of glycan bridging by tissue lectins (sugar code). First, synthesis of head group derivatives for functionalization of amphiphilic dendrimers is performed. Aggregation of resulting (biomimetic) vesicles, alone or in combination with lactose, demonstrates bridging by a tissue lectin (galectin-4). Physiologically, this can stabilize glycolipid-rich microdomains (rafts) and associate sulfatide-rich regions with specific glycoproteins. Further testing documents importance of heterobivalency and linker length. Structurally, sulfatide recognition by galectin-8 is shown to involve sphingosine's OH group as substitute for the 3'-hydroxyl of glucose of lactose. These discoveries underscore functionality of this small determinant on biomembranes intracellularly and on the cell surface. Moreover, they provide a role model to examine counterreceptor capacity of more complex glycans of glycosphingolipids and to start their bottom-up glycotope surface programming.","2230":null,"2231":null,"2232":"Body sensor network (bodyNET) offers possibilities for future disease diagnosis, preventive health care, rehabilitation, and treatment. However, the eventual realization demands reliable and sustainable power sources. The flourishing energy harvesters (EHs) have provided prominent techniques for practically addressing the concurrent energy issue. Targeting for a specific energy source, wearable EHs with a sole conversion mechanism are well investigated. Hybrid EHs integrating different effects for a single source or multi-sources are attaining growing attention, for they provide another degree of freedom concerning a higher-level energy utility. Merging EHs with other functional electronics, diversified functional self-sustainable systems are developed, paving the way for the accomplishment of bodyNET. This review introduces the evolution of wearable EHs from a single effect to hybridized mechanisms for multiple energy sources and wearable to implantable self-sustainable systems. Last, we provide our perspectives on the future development of hybrid EHs to be more competitive with conventional batteries.","2233":null,"2234":null,"2235":"Mammalian central synapses exhibit vast heterogeneity in signaling strength. To understand the extent of this diversity, how it is achieved, and its functional implications, characterization of a large number of individual synapses is required. Using glutamate imaging, we characterized the evoked release probability and spontaneous release frequency of over 24,000 individual synapses. We found striking variability and no correlation between action potential-evoked and spontaneous synaptic release strength, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms. Subpixel localization of individual evoked and spontaneous release events reveals tight spatial regulation of evoked release and enhanced spontaneous release outside of evoked release region. Using on-stage post hoc immune-labeling of vesicle-associated proteins, Ca2+-sensing proteins, and soluble presynaptic proteins we were able to show that distinct molecular ensembles are associated with evoked and spontaneous modes of synaptic release.","2236":null,"2237":"Solar light\/dark cycles and seasonal photoperiods underpin daily and annual rhythms of life on Earth. Yet, the Arctic is characterized by several months of permanent illumination (\"midnight sun\"). To determine the persistence of 24h rhythms during the midnight sun, we investigated transcriptomic dynamics in the copepod Calanus finmarchicus during the summer solstice period in the Arctic, with the lowest diel oscillation and the highest altitude of the sun's position. Here we reveal that in these extreme photic conditions, a widely rhythmic daily transcriptome exists, showing that very weak solar cues are sufficient to entrain organisms. Furthermore, at extremely high latitudes and under sea-ice, gene oscillations become re-organized to include &lt;24h rhythms. Environmental synchronization may therefore be modulated to include non-photic signals (i.e. tidal cycles). The ability of zooplankton to be synchronized by extremely weak diel and potentially tidal cycles, may confer an adaptive temporal reorganization of biological processes at high latitudes.","2238":"Understanding the biological processes that determine the entry of three germ layers of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a central question in developmental and stem cell biology. Here, we genetically engineered hPSCs with the germ layer reporter and inducible CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout system, and a genome-scale screening was performed to define pathways restricting germ layer specification. Genes clustered in the key biological processes, including embryonic development, mRNA processing, metabolism, and epigenetic regulation, were centered in the governance of pluripotency and lineage development. Other than typical pluripotent transcription factors and signaling molecules, loss of function of mesendodermal specifiers resulted in advanced neuroectodermal differentiation, given their inter-germ layer antagonizing effect. Regarding the epigenetic superfamily, microRNAs enriched in hPSCs showed clear germ layer-targeting specificity. The cholesterol synthesis pathway maintained hPSCs via retardation of neuroectoderm specification. Thus, in this study, we identified a full landscape of genetic wiring and biological processes that control hPSC self-renewal and trilineage specification.","2239":null,"2240":null,"2241":"Viruses depend on the host metabolic machinery to complete their life cycle in the host cytoplasm. However, the key viral factors initiating the host machinery after the virus enters the cytoplasm remain unclear. Here, we found that compounds packaged in the virions of white spot syndrome virus, such as palmitic amide, could trigger the viral life cycle in the host cytoplasm. Palmitic amide promoted virus infection by enhancing host glycolysis by binding to triosephosphate isomerase to enhance its enzymatic activity. The glycolysis enhancement resulted in lactate accumulation, thereby promoting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) expression. HIF-1 upregulation further enhanced glycolysis, which in turn promoted virus infection. Therefore, our study presented novel insight into the initiation of the virus life cycle in host cells.","2242":null,"2243":"Liquid metal has demonstrated an enormous potential for developing soft functional devices and machines. However, current liquid metal enabled machines suffer from several issues, such as the requirement of a liquid environment, generation of weak actuating forces, and insufficient maneuverability. To overcome these restrictions, here, a motor is developed based on the electrical actuation of liquid metal droplets without the need for conventional electromagnets. The approach is distinguished by (1) the encapsulation of electrolyte and multiple liquid metal droplets within an enclosed system, and (2) the creation of stable and continuous torque outside a liquid environment. In addition, a liquid metal electrical brush is introduced to operate the motor with low friction and low wear. The unique driving mechanism endows the motor with several advantages, including low friction, no sparking, low noise, versatile working environment, and being built from soft materials that could offer new opportunities for developing soft robotics.","2244":null,"2245":"Hydrogen is recognized as the \"future fuel\" and the most promising alternative of fossil fuels due to its remarkable properties including exceptionally high energy content per unit mass (142 M J \/ k g  ), low mass density, and massive environmental and economical upsides. A wide spectrum of methods in  H 2   production, especially carbon-free approaches,  H 2   purification, and  H 2   storage have been investigated to bring this energy source closer to the technological deployment. Hydrogen hydrates are among the most intriguing material paradigms for  H 2   storage due to their appealing properties such as low energy consumption for charge and discharge, safety, cost-effectiveness, and favorable environmental features. Here, we comprehensively discuss the progress in understanding of hydrogen clathrate hydrates with an emphasis on charging\/discharging rate of  H 2   (i.e. hydrate formation and dissociation rates) and the storage capacity. A thorough understanding on phase equilibrium of the hydrates and its variation through different materials is provided. The path toward ambient temperature and pressure hydrogen batteries with high storage capacity is elucidated. We suggest that the charging rate of  H 2   in this storage medium and long cyclic performance are more immediate challenges than storage capacity for technological translation of this storage medium. This review and provided outlook establish a groundwork for further innovation on hydrogen hydrate systems for promising future of hydrogen fuel.","2246":"The calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calbindin are expressed in neuronal populations regulating brain networks involved in spatial navigation, memory processes, and social interactions. Information about the numbers of these neurons across brain regions is required to understand their functional roles but is scarcely available. Employing semi-automated image analysis, we performed brain-wide analysis of immunohistochemically stained parvalbumin and calbindin sections and show that these neurons distribute in complementary patterns across the mouse brain. Parvalbumin neurons dominate in areas related to sensorimotor processing and navigation, whereas calbindin neurons prevail in regions reflecting behavioral states. We also find that parvalbumin neurons distribute according to similar principles in the hippocampal region of the rat and mouse brain. We validated our results against manual counts and evaluated variability of results among researchers. Comparison of our results to previous reports showed that neuron numbers vary, whereas patterns of relative densities and numbers are consistent.","2247":null,"2248":"The processes underlying synchronous multiple organ fibrosis in systemic sclerosis (SSc) remain poorly understood. Age-related pathologies are associated with organismal decline in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) that is due to dysregulation of NAD+ homeostasis and involves the NADase CD38. We now show that CD38 is upregulated in patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc, and CD38 levels in the skin associate with molecular fibrosis signatures, as well as clinical fibrosis scores, while expression of key NAD+-synthesizing enzymes is unaltered. Boosting NAD+ via genetic or pharmacological CD38 targeting or NAD+ precursor supplementation protected mice from skin, lung, and peritoneal fibrosis. In mechanistic experiments, CD38 was found to reduce NAD+ levels and sirtuin activity to augment cellular fibrotic responses, while inhibiting CD38 had the opposite effect. Thus, we identify CD38 upregulation and resulting disrupted NAD+ homeostasis as a fundamental mechanism driving fibrosis in SSc, suggesting that CD38 might represent a novel therapeutic target.","2249":null,"2250":"Coelenterazine is a key substrate involved in marine bioluminescence which is used for light-production by at least nine phyla. Some luminous animals, such as the hydromedusa Aequorea, lack the ability to produce coelenterazine endogenously and instead depend on dietary sources. Little is known about the source organisms or the metabolic process of coelenterazine biosynthesis. Here, we present evidence that ctenophores are both producers and suppliers of coelenterazine in marine ecosystems. Using biochemical assays and mass spectrometry analyses, we detected coelenterazine from cultured ctenophores fed with a non-luminous coelenterazine-free diet. We propose that ctenophores are an emerging model organism to study coelenterazine biosynthesis and the origins of bioluminescence.","2251":"Liquid biopsies based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) or exosomes provide a noninvasive approach to monitor human health and disease but have not been utilized for astronauts. Here, we profile cfDNA characteristics, including fragment size, cellular deconvolution, and nucleosome positioning, in an astronaut during a year-long mission on the International Space Station, compared to his identical twin on Earth and healthy donors. We observed a significant increase in the proportion of cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA) inflight, and analysis of post-flight exosomes in plasma revealed a 30-fold increase in circulating exosomes and patient-specific protein cargo (including brain-derived peptides) after the year-long mission. This longitudinal analysis of astronaut cfDNA during spaceflight and the exosome profiles highlights their utility for astronaut health monitoring, as well as cf-mtDNA levels as a potential biomarker for physiological stress or immune system responses related to microgravity, radiation exposure, and the other unique environmental conditions of spaceflight.","2252":"Food represents a limiting resource for the growth and developmental progression of many animal species. As a consequence, competition over food, space, or other resources can trigger territoriality and aggressive behavior. In the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus, caterpillars feed predominantly on milkweed, raising the possibility that access to milkweed is critical for growth and survival. Here, we characterize the role of food availability on aggression in monarch caterpillars and find that monarch caterpillars display stereotyped aggressive lunges that increase during development, peaking during the fourth and fifth instar stages. The number of lunges toward a conspecific caterpillar was significantly increased under conditions of low food availability, suggesting resource defense may trigger aggression. These findings establish monarch caterpillars as a model for investigating interactions between resource availability and aggressive behavior under ecologically relevant conditions and set the stage for future investigations into the neuroethology of aggression in this system.","2253":null,"2254":"Spaceflight missions can cause immune system dysfunction in astronauts with little understanding of immune outcomes in deep space. This study assessed immune responses in mice following ground-based, simulated deep spaceflight conditions, compared with data from astronauts on International Space Station missions. For ground studies, we simulated microgravity using the hindlimb unloaded mouse model alone or in combination with acute simulated galactic cosmic rays or solar particle events irradiation. Immune profiling results revealed unique immune diversity following each experimental condition, suggesting each stressor results in distinct circulating immune responses, with clear consequences for deep spaceflight. Circulating plasma microRNA sequence analysis revealed involvement in immune system dysregulation. Furthermore, a large astronaut cohort showed elevated inflammation during low-Earth orbit missions, thereby supporting our simulated ground experiments in mice. Herein, circulating immune biomarkers are defined by distinct deep space irradiation types coupled to simulated microgravity and could be targets for future space health initiatives.","2255":"Tissue interactions are critical for maintaining homeostasis; however, little is known about how remote tissue regulates regeneration. Previously, we established a genetic dual system that induces cell ablation in Drosophila larval imaginal discs and simultaneously manipulates genes in non-damaged tissues. Using humoral metabolome analysis and a genetic damage system, we found that the Tryptophan (Trp)-Kynurenine (Kyn) pathway in the fat body is required for disc repair. Genetic manipulation of Trp-Kyn metabolism in the fat body impaired disc regeneration without affecting wing development. In particular, the fat body-derived humoral kynurenic acid (KynA) was required for disc repair. The impairment of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis from methionine (Met) in the fat body hampers the maintenance of KynA levels in hemolymph at the early stage of disc repair, suggesting a connection between Met-SAM and Trp-Kyn metabolisms. Our data indicate KynA from the fat body acts as a permissive metabolite for tissue repair and regeneration.","2256":null,"2257":"To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. Sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection. This has important implications for the interpretation of existing datasets and the design of future experiments.","2258":"Cyber space enables us to \"share\" bodies whose movements are a consequence of movements by several individuals. But whether and how our motor behavior is affected during body sharing remains unclear. Here we examined this issue in arm reaching performed by a shared avatar, whose movement was generated by averaging the movements of two participants. We observed that participants exhibited improved reaction times with a shared avatar than alone. Moreover, the reach trajectory of the shared avatar was straighter than that of either participant and correlated with their subjective embodiment of the avatar. Finally, the jerk of the avatar's hand was less than either participant's own hand, both when they reached alone and in the shared body. Movement straightness and hand jerk are well known characteristics of human reach behavior, and our results suggest that during body sharing, humans prioritize these movement characteristics of the shared body over their own.","2259":null,"2260":"","2261":null,"2262":"The bizarre scansoriopterygid theropods Yi and Ambopteryx had skin stretched between elongate fingers that form a potential membranous wing. This wing is thought to have been used in aerial locomotion, but this has never been tested. Using laser-stimulated fluorescence imaging, we re-evaluate their anatomy and perform aerodynamic calculations covering flight potential, other wing-based behaviors, and gliding capabilities. We find that Yi and Ambopteryx were likely arboreal, highly unlikely to have any form of powered flight, and had significant deficiencies in flapping-based locomotion and limited gliding abilities. Our results show that Scansoriopterygidae are not models for the early evolution of bird flight, and their structurally distinct wings differed greatly from contemporaneous paravians, supporting multiple independent origins of flight. We propose that Scansoriopterygidae represents a unique but failed flight architecture of non-avialan theropods and that the evolutionary race to capture vertebrate aerial morphospace in the Middle to Late Jurassic was dynamic and complex.","2263":null,"2264":"Compared with conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, targeted molecular therapy, e.g., antibody-drug conjugates or aptamer-drug conjugates, can specifically identify overexpressed natural receptors on the cancer cell, perform targeted release of anticancer drugs, and achieve targeted killing of tumor cells. However, many natural receptors are also expressed on non-cancer cells, thereby diverting the targeting molecules to healthy cells. By generating artificial cell surface receptors specific to diseased cells, aptamer-drug conjugates can identify these artificial receptors, improve therapeutic efficacy, and decrease the minimum effective dosage. In this study, we use high K+ and high H2O2 of the tumor microenvironment (TME) to produce polydopamine only on living cancer cell membrane. Owing to the significant reactivity of polydopamine with amino groups, e.g., the amino group of proteins, polydopamine can deposit on tumor cells and act as \"artificial receptors\" for targeted delivery of anticancer drugs with amino groups, in other words, amino-containing drugs and protein drugs.","2265":"Cell type annotation is a fundamental task in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In this work, we present CellO, a machine learning-based tool for annotating human RNA-seq data with the Cell Ontology. CellO enables accurate and standardized cell type classification of cell clusters by considering the rich hierarchical structure of known cell types. Furthermore, CellO comes pre-trained on a comprehensive data set of human, healthy, untreated primary samples in the Sequence Read Archive. CellO's comprehensive training set enables it to run out of the box on diverse cell types and achieves competitive or even superior performance when compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, CellO's linear models are easily interpreted, thereby enabling exploration of cell-type-specific expression signatures across the ontology. To this end, we also present the CellO Viewer: a web application for exploring CellO's models across the ontology.","2266":"One of the outstanding problems in complexity science and engineering is the study of high-dimensional networked systems and of their susceptibility to transitions to undesired states as a result of changes in external drivers or in the structural properties. Because of the incredibly large number of parameters controlling the state of such complex systems and the heterogeneity of its components, the study of their dynamics is extremely difficult. Here we propose an analytical framework for collapsing complex N-dimensional networked systems into an S+1-dimensional manifold as a function of S effective control parameters with S &lt;&lt; N. We test our approach on a variety of real-world complex problems showing how this new framework can approximate the system's response to changes and correctly identify the regions in the parameter space corresponding to the system's transitions. Our work offers an analytical method to evaluate optimal strategies in the design or management of networked systems.","2267":null,"2268":"Cancers are the result of eco-evolutionary processes fueled by heritable phenotypic diversification and driven by environmentally dependent selection. Space represents a key growth-limiting ecological resource, the ability to explore this resource is likely under strong selection. Using agent-based modeling, we explored the interplay between phenotypic strategies centered on gaining access to new space through cell-extrinsic degradation of extracellular matrix barriers and the exploitation of this resource through maximizing cell proliferation. While cell proliferation is a cell-intrinsic property, newly accessed space represents a public good, which can benefit both producers and non-producers. We found that this interplay results in ecological succession, enabling emergence of large, heterogeneous, and highly proliferative populations. Even though in our simulations both remodeling and proliferation strategies were under strong positive selection, their interplay led to sub-clonal architecture that could be interpreted as evidence for neutral evolution, warranting cautious interpretation of inferences from sequencing of cancer genomes.","2269":null,"2270":null,"2271":"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are of fundamental importance for our understanding of physiology and pathology. PPIs involving short, linear motifs play a major role in immunological recognition, signaling, and regulation and provide attractive starting points for pharmaceutical intervention. Yet, state-of-the-art protein-peptide affinity determination approaches exhibit limited throughput and sensitivity, often resulting from ligand immobilization, labeling, or synthesis. Here, we introduce a high-throughput method for in-solution analysis of protein-peptide interactions using a phenomenon called temperature related intensity change (TRIC). We use TRIC for the identification and fine-mapping of low- and high-affinity protein interaction sites and the definition of sequence binding requirements. Validation is achieved by microarray-based studies using wild-type and mutated recombinant protein and the native protein within tissue lysates. On-chip neutralization and strong correlation with structural data establish TRIC as a quasi-label-free method to determine binding affinities of unmodified peptide libraries with large dynamic range.","2272":"Oxidative water purification of micropollutants (MPs) can proceed via toxic intermediates calling for procedures for connecting degrading chemical mixtures to evolving toxicity. Herein, we introduce a method for projecting evolving toxicity onto composite changing pollutant and intermediate concentrations illustrated through the TAML\/H2O2 mineralization of the common drug and MP, propranolol. The approach consists of identifying the key intermediates along the decomposition pathway (UPLC\/GCMS\/NMR\/UV-Vis), determining for each by simulation and experiment the rate constants for both catalytic and noncatalytic oxidations and converting the resulting predicted concentration versus time profiles to evolving composite toxicity exemplified using zebrafish lethality data. For propranolol, toxicity grows substantially from the outset, even after propranolol is undetectable, echoing that intermediate chemical and toxicity behaviors are key elements of the environmental safety of MP degradation processes. As TAML\/H2O2 mimics mechanistically the main steps of peroxidase catalytic cycles, the findings may be relevant to propranolol degradation in environmental waters.","2273":null,"2274":"Although the deep-sea bathymodiolin mussels have been intensively studied as a model of animal-bacteria symbiosis, it remains challenging to assess the host-symbiont interactions due to the complexity of the symbiotic tissue-the gill. Using cold-seep mussel Gigantidas platifrons as a model, we isolated the symbiont harboring bacteriocytes and profiled the transcriptomes of the three major parts of the symbiosis-the gill, the bacteriocyte, and the symbiont. This breakdown of the complex symbiotic tissue allowed us to characterize the host-symbiont interactions further. Our data showed that the gill's non-symbiotic parts play crucial roles in maintaining and protecting the symbiosis; the bacteriocytes supply the symbiont with metabolites, control symbiont population, and shelter the symbiont from phage infection; the symbiont dedicates to the methane oxidation and energy production. This study demonstrates that the bathymodiolin symbiosis interacts at the tissue, cellular, and molecular level, maintaining high efficiency and harmonic chemosynthetic micro niche.","2275":null,"2276":"Previous studies have shown that live cyanobacteria can produce photocurrent in bio-photoelectrochemical cells (BPECs) that can be exploited for clean renewable energy production. Electron transfer from cyanobacteria to the electrochemical cell was proposed to be facilitated by small molecule(s) mediator(s) whose identity (or identities) remain unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of electron transfer in the BPEC by identifying the major electron mediator as NADPH in three cyanobacterial species. We show that an increase in the concentration of NADPH secreted into the external cell medium (ECM) is obtained by both illumination and activation of the BPEC. Elimination of NADPH in the ECM abrogates the photocurrent while addition of exogenous NADP+ significantly increases and prolongs the photocurrent production. NADP+ is thus the first non-toxic, water soluble electron mediator that can functionally link photosynthetic cells to an energy conversion system and may serve to improve the performance of future BPECs.","2277":"Advanced fluorescence microscopy studies require specific and monovalent molecular labeling with bright and photostable fluorophores. This necessity led to the widespread use of fluorescently labeled nanobodies against commonly employed fluorescent proteins (FPs). However, very little is known how these nanobodies influence their target molecules. Here, we tested commercially available nanobodies and observed clear changes of the fluorescence properties, mobility and organization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged proteins after labeling with the anti-GFP nanobody. Intriguingly, we did not observe any co-diffusion of fluorescently labeled nanobodies with the GFP-labeled proteins. Our results suggest significant binding of the nanobodies to a non-emissive, likely oligomerized, form of the FPs, promoting disassembly into monomeric form after binding. Our findings have significant implications on the application of nanobodies and GFP labeling for studying dynamic and quantitative protein organization in the plasma membrane of living cells using advanced imaging techniques.","2278":"Technological developments have revolutionized measurements on plant genotypes and phenotypes, leading to routine production of large, complex data sets. This has led to increased efforts to extract meaning from these measurements and to integrate various data sets. Concurrently, machine learning has rapidly evolved and is now widely applied in science in general and in plant genotyping and phenotyping in particular. Here, we review the application of machine learning in the context of plant science and plant breeding. We focus on analyses at different phenotype levels, from biochemical to yield, and in connecting genotypes to these. In this way, we illustrate how machine learning offers a suite of methods that enable researchers to find meaningful patterns in relevant plant data.","2279":null,"2280":null,"2281":null,"2282":null,"2283":"Whole-genome sequencing data were produced from a single flathead grey mullet female and assembled into a draft genome sequence, whereas publicly available sequence data were used to obtain a male draft sequence.

Mapping and analysis of Pool-Seq data against the draft genome(s) revealed &gt;30 loci potentially associated with sex, the most promising locus of which, encoding the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (fshr) and harboring two missense variants, was genotyped on 245 fish from four Mediterranean populations. Genotype data showed that fshr represents a previously unknown sex-determining locus, although the incomplete association pattern between fshr genotype and sex-phenotype, the variability of such pattern across different populations, and the presence of other candidate loci reveal that a greater complexity underlies sex determination in the flathead grey mullet.","2284":"All rodents investigated so far possess orientation-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) but - in contrast to carnivores and primates - no evidence of periodic maps with pinwheel-like structures. Theoretical studies debating whether phylogeny or universal principles determine development of pinwheels point to V1 size as a critical constraint. Thus, we set out to study maps of agouti, a big diurnal rodent with a V1 size comparable to cats'. In electrophysiology, we detected interspersed orientation and direction-selective neurons with a bias for horizontal contours, corroborated by homogeneous activation in optical imaging. Compatible with spatial clustering at short distance, nearby neurons tended to exhibit similar orientation preference. Our results argue against V1 size as a key parameter in determining the presence of periodic orientation maps. They are consistent with a phylogenetic influence on the map layout and development, potentially reflecting distinct retinal traits or interspecies differences in cortical circuitry.","2285":null,"2286":null,"2287":"Machine learning has recently emerged as a promising tool for inferring multi-omic relationships in biological systems. At the same time, genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) can be integrated with such multi-omic data to refine phenotypic predictions. In this work, we use a multi-omic machine learning pipeline to analyze a GSMM of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, a cyanobacterium with large potential to produce renewable biofuels. We use regularized flux balance analysis to observe flux response between conditions across photosynthesis and energy metabolism. We then incorporate principal-component analysis, k-means clustering, and LASSO regularization to reduce dimensionality and extract key cross-omic features. Our results suggest that combining metabolic modeling with machine learning elucidates mechanisms used by cyanobacteria to cope with fluctuations in light intensity and salinity that cannot be detected using transcriptomics alone. Furthermore, GSMMs introduce critical mechanistic details that improve the performance of omic-based machine learning methods.","2288":null,"2289":"Holography was originally invented for the purpose of magnifying electron microscopic images without spherical aberration and has been applied to photography for recording and reconstructing three-dimensional objects. Although it has been attracting scientists and ordinary people in the world, it is still a technology in science fiction movies. In this review, we discuss a new version of holography that uses surface plasmons on thin metal film. We discuss conventional holography and its drawbacks, such as overlapping of ghost and background due to the contribution of unnecessary diffraction and monochromacy for avoiding the unwanted diffraction components of different colors. Surface-plasmon holography is a version of near-field holography to overcome drawbacks of conventional holography. Comparison with conventional and volume holography for color reconstruction is discussed in reciprocal lattice space. Localized mode of surface plasmons and meta-surface holography are also reviewed, and feature perspectives and issues are discussed.","2290":null,"2291":"As technology advances, electrical devices such as smartphones have become more and more compact, leading to a demand for the continuous miniaturization of optical components. Metalenses, ultrathin flat optical elements composed of metasurfaces consisting of arrays of subwavelength optical antennas, provide a method of meeting those requirements. Moreover, metalenses have many other distinctive advantages including aberration correction, active tunability, and semi-transparency, compared to their conventional refractive and diffractive counterparts. Therefore, over the last decade, great effort has been focused on developing metalenses to investigate and broaden the capabilities of metalenses for integration into future applications. Here, we discuss recent progress on metalenses including their basic design principles and notable characteristics such as aberration correction, tunability, and multifunctionality.","2292":"Bats are reservoirs for a large number of viruses which have potential to cause major human disease outbreaks, including the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Major efforts are underway to understand bat immune response to viruses, whereas much less is known about their immune responses to bacteria. In this study, MR1-restricted T (MR1T) cells were detected through the use of MR1 tetramers in circulation and tissues of Pteropus alecto (Pa) bats. Pa MR1T cells exhibited weak responses to MR1-presented microbial metabolites at resting state. However, following priming with MR1-presented agonist they proliferated, upregulated critical transcription factors and cytolytic proteins, and gained transient expression of Th1\/17-related cytokines and antibacterial cytotoxicity. Collectively, these findings show that the Pa bat immune system encompasses an abundant and functionally conserved population of MR1T cells with mucosal-associated invariant T-like characteristics, suggesting that MR1 and MR1T cells also play a significant role in bat immune defense.","2293":"Ferroelectric synapses using polarization switching (a purely electronic switching process) to induce analog conductance change have attracted considerable interest. Here, we propose ferroelectric photovoltaic (FePV) synapses that use polarization-controlled photocurrent as the readout and thus have no limitations on the forms and thicknesses of the constituent ferroelectric and electrode materials. This not only makes FePV synapses easy to fabricate but also reduces the depolarization effect and hence enhances the polarization controllability. As a proof-of-concept implementation, a Pt\/Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3\/LaNiO3 FePV synapse is facilely grown on a silicon substrate, which demonstrates continuous photovoltaic response modulation with good controllability (small nonlinearity and write noise) enabled by gradual polarization switching. Using photovoltaic response as synaptic weight, this device exhibits versatile synaptic functions including long-term potentiation\/depression and spike-timing-dependent plasticity. A simulated FePV synapse-based neural network achieves high accuracies (&gt;93%) for image recognition. This study paves a new way toward highly controllable and silicon-compatible synapses for neuromorphic computing.","2294":null,"2295":null,"2296":null,"2297":"Boron-containing compounds represent a promising class of molecules with proven efficacy against a wide range of pathogens, including apicomplexan parasites. Following lead optimization, the benzoxaborole AN13762 was identified as a preclinical candidate against the human malaria parasite, yet the molecular target remained uncertain. Here, we uncovered the parasiticidal mechanisms of AN13762, by combining forward genetics with transcriptome sequencing and computational mutation discovery and using Toxoplasma gondii as a relevant model for Apicomplexa. AN13762 was shown to target TgCPSF3, the catalytic subunit of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex, as the anti-pan-apicomplexan benzoxaborole compound, AN3661. However, unique mutations within the TgCPSF3 catalytic site conferring resistance to AN13762 do not confer cross-protection against AN3661, suggesting a divergent resistance mechanism. Finally, in agreement with the high sequence conservation of CPSF3 between Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium, AN13762 shows oral efficacy in cryptosporidiosis mouse model, a disease for which new drug development is of high priority.","2298":null,"2299":null,"2300":"The plant cell wall, a form of the extracellular matrix, is a complex and dynamic network of polymers mediating a plethora of physiological functions. How polysaccharides assemble into a coherent and heterogeneous matrix remains mostly undefined. Further progress requires improved molecular-level visualization methods that would gain a deeper understanding of the cell wall nanoarchitecture. dSTORM, a type of super-resolution microscopy, permits quantitative nanoimaging of the cell wall. However, due to the lack of single-cell model systems and the requirement of tissue-level imaging, its use in plant science is almost absent. Here we overcome these limitations; we compare two methods to achieve three-dimensional dSTORM and identify optimal photoswitching dyes for tissue-level multicolor nanoscopy. Combining dSTORM with spatial statistics, we reveal and characterize the ultrastructure of three major polysaccharides, callose, mannan, and cellulose, in the plant cell wall precursor and provide evidence for cellulose structural re-organization related to callose content.","2301":"Optical metasurface as a booming research field has put forward profound progress in optics and photonics. Compared with metallic-based components, which suffer from significant thermal loss and low efficiency, high-index all-dielectric nanostructures can readily combine electric and magnetic Mie resonances together, leading to efficient manipulation of optical properties such as amplitude, phase, polarization, chirality, and anisotropy. These advances have enabled tremendous developments in practical photonic devices that can confine and guide light at the nanoscale. Here we review the recent development of local electromagnetic resonances such as Mie-type scattering, bound states in the continuum, Fano resonances, and anapole resonances in dielectric metasurfaces and summarize the fundamental principles of dielectric resonances. We discuss the recent research frontiers in dielectric metasurfaces including wavefront-shaping, metalenses, multifunctional and computational approaches. We review the strategies and methods to realize the dynamic tuning of dielectric metasurfaces. Finally, we conclude with an outlook on the challenges and prospects of dielectric metasurfaces.","2302":"This study develops a new concept involving using the existing infrastructure for photovoltaic (PV) generation to reduce the costs associated with increased land use and to avoid curtailment due to the mismatch between power supply and demand. We establish a method to estimate the technological potential and economic performance of the PV systems deployed in coal-fired power plants in China. The potential capacity of the examined 1,082 units in China reaches 4 GWe, which is equivalent to 32% of China's newly installed distributed PV capacity in 2019. A total of 87% of PV systems achieve plant-side grid parity compared with desulfurized coal benchmark electricity prices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the use of rooftops and coal storage sheds in power plants to facilitate low-cost, flexible PV power generation, thus opening a new channel for future PV generation development.","2303":"Geranylation is a hydrophobic modification discovered in several bacteria tRNAs with the function of promoting codon bias during translation. However, why nature selects this C10-geranyl group remains a question. We conduct synthesis, UV-thermal denaturation, and molecular simulation studies in RNA duplexes and reveal possible reasons behind this natural selection. Among methyl-(C1), dimethylallyl-(C5), geranyl-(C10), and farnesyl-(C15) modified 2-thiouridines, only geranyl-group promotes U:G over U:A pair. Molecular simulation shows all the modified terpene groups point to the minor groove of RNA duplexes. The discrimination between U:G and U:A pairs derives from the difference in hydrogen bonding and interactions of the chain with the hydrophobic area in the minor groove. Geranyl group has perfect length to discriminate U:G and U:A pairs, whereas the others are either too long or too short to achieve the same behavior. This work indicates that geranyl group cannot be replaced by other terpene groups in promoting codon-specificity.","2304":"Microtubules (MTs) and F-actin (F-act) have long been recognized as key regulators of dendritic morphology. Nevertheless, precisely ascertaining their distinct influences on dendritic trees have been hampered until now by the lack of direct, arbor-wide cytoskeletal quantification. We pair live confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled dendritic arborization (da) neurons in Drosophila larvae with complete multi-signal neural tracing to separately measure MTs and F-act. We demonstrate that dendritic arbor length is highly interrelated with local MT quantity, whereas local F-act enrichment is associated with dendritic branching. Computational simulation of arbor structure solely constrained by experimentally observed subcellular distributions of these cytoskeletal components generated synthetic morphological and molecular patterns statistically equivalent to those of real da neurons, corroborating the efficacy of local MT and F-act in describing dendritic architecture. The analysis and modeling outcomes hold true for the simplest (class I), most complex (class IV), and genetically altered (Formin3 overexpression) da neuron types.","2305":null,"2306":"Persistent activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) in diabetes increases the vulnerability of the heart to ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury. We show here that infusion of rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor) at reperfusion following ischemia reduced myocardial infarct size and apoptosis with restoration of cardiac function in type 1 diabetic rabbits. Likewise, treatment with rapamycin protected hyperglycemic human-pluripotent-stem-cells-derived cardiomyocytes (HG-hiPSC-CMs) following simulated ischemia (SI) and reoxygenation (RO). Phosphorylation of S6 (mTORC1 marker) was increased, whereas AKT phosphorylation (mTORC2 marker) and microRNA-302a were reduced with concomitant increase of its target, PTEN, following I\/R injury in diabetic heart and HG-hiPSC-CMs. Rapamycin inhibited mTORC1 and PTEN, but augmented mTORC2 with restoration of miRNA-302a under diabetic conditions. Inhibition of miRNA-302a blocked mTORC2 and abolished rapamycin-induced protection against SI\/RO injury in HG-hiPSC-CMs. We conclude that rapamycin attenuates reperfusion injury in diabetic heart through inhibition of PTEN and mTORC1 with restoration of miR-302a-mTORC2 signaling.","2307":null,"2308":null,"2309":null,"2310":null,"2311":"The emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) network shows great potential in harvesting the ocean wave energy, which can help to achieve large-scale clean wave power generation. However, due to the lack of an effective networking strategy and theoretical guidance, the practicability of the TENG network is heavily restricted. In this paper, based on the typical spherical TENG, we investigated the networking design of TENGs. Four fundamental forms of electrical networking topology are proposed for large-scale TENG networks, and the influences of cable resistance and output phase asynchrony of each unit to the network output were systematically investigated. The research results show that the forms of electrical networking topology can produce an important influence on the output power of large-scale TENG networks. This is the first strategy analysis for the TENG network, which provides a theoretical basis and a universal method for the optimization design of large-scale power networks.","2312":"Neuromorphic devices and systems have attracted attention as next-generation computing due to their high efficiency in processing complex data. So far, they have been demonstrated using both machine-learning software and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor-based hardware. However, these approaches have drawbacks in power consumption and learning speed. An energy-efficient neuromorphic computing system requires hardware that can mimic the functions of a brain. Therefore, various materials have been introduced for the development of neuromorphic devices. Here, recent advances in neuromorphic devices are reviewed. First, the functions of biological synapses and neurons are discussed. Also, deep neural networks and spiking neural networks are described. Then, the operation mechanism and the neuromorphic functions of emerging devices are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects for developing neuromorphic devices that use emerging materials are discussed.","2313":"Aging is a significant risk factor for several diseases. Studies have uncovered multiple signaling pathways that modulate aging, including insulin\/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling (IIS). In Caenorhabditis elegans, the key regulator of IIS is DAF-16\/FOXO. One of the kinases that affects DAF-16 function is the AMPK catalytic subunit homolog AAK-2. In this study, we report that PRY-1\/Axin plays an essential role in AAK-2 and DAF-16-mediated regulation of life span. The pry-1 mutant transcriptome contains many genes associated with aging and muscle function. Consistent with this, pry-1 is strongly expressed in muscles, and muscle-specific overexpression of pry-1 extends life span, delays muscle aging, and improves mitochondrial morphology in AAK-2-DAF-16-dependent manner. Furthermore, PRY-1 is necessary for AAK-2 phosphorylation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PRY-1 functions in muscles to promote the life span of animals. This study establishes Axin as a major regulator of muscle health and aging.","2314":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been identified as naturally occurring RNAs that are highly represented in the eukaryotic transcriptome. Although a large number of circRNAs have been reported, the underlying regulatory mechanism of circRNAs biogenesis remains largely unknown. Here, we integrated in-depth multi-omics data including epigenome, transcriptome, and non-coding RNA and identified candidate circRNAs in six cellular contexts. Next, circRNAs were divided into two classes (high versus low) with different expression levels. Machine learning models were constructed that predicted circRNA expression levels based on 11 different histone modifications and host gene expression. We found that the models achieve great accuracy in predicting high versus low expressed circRNAs. Furthermore, the expression levels of host genes of circRNAs, H3k36me3, H3k79me2, and H4k20me1 contributed greatly to the classification models in six cellular contexts. In summary, all these results suggest that epigenetic modifications, particularly histone modifications, can effectively predict expression levels of circRNAs.","2315":"Dense surface glycosylation on the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein acts as a shield from the adaptive immune system. However, the molecular complexity and flexibility of glycans make experimental studies a challenge. Here we have integrated high-throughput atomistic modeling of fully glycosylated HIV-1 Env with graph theory to capture immunologically important features of the shield topology. This is the first complete all-atom model of HIV-1 Env SOSIP glycan shield that includes both oligomannose and complex glycans, providing physiologically relevant insights of the glycan shield. This integrated approach including quantitative comparison with cryo-electron microscopy data provides hitherto unexplored details of the native shield architecture and its difference from the high-mannose glycoform. We have also derived a measure to quantify the shielding effect over the antigenic protein surface that defines regions of relative vulnerability and resilience of the shield and can be harnessed for rational immunogen design.","2316":"Aging and endocrine transition states can significantly impact inflammation across organ systems. Neuroinflammation is well documented in Alzheimer disease (AD). Herein, we investigated neuroinflammation that emerges during mid-life aging, chronological and endocrinological, in the female brain as an early initiating mechanism driving AD risk later in life. Analyses were conducted in a translational rodent model of mid-life chronological and endocrinological aging followed by validation in transcriptomic profiles from women versus age-matched men. In the translational model, the neuroinflammatory profile of mid-life aging in females was endocrine and chronological state specific, dynamic, anatomically distributed, and persistent. Microarray dataset analyses of aging human hippocampus indicated a sex difference in neuroinflammatory profile in which women exhibited a profile comparable to the pattern discovered in our translational rodent model, whereas age-matched men exhibited a profile consistent with low neuroimmune activation. Translationally, these findings have implications for therapeutic interventions during mid-life to decrease late-onset AD risk.","2317":null,"2318":null,"2319":null,"2320":null,"2321":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101681.].","2322":"Anti-androgens are a common therapy in prostate cancer (PCa) targeting androgen receptor (AR) signaling. However, these therapies fail due to selection of highly aggressive AR-negative cancer cells that have no therapeutic options available. We demonstrate that elevating endogenous ceramide levels with administration of exogenous ceramide nanoliposomes (CNLs) was efficacious in AR-negative cell lines with limited efficacy in AR-positive cells. This effect is mediated through reduced de novo sphingolipid synthesis in AR-positive cells. We show that anti-androgens elevate de novo generation of sphingolipids via SPTSSB, a rate-limiting mediator of sphingolipid generation. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of AR increases the efficacy of CNL in AR-positive cells through de novo synthesis, while SPTSSB knockdown limited CNL's efficacy in AR-negative cells. Alluding to clinical relevance, SPTSSB is upregulated in patients with advanced PCa after anti-androgens treatment. These findings emphasize the relevance of AR regulation upon sphingolipid metabolism and the potential of CNL as a PCa therapeutic.","2323":null,"2324":"Biomimetic catalysts have drawn broad research interest owing to both high specificity and excellent catalytic activity. Herein, we report a series of biomimetic catalysts by the integration of biomolecules (hemin or ferrous phthalocyanine) onto well-defined Au\/CeO2, which leads to the high-performance CO oxidation catalysts. Strong electronic interactions among the biomolecule, Au, and CeO2 were confirmed, and the CO uptake over hemin-Au\/CeO2 was roughly about 8 times greater than Au\/CeO2. Based on the Au\/CeO2(111) and hemin-Au\/CeO2(111) models, the density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanisms of the biomolecules-assisted catalysis process. The theoretical prediction suggests that CO and O2 molecules preferentially bind to the surface of noncontacting Au atoms (low-coordinated sites) rather than the biomolecule sites, and the accelerating oxidation of Au-bound CO occurs via either the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism or the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. Accordingly, the findings provide useful insights into developing biomimetic catalysts with low cost and high activity.","2325":null,"2326":"Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery health will (a) improve the performance and lifespan of battery packs in electric vehicles, spurring higher adoption rates, (b) determine the actual extent of battery degradation during usage, enabling a health-conscious control, and (c) assess the available battery life upon retiring of the vehicle to re-purpose the batteries for \"second-use\" applications. In this paper, the real-time validation of an advanced battery health estimation algorithm is demonstrated via electrochemistry, control theory, and battery-in-the-loop (BIL) experiments. The algorithm is an adaptive interconnected sliding mode observer, based on a battery electrochemical model, which simultaneously estimates the critical variables such as the state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). The BIL experimental results demonstrate that the SOC\/SOH estimates from the observer converge to an error of 2% with respect to their true values, in the face of incorrect initialization and sensor signal corruption.","2327":"Host-microbiota interactions create a unique metabolic milieu that modulates intestinal environments. Integration of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences and mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics has a great potential to reveal the relationship between bacterial composition and the complex metabolic network in the gut. In this study, we conducted untargeted lipidomics followed by a feature-based molecular MS\/MS spectral networking to characterize gut bacteria-dependent lipid subclasses in mice. An estimated 24.8% of lipid molecules in feces were microbiota-dependent, as judged by &gt; 10-fold decrease in antibiotic-treated mice. Among these, there was a series of unique and microbiota-related lipid structures, including acyl alpha-hydroxyl fatty acid (AAHFA) that was newly identified in this study. Based on the integrated analysis of 985 lipid profiles and 16S rRNA sequence data providing 2,494 operational taxonomic units, we could successfully predict the bacterial species responsible for the biosynthesis of these unique lipids, including AAHFA.","2328":"Leishmania braziliensis infection frequently results in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). An increase in incidence of drug-resistant CL leading to treatment failure has been reported. Identification of reliable predictors of treatment outcomes is necessary to optimize patient care. Here, we performed a prospective case-control study in which plasma levels of cytokines and lipid mediators were assessed at different time points during antileishmanial therapy in patients with CL from Brazil. Multidimensional analyses were employed to describe a combination of biomarkers able to predict and characterize treatment failure. We found a biosignature influenced mainly by plasma levels of lipid mediators that accurately predicted treatment failure. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis of a publicly available data set revealed that expression levels of genes related to lipid metabolism measured in skin lesions could distinguish treatment outcomes in CL. Thus, activation of pathways linked to lipid biosynthesis predicts treatment failure in CL. The biomarkers identified may be further explored as therapeutic targets.","2329":null,"2330":"Bone defects caused by trauma and surgery are common clinical problems encountered by orthopedic surgeons. Thus, a hard-textured, natural-like biomaterial that enables encapsulated cells to obtain the much-needed biophysical stimulation and produce functional bone tissue is needed. Incorporating nanomaterials into cell-laden hydrogels is a straightforward tactic for producing tissue engineering structures that integrate perfectly with the body and for tailoring the material characteristics of hydrogels without hindering nutrient exchange with the surroundings. In this review, recent developments in inorganic nanocomposite hydrogels for bone tissue engineering that are of vital importance but have not yet been comprehensively reviewed are summarized.","2331":"Understanding the dynamic transcriptional landscape throughout organ development will provide a template for regenerative therapies. Here, we generated a single-cell RNA sequencing atlas of murine submandibular glands identifying transcriptional profiles that revealed cellular heterogeneity during landmark developmental events: end bud formation, branching morphogenesis, cytodifferentiation, maturation, and homeostasis. Trajectory inference analysis suggests plasticity among acinar and duct populations. We identify transcription factors correlated with acinar differentiation including Spdef, Etv1, and Xbp1, and loss of Ybx1, Eno1, Sox11, and Atf4. Furthermore, we characterize two intercalated duct populations defined by either Gfra3 and Kit, or Gstt1. This atlas can be used to investigate specific cell functions and comparative studies predicting common mechanisms involved in development of branching organs.","2332":"Diadromy, the predictable movements of individuals between marine and freshwater environments, is biogeographically and phylogenetically widespread across fishes. Thus, despite the high energetic and potential fitness costs involved in moving between distinct environments, diadromy appears to be an effective life history strategy. Yet, the origin and molecular mechanisms that underpin this migratory behavior are not fully understood. In this review, we aim first to summarize what is known about diadromy in fishes; this includes the phylogenetic relationship among diadromous species, a description of the main hypotheses regarding its origin, and a discussion of the presence of non-migratory populations within diadromous species. Second, we discuss how recent research based on -omics approaches (chiefly genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics) is beginning to provide answers to questions on the genetic bases and origin(s) of diadromy. Finally, we suggest future directions for -omics research that can help tackle questions on the evolution of diadromy.","2333":"Immunotherapeutics are frequently associated with adverse side effects due to the elicitation of global immune modulation. To lower the risk of these side effects, recombinant DNA technology is employed to enhance the selectivity of cell targeting by genetically fusing different biomolecules, yielding new species referred to as multi-specific biologics. The design of new multi-specific biologics is a central challenge for the realization of new immunotherapies. To understand the molecular determinants responsible for regulating the binding between multi-specific biologics and surface-bound membrane receptors, we developed a multiscale computational framework that integrates various simulation approaches covering different timescales and spatial resolutions. Our model system of multi-specific biologics contains two natural ligands of immune receptors, which are covalently tethered by a peptide linker. Using this method, a number of interesting features of multi-specific biologics were identified. Our study therefore provides an important strategy to design the next-generation biologics for immunotherapy.","2334":null,"2335":null,"2336":"Tepotinib is an oral MET inhibitor approved for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring MET exon 14 (METex14) skipping mutations. Examining treatment-naive or tepotinib-resistant cells with MET amplification or METex14 skipping mutations identifies other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that co-exist in cells prior to tepotinib exposure and become more prominent upon tepotinib resistance. In a small cohort of patients with lung cancer with MET genetic alterations treated with tepotinib, gene copy number gains of other RTKs were found at baseline and affected treatment outcome. An Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) inhibitor delayed the emergence of tepotinib resistance and synergized with tepotinib in treatment-naive and tepotinib-resistant cells as well as in xenograft models. Alternative signaling pathways potentially diminish the effect of tepotinib monotherapy, and the combination of tepotinib with an SHP2 inhibitor enables the control of tumor growth in cells with MET genetic alterations.","2337":"In the recent decade small RNA-based inheritance has been implicated in a variety of transmitted physiological responses to the environment. In Caenorhabditis elegans, heritable small RNAs rely on RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, RNA-processing machinery, chromatin modifiers, and argonauts for their biogenesis and gene-regulatory effects. Importantly, many of these factors reside in evolutionary conserved germ granules that are required for maintaining germ cell identity and gene expression. Recent literature demonstrated that transient disturbance to the stability of the germ granules leads to changes in the pools of heritable small RNAs and the physiology of the progeny. In this piece, we discuss the heritable consequences of transient destabilization of germ granules and elaborate on the various small RNA-related processes that act in the germ granules. We further propose that germ granules may serve as environment sensors that translate environmental changes to inheritable small RNA-based responses.","2338":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease caused by an auto-reactive immune system. Recent studies also demonstrated synapse dysfunctions in MS patients and MS mouse models. We previously observed decreased synaptic vesicle exocytosis in photoreceptor synapses in the EAE mouse model of MS at an early, preclinical stage. In the present study, we analyzed whether synaptic defects are associated with altered presynaptic Ca2+ signaling. Using high-resolution immunolabeling, we found a reduced signal intensity of Cav-channels and RIM2 at active zones in early, preclinical EAE. In line with these morphological alterations, depolarization-evoked increases of presynaptic Ca2+ were significantly smaller. In contrast, basal presynaptic Ca2+ was elevated. We observed a decreased expression of Na+\/K+-ATPase and plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase 2 (PMCA2), but not PMCA1, in photoreceptor terminals of EAE mice that could contribute to elevated basal Ca2+. Thus, complex Ca2+ signaling alterations contribute to synaptic dysfunctions in photoreceptors in early EAE.","2339":null,"2340":null,"2341":"STAT3 is a transcription factor involved in several cellular activities including inflammation, proliferation, and survival, but it also plays a non-transcriptional role in modulating mitochondrial metabolism. Given its diverse functions in human cancers, it is an emerging therapeutic target. Here we show that OPB-51602, a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3, is highly toxic in a STAT3-dependent manner. Specifically, drug toxicity depends on mitochondrial STAT3 as tumor cells expressing only a mitochondrially restricted form of STAT3 are sensitive to the compound, whereas STAT3-null cells are protected. OPB-51602 inhibited complex I activity and led to increased ROS production, which in turn induced mitophagy, actin rearrangements, and cell death. Cells undergoing reduced oxidative phosphorylation or expressing NDI1 NADH dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which bypasses mammalian complex I, were resistant to OPB-51602 toxicity. These results show that targeting mitochondrial STAT3 function causes synthetic lethality through complex I inhibition that could be exploited for cancer chemotherapy.","2342":"Low-cost, scalable energy storage is the key to continuing growth of renewable energy technologies. Here a battery with sedimentary slurry electrode (SSE) is proposed. Through the conversion of discrete particles between sedimentary and suspending types, it not only inherits the advantages of semi-solid flow cell but also exhibits high energy density and stable conductive network. Given an example, the zinc SSE (ZSSE) delivers a large discharge capacity of 479.2 mAh g-1 at 10 mA cm-2. More importantly, by renewal of the slurry per 20 cycles, it can run for 112 and 75 cycles before falling below 80% of designed capacity under 10 mA cm-2 (20% DODZn) and 25 mA cm-2 (25% DODZn), respectively. The lost capacity after cycles is able to recover after slurry renewal and the end-of-life SSE can be easily reused by re-formation. The concept of SSE brands a new way for electrochemical energy storage.","2343":"Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2), a risk gene for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), is implicated in telencephalon development. Because AUTS2 is also expressed in the cerebellum where defects have been linked to ASDs, we investigated AUTS2 functions in the cerebellum. AUTS2 is specifically localized in Purkinje cells (PCs) and Golgi cells during postnatal development. Auts2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice exhibited smaller and deformed cerebella containing immature-shaped PCs with reduced expression of Cacna1a. Auts2 cKO and knock-down experiments implicated AUTS2 participation in elimination and translocation of climbing fiber synapses and restriction of parallel fiber synapse numbers. Auts2 cKO mice exhibited behavioral impairments in motor learning and vocal communications. Because Cacna1a is known to regulate synapse development in PCs, it suggests that AUTS2 is required for PC maturation to elicit normal development of PC synapses and thus the impairment of AUTS2 may cause cerebellar dysfunction related to psychiatric illnesses such as ASDs.","2344":"Climate change is one of the processes that have already overstepped the safe planetary boundaries, together with the rate of biodiversity loss and human interference with the nitrogen and phosphorus cycles. The three processes are related to agriculture and, as such, to both food safety and food security, and ultimately to human health. Adaptation to climate change is a difficult breeding objective because of its complexity, its unpredictability, and its location specificity. However, one strategy exists, which is based on a more dynamic use of agrobiodiversity in agriculture through the cultivation of evolutionary populations. In this review, we show how the translation into agricultural practice of nearly 100 years of research on evolutionary populations and mixtures is able to address the complexity of climate change while stabilizing yield, decreasing the use of most agrochemicals, thus reducing emissions and producing healthy food.","2345":"In this perspective, we highlight the role of surface heterogeneity in electrosynthesis reactions. Heterogeneities may come in the form of distinct crystallographic facets, boundaries between facets or grains, or point defects. We approach this topic from a foundation of surface science, where signatures from model systems provide understanding of observations on more complex and higher-surface-area materials. In parallel, probe-based techniques can inform directly on spatial variation across electrode surfaces. We call attention to the role spectroscopy can play in understanding the impact of these heterogeneities in electrocatalyst activity and selectivity, particularly where these surface features have effects extending into the electrolyte double layer.","2346":"Sensors are a key component of the Internet of Things (IoTs) to collect information of environments or objects. Considering the tremendous number and complex working conditions of sensors, multifunction and self-powered feathers are two basic requirements. Nanogenerators are a kind of devices based on the triboelectric, piezoelectric, or pyroelectric effects to harvest ambient energy and then converting to electricity. The hybridized nanogenerators that combined multiple effects in one device have great potential in multifunctional self-powered sensors because of the unique superiority such as generating electrical signals directly, responding to diverse stimuli, etc. This review aims at introducing the latest advancements of hybridized nanogenerators for multifunctional self-powered sensing. Firstly, the principles and sensor prototypes based on TENG are summarized. To avoid signal interference and energy insufficiently, the multifunctional self-powered sensors based on hybridized nanogenerators are reviewed.

However, these similarities do not directly transfer to the success of efficient computation without device and algorithm co-designs and optimizations. Contemporary deep learning algorithms demand the memristive artificial synapses to ideally possess analog weighting and linear weight-update behavior, requiring substantial device-level and circuit-level optimization. Such co-design and optimization have been the main focus of memristive neuromorphic engineering, which often abandons the \"non-ideal\" behaviors of memristive devices, although many of them resemble what have been observed in biological components. Novel brain-inspired algorithms are being proposed to utilize such behaviors as unique features to further enhance the efficiency and intelligence of neuromorphic computing, which calls for collaborations among electrical engineers, computing scientists, and neuroscientists.","2348":null,"2349":null,"2350":"An incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL) is a network motif known for its ability to accelerate responses and generate pulses. It remains an open question to understand the behavior of IFFLs in contexts with high levels of retroactivity, where an upstream transcription factor binds to numerous downstream binding sites. Here we study the behavior of IFFLs by simulating and comparing ODE models with different levels of retroactivity. We find that increasing retroactivity in an IFFL can increase, decrease, or keep the network's response time and pulse amplitude constant. This suggests that increasing retroactivity, traditionally considered an impediment to designing robust synthetic systems, could be exploited to improve the performance of IFFLs. In contrast, we find that increasing retroactivity in a negative autoregulated circuit can only slow the response. The ability of an IFFL to flexibly handle retroactivity may have contributed to its significant abundance in both bacterial and eukaryotic regulatory networks.","2351":null,"2352":null,"2353":null,"2354":null,"2355":"The transcription factor NRL (neural retina leucine zipper) has been canonized as the master regulator of photoreceptor cell fate in the retina.

Transgenic expression of Nrl from zebrafish or mouse was sufficient to induce rod photoreceptor cells. Zebrafish nrl -\/- mutants lacked rods (and had excess UV-sensitive cones) as young larvae; thus, the conservation of Nrl function between mice and zebrafish appears sound. Strikingly, however, rods were abundant in adult nrl -\/- null mutant zebrafish. Rods developed in adults despite Nrl protein being undetectable. Therefore, a yet-to-be-revealed non-canonical pathway independent of Nrl is able to specify the fate of some rod photoreceptors.","2356":"The mammalian vocal pattern generator is situated in the brainstem but its exact structure is debated. We mapped these circuits in rats by cooling and microstimulation. Local cooling disrupted call production above an anterior and a posterior brainstem position. Anterior cooling affected predominantly high-frequency calls, whereas posterior cooling affected low-frequency calls. Electrical microstimulation of the anterior part led to modulated high-frequency calls, whereas microstimulation of the posterior part led to flat, low-frequency calls. At intermediate positions cooling did not affect calls and stimulation did not elicit calls. The anterior region corresponds to a subsection of the parvicellular reticular formation that we term the vocalization parvicellular reticular formation (VoPaRt). The posterior vocalization sites coincide with the nucleus retroambiguus (NRA). VoPaRt and NRA neurons were very small and the VoPaRt was highly myelinated, suggestive of high-speed processing. Our data suggest an anatomically and functionally bipartite vocal pattern generator.","2357":"Invasion and proliferation are defining phenotypes of cancer, and in glioblastoma blocking one stimulates the other, implying that effective therapy must inhibit both, ideally through a single target that is also dispensable for normal tissue function. The molecular motor myosin 10 meets these criteria. Myosin 10 knockout mice can survive to adulthood, implying that normal cells can compensate for its loss; its deletion impairs invasion, slows proliferation, and prolongs survival in murine models of glioblastoma. Myosin 10 deletion also enhances tumor dependency on the DNA damage and the metabolic stress responses and induces synthetic lethality when combined with inhibitors of these processes. Our results thus demonstrate that targeting myosin 10 is active against glioblastoma by itself, synergizes with other clinically available therapeutics, may have acceptable side effects in normal tissues, and has potential as a heretofore unexplored therapeutic approach for this disease.","2358":"Nucleic acids, aside from being best known as the carrier of genetic information, are versatile biomaterials for constructing nanoscopic devices for biointerfacing, owing to their unique properties such as specific base pairing and predictable structure. For live-cell analysis of native RNA transcripts, the most widely used nucleic acid-based nanodevice has been the molecular beacon (MB), a class of stem-loop-forming probes that is activated to fluoresce upon hybridization with target RNA. Here, we overview efforts that have been made in developing MB-based bioassays for sensitive intracellular analysis, particularly at the single-molecule level. We also describe challenges that are currently limiting the widespread use of MBs and provide possible solutions. With continued refinement of MBs in terms of labeling specificity and detection accuracy, accompanied by new development in imaging platforms with unprecedented sensitivity, the application of MBs is envisioned to expand in various biological research fields.","2359":"AMPylation is a post-translational modification that modifies amino acid side chains with adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Recently, a role of AMPylation as a universal regulatory mechanism in infection and cellular homeostasis has emerged, driving the demand for universal tools to study this modification. Here, we describe three monoclonal anti-AMP antibodies (mAbs) from mouse that are capable of protein backbone-independent recognition of AMPylation, in denatured (western blot) as well as native (ELISA, IP) applications, thereby outperforming previously reported tools. These antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for AMP modifications, highlighting their potential as tools for new target identification, as well as for validation of known targets. Interestingly, applying the anti-AMP mAbs to various cancer cell lines reveals a previously undescribed broad and diverse AMPylation pattern. In conclusion, these anti-AMP mABs will further advance the current understanding of AMPylation and the spectrum of modified targets.","2360":null,"2361":null,"2362":"PINK1 loss-of-function mutations cause early onset Parkinson disease. PINK1-Parkin mediated mitophagy has been well studied, but the relevance of the endogenous process in the brain is debated. Here, the absence of PINK1 in human dopaminergic neurons inhibits ionophore-induced mitophagy and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential. Compensatory, mitochondrial renewal maintains mitochondrial morphology and protects the respiratory chain. This is paralleled by metabolic changes, including inhibition of the TCA cycle enzyme mAconitase, accumulation of NAD+, and metabolite depletion. Loss of PINK1 disrupts dopamine metabolism by critically affecting its synthesis and uptake. The mechanism involves steering of key amino acids toward energy production rather than neurotransmitter metabolism and involves cofactors related to the vitamin B6 salvage pathway identified using unbiased multi-omics approaches. We propose that reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential that cannot be controlled by PINK1 signaling initiates metabolic compensation that has neurometabolic consequences relevant to Parkinson disease.","2363":"The merger of transition metal catalysis and electroorganic synthesis has recently emerged as a versatile platform for the development of highly enabling radical reactions in a sustainable fashion. Electrochemistry provides access to highly reactive radical species under extremely mild reaction conditions from abundant native functionalities. Transition metal catalysts can be used as redox-active electrocatalysts to shuttle electrons, chiral information to organic substrates, and the reactive intermediates in the electrolytic systems. The combination of these strategies in this mechanistic paradigm thus makes the generation and utilization of radical species in a chemoselective manner and allows further application to more synthetically attractive enantioselective radical transformations. This perspective discusses key advances over the past few years in the field of electrochemical transition metal catalysis and demonstrates how the unique features of this strategy permit challenging or previously elusive transformations via radical pathways to be successfully achieved.","2364":"Anaerobic digestion was one of the first bioenergy strategies developed, yet the interactions of the microbial community that is responsible for the production of methane are still poorly understood. For example, it has only recently been recognized that the bacteria that oxidize organic waste components can forge electrical connections with methane-producing microbes through biologically produced, protein-based, conductive circuits. This direct interspecies electron transfer (DIET) is faster than interspecies electron exchange via diffusive electron carriers, such as H2. DIET is also more resilient to perturbations such as increases in organic load inputs or toxic compounds. However, with current digester practices DIET rarely predominates. Improvements in anaerobic digestion associated with the addition of electrically conductive materials have been attributed to increased DIET, but experimental verification has been lacking. This deficiency may soon be overcome with improved understanding of the diversity of microbes capable of DIET, which is leading to molecular tools for determining the extent of DIET. Here we review the microbiology of DIET, suggest molecular strategies for monitoring DIET in anaerobic digesters, and propose approaches for re-engineering digester design and practices to encourage DIET.","2365":null,"2366":null,"2367":"An extensive body of evidence supports the notion that exposure to an enriched\/impoverished environment alters brain functions via epigenetic changes. However, how specific modifications of social environment modulate brain functions remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we investigate the molecular and behavioral consequences of briefly manipulating social settings in young and middle-aged wild-type mice. We observe that, modifications of the social context, only affect the performance in socially related tasks. Social enrichment increases sociability whereas isolation leads to the opposite effect. Our work also pointed out specific miRNA signatures associated to each social environment. These miRNA alterations are reversible and found selectively in the medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, we show that miRNA modifications linked to social enrichment or isolation might target rather different intracellular pathways. Together, these observations suggest that the prefrontal cortex may be a key brain area integrating social information via the modification of precise miRNA networks.","2368":null,"2369":null,"2370":"Graphene materials (GMs) are being investigated for multiple microbiological applications because of their unique physicochemical characteristics including high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area, and robust mechanical strength. In the last decade, studies on the interaction of GMs with bacterial cells appear conflicting. On one side, GMs have been developed to promote the proliferation of electroactive bacteria on the surface of electrodes in bioelectrochemical systems or to accelerate interspecies electron transfer during anaerobic digestion. On the other side, GMs with antibacterial properties have been synthesized to prevent biofilm formation on membranes for water treatment, on medical equipment, and on tissue engineering scaffolds. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms and factors determining the positive or negative impact of GMs on bacteria. Furthermore, we examine the bacterial growth-promoting and antibacterial applications of GMs and debate their practicability.","2371":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.100855.].","2372":"Heterologous expression of a biosynthesis gene cluster from Amycolatopsis sp. resulted in the discovery of two unique class IV lasso peptides, felipeptins A1 and A2. A mixture of felipeptins stimulated proliferation of cancer cells, while having no such effect on the normal cells. Detailed investigation revealed, that pre-treatment of cancer cells with a mixture of felipeptins resulted in downregulation of the tumor suppressor Rb, making the cancer cells to proliferate faster. Pre-treatment with felipeptins made cancer cells considerably more sensitive to the anticancer agent doxorubicin and re-sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to this drug. Structural characterization and binding experiments showed an interaction between felipeptins resulting in complex formation, which explains their synergistic effect. This discovery may open an alternative avenue in cancer treatment, helping to eliminate quiescent cells that often lead to cancer relapse.","2373":null,"2374":null,"2375":null,"2376":null,"2377":null,"2378":"The influence of DNA methylation on gene behavior and its consequent phenotypic effects appear to be very important, but the details are not well understood. Insects offer a diversity of DNA methylation modes, making them an excellent lineage for comparative analyses. However, functional studies have tended to focus on quite specialized holometabolan species, such as wasps, bees, beetles, and flies. Here, we have studied DNA methylation in the hemimetabolan insect Blattella germanica. In this cockroach, a gene involved in DNA methylation, DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), is expressed in early embryogenesis. In our experiments, RNAi of DNMT1 reduces DNA methylation and impairs blastoderm formation. Using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing and transcriptome analyses, we observed that methylated genes are associated with metabolism and are highly expressed, whereas unmethylated genes are related to signaling and show low expression. Moreover, methylated genes show greater expression change and less expression variability than unmethylated genes.","2379":"Regional changes to the intestinal microenvironment brought about by Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery may contribute to some of its potent systemic metabolic benefits through favorably regulating various local cellular processes. Here, we show that the intestinal contents of RYGB-operated compared with sham-operated rats region-dependently confer superior glycemic control to recipient germ-free mice in association with suppression of endotoxemia. Correspondingly, they had direct barrier-stabilizing effects on an intestinal epithelial cell line which, bile-exposed intestinal contents, were partly farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-dependent. Further, circulating fibroblast growth factor 19 levels, a readout of intestinal FXR activation, negatively correlated with endotoxemia severity in longitudinal cohort of RYGB patients. These findings suggest that various host- and\/or microbiota-derived luminal factors region-specifically and synergistically stabilize the intestinal epithelial barrier following RYGB through FXR signaling, which could potentially be leveraged to better treat endotoxemia-induced insulin resistance in obesity in a non-invasive and more targeted manner.","2380":null,"2381":null,"2382":null,"2383":"The lipid bilayer plays a pivotal role in force transmission to many mechanically-gated channels. We developed the technology to monitor membrane diffusivity in order to test the hypothesis positing that Ca2+ regulates open probability (P o) of cochlear hair cell mechanotransduction (MET) channels via the plasma membrane. The stereociliary membrane was more diffusive (9x) than the basolateral membrane. Elevating intracellular Ca2+ buffering or lowering extracellular Ca2+ reduced stereociliary diffusivity and increased MET P o. In contrast, prolonged depolarization increased stereociliary diffusivity and reduced MET P o. No comparable effects were noted for soma measurements. Although MET channels are located in the shorter stereocilia rows, both rows had similar baseline diffusivity and showed similar responses to Ca2+ manipulations and MET channel blocks, suggesting that diffusivity is independent of MET. Together, these data suggest that the stereociliary membrane is a component of a calcium-modulated viscoelastic-like element regulating hair cell mechanotransduction.","2384":"Computational psychiatry is a nascent field that attempts to use multi-level analyses of the underlying computational problems that we face in navigating a complex, uncertain and changing world to illuminate mental dysfunction and disease. Two particular foci of the field are the costs and benefits of environmental adaptivity and the danger and necessity of heuristics. Here, we examine the extent to which these foci and others can be used to study the actual and potential flaws of the artificial computational devices that we are increasingly inventing and empowering to navigate this very same environment on our behalf.","2385":null,"2386":"Acute hypoxia (HX) causes extensive cellular damage in the developing human cerebral cortex. We found increased expression of activated-EGFR in affected cortical areas of neonates with HX and investigated its functional role in the piglet, which displays a highly evolved, gyrencephalic brain, with a human-like maturation pattern. In the piglet, HX-induced activation of EGFR and Ca2+\/calmodulin kinase IV (CaMKIV) caused cell death and pathological alterations in neurons and glia. EGFR blockade inhibited CaMKIV activation, attenuated neuronal loss, increased oligodendrocyte proliferation, and reversed HX-induced astrogliosis. We performed for the first time high-throughput transcriptomic analysis of the piglet cortex to define molecular responses to HX and to uncover genes specifically involved in EGFR signaling in piglet and human brain injury. Our results indicate that specific molecular responses modulated by EGFR may be targeted as a therapeutic strategy for HX injury in the neonatal brain.","2387":"White adipose tissue (WAT) is a dynamic tissue, which responds to environmental stimuli and dietary cues by changing its morphology and metabolic capacity. The ability of WAT to undergo a beige remodeling has become an appealing strategy to combat obesity and its comorbidities. Here, by using single-cell RNA sequencing, we provide a comprehensive atlas of the cellular dynamics during beige remodeling. We reveal drastic changes both in the overall cellular composition and transcriptional states of individual cell subtypes between Adrb3- and cold-induced beiging. Moreover, we demonstrate that cold induces a myeloid to lymphoid shift of the immune compartment compared to Adrb3 activation. Further analysis showed that, Adrb3 stimulation leads to activation of the interferon\/Stat1 pathways favoring infiltration of myeloid immune cells, while repression of this pathway by cold promotes lymphoid immune cell recruitment. These findings highlight that pharmacological mimetics may not provide the same beneficial effects as physiological stimuli.","2388":"Social dilemmas are often shaped by actions involving uncertain returns only achievable in the future, such as climate action or voluntary vaccination. In this context, uncertainty may produce non-trivial effects. Here, we assess experimentally - through a collective risk dilemma - the effect of timing uncertainty, i.e. how uncertainty about when a target needs to be reached affects the participants' behaviors. We show that timing uncertainty prompts not only early generosity but also polarized outcomes, where participants' total contributions are distributed unevenly. Furthermore, analyzing participants' behavior under timing uncertainty reveals an increase in reciprocal strategies. A data-driven game-theoretical model captures the self-organizing dynamics underpinning these behavioral patterns. Timing uncertainty thus casts a shadow on the future that leads participants to respond early, whereas reciprocal strategies appear to be important for group success. Yet, the same uncertainty also leads to inequity and polarization, requiring the inclusion of new incentives handling these societal issues.","2389":null,"2390":null,"2391":null,"2392":null,"2393":null,"2394":"Several treatments have been attempted in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) animal models and patients. Recently, transplantation of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (MNCs) was investigated as a regenerative therapy for ALS, but satisfactory treatments remain to be established. To develop an effective treatment, we focused on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) expressing hepatocyte growth factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, and insulin-like growth factor using human artificial chromosome vector (HAC-MSCs). Here, we demonstrated the transplantation of MNCs with HAC-MSCs in ALS mice. As per our results, the progression of motor dysfunction was significantly delayed, and their survival was prolonged dramatically. Additional analysis revealed preservation of motor neurons, suppression of gliosis, engraftment of numerous MNCs, and elevated chemotaxis-related cytokines in the spinal cord of treated mice. Therefore, growth factor-expressing MSCs enhance the therapeutic effects of bone marrow-derived MNCs for ALS and have a high potential as a novel cell therapy for patients with ALS.","2395":null,"2396":"The relative contribution of the two phagosomal catabolic processes, oxidative and metabolic, was assessed in the killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in phagosomes of alveolar macrophages (AMs) from wild-type (p47-phox +\/+ ) or NOX-defective (p47-phox -\/- ) mice. Free radical release and degradative acidification within AM phagosomes is sequential and separable. The initial NOX activity, identifiable as a transient alkalinization, leads to fast bacterial wall permeabilization by ROS. This is followed by V-ATPase-induced acidification and enzymatic bacterial degradation contributed through phagosomal-lysosomal fusion. The alkalinization\/acidification ratio was variable among phagosomes within single cells of a given genotype and not as a function of macrophage M1 or M2 classification, possibly owing to uneven distribution of phagosomal transporter proteins. Irregular, excessive NOX activity prevents phago-lysosomal fusion, and the lack of V-ATPase-induced acidification leads to bacterial stasis in the phagosome. Thus, efficient phagosomal bacterial killing is a result of tightly balanced activity between two processes.","2397":"Chondrichthyan (cartilaginous fish) occupies a key phylogenetic position and is important for investigating evolutionary processes of vertebrates. However, limited whole genomes impede our in-depth knowledge of important issues such as chromosome evolution and immunity. Here, we report the chromosome-level genome of white-spotted bamboo shark. Combing it with other shark genomes, we reconstructed 16 ancestral chromosomes of bamboo shark and illustrate a dynamic chromosome rearrangement process. We found that genes on 13 fast-evolving chromosomes can be enriched in immune-related pathways. And two chromosomes contain important genes that can be used to develop single-chain antibodies, which were shown to have high affinity to human disease markers by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We also found three bone formation-related genes were lost due to chromosome rearrangements. Our study highlights the importance of chromosome rearrangements, providing resources for understanding of cartilaginous fish diversification and potential application of single-chain antibodies.","2398":"Reports indicate an association between COVID-19 and anosmia, as well as the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virions in the olfactory bulb. To test whether the olfactory neuroepithelium may represent a target of the virus, we generated RNA-seq libraries from human olfactory neuroepithelia, in which we found substantial expression of the genes coding for the virus receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) and for the virus internalization enhancer TMPRSS2. We analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sustentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues. Finally, we found ACE2 transcripts in specific brain cell types, both in mice and humans. Sustentacular cells thus represent a potential entry door for SARS-CoV-2 in a neuronal sensory system that is in direct connection with the brain.","2399":"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the brain and the most common form of dementia among the elderly. The single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-Seq) techniques are extremely useful for dissecting the function\/dysfunction of highly heterogeneous cells in the brain at the single-cell level, and the corresponding data analyses can significantly improve our understanding of why particular cells are vulnerable in AD. We developed an integrated database named scREAD (single-cell RNA-Seq database for Alzheimer's disease), which is as far as we know the first database dedicated to the management of all the existing scRNA-Seq and snRNA-Seq data sets from the human postmortem brain tissue with AD and mouse models with AD pathology. scREAD provides comprehensive analysis results for 73 data sets from 10 brain regions, including control atlas construction, cell-type prediction, identification of differentially expressed genes, and identification of cell-type-specific regulons.","2400":null,"2401":"The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the marine sector were around 2.6% of world GHG emissions in 2015 and are expected to increase 50%-250% to 2050 under a \"business as usual\" scenario, making the decarbonization of this fossil fuel-intensive sector an urgent priority. Biofuels, which come in various forms, are one of the most promising options to replace existing marine fuels for accomplishing this in the short to medium term. Some unique challenges, however, impede biofuels penetration in the shipping sector, including the low cost of the existing fuels, the extensive present-day refueling infrastructure, and the exclusion of the sector from the Paris climate agreement. To address this, it is necessary to first identify those biofuels best suited for deployment as marine fuel. In this work, the long list of possible biofuel candidates has been narrowed down to four high-potential options-bio-methanol, bio-dimethyl ether, bio-liquefied natural gas, and bio-oil. These options are further evaluated based on six criteria-cost, potential availability, present technology status, GHG mitigation potential, infrastructure compatibility, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) compatibility-via both an extensive literature review and stakeholder discussions. These four candidates turn out to be relatively evenly matched overall, but each possesses certain strengths and shortcomings that could favor that fuel under specific circumstances, such as if compatibility with existing shipping infrastructure or with CCS deployment become pivotal requirements. Furthermore, we pay particular attention to the possibility of integrating deployment of these biofuels with CCS to further reduce marine sector emissions. It is shown that this aspect is presently not on the radar of the industry stakeholders but is likely to grow in importance as CCS acceptability increases in the broader green energy sector.","2402":"As a key precursor for nitrogenous compounds and fertilizer, ammonia affects our lives in numerous ways. Rapid and sensitive detection of ammonia is essential, both in environmental monitoring and in process control for industrial production. Here we report a novel and nonperturbative method that allows rapid detection of ammonia at low concentrations, based on the all-optical detection of surface-enhanced Raman signals. We show that this simple and affordable approach enables ammonia probing at selected regions of interest with high spatial resolution, making in situ and operando observations possible.","2403":"Thresholds are widespread in origin of life scenarios, from the emergence of chirality, to the appearance of vesicles, of autocatalysis, all the way up to Darwinian evolution. Here, we analyze the \"error threshold,\" which poses a condition for sustaining polymer replication, and generalize the threshold approach to other properties of prebiotic systems. Thresholds provide theoretical predictions, prescribe experimental tests, and integrate interdisciplinary knowledge. The coupling between systems and their environment determines how thresholds can be crossed, leading to different categories of prebiotic transitions. Articulating multiple thresholds reveals evolutionary properties in prebiotic scenarios. Overall, thresholds indicate how to assess, revise, and compare origin of life scenarios.","2404":null,"2405":"Infrared PbS colloidal quantum dot (CQD)-based materials receive significant attention because of its unique properties. The PbS CQD ink that originates from ligand exchange of CQDs is highly potential for efficient and stable infrared CQD solar cells (CQDSCs) using low-temperature solution-phase processing. In this review, we present a comprehensive overview of CQD inks for the development of efficient infrared solar cells, which can effectively harvest the photons from the infrared wavelength region of the solar spectrum, including the importance of infrared absorbers for solar cells, the unique properties of CQDs, ligand-exchange determined CQD inks, and related photovoltaic performance of CQDSCs. Finally, we present a brief conclusion, and the possible challenges and opportunities of the CQD inks are discussed in-depth to further develop highly efficient and stable infrared solar cells.","2406":"A lymph node sinus-on-a-chip adhesion microfluidic platform that recapitulates the hydrodynamic microenvironment of the lymph node subcapsular sinus was engineered. This device was used to interrogate the effects of lymph node remodeling on cellular adhesion in fluid flow relevant to lymphatic metastasis. Wall shear stress levels analytically estimated and modeled after quiescent and diseased\/inflamed lymph nodes were experimentally recapitulated using a flow-based microfluidic perfusion system to assess the effects of physiological flow fields on human metastatic cancer cell adhesion. Results suggest that both altered fluid flow profiles and presentation of adhesive ligands, which are predicted to manifest within the lymph node subcapsular sinus as a result of inflammation-induced remodeling, and the presence of lymph-borne monocytic cells may synergistically contribute to the dynamic extent of cell adhesion in flow relevant to lymph node invasion by cancer and monocytic immune cells during lymphatic metastasis.","2407":"Nature does nothing in vain. Through millions of years of revolution, living organisms have evolved hierarchical and anisotropic structures to maximize their survival in complex and dynamic environments. Many of these structures are intrinsically heterogeneous and often with functional gradient distributions. Understanding the convergent and divergent gradient designs in the natural material systems may lead to a new paradigm shift in the development of next-generation high-performance bio-\/nano-materials and devices that are critically needed in energy, environmental remediation, and biomedical fields. Herein, we review the basic design principles and highlight some of the prominent examples of gradient biological materials\/structures discovered over the past few decades. Interestingly, despite the anisotropic features in one direction (i.e., in terms of gradient compositions and properties), these natural structures retain certain levels of symmetry, including point symmetry, axial symmetry, mirror symmetry, and 3D symmetry. We further demonstrate the state-of-the-art fabrication techniques and procedures in making the biomimetic counterparts. Some prototypes showcase optimized properties surpassing those seen in the biological model systems. Finally, we summarize the latest applications of these synthetic functional gradient materials and structures in robotics, biomedical, energy, and environmental fields, along with their future perspectives. This review may stimulate scientists, engineers, and inventors to explore this emerging and disruptive research methodology and endeavors.","2408":null,"2409":"Cellular cheating leading to cancers exists in all branches of multicellular life, favoring the evolution of adaptations to avoid or suppress malignant progression, and\/or to alleviate its fitness consequences. Ecologists have until recently largely neglected the importance of cancer cells for animal ecology, presumably because they did not consider either the potential ecological or evolutionary consequences of anticancer adaptations. Here, we review the diverse ways in which the evolution of anticancer adaptations has significantly constrained several aspects of the evolutionary ecology of multicellular organisms at the cell, individual, population, species, and ecosystem levels and suggest some avenues for future research.","2410":"AMFR\/gp78 and USP13 are a pair of ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinase that ensure the accuracy of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Depletion of USP13 leads to caspase activation and cleavage of the ERAD chaperone BAG6, which is reversed by knockdown of AMFR. However, the mechanism and physiological relevance of this regulation are still unclear. Here, by using the NEDDylator system, we screened out TXN as a substrate of AMFR and USP13 and showed its involvement in regulating CASP3 activation and BAG6 cleavage. Furthermore, we showed that the cleaved N-terminal BAG6 is located in the cytosol and interacts with both LC3B-I and unprocessed form of LC3B (Pro-LC3B) through the LIR1 motif to suppress autophagy. An NMR approach verified the direct interaction between BAG6 LIR1 and LC3B-I or Pro-LC3B. Collectively, our findings uncover a mechanism that converts BAG6 from an ERAD regulator to an autophagy tuner and apoptosis inducer during ER stress.","2411":"Titanium and its alloys have emerged as excellent candidates for use as orthopedic biomaterials. Nevertheless, there are often complications arising after implantation of orthopedic devices, most notably prosthetic joint infection and aseptic loosening. To ensure that implanted devices remain functional in situ, innovation in surface modification has attracted much attention in the effort to develop orthopedic materials with optimal characteristics at the biomaterial-tissue interface. This review will draw together metallurgy, surface engineering, biofilm microbiology, and biomaterial science. It will serve to appreciate why titanium and its alloys are frequently used orthopedic biomaterials and address some of the challenges facing these biomaterials currently, including the significant problem of device-associated infection. Finally, the authors shall consolidate and evaluate surface modification techniques employed to overcome some of these issues by offering a unique perspective as to the direction in which research is headed from a broad, interdisciplinary point of view.","2412":"Transcriptional fidelity depends on accurate promoter selection and initiation from the correct sites. In yeast, H3K36me3-mediated recruitment of the Rpd3S HDAC complex to gene bodies suppresses spurious transcription initiation. Here we describe an equivalent pathway in metazoans. PWWP2A\/B is an H3K36me3 reader that forms a stable complex with HDAC1\/2. We used CAGE-seq to profile all transcription initiation sites in wild-type mESCs and cells lacking PWWP2A\/B. Loss of PWWP2A\/B enhances spurious initiation from intragenic sites present in wild-type mESCs, and this effect is associated with increased levels of initiating Pol-II and histone acetylation. Spurious initiation events in Pwwp2a\/b DKO mESCs do not overlap in genomic location or chromatin features with spurious sites that arise in Dnmt3b KO mESCs, previously reported to function in the suppression of intragenic transcriptional initiation, suggesting these pathways function cooperatively in maintaining the fidelity of transcription initiation in metazoans.","2413":null,"2414":null,"2415":"Glia, the helper cells of the brain, are essential in maintaining neural resilience across time and varying challenges: By reacting to changes in neuronal health glia carefully balance repair or disposal of injured neurons. Malfunction of these interactions is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. We present a reductionist model that mimics repair-or-dispose decisions to generate a hypothesis for the cause of disease onset. The model assumes four tissue states: healthy and challenged tissue, primed tissue at risk of acute damage propagation, and chronic neurodegeneration. We discuss analogies to progression stages observed in the most common neurodegenerative conditions and to experimental observations of cellular signaling pathways of glia-neuron crosstalk. The model suggests that the onset of neurodegeneration can result as a compromise between two conflicting goals: short-term resilience to stressors versus long-term prevention of tissue damage.","2416":null,"2417":"Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk of cardiomyopathy at birth and myocardial infarction in adulthood, but prevention is hindered because mechanisms remain unknown. We previously showed that maternal glucolipotoxicity increases the risk of cardiomyopathy and mortality in newborn rats through fuel-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. Here we demonstrate ongoing cardiometabolic consequences by cross-fostering and following echocardiography, cardiomyocyte bioenergetics, mitochondria-mediated turnover, and cell death following metabolic stress in aged adults. Like humans, cardiac function improves by weaning with no apparent differences in early adulthood but declines again in aged diabetes-exposed offspring. This is preceded by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, exaggerated age-related increase in mitochondrial number, and higher oxygen consumption. Prenatally exposed male cardiomyocytes have more mitolysosomes indicating high baseline turnover; when exposed to metabolic stress, mitophagy cannot increase and cardiomyocytes have faster mitochondrial membrane potential loss and mitochondria-mediated cell death. Details highlight age- and sex-specific roles of mitochondria in developmentally programmed adult heart disease.","2418":"Urban rooftop functional design offers a promising option to enable multi-function urban land-use to deliver multiple ecosystem services, e.g., food production by rooftop agriculture and energy supply by installing photovoltaic (PV) panels. To identify the best rooftop utilization strategy considering multiple decision criteria and understand the impact of rooftop solution on the design of urban energy systems, we propose a whole system modeling framework that integrates biogeochemical simulation and multi-objective energy system optimization. We apply the framework to evaluate three rooftop agriculture options, namely, basic rooftop farming, unconditioned greenhouse, and conditioned greenhouse, and one rooftop energy supply option, i.e., PV panels, for an urban energy eco-design case in Shanghai, China. Enabling rooftop agriculture options brings more flexibility to the design and operation of energy systems. PV panels provide cost-optimal solutions, whereas conditioned greenhouse potentially delivers environmentally sustainable land-use by contributing to climate regulation ecosystem services.","2419":"Clinical evidence supports a role for the extracellular matrix (ECM) in cancer risk and prognosis across multiple tumor types, and numerous studies have demonstrated that individual ECM components impact key hallmarks of tumor progression (e.g., proliferation, migration, angiogenesis). However, the ECM is a complex network of fibrillar proteins, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans that undergoes dramatic changes in composition and organization during tumor development. In this review, we will highlight how engineering approaches can be used to examine the impact of changes in tissue architecture, ECM composition (i.e., identity and levels of individual ECM components), and cellular- and tissue-level mechanics on tumor progression. In addition, we will discuss recently developed methods to model the ECM that have not yet been applied to the study of cancer.","2420":null,"2421":"The ability to group sensory data into behaviorally meaningful classes and to maintain these perceptual categories active in working memory is key to intelligent behavior. Here, we show that carrion crows, highly vocal and cognitively advanced corvid songbirds, possess categorical auditory working memory. The crows were trained in a delayed match-to-category task that required them to flexibly match remembered sounds based on the upward or downward shift of the sounds' frequency modulation. After training, the crows instantaneously classified novel sounds into the correct auditory categories. The crows showed sharp category boundaries as a function of the relative frequency interval of the modulation. In addition, the crows generalized frequency-modulated sounds within a category and correctly classified novel sounds kept in working memory irrespective of other acoustic features of the sound. This suggests that crows can form and actively memorize auditory perceptual categories in the service of cognitive control of their goal-directed behaviors.","2422":"Evolution is generally considered to be unpredictable because genetic variations are known to occur randomly. However, remarkable patterns of repeated convergent evolution are observed, for instance, loss of pigments by organisms living in caves. Analogous phenotypes appear in similar environments, sometimes in response to similar constraints. Alongside randomness, a certain evolutionary determinism also exists, for instance, the selection of particular phenotypes subjected to particular environmental constraints in the \"evolutionary funnel.\" We pursue the idea that eco-evolutionary specialization is in some way determinist. The conceptual framework of phenotypic changes entailing specialization presented in this essay explains how evolution can be predicted. We also discuss how the predictability of evolution could be tested using the case of metabolic specialization through gene losses. We also put forward that microorganisms could be key models to test and possibly make headway evolutionary predictions and knowledge about evolution.","2423":"Evolution gave rise to creatures that are arguably more sophisticated than the greatest human-designed systems. This feat has inspired computer scientists since the advent of computing and led to optimization tools that can evolve complex neural networks for machines-an approach known as \"neuroevolution.\" After a few successes in designing evolvable representations for high-dimensional artifacts, the field has been recently revitalized by going beyond optimization: to many, the wonder of evolution is less in the perfect optimization of each species than in the creativity of such a simple iterative process, that is, in the diversity of species. This modern view of artificial evolution is moving the field away from microevolution, following a fitness gradient in a niche, to macroevolution, filling many niches with highly different species. It already opened promising applications, like evolving gait repertoires, video game levels for different tastes, and diverse designs for aerodynamic bikes.","2424":null,"2425":null,"2426":null,"2427":null,"2428":null,"2429":null,"2430":"A revitalization of organic electrosynthesis has incited the organic chemistry community to adopt electrochemistry as a green and cost-efficient method for activating small molecules to replace highly toxic and expensive redox chemicals. However, many of the critical challenges of batch electrosynthesis, especially for organic synthesis, still remain. The combination of continuous flow technology and electrochemistry is a potent means to enable industry to implement large scale electrosynthesis. Indeed, flow electrosynthesis helps overcome problems that mainly arise from macro batch electro-organic systems, such as mass transfer, ohmic drop, and selectivity, but this is still far from being a flawless and generic applicable process. As a result, a notable increase in research on methodology and hardware sophistication has emerged, and many hitherto uncharted chemistries have been achieved. To better help the commercialization of wide-scale electrification of organic synthesis, we highlight in this perspective the advances made in large-scale flow electrosynthesis and its future trajectory while pointing out the main challenges and key improvements of current methodologies.","2431":"Colon cancer remains the third most common cause of cancer in the US, and the third most common cause of cancer death. Worldwide, colon cancer is the second most common cause of cancer and cancer deaths. At least 25% of patients still present with metastatic disease, and at least 25-30% will develop metastatic colon cancer in the course of their disease. While chemotherapy and surgery remain the mainstay of treatment, understanding the fundamental cellular niche and mechanical properties that result in metastases would facilitate both prevention and cure. Advances in biomaterials, novel 3D primary human cells, modelling using microfluidics and the ability to alter the physical environment, now offers a unique opportunity to develop and test impactful treatment.","2432":"The universal importance of epigenetic regulation has become explicit over the last decade. There is now a detailed understanding of the molecular signatures and chromatin-modifying enzymes determining epigenetic regulation. For example, the trimethylation of lysine 27 at histone H3 by Polycomb complexes is a hallmark of silenced gene expression conserved across animal and plant kingdoms. The repressive activity of Polycomb complexes is balanced by the histone demethylase activity of Jumonji C-domain proteins. There has been a lot of research on Polycomb functions and H3K27 methylation; however, until recently, little was known about the role of histone H3K27 demethylases. Here, we review the role of Jumonji C-domain proteins from the plant development perspective. We will recall the history of histone lysine demethylation and explore the recent advances on the H3K27 demethylases in plant biology. Conserved and novel genomic functions of these epigenetic regulators will be discussed.","2433":null,"2434":"HIV-1 envelope (Env) N-glycosylation impact virus-cell entry and immune evasion. How each glycan interacts to shape the Env-protein-sugar complex and affects Env function is not well understood. Here, analysis of two Env variants from the same donor, with differing functional characteristics and N-glycosylation-site composition, revealed that changes to key N-glycosylation sites affected the Env structure at distant locations and had a ripple effect on Env-wide glycan processing, virus infectivity, antibody recognition, and virus neutralization. Specifically, the N262 glycan, although not in the CD4-binding site, modulated Env binding to the CD4 receptor, affected Env recognition by several glycan-dependent neutralizing antibodies, and altered site-specific glycosylation heterogeneity, with, for example, N448 displaying limited glycan processing. Molecular-dynamic simulations visualized differences in glycan density and how specific oligosaccharide positions can move to compensate for a glycan loss. This study demonstrates how changes in individual glycans can alter molecular dynamics, processing, and function of the Env-glycan shield.","2435":null,"2436":null,"2437":"Biofilms are the habitat of 95% of bacteria successfully protecting bacteria from many antibiotics. However, inhibiting biofilm formation is difficult in that it is a complex system involving the physical and chemical interaction of both substrate and bacteria. Focusing on the substrate surface and potential interactions with bacteria, we examined both physical and chemical properties of substrates coated with a series of phenyl acrylate monomer derivatives. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed smooth surfaces often approximating surgical grade steel. Induced biofilm growth of five separate bacteria on copolymer samples comprising varying concentrations of phenyl acrylate monomer derivatives evidenced differing degrees of biofilm resistance via optical microscopy. Using goniometric surface analyses, the van Oss-Chaudhury-Good equation was solved linear algebraically to determine the surface energy profile of each polymerized phenyl acrylate monomer derivative, two bacteria, and collagen. Based on the microscopy and surface energy profiles, a thermodynamic explanation for biofilm resistance is posited.","2438":null,"2439":"Efficient thermal energy harvesting using phase change materials (PCMs) has great potential for thermal energy storage and thermal management applications. Benefiting from these merits of pore structure diversity, convenient controllability, and excellent thermophysical stability, SiO2-based composite PCMs have comparatively shown more promising prospect. In this regard, the microstructure-thermal property correlation of SiO2-based composite PCMs is still unclear despite the significant achievements in structural design. To enrich the fundamental understanding on the correlations between the microstructure and the thermal properties, we systematically summarize the state-of-the-art advances in SiO2-based composite PCMs for tuning thermal energy storage from the perspective of tailoring chemistry strategies. In this review, the tailoring chemistry influences of surface functional groups, pore sizes, dopants, single shell, and hybrid shells on the thermal properties of SiO2-based composite PCMs are systematically summarized and discussed. This review aims to provide in-depth insights into the correlation between structural designs and thermal properties, thus showing better guides on the tailor-made construction of high-performance SiO2-based composite PCMs. Finally, the current challenges and future recommendations for the tailoring chemistry are also highlighted.","2440":null,"2441":"Lipid composition varies among organelles, and the distinct lipid composition is important for specific functions of each membrane. Lipid transport between organelles, which is critical for the maintenance of membrane lipid composition, occurs by either vesicular or non-vesicular mechanisms. In yeast, ceramide synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is transported to the Golgi apparatus where inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC) is formed. Here we show that a fraction of Tcb3p, a yeast tricalbin protein, localizes to ER-Golgi contact sites. Tcb3p and their homologs Tcb1p and Tcb2p are required for formation of ER-Golgi contacts and non-vesicular ceramide transport. Absence of Tcb1p, Tcb2p, and Tcb3p increases acylceramide synthesis and subsequent lipid droplet (LD) formation. As LD can sequester excess lipids, we propose that tricalbins act as regulators of ceramide transport at ER-Golgi contact sites to help reduce a potentially toxic accumulation of ceramides.","2442":"CDK6 is frequently overexpressed in various cancer types and functions as a positive regulator of the cell cycle and as a coregulator of gene transcription. We provide evidence that CDK6 is involved in the process of DNA methylation, at least in ALL. We observe a positive correlation of CDK6 and DNMT expression in a large number of ALL samples. ChIP-seq analysis reveals CDK6 binding to genomic regions associated with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). ATAC-seq shows a strong reduction in chromatin accessibility for DNMT3B in CDK6-deficient BCR-ABL + Cdk6-\/- cells, accompanied by lower levels of DNMT3B mRNA and less chromatin-bound DNMT3B, as shown by RNA-seq and chromatome analysis. Motif analysis suggests that ETS family members interact with CDK6 to regulate DNMT3B. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing analysis uncovers reversible and cell line-specific changes in DNA methylation patterns upon CDK6 loss. The results reveal a function of CDK6 as a regulator of DNA methylation in transformed cells.","2443":"Although the influence of sleep quality on the immune system is well documented, the mechanisms behind its impact on natural host immunity remain unclear. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that neuroimmune interactions play an important role in this phenomenon. To evaluate the impact of stress-induced sleep disturbance on host immunity, we used a murine model of rapid eye movement sleep deprivation (RSD) integrated with a model of malaria blood-stage infection. We demonstrate that sleep disturbance compromises the differentiation of T follicular helper cells, increasing host susceptibility to the parasite. Chemical inhibition of glucocorticoid (Glcs) synthesis showed that abnormal Glcs production compromised the transcription of Tfh-associated genes resulting in impaired germinal center formation and humoral immune response. Our data demonstrate that RSD-induced abnormal activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis drives host susceptibility to infection. Understanding the impact of sleep quality in natural resistance to infection may provide insights for disease management.","2444":"The effects of solvent absorption on the electrochemical and mechanical properties of polymer electrolytes for use in solid-state batteries have been measured by researchers since the 1980s. These studies have shown that small amounts of absorbed solvent may increase ion mobility and decrease crystallinity in these materials. Even though many polymers and lithium salts are hygroscopic, the solvent content of these materials is rarely reported. As ppm-level solvent content may have important consequences for the lithium conductivity and crystallinity of these electrolytes, more widespread reporting is recommended. Here we illustrate that ppm-level solvent content can significantly increase ion mobility, and therefore the reported performance, in solid polymer electrolytes. Additionally, the impact of absorbed solvents on other battery components has not been widely investigated in all-solid-state battery systems. Therefore, comparisons will be made with systems that use liquid electrolytes to better understand the consequences of absorbed solvents on electrode performance.","2445":null,"2446":"One hallmark of the visual system is a strict retinotopic organization from the periphery toward the central brain, where functional imaging in Drosophila revealed a spatially accurate representation of visual cues in the central complex. This raised the question how, on a circuit level, the topographic features are implemented, as the majority of visual neurons enter the central brain converge in optic glomeruli. We discovered a spatial segregation of topographic versus nontopographic projections of distinct classes of medullo-tubercular (MeTu) neurons into a specific visual glomerulus, the anterior optic tubercle (AOTU). These parallel channels synapse onto different tubercular-bulbar (TuBu) neurons, which in turn relay visual information onto specific central complex ring neurons in the bulb neuropil. Hence, our results provide the circuit basis for spatially accurate representation of visual information and highlight the AOTU's role as a prominent relay station for spatial information from the retina to the central brain.","2447":null,"2448":null,"2449":"By testing pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-based lentivirus, this study reports that exosomes\/microvesicles (Ex\/Mv) isolated from murine hypothalamic neural stem\/progenitor cells (htNSC) or subtype htNSCPGHM as well as hippocampal NSC have innate immunity-like actions against these RNA viruses. These extracellular vesicles also have a cell-free innate antiviral action by attacking and degrading viruses. We further generated the induced versions of Ex\/Mv through prior viral exposure to NSCs and found that these induced Ex\/Mv were stronger than basal Ex\/Mv in reducing the infection of these viruses, suggesting the involvement of an adaptive immunity-like antiviral function. These NSC Ex\/Mv were found to be characterized by producing large libraries of P element-induced wimpy testis (PIWI)-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) against genomes of various viruses, and some of these piRNAs were enriched during the adaptive immunity-like reaction, possibly contributing to the antiviral effects of these Ex\/Mv. In conclusion, NSC Ex\/Mv have antiviral immunity and could potentially be developed to combat against various viruses.","2450":null,"2451":null,"2452":null,"2453":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101530.].","2454":null,"2455":null,"2456":"Advances in single cell genomics and transcriptomics have shown that at tissue level there is complex cellular heterogeneity. To understand the effect of this inter-cell heterogeneity on metabolism it is essential to develop a single cell lipid profiling approach that allows the measurement of lipids in large numbers of single cells from a population. This will provide a functional readout of cell activity and membrane structure. Using liquid extraction surface analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry we have developed a high-throughput method for untargeted single cell lipid profiling. This technological advance highlighted the importance of cellular heterogeneity in the functional metabolism of individual human dopamine neurons, suggesting that A53T alpha-synuclein (SNCA) mutant neurons have impaired membrane function. These results demonstrate that this single cell lipid profiling platform can provide robust data that will expand the frontiers in biomedical research.","2457":"A major feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathology is the accumulation of ubiquitin (Ub) into intracellular inclusions. This sequestration of Ub may reduce the availability of free Ub, disrupting Ub homeostasis and ultimately compromising cellular function and survival. We previously reported significant disturbance of Ub homeostasis in neuronal-like cells expressing mutant SOD1. Here, we show that Ub homeostasis is also perturbed in neuronal-like cells expressing either TDP-43 or FUS. The expression of mutant TDP-43 and mutant FUS led to UPS dysfunction, which was associated with a redistribution of Ub and depletion of the free Ub pool. Redistribution of Ub is also a feature of sporadic ALS, with an increase in Ub signal associated with inclusions and no compensatory increase in Ub expression. Together, these findings suggest that alterations to Ub homeostasis caused by the misfolding and aggregation of ALS-associated proteins play an important role in the pathogenesis of ALS.","2458":"Tissue damage triggers a rapid innate immune response that mediates host defense. Previously we reported that thermal damage of the larval zebrafish fin disrupts collagen organization and induces a robust and potentially damaging innate immune response. The mechanisms that drive damaging versus protective neutrophil inflammation in interstitial tissues remain unclear. Here we identify distinct cues in the tissue microenvironment that differentially drive neutrophil and macrophage responses to sterile injury. Using live imaging, we found a motile zone for neutrophils, but not macrophages, in collagen-free regions and identified a specific role for interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor signaling in neutrophil responses to thermal damage. IL-6 receptor mutants show impaired neutrophil recruitment to sterile thermal injury that was not present in tissues infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These findings identify distinct signaling networks during neutrophil recruitment to sterile and microbial damage cues and provide a framework to limit potentially damaging neutrophil inflammation.","2459":"The reproducibility crisis is a multifaceted problem involving ingrained practices within the scientific community. Fortunately, some causes are addressed by the author's adherence to rigor and reproducibility criteria, implemented via checklists at various journals. We developed an automated tool (SciScore) that evaluates research articles based on their adherence to key rigor criteria, including NIH criteria and RRIDs, at an unprecedented scale. We show that despite steady improvements, less than half of the scoring criteria, such as blinding or power analysis, are routinely addressed by authors; digging deeper, we examined the influence of specific checklists on average scores. The average score for a journal in a given year was named the Rigor and Transparency Index (RTI), a new journal quality metric. We compared the RTI with the Journal Impact Factor and found there was no correlation. The RTI can potentially serve as a proxy for methodological quality.","2460":"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a paradoxical state of wake-like brain activity occurring after non-REM (NREM) sleep in mammals and birds. In mammals, brain cooling during NREM sleep is followed by warming during REM sleep, potentially preparing the brain to perform adaptively upon awakening. If brain warming is the primary function of REM sleep, then it should occur in other animals with similar states. We measured cortical temperature in pigeons and bearded dragons, lizards that exhibit NREM-like sleep and REM-like sleep with brain activity resembling wakefulness. In pigeons, cortical temperature decreased during NREM sleep and increased during REM sleep. However, brain temperature did not increase when dragons switched from NREM-like to REM-like sleep. Our findings indicate that brain warming is not a universal outcome of sleep states characterized by wake-like activity, challenging the hypothesis that their primary function is to warm the brain in preparation for wakefulness.","2461":"The tyrosine kinase receptor ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2) is overexpressed in lung (LSCC) and head and neck (HNSCC) squamous cell carcinomas. Although EPHA2 can inhibit tumorigenesis in a ligand-dependent fashion via phosphorylation of Y588 and Y772, it can promote tumorigenesis in a ligand-independent manner via phosphorylation of S897. Here, we show that EPHA2 and Roundabout Guidance Receptor 1 (ROBO1) interact to form a functional heterodimer. Furthermore, we show that the ROBO1 ligand Slit Guidance Ligand 2 (SLIT2) and ensartinib, an inhibitor of EPHA2, can attenuate growth of HNSCC cells and act synergistically in LSCC cells. Our results suggest that patients with LSCC and HNSCC may be stratified and treated based on their EPHA2 and ROBO1 expression patterns. Although ~73% of patients with LSCC could benefit from SLIT2+ensartinib treatment, ~41% of patients with HNSCC could be treated with either SLIT2 or ensartinib. Thus, EPHA2 and ROBO1 represent potential LSCC and HNSCC theranostics.","2462":"As the world's demand for alternative energy increases, the development of green energy harvesters becomes ever more important. As a result, the creation of triboelectric (TENG), piezoelectric (PENG), and pyroelectric nanogenerators, electromagnetic generators (EMG), solar cells, and electrochemical cells is attracting interest in an effort to convert mechanical, thermal, magnetic, solar, and chemical energy into electricity. In order to take advantage of the ambient energies from our surrounding environment, the design of hybridized generator units that can simultaneously scavenge energy in a variety of forms continues to develop. These systems are being considered to satisfy the energy needs of a range of electronic devices and adapt to a variety of working environments. This review demonstrates the latest progress in hybridized nanogenerators in accordance with their structure, operating principle, and applications. These studies demonstrate new approaches to developing hybrid techniques and novel assemblies for efficiently harvesting environmental energy from a number of sources.","2463":"Cancer cells alter their nutrition metabolism to cope the stressful environment. One important metabolism adjustment is that cancer cells activate glutaminolysis in response to the reduced carbon from glucose entering into the TCA cycle due to inactivation of several enzymes in glycolysis. An important question is how the cancer cells coordinate the changes of glycolysis and glutaminolysis. In this report, we demonstrate that the pyruvate kinase inactive dimer PKM2 facilitates activation of glutaminolysis. Our experiments show that growth stimulations promote PKM2 dimer. The dimer PKM2 plays a role in regulation of glutaminolysis by upregulation of mitochondrial glutaminase I (GLS-1). PKM2 dimer regulates the GLS-1 expression by controlling internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent c-myc translation. Growth stimulations promote PKM2 interacting with c-myc IRES-RNA, thus facilitating c-myc IRES-dependent translation. Our study reveals an important linker that coordinates the metabolism adjustment in cancer cells.","2464":"Photoreceptors, especially cones, which are enriched in the human macula, have high energy demands, making them vulnerable to metabolic stress. Metabolic dysfunction of photoreceptors and their supporting retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an important underlying cause of degenerative retinal diseases. However, how cones and the macula support their exorbitant metabolic demand and communicate with RPE is unclear. By profiling metabolite uptake and release and analyzing metabolic genes, we have found cone-rich retinas and human macula share specific metabolic features with upregulated pathways in pyruvate metabolism, mitochondrial TCA cycle, and lipid synthesis. Human neural retina and RPE have distinct but complementary metabolic features. Retinal metabolism centers on NADH production and neurotransmitter biosynthesis. The retina needs aspartate to sustain its aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial metabolism. RPE metabolism is directed toward NADPH production and biosynthesis of acetyl-rich metabolites, serine, and others. RPE consumes multiple nutrients, including proline, to produce metabolites for the retina.","2465":"Although a rising concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ has long been recognized as an essential signal for apoptosis, the dynamical mechanisms by which Ca2+ regulates apoptosis are not clear yet. To address this, we constructed a computational model that integrates known biochemical reactions and can reproduce the dynamical behaviors of Ca2+-induced apoptosis as observed in experiments. Model analysis shows that oscillating Ca2+ signals first convert into gradual signals and eventually transform into a switch-like apoptotic response. Via the two processes, the apoptotic signaling pathway filters the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations effectively but instead responds acutely to their amplitude. Collectively, our results suggest that Ca2+ regulates apoptosis mainly via oscillation amplitude, rather than frequency, modulation. This study not only provides a comprehensive understanding of how oscillatory Ca2+ dynamically regulates the complex apoptotic signaling network but also presents a typical example of how Ca2+ controls cellular responses through amplitude modulation.","2466":null,"2467":"An essential event in gene regulation is the binding of a transcription factor (TF) to its target DNA. Models considering the interactions between the TF and the DNA geometry proved to be successful approaches to describe this binding event, while conserving data interpretability. However, a direct characterization of the DNA shape contribution to binding is still missing due to the lack of accurate and large-scale binding affinity data. Here, we use a binding assay we recently established to measure with high sensitivity the binding specificities of 13 Drosophila TFs, including dinucleotide dependencies to capture non-independent amino acid-base interactions. Correlating the binding affinities with all DNA shape features, we find that shape readout is widely used by these factors. A shape readout\/TF-DNA complex structure analysis validates our approach while providing biological insights such as positively charged or highly polar amino acids often contact nucleotides that exhibit strong shape readout.","2468":null,"2469":"The transcription factor EB (TFEB) has emerged as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, exocytosis, and autophagy, promoting the clearance of substrates stored in cells. c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase that participates in cellular signaling in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. In this study, we explored the connection between c-Abl and TFEB. Here, we show that under pharmacological and genetic c-Abl inhibition, TFEB translocates into the nucleus promoting the expression of its target genes independently of its well-known regulator, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Active c-Abl induces TFEB phosphorylation on tyrosine and the inhibition of this kinase promotes lysosomal biogenesis, autophagy, and exocytosis. c-Abl inhibition in Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) models, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes, promotes a cholesterol-lowering effect in a TFEB-dependent manner. Thus, c-Abl is a TFEB regulator that mediates its tyrosine phosphorylation, and the inhibition of c-Abl activates TFEB promoting cholesterol clearance in NPC models.","2470":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) initiation is characterized by stepwise accumulation of molecular alterations, during which the early events are largely unknown. Here, we presented a comprehensive genomic and transcriptomic landscape at stages of hepatitis, cirrhosis, and HCC by using a diethylnitrosamine-induced rat HCC model. We observed the early occurrence of gene instability and aberrant cancer associated signaling pathways in liver hepatitis. We further characterized the progressive molecular changes during hepatocarcinogenesis, wherein the intense rivalry between tumor-suppressive and oncogenic strengths occurred in cirrhosis stage. Despite the significant pathological difference, mutation signatures and expression landscape are highly similar between hepatitis and cirrhosis stages. Furthermore, we identified PI3K-Akt signaling pathway as a key pathway in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis through integrative analysis, and PIK3CD is a potential biomarker indicating HCC recurrence. The dynamic immune response during hepatocarcinogenesis, such as continuous decline of monocytes, suggests an immunological intervention strategy beyond chemoprevention for liver cancer.","2471":"Biological circuits and systems within even a single cell need to be represented by large-scale feedback networks of nonlinear, stochastic, stiff, asynchronous, non-modular coupled differential equations governing complex molecular interactions. Thus, rational drug discovery and synthetic biological design is difficult. We suggest that a four-pronged interdisciplinary approach merging biology and electronics can help: (1) The mapping of biological circuits to electronic circuits via quantitatively exact schematics; (2) The use of existing electronic circuit software for hierarchical modeling, design, and analysis with such schematics; (3) The use of cytomorphic electronic hardware for rapid stochastic simulation of circuit schematics and associated parameter discovery to fit measured biological data; (4) The use of bio-electronic reporting circuits rather than bio-optical circuits for measurement. We suggest how these approaches can be combined to automate design, modeling, analysis, simulation, and quantitative fitting of measured data from a synthetic biological operational amplifier circuit in living microbial cells.","2472":null,"2473":"Understanding plant adaptive responses to the space environment is a requisite for enabling space farming. Spaceflight produces deleterious effects on plant cells, particularly affecting ribosome biogenesis, a complex stress-sensitive process coordinated with cell division and differentiation, known to be activated by red light. Here, in a series of ground studies, we have used mutants from the two Arabidopsis nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2, nucleolar regulators of ribosome biogenesis) to better understand their role in adaptive response mechanisms to stress on Earth. Thus, we show that nucleolin stress-related gene NUC2 can compensate for the environmental stress provided by darkness in nuc1 plants, whereas nuc2 plants are not able to provide a complete response to red light. These ground control findings, as part of the ESA\/NASA Seedling Growth spaceflight experiments, will determine the basis for the identification of genetic backgrounds enabling an adaptive advantage for plants in future space experiments.","2474":"Logic gates are important components in integrated photonic circuitry. Here, a series of logic gates to achieve fundamental logic operations based on linear interference in spoof surface plasmon polariton waveguides are demonstrated at terahertz frequencies. A metasurface-based plasmonic source is adopted to couple free-space terahertz radiation into surface waves, followed by a funnel-shaped metasurface to efficiently couple the surface waves to the waveguides built on a domino structure. A single Mach-Zehnder waveguide interferometer can work as logic gates for four logic functions: AND, NOT, OR, and XOR. By cascading two such interferometers, NAND and NOR operations can also be achieved. Experimental investigations are supported by numerical simulations, and good agreement is obtained. The logic gates have compact sizes and high intensity contrasts for the output \"1\" and \"0\" states. More complicated functions can be envisioned and will be of great value for future terahertz integrated computing.","2475":null,"2476":"The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG) are two recently developed technologies for effective harvesting of ambient mechanical energy for the creation of self-powered systems. The advantages of TENGs and PENGs which include large open-circuit output voltage, low cost, ease of fabrication, and high conversion efficiency enable their application as new flexible sensors, wearable devices, soft robotics, and machines. This perspective provides an overview of the current state of the art in triboelectric and piezoelectric devices that are used as self-powered sensors and energy harvesters for soft robots and machines; hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both mechanisms are also discussed. To improve system performance and efficiency, the potential of providing self-powered soft systems with a degree of multifunctionality is investigated. This includes optical sensing, transparency, self-healing, water resistance, photo-luminescence, or an ability to operate in hostile environments such as low temperature, high humidity, or high strain\/stretch. Finally, areas for future research directions are identified.","2477":"Adapting organisms face a tension between specializing their phenotypes for certain ecological tasks and developing generalist strategies that permit persistence in multiple environmental conditions. Understanding when and how generalists or specialists evolve is an important question in evolutionary dynamics. Here, we study the evolution of bacterial range expansions by selecting Escherichia coli for faster migration through porous media containing one of four different sugars supporting growth and chemotaxis. We find that selection in any one sugar drives the evolution of faster migration in all sugars. Measurements of growth and motility of all evolved lineages in all nutrient conditions reveal that the ubiquitous evolution of fast migration arises via phenotypic plasticity. Phenotypic plasticity permits evolved strains to exploit distinct strategies to achieve fast migration in each environment, irrespective of the environment in which they were evolved. Therefore, selection in a homogeneous environment drives phenotypic plasticity that improves performance in other environments.","2478":"The reproduction of the shape of giant vesicles usually results in the increase of their \"population\" size. This may be achieved on giant vesicles by appropriately supplying \"mother\" vesicles with membranogenic amphiphiles. The next \"generation\" of \"daughter\" vesicles obtained from this \"feeding\" is inherently difficult to distinguish from the original mothers. Here we report on a method for the consecutive feeding with different fatty acids that each provoke membrane growth and detachment of daughter vesicles from glass microsphere-supported phospholipidic mother vesicles. We discovered that a saturated fatty acid was carried over to the next generation of mothers better than two unsaturated congeners. This has an important bearing on the growth and replication of primitive compartments at the early stages of life. Microsphere-supported vesicles are also a precise analytical tool.","2479":"Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials and their heterostructures have recently been recognized as promising building blocks for futuristic brain-like neuromorphic computing devices. They exhibit unique properties such as near-atomic thickness, dangling-bond-free surfaces, high mechanical robustness, and electrical\/optical tunability. Such attributes unattainable with traditional electronic materials are particularly promising for high-performance artificial neurons and synapses, enabling energy-efficient operation, high integration density, and excellent scalability. In this review, diverse 2D materials explored for neuromorphic applications, including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, and black phosphorous, are comprehensively overviewed. Their promise for neuromorphic applications are fully discussed in terms of material property suitability and device operation principles. Furthermore, up-to-date demonstrations of neuromorphic devices based on 2D materials or their heterostructures are presented. Lastly, the challenges associated with the successful implementation of 2D materials into large-scale devices and their material quality control will be outlined along with the future prospect of these emergent materials.","2480":"How the extracellular matrix (ECM) affects the progression of a localized tumor to invasion of the ECM and eventually to vascular dissemination remains unclear. Although many studies have examined the role of the ECM in early stages of tumor progression, few have considered the subsequent stages that culminate in intravasation. In the current study, we have developed a three-dimensional (3D) microfluidic culture system that captures the entire process of invasion from an engineered human micro-tumor of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through a type I collagen matrix and escape into a lymphatic-like cavity. By varying the physical properties of the collagen, we have found that MDA-MB-231 tumor cells invade and escape faster in lower-density ECM. These effects are mediated by the ECM pore size, rather than by the elastic modulus or interstitial flow speed. Our results underscore the importance of ECM structure in the vascular escape of human breast cancer cells.","2481":null,"2482":null,"2483":null,"2484":"The Arabian killifish, Aphanius dispar, is a small tropical teleost fish living in wide range of habitats in sea water and fresh water in the Middle East. Here, we report extraordinary fluorescent pigment cells in the Arabian killifish embryo. These cells appear brown in transmitted light, yellowish white in reflected light, and as strong fluorescence in GFP and RFP filters. TEM and confocal microscopy analyses show the fluorescence emanates from leucosome-like pigment organelles. The cells express the gene encoding GTP cyclohydrolase (gch), a marker for leucophores and xanthophore. Gene knockdown and knockout of gch using morpholino or CRISPR-Cas9 induced loss of fluorescence in these embryos, indicating a crucial role of the enzyme and the associated pterine biosynthesis pathway in the generation of the fluorescence. We concluded that these cells are a highly fluorescent subtype of leucophores and have named them as fluoroleucophores.","2485":"Human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 can be used for the production of therapeutic glycoproteins requiring human post-translational modifications. High cell density perfusion processes are advantageous for such production but are challenging due to the shear sensitivity of HEK293 cells. To understand the impact of hollow filter cell separation devices, cells were cultured in bioreactors operated with tangential flow filtration (TFF) or alternating tangential flow filtration (ATF) at various flow rates. The average theoretical velocity profile in these devices showed a lower shear stress for ATF by a factor 0.637 compared to TFF. This was experimentally validated and, furthermore, transcriptomic evaluation provided insights into the underlying cellular processes. High shear caused cellular stress leading to apoptosis by three pathways, i.e. endoplasmic reticulum stress, cytoskeleton reorganization, and extrinsic signaling pathways. Positive effects of mild shear stress were observed, with increased recombinant erythropoietin production and increased gene expression associated with transcription and protein phosphorylation.","2486":"The finding of bulk quantum oscillations in the Kondo insulator SmB6 proved a considerable surprise. Subsequent measurements of bulk quantum oscillations in other correlated insulators including YbB12 lent support to our discovery of a class of bulk unconventional insulators that host bulk quantum oscillations. Here we perform a series of experiments to examine evidence for the intrinsic character of bulk quantum oscillations in floating zone-grown single crystals of SmB6 that have been the subject of our quantum oscillation studies. We present results of thermodynamic, transport, and composition analysis experiments on pristine floating zone-grown single crystals of SmB6 and compare quantum oscillations with metallic LaB6 and elemental aluminum. These results establish the intrinsic origin of quantum oscillations from the insulating bulk of floating zone-grown SmB6. The similarity of the Fermi surface in insulating SmB6 with the conduction-electron Fermi surface in metallic hexaborides is at the heart of a theoretical mystery.","2487":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016\/j.isci.2020.101496.].","2488":null,"2489":"Inhibition of the ATR kinase has emerged as a therapeutically attractive means to target cancer since the development of potent inhibitors, which are now in clinical testing. We investigated a potential link between ATR inhibition and the autophagy process in esophageal cancer cells using four ATR inhibitors including two in clinical testing. The response to pharmacological ATR inhibitors was compared with genetic systems to investigate the ATR dependence of the effects observed. The ATR inhibitor, VX-970, was found to lead to an accumulation of p62 and LC3-II indicative of a blocked autophagy. This increase in p62 occurred post-transcriptionally and in all the cell lines tested. However, our data indicate that the accumulation of p62 occurred in an ATR-independent manner and was instead an off-target response to the ATR inhibitor. This study has important implications for the clinical response to pharmacological ATR inhibition, which in some cases includes the blockage of autophagy.","2490":"Rare diseases are an emerging global health priority. Although individually rare, the prevalence of rare \"orphan\" diseases is high, affecting approximately 300 million people worldwide. Treatments for these conditions are often inadequate, leaving the disease to progress unabated. Here, we review the clinical features and pathophysiology of neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (NIV), a rare inflammatory retinal disease caused by mutations in the CAPN5 gene. Although the prevalence of NIV is low (1 in 1,000,000 people), the disease mimics more common causes of blindness (e.g. uveitis, retinitis pigmentosa, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy) at distinct clinical stages. There is no cure for NIV to date. We highlight how personalized proteomics helped identify potential stage-specific biomarkers and drug targets in liquid vitreous biopsies. The NIV vitreous proteome revealed enrichment of molecular pathways associated with common retinal pathologies and implicated superior targets for therapeutic drug repositioning. In addition, we review our pipeline for collecting, storing, and analyzing ophthalmic surgical samples. This approach can be adapted to treat a variety of rare genetic diseases.","2491":null,"2492":null,"2493":"Stress adaptation is exploited by cancer cells to survive and proliferate under adverse conditions. Survival pathways induced by stress are thus highly promising therapeutic targets. One key pathway involves formation of cytoplasmic stress granules, which regulate the location, stability, and translation of specific mRNAs. Here, we describe a transcriptional stress response that is triggered by similar stressors and characterized by accumulation of RepoMan (cell division cycle associated 2) at nuclear stress foci (nucSF). Formation of these structures is reversible, and they are distinct from known nuclear organelles and stress bodies. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed accumulation of heterochromatic markers, and increased association of RepoMan with the adenylate cyclase 2 (ADCY2) gene locus in stressed cells accompanied reduced levels of ADCY2 mRNA and protein. Quantitative comparison of the RepoMan interactome in stressed vs. unstressed cells identified condensin II as a nucSF factor, suggesting their functional association in the establishment and\/or maintenance of these facultative heterochromatic domains.","2494":null,"2495":null,"2496":"Dr Francesca Ciccarelli (The Francis Crick Institute, UK) and Dr James De Gregori (University of Colorado, USA) interview 3 top scientists in clinical (Dr Charles Swanton, The Francis Crick Institute, UK), molecular (Dr Kornelia Polyak, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, USA), and evolutionary cancer research (Dr Carlo Maley, Arizona State University, USA) to discuss the current status of knowledge, the challenges, and the opportunities to move the field forward.","2497":"Machine learning has been heavily researched and widely used in many disciplines. However, achieving high accuracy requires a large amount of data that is sometimes difficult, expensive, or impractical to obtain. Integrating human knowledge into machine learning can significantly reduce data requirement, increase reliability and robustness of machine learning, and build explainable machine learning systems. This allows leveraging the vast amount of human knowledge and capability of machine learning to achieve functions and performance not available before and will facilitate the interaction between human beings and machine learning systems, making machine learning decisions understandable to humans. This paper gives an overview of the knowledge and its representations that can be integrated into machine learning and the methodology. We cover the fundamentals, current status, and recent progress of the methods, with a focus on popular and new topics. The perspectives on future directions are also discussed.","2498":"Photoelectrochemical water splitting has been intensively investigated as artificial photosynthesis technology to convert solar energy into chemical energy. The use of seawater and salted water has advantages for minimum environmental burden; however, the oxidation of Cl- ion to hypochlorous acid (HClO), which has toxicity and heavy corrosiveness, should occur at the anode, along with the oxygen evolution. Here, O2 and HClO production in aqueous solution containing Cl- on photoanodes modified with various metal oxides was investigated. The modification of MnOx resulted in the promotion of the O2 evolution reaction (OER) specifically without HClO production over a wide range of conditions. The results will contribute not only to the practical application of artificial photosynthesis using salted water but also to the elucidation of substantial function of manganese as the element for OER center in natural photosynthesis.","2499":null,"2500":"The SARS-CoV-2 immune response in human milk has not yet been examined, although protecting infants and young children from COVID-19 is critical for limiting community transmission and preventing serious illness and death. Here, milk samples from eight COVID-19-recovered and seven COVID-19-suspected donors were tested for antibody (Ab) binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. All samples exhibited significant specific IgA reactivity to the full Spike, whereas 80% exhibited significant IgA and secretory (s)Ab binding to the Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD). Additionally, 67% samples exhibited IgG and\/or IgM binding to RBD. IgA and sAb titers were highly correlated, indicating most IgA to be sIgA. Overall, these data indicate that a robust sIgA-dominant SARS-CoV-2 Ab response in human milk after infection should be expected in a significant majority of individuals. Further research is highly warranted to determine Ab functionality and the potential for exploiting extracted milk sIgA for therapeutic use.","2501":"Circumventing the emergence of fungicide-resistant strains is a crucial issue for robust disease management in agriculture. The agricultural fungicide ferimzone has been used for the control of rice diseases including rice blast. The emergence of ferimzone-resistant strains in rice fields has not been reported. Here, we identified the copper transport CoICT1 gene as the ferimzone sensitivity gene in Colletotrichum orbiculare and the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Genetic and cytological analyses showed that functional defects in the copper transport pathways, consisting of CoIct1 and P-type ATPase CoCcc2, led to the low sensitivity to ferimzone and the pathogenicity defect due to attenuated melanization in the appressorium. Importantly, the presence of CuSO4 induced high sensitivity to ferimzone even in the coict1 mutant. Our study shows that there is a trade-off relation between the sensitivity to ferimzone and fungal pathogenicity.","2502":null,"2503":"Principled computational approaches for tumor phylogeny reconstruction via single-cell sequencing typically aim to build the most likely perfect phylogeny tree from the noisy genotype matrix - which represents genotype calls of single cells. This problem is NP-hard, and as a result, existing approaches aim to solve relatively small instances of it through combinatorial optimization techniques or Bayesian inference. As expected, even when the goal is to infer basic topological features of the tumor phylogeny, rather than reconstructing the topology entirely, these approaches could be prohibitively slow. In this paper, we introduce fast deep learning solutions to the problems of inferring whether the most likely tree has a linear (chain) or branching topology and whether a perfect phylogeny is feasible from a given genotype matrix. We also present a reinforcement learning approach for reconstructing the most likely tumor phylogeny. This preliminary work demonstrates that data-driven approaches can reconstruct key features of tumor evolution.","2504":"Traumatic experiences generate stressful neurological effects in the exposed persons and animals. Previous studies have demonstrated that in many species, including Drosophila, the defeated animal has a higher probability of losing subsequent fights. However, the neural basis of this \"loser effect\" is largely unknown. We herein report that elevated serotonin (5-HT) signaling helps a loser to overcome suppressive neurological states. Coerced activation of 5-HT neurons increases aggression in males and promotes losers to both vigorously re-engage in fights and even defeat the previous winners and regain mating motivation. P1 neurons act upstream and 5-HT1B neurons in the ellipsoid body act downstream of 5-HT neurons to arouse losers. Our results demonstrate an ancient neural mechanism of regulating depressive behavioral states after distressing events.","2505":"The recent prevalence of high-throughput sequencing has been producing numerous prokaryotic community structure datasets. Although the trait-based approach is useful to interpret those datasets from ecological perspectives, available trait information is biased toward culturable prokaryotes, especially those of clinical and public health relevance, and thus may not represent the breadth of microbiota found across many of Earth's environments. To facilitate habitat-based analysis free of such bias, here we report a ready-to-use prokaryotic habitat database, ProkAtlas. ProkAtlas comprehensively links 16S rRNA gene sequences to prokaryotic habitats, using public shotgun metagenome datasets. We also developed a computational pipeline for habitat-based analysis of given prokaryotic community structures. After confirmation of the method effectiveness using 16S rRNA gene sequence datasets from individual genomes and the Earth Microbiome Project, we showed its validness and effectiveness in drawing ecological insights by applying it to six empirical prokaryotic community datasets from soil, aquatic, and human gut samples.","2506":"p32\/C1qbp regulates mitochondrial protein synthesis and is essential for oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Although dysfunction of p32\/C1qbp impairs fetal development and immune responses, its role in hematopoietic differentiation remains unclear. Here, we found that mitochondrial dysfunction affected terminal differentiation of newly identified erythroid\/B-lymphoid progenitors among CD45- Ter119- CD31- triple-negative cells (TNCs) in bone marrow. Hematopoietic cell-specific genetic deletion of p32\/C1qbp (p32cKO) in mice caused anemia and B-lymphopenia without reduction of hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells. In addition, p32cKO mice were susceptible to hematopoietic stress with delayed recovery from anemia. p32\/C1qbp-deficient CD51- TNCs exhibited impaired mitochondrial oxidation that consequently led to inactivation of mTORC1 signaling, which is essential for erythropoiesis. These findings uncover the importance of mitochondria, especially at the stage of TNCs during erythropoiesis, suggesting that dysregulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis is a cause of anemia and B-lymphopenia with an unknown pathology.","2507":null,"2508":null,"2509":null,"2510":"Bioweathering mediated by microorganisms plays a significant role in biogeochemical cycles on global scales over geological timescales. Single processes induced by specific taxa have been described but could rarely be demonstrated for complex communities that dominate whole landscapes. The recently discovered grit crust of the coastal Atacama Desert, which is a transitional community between a cryptogamic ground cover and a rock-bound lithic assemblage, offers the unique chance to elucidate various bioweathering processes that occur simultaneously. Here, we present a bioweathering scenario of this biocenosis including processes such as penetration of the lithomatrix, microbial responses to wet-dry cycles, alkalinolysis, enzyme activity, and mineral re-localization. Frequently occurring fog, for example, led to a volume increase of microorganisms and the lithomatrix. This, together with pH shifts and dust accumulation, consequently results in biophysical breakdown and the formation of a terrestrial protopedon, an initial stage of pedogenesis fueled by the grit crust.","2511":"The recruitment of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to gene promoters is critical for its function in repressing gene expression in murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). However, previous studies have demonstrated that although the expression of early lineage-specific genes is largely repressed, the genome-wide PRC2 occupancy is unexpectedly reduced in naive mESCs. In this study, we provide evidence that fibroblast growth factor\/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling determines the global PRC2 occupancy through regulating the expression of PRC2-recruiting factor JARID2 in naive mESCs. At the transcriptional level, the de-repression of bivalent genes is predominantly determined by the presence of cell signaling-associated transcription factors but not the status of PRC2 occupancy at gene promoters. Hence, this study not only reveals a key molecular mechanism by which cell signaling regulates the PRC2 occupancy in mESCs but also elucidates the functional roles of transcription factors and Polycomb-mediated epigenetic mechanisms in transcriptional regulation.","2512":"The genetic footprints of adaptations to naturally occurring tropical stress along with domestication are poorly reported in chickens. Here, by conducting population genomic analyses of 67 chickens inhabiting distinct climates, we found signals of gene flow from Tibetan chickens to Sri Lankan and Saudi Arabian breeds and identified 12 positively selected genes that are likely involved in genetic adaptations to both tropical desert and tropical monsoon island climates. Notably, in tropical desert climate, advantageous alleles of TLR7 and ZC3HAV1, which could inhibit replication of viruses in cells, suggest immune adaptation to the defense against zoonotic diseases in chickens. Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis showed that four genes (OC90, PLA2G12B, GPR17 and TNFRSF11A) involved in arachidonic acid metabolism have undergone convergent adaptation to tropical desert climate between birds and mammals. Our study offers insights into the genetic mechanisms of adaptations to tropical climates in birds and other animals and provides practical value for breeding design and medical research on avian viruses.","2513":"DUSP6 functions as an important negative feedback component of the MAPK\/ERK signaling pathway. Although DUSP6 expression is tightly regulated by ERK1\/2 signaling, the molecular mechanism of this regulation remains partially understood. In this work, we show that the transcriptional repressor CIC functions downstream of the ERK1\/2 signaling to negatively regulate DUSP6 expression. CIC directly represses DUSP6 transcription by binding to three cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in DUSP6 promoter. p90RSK, a downstream target of ERK1\/2, phosphorylates CIC at S173 and S301 sites, which creates a 14-3-3 recognition motif, resulting in 14-3-3-mediated nuclear export of CIC and derepression of DUSP6. Finally, we demonstrate that the oncogenic CIC-DUX4 fusion protein acts as a transcriptional activator of DUSP6 and its nuclear\/cytoplasmic distribution remains regulated by ERK1\/2 signaling. These results complete an ERK1\/2\/p90RSK\/CIC\/DUSP6 negative feedback circuit and elucidate the molecular mechanism of how RTK\/MAPK signaling harnesses the transcriptional repressor activity of CIC in mammalian cells.","2514":"Misfolded or unfolded proteins in the ER are said to be degraded only after translocation or isolation from the ER. Here, we describe a mechanism by which mutant proteins are degraded within the ER. Aggregates of mutant arginine vasopressin (AVP) precursor were confined to ER-associated compartments (ERACs) connected to the ER in AVP neurons of a mouse model of familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus. The ERACs were enclosed by membranes, an ER chaperone and marker protein of phagophores and autophagosomes were expressed around the aggregates, and lysosomes fused with the ERACs. Moreover, lysosome-related molecules were present within the ERACs, and aggregate degradation within the ERACs was dependent on autophagic-lysosomal activity. Thus, we demonstrate that protein aggregates can be degraded by autophagic-lysosomal machinery within specialized compartments of the ER.","2515":"GPCRs are the largest receptor family that are involved in virtually all biological processes. Pharmacologically, they are highly druggable targets, as they cover more than 40% of all drugs in the market. Our knowledge of biased signaling provided insight into pharmacology vastly improving drug design to avoid unwanted effects and achieve higher efficacy and selectivity. However, yet another feature of GPCR biology is left largely unexplored, location bias. Recent developments in this field show promising avenues for evolution of new class of pharmaceuticals with greater potential for higher level of precision medicine. Further consideration and understanding of this phenomenon with deep biochemical and molecular insights would pave the road to success. In this review, we critically analyze this perspective and discuss new avenues of investigation.","2516":"The FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, comprising SPT16 and SSRP1, conducts structural alterations during nucleosome unwrapping. Our previous cryoelectron microscopic (cryo-EM) analysis revealed the first intermediate structure of an unwrapped nucleosome with human FACT, in which 112-bp DNA and the phosphorylated intrinsically disordered (pAID) segment of SPT16 jointly wrapped around the histone core instead of 145-bp DNA. Using NMR, here we clarified that the histone H3 N-terminal tails, unobserved in the cryo-EM structure, adopt two different conformations reflecting their asymmetric locations at entry\/exit sites: one corresponds to the original nucleosome site buried in two DNA gyres (DNA side), whereas the other, comprising pAID and DNA, is more exposed to the solvent (pAID side). NMR real-time monitoring showed that H3 acetylation is faster on the pAID side than on the DNA side. Our findings highlight that accessible conformations of H3 tails are created by the replacement of nucleosomal DNA with pAID.","2517":"The Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) is a small inshore species of odontocete cetacean listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. Here, we report on the evolution of S. chinensis chromosomes from its cetruminant ancestor and elucidate the evolutionary history and population genetics of two neighboring S. chinensis populations. We found that breakpoints in ancestral chromosomes leading to S. chinensis could have affected the function of genes related to kidney filtration, body development, and immunity. Resequencing of individuals from two neighboring populations in the northwestern South China Sea, Leizhou Bay and Sanniang Bay, revealed genetic differentiation, low diversity, and small contemporary effective population sizes. Demographic analyses showed a marked decrease in the population size of the two investigated populations over the last ~4,000 years, possibly related to climatic oscillations. This study implies a high risk of extinction and strong conservation requirement for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin.","2518":"Transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its main negative regulator, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), are at the interface between redox and intermediary metabolism, allowing adaptation and survival under conditions of oxidative, inflammatory, and metabolic stress. Nrf2 is the principal determinant of redox homeostasis, and contributes to mitochondrial function and integrity and cellular bioenergetics. Using proteomics and lipidomics, we show that genetic downregulation of Keap1 in mice, and the consequent Nrf2 activation to pharmacologically relevant levels, leads to upregulation of carboxylesterase 1 (Ces1) and acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (Acox2), decreases triglyceride levels, and alters the lipidome. This is accompanied by downregulation of hepatic ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) and decreased levels of acetyl-CoA, a trigger for autophagy. These findings suggest that downregulation of Keap1 confers features of a fasted metabolic state, which is an important consideration in the drug development of Keap1-targeting pharmacologic Nrf2 activators.","2519":"Thermal metamaterials have amazing properties in heat transfer beyond naturally occurring materials owing to their well-designed artificial structures. The idea of thermal metamaterial has completely subverted the design of thermal functional devices and makes it possible to manipulate heat flow at will. In this perspective, we review the up-to-date progress of thermal metamaterials starting from 2008. We focus on both the key theoretical fundamentals and techniques for applications and give a perspective of scale-based classification on thermal metamaterials' theories and applications. We also discuss the junction between macroscale and microscale design methods and propose some prospects for the future trend of this field.","2520":null,"2521":"The efficiency of photovoltaic modules in the field is generally lower than the efficiency under standard testing conditions due to temperature and spectral effects. Using the latest spectral dataset available from the National Solar Radiation Database, we report spectral correction factors ranging from -2% to 1.3% of the produced energy for silicon modules depending on location and collector geometry. We find that spectral effects favor trackers if silicon modules are used, but favor a fixed tilt instead if perovskites or CdTe are used. In high-irradiance locations, the energy yield advantage of silicon-based trackers is underestimated by 0.4% if spectral sensitivity effects are neglected. As the photovoltaic market grows to a multi-terawatt size, these seemingly small effects are expected to have an economic impact equivalent to tens of billions of dollars in the next few decades, far outweighting the cost of the required research effort.","2522":null,"2523":null,"2524":"Multifactorial disease pathophysiology is complex and incompletely addressed by existing targeted pharmacotherapies. Amino acids (AAs) and related metabolites and precursors are a class of endogenous metabolic modulators (EMMs) that have diverse biological functions and, thus, have been explored for decades as potential multifactorial disease treatments. Here, we review the literature on this class of EMMs in disease treatment, with a focus on the emerging clinical studies on AAs and related metabolites and precursors as single- and combination-agents targeted to a single biology. These clinical research insights, in addition to increasing understanding of disease metabolic profiles and combinatorial therapeutic design principles, highlight an opportunity to develop EMM compositions with AAs and related metabolites and precursors to target multifactorial disease biology. EMM compositions are uniquely designed to enable a comprehensive approach, with potential to simultaneously and safely target pathways underlying multifactorial diseases and to regulate biological processes that promote overall health.","2525":"Inferring missing links based on the currently observed network is known as link prediction, which has tremendous real-world applications in biomedicine, e-commerce, social media, and criminal intelligence. Numerous methods have been proposed to solve the link prediction problem. Yet, many of these methods are designed for undirected networks only and based on domain-specific heuristics. Here we developed a new link prediction method based on deep generative models, which does not rely on any domain-specific heuristic and works for general undirected or directed complex networks. Our key idea is to represent the adjacency matrix of a network as an image and then learn hierarchical feature representations of the image by training a deep generative model. Those features correspond to structural patterns in the network at different scales, from small subgraphs to mesoscopic communities. When applied to various real-world networks from different domains, our method shows overall superior performance against existing methods.","2526":null,"2527":"The beginning of the 21st century has been marked by three distinct waves of zoonotic coronavirus outbreaks into the human population. The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and emerged as a global threat endangering the livelihoods of millions worldwide. Currently, and despite collaborative efforts, diverse therapeutic strategies from ongoing clinical trials are still debated. To address the need for such an immediate call of action, we leveraged the largest dataset of drug-induced transcriptomic perturbations, public SARS-CoV-2 transcriptomic datasets, and expression profiles from normal lung transcriptomes. Most importantly, our unbiased systems biology approach prioritized more than 50 repurposable drug candidates (e.g., corticosteroids, Janus kinase and Bruton kinase inhibitors). Further clinical investigation of these FDA-approved candidates as monotherapy or in combination with an antiviral regimen (e.g., remdesivir) could lead to promising outcomes in patients with COVID-19.","2528":null,"2529":null,"2530":"Keeping track of others' perceptual beliefs-what they perceive and know about the current situation-is imperative in many social contexts. In a series of experiments, we set out to investigate people's ability to keep track of what robots know or believe about objects and events in the environment. To this end, we subjected 155 experimental participants to an anticipatory-looking false-belief task where they had to reason about a robot's perceptual capability in order to predict its behavior. We conclude that (1) it is difficult for people to track the perceptual beliefs of a robot whose perceptual capability potentially differs significantly from human perception, (2) people can gradually \"tune in\" to the unique perceptual capabilities of a robot over time by observing it interact with the environment, and (3) providing people with verbal information about a robot's perceptual capability might not significantly help them predict its behavior.","2531":null,"2532":"Understanding the antibody response is critical to developing vaccine and antibody-based therapies and has inspired the recent development of new methods to isolate antibodies. Methods to define the antibody-antigen interactions that determine specificity or allow escape have not kept pace. We developed Phage-DMS, a method that combines two powerful approaches-immunoprecipitation of phage peptide libraries and deep mutational scanning (DMS)-to enable high-throughput fine mapping of antibody epitopes. As an example, we designed sequences encoding all possible amino acid variants of HIV Envelope to create phage libraries. Using Phage-DMS, we identified sites of escape predicted using other approaches for four well-characterized HIV monoclonal antibodies with known linear epitopes. In some cases, the results of Phage-DMS refined the epitope beyond what was determined in previous studies. This method has the potential to rapidly and comprehensively screen many antibodies in a single experiment to define sites essential for binding interactions.","2533":null,"2534":null,"2535":"Phenotypic heterogeneity in cancer is often caused by different patterns of genetic alterations. Understanding such phenotype-genotype relationships is fundamental for the advance of personalized medicine. We develop a computational method, named NETPHIX (NETwork-to-PHenotype association with eXclusivity) to identify subnetworks of genes whose genetic alterations are associated with drug response or other continuous cancer phenotypes. Leveraging interaction information among genes and properties of cancer mutations such as mutual exclusivity, we formulate the problem as an integer linear program and solve it optimally to obtain a subnetwork of associated genes. Applied to a large-scale drug screening dataset, NETPHIX uncovered gene modules significantly associated with drug responses. Utilizing interaction information, NETPHIX modules are functionally coherent and can thus provide important insights into drug action. In addition, we show that modules identified by NETPHIX together with their association patterns can be leveraged to suggest drug combinations.","2536":null,"2537":null,"2538":"The activity of neurons of the medial posterior parietal area V6A in macaque monkeys is modulated by many aspects of reach task. In the past, research was mostly focused on modulating the effect of single parameters upon the activity of V6A cells. Here, we used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to simultaneously test the contribution of several factors upon V6A cells during a fix-to-reach task. This approach resulted in the definition of a representative \"functional fingerprint\" for each neuron. We first studied how the features are distributed in the population. Our analysis highlighted the virtual absence of units strictly selective for only one factor and revealed that most cells are characterized by \"mixed selectivity.\" Then, exploiting our GLM framework, we investigated the dynamics of spatial parameters encoded within V6A. We found that the tuning is not static, but changed along the trial, indicating the sequential occurrence of visuospatial transformations helpful to guide arm movement.","2539":"Science, engineering, and medicine ultimately demand fast information processing with ultra-low power consumption. The recently developed spin-orbit torque (SOT)-induced magnetization switching paradigm has been fueling opportunities for spin-orbitronic devices, i.e., enabling SOT memory and logic devices at sub-nano second and sub-picojoule regimes. Importantly, spin-orbitronic devices are intrinsic of nonvolatility, anti-radiation, unlimited endurance, excellent stability, and CMOS compatibility, toward emerging applications, e.g., processing in-memory, neuromorphic computing, probabilistic computing, and 3D magnetic random access memory. Nevertheless, the cutting-edge SOT-based devices and application remain at a premature stage owing to the lack of scalable methodology on the field-free SOT switching. Moreover, spin-orbitronics poises as an interdisciplinary field to be driven by goals of both fundamental discoveries and application innovations, to open fascinating new paths for basic research and new line of technologies. In this perspective, the specific challenges and opportunities are summarized to exert momentum on both research and eventual applications of spin-orbitronic devices.","2540":null,"2541":null,"2542":null,"2543":"Animals' ability to sense environmental cues and to integrate this information to control fecundity is vital for continuing the species lineage. In this study, we observed that the sensory neurons Amphid neuron (ASHs and ADLs) differentially regulate egg-laying behavior in Caenorhabditis elegans under varied environmental conditions via distinct neuronal circuits. Under standard culture conditions, ASHs tonically release a small amount of glutamate and inhibit Hermaphrodite specific motor neuron (HSN) activities and egg laying via a highly sensitive Glutamate receptor (GLR)-5 receptor. In contrast, under Cu2+ stimulation, ASHs and ADLs may release a large amount of glutamate and inhibit Amphid interneuron (AIA) interneurons via low-sensitivity Glutamate-gated chloride channel (GLC)-3 receptor, thus removing the inhibitory roles of AIAs on HSN activity and egg laying. However, directly measuring the amount of glutamate released by sensory neurons under different conditions and assaying the binding kinetics of receptors with the neurotransmitter are still required to support this study directly.","2544":"The development of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) building block and deciphering its luminescence mechanism are of great significance. Here a feasible strategy for the construction of AIE unit based on E-Z isomerization (EZI) of exocyclic C=N double bond is proposed. Taking [1,2,4]thiadiazole[4,3-a]pyridine (TZP) derivative as an example, its aryl-substituted derivative (TZPP) shows obvious AIE character. The analysis of spectral data and theoretical calculations indicates that fast structural relaxation of TZPP in the emissive state plays a key role in a low fluorescence quantum yield in dilute solution, which should be caused by the small energy gap between locally excited (LE) state and twisted intramolecular charge transfer state. When in solid state, the bright emission with LE state characteristic reappears due to the large shift barrier of geometry transformation. As a potential building block for AIEgens with special heterocyclic structure, these findings would open up opportunities for developing various functional materials.","2545":null,"2546":"Cells often communicate by the secretion, transport, and perception of molecules. Information conveyed by molecules is encoded, transmitted, and decoded by cells within the context of the prevailing microenvironments. Conversely, in electronics, transmission reliability and message validation are predictable, robust, and less context dependent. In turn, many transformative advances have resulted by the formal consideration of information transfer. One way to explore this potential for biological systems is to create bio-device interfaces that facilitate bidirectional information transfer between biology and electronics. Redox reactions enable this linkage because reduction and oxidation mediate communication within biology and can be coupled with electronics. By manipulating redox reactions, one is able to combine the programmable features of electronics with the ability to interrogate and modulate biological function. In this review, we examine methods to electrochemically interrogate the various components of molecular communication using redox chemistry and to electronically control cell communication using redox electrogenetics.","2547":null,"2548":null,"2549":"In this work, pattern recognition and characterization of the neuromuscular dynamics of driver upper limb during naturalistic driving were studied. During the human-in-the-loop experiments, two steering tasks, namely, the passive and active steering tasks, were instructed to be completed by the subjects. Furthermore, subjects manipulated the steering wheel with two distinct postures and six different hand positions. The neuromuscular dynamics of subjects' upper limb were measured using electromyogram signals, and the behavioral data, including the steering torque and steering angle, were also collected. Based on the experimental data, patterns of muscle activities during naturalistic driving were investigated. The correlations, amplitudes, and responsiveness of the electromyogram signals, as well as the smoothness and regularity of the steering torque were discussed. The results reveal the mechanisms of neuromuscular dynamics of driver upper limb and provide a theoretical foundation for the design of the future human-machine interface for automated vehicles.","2550":"Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a subset of long noncoding RNA generated from genomic enhancers: they are thought to act as potent promoters of the expression of nearby genes through interaction with the transcriptional and epigenomic machineries. In the present work, we describe two eRNAs transcribed from the enhancer of Nkx2-5-a gene specifying a master cardiomyogenic lineage transcription factor (TF)-which we call Intergenic Regulatory Element Nkx2-5 Enhancers (IRENEs). The IRENEs are encoded, respectively, on the same strand (SS) and in the divergent direction (div) respect to the nearby gene. Of note, these two eRNAs have opposing roles in the regulation of Nkx2-5: IRENE-SS acts as a canonical promoter of transcription, whereas IRENE-div represses the activity of the enhancer through recruitment of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1. Thus, we have identified an autoregulatory loop controlling expression of the master cardiac TF NKX2-5, in which one eRNA represses transcription.","2551":null,"2552":null,"2553":"The role of lipid metabolism in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is poorly understood. We have used large-scale targeted proteomics to demonstrate that undifferentiated hPSCs express different fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis-related enzymes, including ATP citrate lyase and FA synthase (FASN), than those expressed in hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs). Detailed lipid profiling revealed that inhibition of FASN resulted in significant reduction of sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholine (PC); moreover, we found that PC was the key metabolite for cell survival in hPSCs. Inhibition of FASN induced cell death in undifferentiated hPSCs via mitochondria-mediated apoptosis; however, it did not affect cell survival in hPSC-CMs, neurons, or hepatocytes as there was no significant reduction of PC. Furthermore, we did not observe tumor formation following transplantation of FASN inhibitor-treated cells. Our findings demonstrate the importance of de novo FA synthesis in the survival of undifferentiated hPSCs and suggest applications for FASN inhibition in regenerative medicine.","2554":"Geological flows-from mudslides to volcanic eruptions-are often opaque and consist of multiple interacting phases. Scaled laboratory geological experiments using analog materials have often been limited to optical imaging of flow exteriors or ex situ measurements. Geological flows often include internal phase transitions and chemical reactions that are difficult to image externally. Thus, many physical mechanisms underlying geological flows remain unknown, hindering model development. We propose using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance geosciences via non-invasive, in situ measurements of 3D flows. MRI is currently used to characterize the interior dynamics of multiphase flows, distinguishing between different chemical species as well as gas, liquid, and solid phases, while quantitatively measuring concentration, velocity, and diffusion fields. This perspective describes the potential of MRI techniques to image dynamics within scaled geological flow experiments and the potential of technique development for geological samples to be transferred to other disciplines utilizing MRI.","2555":null,"2556":"Similarities between microbial and cancer cells were noticed in recent years and serve as a basis for an atavism theory of cancer. Cancer cells would rely on the reactivation of an ancestral \"genetic program\" that would have been repressed in metazoan cells. Here we argue that cancer cells resemble unicellular organisms mainly in their similar way to exploit cellular stochasticity to produce cell specialization and maximize proliferation. Indeed, the relationship between low stochasticity, specialization, and quiescence found in normal differentiated metazoan cells is lost in cancer. On the contrary, low stochasticity and specialization are associated with high proliferation among cancer cells, as it is observed for the \"specialist\" cells in microbial populations that fully exploit nutritional resources to maximize proliferation. Thus, we propose a model where the appearance of cancer phenotypes can be solely due to an adaptation and a speciation process based on initial increase in cellular stochasticity.","2557":"Signaling through stimulator of interferon genes (STING) leads to the production of type I interferons (IFN-Is) and inflammatory cytokines. A gain-of-function mutation in STING was identified in an autoinflammatory disease (STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy; SAVI). The expression of cyclic GMP-AMP, DNA-activated cGAS-STING pathway, increased in a proportion of patients with SLE. The STING signaling pathway may be a candidate for targeted therapy in SLE. Here, we demonstrated that disruption of STING signaling ameliorated lupus development in Fcgr2b-deficient mice. Activation of STING promoted maturation of conventional dendritic cells and differentiation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells via LYN interaction and phosphorylation. The inhibition of LYN decreased the differentiation of STING-activated dendritic cells. Adoptive transfer of STING-activated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells into the FCGR2B and STING double-deficiency mice restored lupus phenotypes. These findings provide evidence that the inhibition of STING signaling may be a candidate targeted treatment for a subset of patients with SLE.","2558":null,"2559":"The early loss of vision results in a reorganized neocortex, affecting areas of the brain that process both the spared and lost senses, and leads to heightened abilities on discrimination tasks involving the spared senses. Here, we used performance measures and machine learning algorithms that quantify behavioral strategy to determine if and how early vision loss alters adaptive sensorimotor behavior. We tested opossums on a motor task involving somatosensation and found that early blind animals had increased limb placement accuracy compared with sighted controls, while showing similarities in crossing strategy. However, increased reliance on tactile inputs in early blind animals resulted in greater deficits in limb placement and behavioral flexibility when the whiskers were trimmed. These data show that compensatory cross-modal plasticity extends beyond sensory discrimination tasks to motor tasks involving the spared senses and highlights the importance of whiskers in guiding forelimb control.","2560":null,"2561":null,"2562":null,"2563":"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) both self-renew and give rise to progenitors that initiate spermatogenic differentiation in the mammalian testis. Questions remain regarding the extent to which the SSC and progenitor states are functionally distinct. Here we provide the first multiparametric integrative analysis of mammalian germ cell epigenomes comparable with that done for &gt;100 somatic cell types by the ENCODE Project. Differentially expressed genes distinguishing SSC- and progenitor-enriched spermatogonia showed distinct histone modification patterns, particularly for H3K27ac and H3K27me3. Motif analysis predicted transcription factors that may regulate spermatogonial subtype-specific fate, and immunohistochemistry and gene-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses confirmed subtype-specific differences in target gene binding of a subset of these factors. Taken together, these results show that SSCs and progenitors display distinct epigenetic profiling consistent with these spermatogonial subtypes being differentially programmed to either self-renew and maintain regenerative capacity as SSCs or lose regenerative capacity and initiate lineage commitment as progenitors.","2564":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Many human miRNAs are intragenic, located within introns of protein-coding sequence (host). Intriguingly, a percentage of intragenic miRNAs downregulate the host transcript forming an incoherent feedforward motif topology. Here, we study intragenic miRNA-mediated host gene regulation using a synthetic gene circuit stably integrated within a safe-harbor locus of human cells. When the intragenic miRNA is directed to inhibit the host transcript, we observe a reduction in reporter expression accompanied by output filtering and noise reduction. Specifically, the system operates as a filter with respect to promoter strength, with the threshold being robust to promoter strength and measurement time. Additionally, the intragenic miRNA regulation reduces expression noise compared to splicing-alone architecture. Our results provide a new insight into miRNA-mediated gene expression, with direct implications to gene therapy and synthetic biology applications.","2565":"Ionic reactions are the most common reactions used in chemical synthesis. In relatively low dielectric constant solvents (e.g., dichloromethane, toluene), ions usually exist as ion pairs. Despite the importance of counterions, a quantitative description of how the paired 'counterion' affects the reaction kinetic is still elusive. We introduce a general and quantitative model, namely transition-state expansion (TSE), that describes how the size of a counterion affects the transition-state structure and the kinetics of an ionic reaction. This model could rationalize the counterion effects in nucleophilic substitutions and gold-catalyzed enyne cycloisomerizations.","2566":"Signaling pathways that promote oligodendrocyte development improve oligodendrocyte regeneration and myelin recovery from demyelinating pathologies. Sox factors critically control myelin gene expression and oligodendroglial fate, but little is known about signaling events underlying Sox-mediated oligodendroglial regeneration. In this study of the SoxF member Sox17, we demonstrate that Sox17-induced oligodendrocyte regeneration in adult myelin lesions occurs by suppressing lesion-induced Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling which is inhibitory to oligodendrocyte regeneration and by increasing Sonic Hedgehog\/Smoothened\/Gli2 activity. Hedgehog signaling through Smoothened critically supports adult oligodendroglial viability and is an upstream regulator of beta-catenin. Gli2 ablation in adult oligodendrocyte progenitor cells indicates that Gli2 regulates beta-catenin differentially in wild-type and Sox17-overexpressing white matter. Myelin lesions in Sox17-deficient mice show beta-catenin hyperactivation, regenerative failure, and loss of oligodendrogenesis, despite exogenous Hedgehog stimulation. These studies indicate the benefit of Sox17 signaling targets to enhance oligodendrocyte regeneration after demyelination injury by modulating both Hedgehog and Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling.","2567":"Many behaviors that are critical for survival and reproduction are expressed over extended time periods. The ability to inexpensively record and store large volumes of video data creates new opportunities to understand the biological basis of these behaviors and simultaneously creates a need for tools that can automatically quantify behaviors from large video datasets. Here, we demonstrate that 3D Residual Networks can be used to classify an array of complex behaviors in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes. We first apply pixel-based hidden Markov modeling combined with density-based spatiotemporal clustering to identify sand disturbance events. After this, a 3D ResNet, trained on 11,000 manually annotated video clips, accurately (&gt;76%) classifies the sand disturbance events into 10 fish behavior categories, distinguishing between spitting, scooping, fin swipes, and spawning. Furthermore, animal intent can be determined from these clips, as spits and scoops performed during bower construction are classified independently from those during feeding.","2568":"Neuromorphic systems take inspiration from the principles of biological information processing to form hardware platforms that enable the large-scale implementation of neural networks. The recent years have seen both advances in the theoretical aspects of spiking neural networks for their use in classification and control tasks and a progress in electrophysiological methods that is pushing the frontiers of intelligent neural interfacing and signal processing technologies. At the forefront of these new technologies, artificial and biological neural networks are tightly coupled, offering a novel \"biohybrid\" experimental framework for engineers and neurophysiologists. Indeed, biohybrid systems can constitute a new class of neuroprostheses opening important perspectives in the treatment of neurological disorders. Moreover, the use of biologically plausible learning rules allows forming an overall fault-tolerant system of co-developing subsystems. To identify opportunities and challenges in neuromorphic biohybrid systems, we discuss the field from the perspectives of neurobiology, computational neuroscience, and neuromorphic engineering.","2569":null,"2570":null,"2571":"Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies targeting immune checkpoint molecules, including programmed death-1 (PD-1), PD ligand-1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4, has become prominent in the treatment of many types of cancer. However, a significant number of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs). irAEs can affect any organ system, and although most are clinically manageable, irAEs can result in mortality or long-term morbidity. Factors that can predict irAEs remain elusive. Understanding the etiology of ICI-induced irAEs and ways to limit these adverse events are needed. In this review, we provide basic science and clinical insights on the mechanisms responsible for ICI efficacy and ICI-induced irAEs. We further provide insights into approaches that may uncouple irAEs from the ability of ICIs to kill tumor cells.","2572":null,"2573":null,"2574":"Our rudimentary knowledge about rat intraspecific vocal system of information exchange is limited by experimental models of communication. Rats emit 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations in appetitive states and 22-kHz ones in aversive states. Both affective states influence heart rate. We propose a behavioral model employing exposure to pre-recorded playbacks in home-cage-like conditions. Fifty-kHz playbacks elicited the most vocalizations (&gt;60 calls per minute, mostly of 50-kHz type), increased heart rate, and locomotor activity. In contrast, 22-kHz playback led to abrupt decrease in heart rate and locomotor activity. Observed effects were more pronounced in singly housed rats compared with the paired housed group; they were stronger when evoked by natural playback than by corresponding artificial tones. Finally, we also observed correlations between the number of vocalizations, heart rate levels, and locomotor activity. The correlations were especially strong in response to 50-kHz playback.","2575":null,"2576":null,"2577":null,"2578":"A dengue suppression strategy based on release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis is being trialed in many countries. Wolbachia inhibits replication and transmission of dengue viruses. Questions remain regarding the long-term stability of virus-suppressive effects. We sequenced the Wolbachia genome and analyzed Ae. aegypti mitochondrial DNA markers isolated from mosquitoes sampled 2-8 years after releases in the greater Cairns region, Australia. Few changes were detected when Wolbachia genomes of field mosquitoes were compared with Wolbachia genomes of mosquitoes obtained soon after initial releases. Mitochondrial variants associated with the initial Wolbachia release stock are now the only variants found in release sites, highlighting maternal leakage as a possible explanation for rare Wolbachia-negative mosquitoes and not migration from non-release areas. There is no evidence of changes in the Wolbachia genome that indicate selection against its viral-suppressive effects or other phenotypes attributable to infection with the bacterium.","2579":null,"2580":"The immune checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) plays a critical role in immune regulation. Recent studies have demonstrated functional PD-1 expression in peripheral sensory neurons, which contributes to neuronal excitability, pain, and opioid analgesia. Here we report neuronal expression and function of PD-1 in the central nervous system (CNS), including the spinal cord, thalamus, and cerebral cortex. Notably, GABA-induced currents in spinal dorsal horn neurons, thalamic neurons, and cortical neurons are suppressed by the PD-1-neutralizing immunotherapeutic Nivolumab in spinal cord slices, brain slices, and dissociated cortical neurons. Reductions in GABA-mediated currents in CNS neurons were also observed in Pd1 -\/- mice without changes in GABA receptor expression. Mechanistically, Nivolumab binds spinal cord neurons and elicits ERK phosphorylation to suppress GABA currents. Finally, both GABA-mediated analgesia and anesthesia are impaired by Pd1 deficiency. Our findings reveal PD-1 as a CNS-neuronal inhibitor that regulates GABAergic signaling and GABA-mediated behaviors.","2581":"Recently, lipid metabolism reprogramming has been further evidenced in malignancies via the observation of large amounts of lipid droplets (LDs) in human tumors, including in glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal primary brain tumor. However, the role played by LDs in tumor cells remains unknown. Here, we show that triglycerides (TG), the major components of LDs, serve as a critical energy reservoir to support GBM cell survival. TG\/LDs rapidly diminished in GBM cells upon glucose reduction, whereas inhibiting fatty acid oxidation or autophagy resulted in the accumulation of TG\/LDs and strongly potentiated GBM cell death. Immunofluorescence imaging and time-lapse videos showed that LDs are hydrolyzed by autophagy to release free fatty acids that mobilize into mitochondria for energy production. Our study demonstrates that autophagy-mediated hydrolysis of TG\/LDs maintains energy homeostasis and GBM survival upon glucose reduction, suggesting that limiting TG\/LDs utilization might be necessary upon treating GBM.","2582":null,"2583":null,"2584":"Computationally understanding the molecular mechanisms that give rise to cell signaling responses upon different environmental, chemical, and genetic perturbations is a long-standing challenge that requires models that fit and predict quantitative responses for new biological conditions. Overcoming this challenge depends not only on good models and detailed experimental data but also on the rigorous integration of both. We propose a quantitative framework to perturb and model generic signaling networks using multiple and diverse changing environments (hereafter \"kinetic stimulations\") resulting in distinct pathway activation dynamics. We demonstrate that utilizing multiple diverse kinetic stimulations better constrains model parameters and enables predictions of signaling dynamics that would be impossible using traditional dose-response or individual kinetic stimulations. To demonstrate our approach, we use experimentally identified models to predict signaling dynamics in normal, mutated, and drug-treated conditions upon multitudes of kinetic stimulations and quantify which proteins and reaction rates are most sensitive to which extracellular stimulations.","2585":"Studies revealing molecular mechanisms underlying neural specification have majorly focused on the role played by different transcription factors, but less on non-nuclear components. Earlier, we reported mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) to be essential for self-renewal and pluripotency of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). In the present study, we found SOD2 to be specifically required for neural lineage, but not the meso- or endoderm specification. Temporally, SOD2 regulated early neural genes, but not the matured genes, by modulating mitochondrial dynamics-specifically by enhancing the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin 2 (MFN2). Bio-complementation strategy further confirmed SOD2 to enhance mitochondrial fusion process independent of its antioxidant activity. Over-expression of SOD2 along with OCT4, but neither alone, transdifferentiated mouse fibroblasts to neural progenitor-like colonies, conclusively proving the neurogenic potential of SOD2. In conclusion, our findings accredit a novel role for SOD2 in early neural lineage specification.","2586":"Epidemiological and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have shown high correlation between childhood obesity and advance in puberty. Early age at menarche is associated with a series of morbidities, including breast cancer, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. The adipocyte hormone leptin signals the amount of fat stores to the neuroendocrine reproductive axis via direct actions in the brain. Using mouse genetics, we and others have identified the hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus (PMv) and the agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) as primary targets of leptin action in pubertal maturation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying leptin's effects remain unknown. Here we assessed changes in the PMv and Arc transcriptional program during leptin-stimulated and typical pubertal development using overlapping analysis of bulk RNA sequecing, TRAP sequencing, and the published database. Our findings demonstrate that dynamic somatodendritic remodeling and extracellular space organization underlie leptin-induced and typical pubertal maturation in female mice.","2587":"We applied digital spatial profiling for 87 immune and stromal genes to lymph node germinal center (GC) dark- and light-zone (DZ\/LZ) regions of interest to obtain a differential signature of these two distinct microenvironments. The spatially resolved 53-genes signature, comprising key genes of the DZ mutational machinery and LZ immune and mesenchymal milieu, was applied to the transcriptomes of 543 GC-related diffuse large B cell lymphomas and double-hit (DH) lymphomas. According to the DZ\/LZ signature, the GC-related lymphomas were sub-classified into two clusters. The subgroups differed in the distribution of DH cases and survival, with most DH displaying a distinct DZ-like profile. The clustering analysis was also performed using a 25-genes signature composed of genes positively enriched in the non-B, stromal sub-compartments, for the first time achieving DZ\/LZ discrimination based on stromal\/immune features. The report offers new insight into the GC microenvironment, hinting at a DZ microenvironment of origin in DH lymphomas.","2588":null,"2589":null,"2590":"Skeletal muscle adaptation is mediated by cooperative regulation of metabolism, signal transduction, and gene expression. However, the global regulatory mechanism remains unclear. To address this issue, we performed electrical pulse stimulation (EPS) in differentiated C2C12 myotubes at low and high frequency, carried out metabolome and transcriptome analyses, and investigated phosphorylation status of signaling molecules. EPS triggered extensive and specific changes in metabolites, signaling phosphorylation, and gene expression during and after EPS in a frequency-dependent manner. We constructed trans-omic network by integrating these data and found selective activation of the pentose phosphate pathway including metabolites, upstream signaling molecules, and gene expression of metabolic enzymes after high-frequency EPS. We experimentally validated that activation of these molecules after high-frequency EPS was dependent on reactive oxygen species (ROS). Thus, the trans-omic analysis revealed ROS-dependent activation in signal transduction, metabolome, and transcriptome after high-frequency EPS in C2C12 myotubes, shedding light on possible mechanisms of muscle adaptation.","2591":null,"2592":"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disease associated with progressive loss of mental skills and cognitive and physical functions whose etiology is not completely understood. Here, our goal was to simultaneously uncover novel and known molecular targets in the structured layers of the hippocampus and olfactory bulbs that may contribute to early hippocampal synaptic deficits and olfactory dysfunction in AD mice. Spatially resolved transcriptomics was used to identify high-confidence genes that were differentially regulated in AD mice relative to controls. A diverse set of genes that modulate stress responses and transcription were predominant in both hippocampi and olfactory bulbs. Notably, we identify Bok, implicated in mitochondrial physiology and cell death, as a spatially downregulated gene in the hippocampus of mouse and human AD brains. In summary, we provide a rich resource of spatially differentially expressed genes, which may contribute to understanding AD pathology.","2593":"An oxidative DNA-cleaving DNAzyme (PL) employs a double-cofactor model \"X\/Cu2+\" for catalysis. Herein, we verified that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), flavin mononucleotide, cysteine, dithiothreitol, catechol, resorcinol, hydroquinone, phloroglucinol, o-phenylenediamine, 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine, and hydroxylamine acted as cofactor X. According to their structural similarities or fluorescence property, we further confirmed that reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), 2-mercaptoethanol, dopamine, chlorogenic acid, resveratrol, and 5-carboxyfluorescein also functioned as cofactor X. Superoxide anions might be the commonality behind these cofactors. We subsequently determined the conservative change of individual nucleotides in the catalytic core under four different cofactor X. The nucleotides A4 and C5 are highly conserved, whereas the conservative levels of other nucleotides are dependent on the types of cofactor X. Moreover, we observed that the minor change in the PL's secondary structure affects electrophoretic mobility. Finally, we characterized a highly efficient variant T3G and converted its double-cofactor NADH\/Cu2+ to sole-cofactor NADH.","2594":"Rapid growth of intermittent renewable power generation makes the identification of investment opportunities in energy storage and the establishment of their profitability indispensable. Here we first present a conceptual framework to characterize business models of energy storage and systematically differentiate investment opportunities. We then use the framework to examine which storage technologies can perform the identified business models and review the recent literature regarding the profitability of individual combinations of business models and technologies. Our analysis shows that a set of commercially available technologies can serve all identified business models. We also find that certain combinations appear to have approached a tipping point toward profitability. Yet, this conclusion only holds for combinations examined most recently or stacking several business models. Many technologically feasible combinations have been neglected, indicating a need for further research to provide a detailed and conclusive understanding about the profitability of energy storage.","2595":null,"2596":null,"2597":null,"2598":"Stress Granule formation has been linked to the resistance of some cancer cells to chemotherapeutic intervention.

Circovirus can be used to explore the cell adhesion mechanism of nonenveloped viruses. We developed a single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assay to directly visualize the capsid's conformational feature. The capsid underwent reversible dynamic transformation between three conformations. The cell surface receptor heparan sulfate (HS) altered the dynamic equilibrium of the capsid to the high-FRET state, revealing the HS-binding region. Neutralizing antibodies restricted capsid transition to a low-FRET state, masking the HS-binding domain. The lack of positively charged amino acids in the HS-binding site reduced cell surface affinity and attenuated virus infectivity via conformational changes. These intrinsic characteristics of the capsid suggested that conformational dynamics is critical for the structural changes occurring upon cell surface receptor binding, supporting a dynamics-based mechanism of receptor binding.","2602":"Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are impressive imaging probes with great potential for enriching the library of metal-free fluorescent materials, yet current strategies have struggled to achieve products that emit full-color light in a single reaction system. Establishing an efficient and robust synthesis approach that unlocks the color barrier to the luminescence centers of specific CPDs remains a challenge. Herein, the surface-state engineering of pyridine and amide in the indole system to create a palette of resolvable full-color light-emissive CPDs is reported. Detailed structural analysis revealed that cationic polymerization and oxidation reactions potentially contribute to the formation of the main frameworks and emission centers of the final CPDs, with emissive oxygen- and nitrogen-based centers fixed by cross-linked polymer structures. This study provides valuable insight into the energy absorbance and photoluminescence mechanism of CPDs and introduces additional reactants (benzo heterocycle) into CPD research.","2603":"The diversity of the dolphin family was established during a short window of time. We investigated delphinid skull shape evolution, mapping shapes on an up-to-date nuclear phylogeny. In this model, the common ancestor was similar to Lagenorhynchus albirostris. Initial diversification occurred in three directions: toward specialized raptorial feeders of small prey with longer, narrower beaks, e.g., Delphinus; toward wider skulls with downward-oriented rostra and reduced temporal fossae, exemplified by suction feeders, e.g., Globicephala; and toward shorter and wider skulls\/rostra and enlarged temporal fossae, e.g., Orcinus. Skull shape diversity was established early, the greatest later developments being adaptation of Steno to raptorial feeding on large prey and the convergence of Pseudorca toward Orcinus, related to handling large prey. Delphinid skull shapes are related to feeding mode and prey size, whereas adaptation to habitat is not marked. Over a short period, delphinid skulls have evolved a diversity eclipsing other extant odontocete clades.","2604":null,"2605":"The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on electrocatalysts represents a major obstacle in the development of fuel cell technology. A tremendous amount of work has reported the increasing ORR activity for catalysts. Nevertheless, when applied to practical Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA, an assembled stack of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell) configuration, the high-performance catalysts on the rotating disk electrode (RDE) may not display the same high activity as in the lab-scale tests. This led us to reexamine the ORR evaluation based on the RDE technique. With the development of high active electrocatalysts, it may become significant to determine the reasonable kinetic current at a conventional fixed potential approaching the limited current by using the Koutecky-Levich (K-L) technique on RDE for the evaluation of ORR activity. Here we describe such a challenging situation and systematically discuss the proper kinetic region when comparing the ORR activity with the unsuitable potential or Pt loading based on the K-L technique. Furthermore, the rational benchmarking guidelines are given for the evaluation of the ORR electrocatalysts.","2606":null,"2607":null,"2608":null,"2609":null,"2610":"The pathophysiology, immune reaction, and differential vulnerability of different population groups and viral host immune system evasion strategies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection are not yet well understood.

We argue that maintenance of mitochondrial integrity is essential for adequate innate immune system responses and to blunt mitochondrial modulation by SARS-CoV-2. Mitochondrial health thus may determine differential vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 infection rendering markers of mitochondrial functions promising potential biomarkers for SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and severity of outcome. Current knowledge gaps on our understanding of mitochondrial involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection, lifestyle, and pharmacological strategies to improve mitochondrial integrity and potential reciprocal interactions with chronic and age-related diseases, e.g., Parkinson disease, are pointed out.","2611":"Mononuclear cells are the first line of defense against microbial infection. Yet, several viruses have evolved different mechanisms to overcome host defenses to ensure their spread. Here, we show unique mechanisms of how equid herpesvirus-1 manipulates peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to travel further in the body. (1) \"PBMC-hitching\": at the initial contact, herpesviruses lurk in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of PBMC without entering the cells. The virus exploits the components of the ECM to bind, transport, and then egress to infect other cells. (2) \"Intracellular delivery\": transendothelial migration is a physiological mechanism where mononuclear cells can transmigrate through the endothelial cells. The virus was intangible and probably did not interfere with such a mechanism where the infected PBMC can probably deliver the virus inside the endothelium. (3) \"Classical-fusion\": this process is well mastered by herpesviruses due to a set of envelope glycoproteins that facilitate cell-cell fusion and virus spread.","2612":null,"2613":"Seasonality of acute viral respiratory diseases is a well-known and yet not fully understood phenomenon. Several models have been proposed to explain the regularity of yearly recurring outbreaks and the phase differences observed at different latitudes on the Earth. Such models consider known internal causes, primarily the periodic emergence of new virus variants that evade the host immune response. Yet, this alone is generally unable to explain the regularity of recurrences and the observed phase differences. Here we show that seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, as well as its distribution with latitude on the Earth, can be fully explained by the virucidal properties of UV-B and UV-A solar photons through a daily, minute-scale, resonant forcing mechanism. Such an induced periodicity can last, virtually unperturbed, from tens to hundreds of cycles, and even in the presence of internal dynamics (host's loss of immunity) much slower than seasonal will, on a long period, generate seasonal oscillations.","2614":null,"2615":"Control of temperature variation is of primordial importance in particular areas of biomedicine. In this context, medical treatments such as hyperthermia and cryotherapy, and also the development and use of hydrogel-based biomaterials, are of particular concern. To enable accurate temperature measurement without perturbing or even destroying the biological tissue or material to be monitored, contactless thermometry methods are preferred. Among these, the most suitable are based on magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI, MRS). Here, we address the latest developments in this field as well as their current and anticipated practical applications. We highlight recent progress aimed at rendering MR thermometry faster and more reproducible, versatile, and sophisticated and provide our perspective on how these new techniques broaden the range of applications in medical treatments and biomaterial development by enabling insight into finer details of thermal behavior. Thus, these methods facilitate optimization of clinical and industrial heating and cooling protocols.","2616":"Brassinosteroids (BRs) regulate a variety of physiological processes in plants via extensive crosstalk with diverse biological signaling networks. Although BRs are known to reciprocally regulate circadian oscillation, the molecular mechanism underlying BR-mediated regulation of circadian clock remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the BR-activated transcription factor bri1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1) integrates BR signaling into the circadian network in Arabidopsis. BES1 repressed expression of CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) at night by binding to their promoters, together with TOPLESS (TPL). The repression of CCA1 and LHY by BR treatment, which occurred during the night, was compromised in bes1-ko and tpl-8 mutants. Consistently, long-term treatment with BR shortened the circadian period, and BR-induced rhythmic shortening was impaired in bes1-ko and tpl-8 single mutants and in the cca1-1lhy-21 double mutant. Overall, BR signaling is conveyed to the circadian oscillator via the BES1\/TPL-CCA1\/LHY module, contributing to gating diurnal BR responses in plants.","2617":"The exponential growth in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates increasing supplies of low-cost and high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Naturally, the ramp-up in LIB production raises concerns over raw material availability, where constraints can generate severe price spikes and bring the momentum and optimism of the EV market to a halt. Particularly, the reliance of cobalt in the cathode is concerning owing to its high cost, scarcity, and centralized and volatile supply chain structure. However, compositions suitable for EV applications that demonstrate high energy density and lifetime are all reliant on cobalt to some degree. In this work, we assess the necessity and feasibility of developing and commercializing cobalt-free cathode materials for LIBs. Promising cobalt-free compositions and critical areas of research are highlighted, which provide new insight into the role and contribution of cobalt.","2618":null,"2619":null,"2620":"Mitochondrial function relies on multiple quality control mechanisms, including the release of mitochondrial vesicles. To investigate the ultrastructure and prevalence of mitochondrial membranous protrusions (and, by extension, vesicles) in neurons, we surveyed mitochondria in rat and planarian brains using transmission electron microscopy (EM). We observed that mitochondrial protrusions mostly extend from the outer membrane. Leveraging available 3D EM datasets of the brain, we further analyzed mitochondrial protrusions in neurons of mouse and Drosophila brains, identifying high-resolution spatial views of these protrusions. To assess whether the abundance of mitochondrial protrusions and mitochondria-derived vesicles respond to cellular stress, we examined neurons expressing fluorescently tagged mitochondrial markers using confocal microscopy with Airyscan and found increased numbers of mitochondrial protrusions and vesicles with mild stress. Future studies using improved spatial resolution with added temporal information may further define the functional implications of mitochondrial protrusions and vesicles in neurons.","2621":null,"2622":null,"2623":"Asperuloside (ASP) is an iridoid glycoside that is extracted from Eucommia leaves. Eucommia is used in traditional Chinese medicine and has a long history of benefits on health and longevity. Here, we investigated the impact of ASP on obesity-related metabolic disorders and show that ASP reduces body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance effectively in mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD). Intestinal dysbiosis is closely linked with metabolic disorders. Our data indicate that ASP achieves these benefits on metabolic homeostasis by reversing HFD-induced gut dysbiosis and by changing gut-derived secondary metabolites and metabolic signaling. Our results indicate that ASP may be used to regulate gut microbiota for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.","2624":null,"2625":"Increased consumption of fats and added sugars has been associated with an increase in metabolic syndromes. Here we show that mice chronically fed an energy-rich diet (ERD) with high fat and moderate sucrose have enhanced the absorption of a gastrointestinal fructose load, and this required expression of the arrestin domain protein Txnip in the intestinal epithelial cells. ERD feeding induced gene and protein expression of Glut5, and this required the expression of Txnip. Furthermore, Txnip interacted with Rab11a, a small GTPase that facilitates the apical localization of Glut5. We also demonstrate that ERD promoted Txnip\/Glut5 complexes in the apical intestinal epithelial cell. Our findings demonstrate that ERD facilitates fructose absorption through a Txnip-dependent mechanism in the intestinal epithelial cell, suggesting that increased fructose absorption could potentially provide a mechanism for worsening of metabolic syndromes in the setting of a chronic ERD.","2626":"Aging-associated changes in the immune system often lead to immune dysfunction; however, the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon have yet to be fully elucidated. This study found that the microRNA-192 (miR-192) is an aging-associated immune regulatory microRNA whose concentration was significantly increased in aged extracellular vesicles (EVs) due to the hyperinflammatory state of aged mice. Interestingly, EV miR-192 exhibited anti-inflammatory effects on macrophages. In our aged mouse model, aging was associated with prolonged inflammation in the lung upon stimulation with inactivated influenza whole virus particles (WVP), whereas EV miR-192 alleviated the prolonged inflammation associated with aging. The hyperinflammatory state of aged mice resulted in reduced production of specific antibodies and efficacy of vaccination with WVP; however, EV miR-192 attenuated this hyperinflammatory state and improved vaccination efficacy in aged mice. Our data indicate that aged EVs constitute a negative feedback loop that alleviates aging-associated immune dysfunction.","2627":"Structural mutants of p53 induce global p53 protein destabilization and misfolding, followed by p53 protein aggregation. First evidence indicates that p53 can be part of protein condensates and that p53 aggregation potentially transitions through a condensate-like state. We show condensate-like states of fluorescently labeled structural mutant p53 in the nucleus of living cancer cells. We furthermore identified small molecule compounds that interact with the p53 protein and lead to dissolution of p53 structural mutant condensates. The same compounds lead to condensation of a fluorescently tagged p53 DNA-binding mutant, indicating that the identified compounds differentially alter p53 condensation behavior depending on the type of p53 mutation. In contrast to p53 aggregation inhibitors, these compounds are active on p53 condensates and do not lead to mutant p53 reactivation. Taken together our study provides evidence for structural mutant p53 condensation in living cells and tools to modulate this process.","2628":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, is characterized by progressive muscle weakness. Even though DMD manifests first in skeletal muscle, heart failure is a major cause of death in late-stage DMD. To get insights into DMD-associated cardiomyopathy, we performed a proteome analysis of myocardium from a genetically engineered porcine DMD model resembling clinical and pathological hallmarks of human DMD. To capture DMD progression, samples from 2-day- and 3-month-old animals were analyzed. Dystrophin was absent in all DMD samples, and components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex were decreased, suggesting destabilization of the cardiomyocyte plasma membrane and impaired cellular signaling. Furthermore, abundance alterations of proteins known to be associated with human cardiomyopathy were observed. Compared with data from skeletal muscle, we found clear evidence that DMD progression in myocardium is not only slower than in skeletal muscle but also involves different biological and biochemical pathways.","2629":null,"2630":null,"2631":"The recent sale of an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated portrait for $432,000 at Christie's art auction has raised questions about how credit and responsibility should be allocated to individuals involved and how the anthropomorphic perception of the AI system contributed to the artwork's success. Here, we identify natural heterogeneity in the extent to which different people perceive AI as anthropomorphic. We find that differences in the perception of AI anthropomorphicity are associated with different allocations of responsibility to the AI system and credit to different stakeholders involved in art production. We then show that perceptions of AI anthropomorphicity can be manipulated by changing the language used to talk about AI-as a tool versus agent-with consequences for artists and AI practitioners. Our findings shed light on what is at stake when we anthropomorphize AI systems and offer an empirical lens to reason about how to allocate credit and responsibility to human stakeholders.","2632":"Chronic HCV can result in advanced liver disease, including cirrhosis. Patients with advanced fibrosis experience poor clinical outcomes and increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These outcomes are, in part, a consequence of immune dysfunction. Increased inhibitory receptor and Galectin-9 (GAL-9) expression is a possible mechanism promoting lymphocyte dysfunction. In this study, we measured the expression of inhibitory receptors and GAL-9 on T\/NK cells of patients with chronic HCV with no to moderate fibrosis (F0-F2) and advanced fibrosis (F3-F4). To analyze their co-expression, we employed t-SNE analysis. Notably, we found that F3-F4 patients had higher frequencies of &gt;3 inhibitory receptor co-expression on NK cells. Moreover, F3-F4 patients manifest a higher frequency of NK cells co-expressing TIGIT and TIM-3, and CD4\/NK cells co-expressing LAG-3 and GAL-9. In conclusion, we identified phenotypes of immune dysregulation that could explain the increased susceptibility to infection and HCC in patients with chronic HCV with advanced fibrosis.","2633":null,"2634":null,"2635":"The human immune system is comprised of a diverse and interactive network of specialized cells localized in diverse tissues throughout the body, where they mediate protection against pathogens and environmental insults while maintaining tissue homeostasis. Although much of our understanding of human immunology has derived from studies of peripheral blood, recent work utilizing human tissue resources and innovative computational methods have employed a whole-body, systems-based approach, revealing tremendous complexity and heterogeneity of the immune system within individuals and across the population. In this review, we discuss how tissue localization, developmental and age-associated changes, and conditions of health and disease shape the immune response, as well as how improved understanding of interindividual and tissue-specific immunity can be leveraged for developing targeted therapeutics.","2636":null,"2637":"Bacterial degradation of the sugar sulfoquinovose (SQ, 6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose) produced by plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, is an important component of the biogeochemical carbon and sulfur cycles. Here, we reveal a third biochemical pathway for primary SQ degradation in an aerobic Bacillus aryabhattai strain. An isomerase converts SQ to 6-deoxy-6-sulfofructose (SF). A novel transaldolase enzyme cleaves the SF to 3-sulfolactaldehyde (SLA), while the non-sulfonated C3-(glycerone)-moiety is transferred to an acceptor molecule, glyceraldehyde phosphate (GAP), yielding fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). Intestinal anaerobic bacteria such as Enterococcus gilvus, Clostridium symbiosum, and Eubacterium rectale strains also express transaldolase pathway gene clusters during fermentative growth with SQ. The now three known biochemical strategies for SQ catabolism reflect adaptations to the aerobic or anaerobic lifestyle of the different bacteria. The occurrence of these pathways in intestinal (family) Enterobacteriaceae and (phylum) Firmicutes strains further highlights a potential importance of metabolism of green-diet SQ by gut microbial communities to, ultimately, hydrogen sulfide.","2638":"Light-inducible gene expression systems represent powerful methods for studying the functional roles of dynamic gene expression. Here, we developed an optimized light-inducible Gal4\/UAS gene expression system for mammalian cells. We designed photoactivatable (PA)-Gal4 transcriptional activators based on the concept of split transcription factors, in which light-dependent interactions between Cry2-CIB1 PA-protein interaction modules can reconstitute a split Gal4 DNA-binding domain and p65 transcription activation domain. We developed a set of PA-Gal4 transcriptional activators (PA-Gal4cc), which differ in terms of induced gene expression levels following pulsed or prolonged light exposure, and which have different activation\/deactivation kinetics. These systems offer optogenetic tools for the precise manipulation of gene expression at fine spatiotemporal resolution in mammalian cells.","2639":"Immunotherapy has yielded impressive results, but only for a minority of patients with cancer. Therefore, new approaches that potentiate immunotherapy are a pressing medical need. Ferroptosis is a newly described type of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent phospholipid peroxidation via Fenton chemistry. Here, we developed iron oxide-loaded nanovaccines (IONVs), which, chemically programmed to integrate iron catalysis, drug delivery, and tracking exploiting the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), improves immunotherapy and activation of ferroptosis. The IONVs trigger danger signals and use molecular disassembly and reversible covalent bonds for targeted antigen delivery and improved immunostimulatory capacity and catalytic iron for targeting tumor cell ferroptosis. IONV- and antibody-mediated TME modulation interfaced with imaging was important toward achieving complete eradication of aggressive and established tumors, eliciting long-lived protective antitumor immunity with no toxicities. This work establishes the feasibility of using nanoparticle iron catalytic activity as a versatile and effective feature for enhancing immunotherapy.","2640":null,"2641":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is primarily characterized by progressive muscle wasting due to deficiency in the membrane cytoskeletal protein dystrophin but is also associated with body-wide cellular disturbances in a variety of non-muscle tissues. In this study, we have focused on the comparative proteomic analysis of the spleen and established considerable changes in this crucial secondary lymphoid organ from the genetic mdx-4cv mouse model of dystrophinopathy. An apparent short isoform of dystrophin and associated glycoproteins were identified in spleen by mass spectrometry but appear not be affected in muscular dystrophy. In contrast, the mdx-4cv spleen showed significant proteome-wide changes in other protein species that are involved in metabolism, signaling, and cellular architecture. Since the spleen plays a key role in the immune response, these proteomic alterations may reflect pathophysiological cross talk between the lymphoid system and dystrophic muscles, which are affected by both fiber degeneration and inflammation.","2642":"Zero- to two-dimensional nanomaterials have been incorporated into metal-matrices to improve the strength of metals, but challengingly, high-volume-fraction nanomaterials are difficult to disperse uniformly in metal matrices, severely degrading the ductility of conventionally processed metals. Here, a considerably dense uniform dispersion of in situ formed nanoscale lamellar TiC reinforcement (16.1 wt %) in Ti matrix is achieved through laser-tailored 3D printing and complete reaction of Ti powder with a small amount (1.0 wt %) of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). An enhanced tensile strength of 912 MPa and an outstanding fracture elongation of 16% are simultaneously achieved for laser-printed components, showing a maximum 350% improvement in \"product of strength and elongation\" compared with conventional Ti. In situ nanoscale TiC reinforcement favors the formation of ultrafine equiaxed Ti grains and metallurgically coherent interface with minimal lattice misfit between TiC lamellae and Ti matrix. Our approach hopefully provides a feasible way to broaden structural applications of CNTs in load-bearing Ti-based engineering components via laser-tailored reorganization with Ti.","2643":"Atlastin (ATL) is a class of dynamin-like GTPases shaping endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by mediating homotypic membrane fusion. Defect of ATLs leads to abnormal ER structure and hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), a neurodegenerative disease with progressive spasticity. How ATLs are regulated to maintain the ER dynamics is not clear. Here, we found that SYVN1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase on the ER membrane, regulates ER shape and COPII exporting by mediating ubiquitination on ATLs, especially ATL1. ATL1 is ubiquitinated by SYVN1 strongly on K285 and mildly on K287. Ubiquitination on ATL1 does not result in protein degradation but inhibits ATL1 GTPase activity. SYVN1 overexpression compensates the excessive ER network fusion caused by ATL1 overexpression. Accordingly, the role of SYVN1 and ATL1 in regulating ER morphology is also recapitulated in Caenorhabditis elegans. Taken together, our study reveals a different role of SYVN1 in ER remodeling through mediating ubiquitination on ATLs.","2644":null,"2645":null,"2646":null,"2647":null,"2648":"Region-specific neural progenitor cells (NPCs) can be generated from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) by modulating signaling pathways. However, how intrinsic transcriptional factors contribute to the neural regionalization is not well characterized. Here, we generate region-specific NPCs from hESCs and find that SOX1 is highly expressed in NPCs with the rostral hindbrain identity. Moreover, we find that OTX2 inhibits SOX1 expression, displaying exclusive expression between the two factors. Furthermore, SOX1 knockout (KO) leads to the upregulation of midbrain genes and downregulation of rostral hindbrain genes, indicating that SOX1 is required for specification of rostral hindbrain NPCs. Our SOX1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis reveals that SOX1 binds to the distal region of GBX2 to activate its expression. Overexpression of GBX2 largely abrogates SOX1-KO-induced aberrant gene expression. Taken together, this study uncovers previously unappreciated role of SOX1 in early neural regionalization and provides new information for the precise control of the OTX2\/GBX2 interface.","2649":null,"2650":"Advances in reading, writing, and editing DNA are providing unprecedented insights into the complexity of immunological systems. This combination of systems and synthetic biology methods is enabling the quantitative and precise understanding of molecular recognition in adaptive immunity, thus providing a framework for reprogramming immune responses for translational medicine. In this review, we will highlight state-of-the-art methods such as immune repertoire sequencing, immunoinformatics, and immunogenomic engineering and their application toward adaptive immunity. We showcase novel and interdisciplinary approaches that have the promise of transforming the design and breadth of molecular and cellular immunotherapies.","2651":"Leaf angle is mainly determined by the lamina joint (LJ) and contributes to ideal crop architecture for high yield. Here, we dissected five successive stages with distinct cytological features of LJs spanning organogenesis to leaf angle formation and obtained the underlying stage-specific mRNAs and small RNAs, which well explained the cytological dynamics during LJ organogenesis and leaf angle plasticity. Combining the gene coexpression correlation with high-throughput promoter analysis, we identified a set of transcription factors (TFs) determining the stage- and\/or cytological structure-specific profiles. The functional studies of these TFs demonstrated that cytological dynamics determined leaf angle and that the knockout rice of these TFs with erect leaves significantly enhanced yield by maintaining the proper tiller number under dense planting. This work revealed the high-resolution mechanisms of how the cytological dynamics of LJ determined leaf erectness and served as a valuable resource to remodel rice architecture for high yield by controlling population density.","2652":"","2653":"A wide range of physical systems can be formally mapped to a linear chain of sorted objects. Upon introduction of intrachain interactions, such a chain can \"fold\" to elaborate topological structures, analogous to folded linear polymer systems. Two distinct chain-topology theories, knot theory and circuit topology, have separately provided insight into the structure, dynamics, and evolution of folded linear polymers such as proteins and genomic DNA. Knot theory, however, ignores intrachain interactions (contacts), whereas chain crossings are ignored in circuit topology. Thus, there is a need for a universal approach that can provide topological description of any folded linear chain. Here, we generalize circuit topology in order to grasp particularities typically addressed by knot theory. We develop a generic approach that is simple, mathematically rigorous, and practically useful for structural classification, analysis of structural dynamics, and engineering applications.","2654":"","2655":null,"2656":"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the pathophysiology of this virus is complex and largely unknown, we employed a network-biology-fueled approach and integrated transcriptome data pertaining to lung epithelial cells with human interactome to generate Calu-3-specific human-SARS-CoV-2 interactome (CSI). Topological clustering and pathway enrichment analysis show that SARS-CoV-2 targets central nodes of the host-viral network, which participate in core functional pathways. Network centrality analyses discover 33 high-value SARS-CoV-2 targets, which are possibly involved in viral entry, proliferation, and survival to establish infection and facilitate disease progression. Our probabilistic modeling framework elucidates critical regulatory circuitry and molecular events pertinent to COVID-19, particularly the host-modifying responses and cytokine storm. Overall, our network-centric analyses reveal novel molecular components, uncover structural and functional modules, and provide molecular insights into the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 that may help foster effective therapeutic design.","2657":"C21ORF2 and NEK1 have been identified as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated genes. Both genes are also mutated in certain ciliopathies, suggesting that they might contribute to the same signaling pathways. Here we show that FBXO3, the substrate receptor of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, binds and ubiquitylates C21ORF2, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation. C21ORF2 stabilizes the kinase NEK1, with the result that loss of FBXO3 stabilizes not only C21ORF2 but also NEK1. Conversely, NEK1-mediated phosphorylation stabilizes C21ORF2 by attenuating its interaction with FBXO3. We found that the ALS-associated V58L mutant of C21ORF2 is more susceptible to phosphorylation by NEK1, with the result that it is not ubiquitylated by FBXO3 and therefore accumulates together with NEK1. Expression of C21ORF2(V58L) in motor neurons induced from mouse embryonic stem cells impaired neurite outgrowth. We suggest that inhibition of NEK1 activity is a potential therapeutic approach to ALS associated with C21ORF2 mutation.","2658":null,"2659":"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA), play fundamental roles in mammalian physiology. Although PUFA imbalance causes various disorders, mechanisms of the regulation of their systemic levels are poorly understood. Here, we report that hepatic DHA-containing phospholipids (DHA-PLs) determine the systemic levels of PUFAs through the SREBP1-mediated transcriptional program. We demonstrated that liver-specific deletion of Agpat3 leads to a decrease of DHA-PLs and a compensatory increase of ARA-PLs not only in the liver but also in other tissues including the brain. Together with recent findings that plasma lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) is the major source of brain DHA, our results indicate that hepatic AGPAT3 contributes to brain DHA accumulation by supplying DHA-PLs as precursors of DHA-lysoPC. Furthermore, dietary fish oil-mediated suppression of hepatic PUFA biosynthetic program was blunted in liver-specific Agpat3 deletion. Our findings highlight the central role of hepatic DHA-PLs as the molecular rheostat for systemic homeostasis of PUFAs.","2660":"Current crop production systems are prone to increasing pathogen pressure. Fundamental understanding of molecular plant-pathogen interactions, the availability of crop and pathogen genomic information, as well as emerging genome editing permits a novel approach for breeding of crop disease resistance. We describe here strategies to identify new targets for resistance breeding with focus on interruption of the compatible plant-pathogen interaction by CRISPR\/Cas-mediated genome editing. Basically, crop genome editing can be applied in several ways to achieve this goal. The most common approach focuses on the \"simple\" knockout by non-homologous end joining repair of plant susceptibility factors required for efficient host colonization. However, genome re-writing via homology-directed repair or base editing can also prevent host manipulation by changing the targets of pathogen-derived effectors or molecules beyond recognition, which also decreases plant susceptibility. We conclude that genome editing by CRISPR\/Cas will become increasingly indispensable to generate in relatively short time beneficial resistance traits in crops to meet upcoming challenges.","2661":"Physiological trade-offs between mosquito immune response and reproductive capability can arise due to insufficient resource availability. C-type lectin family members may be involved in these processes. We established a GCTL-3-\/- mutant Aedes aegypti using CRISPR\/Cas9 to investigate the role of GCTL-3 in balancing the costs associated with immune responses to arboviral infection and reproduction. GCTL-3-\/- mutants showed significantly reduced DENV-2 infection rate and gut commensal microbiota populations, as well as upregulated JAK\/STAT, IMD, Toll, and AMPs immunological pathways. Mutants also had significantly shorter lifespans than controls and laid fewer eggs due to defective germ line development. dsRNA knock-down of Attacin and Gambicin, two targets of the AMPs pathway, partially rescued this reduction in reproductive capabilities. Upregulation of immune response following GCTL-3 knock-out therefore comes at a cost to reproductive fitness. Knock-out of other lectins may further improve our knowledge of the molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying reproduction-immunity trade-offs in mosquitoes.","2662":null,"2663":"Brain metastasis is an ineffective process, and many cancer cells enter into an indolent state following extravasation in the brain. Single cell RNA sequencing of melanoma brain metastases reveals that non-proliferating brain metastatic melanoma cells exhibit a pattern of gene expression associated with inhibition of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). The brain microenvironment, specifically the combination of reactive astrocytes and mechanically soft surroundings, suppressed DNMT1 expression in various cancer types and caused cell cycle delay. Somewhat unexpectedly, we find that DNMT1 suppression not only induces cell cycle delay but also activates pro-survival signals in brain metastatic cancer cells, including L1CAM and CRYAB. Our results demonstrate that transcriptional changes triggered by DNMT1 suppression is a key step for cancer cells to survive in the brain microenvironment and that they also restrict cancer cell proliferation. The dual consequences of DNMT1 suppression can explain the persistence of indolent cancer cells in the brain microenvironment.","2664":"Insulin regulates glucose metabolism through thousands of regulatory mechanisms; however, which regulatory mechanisms are keys to control glucose metabolism remains unknown. Here, we performed kinetic trans-omic analysis by integrating isotope-tracing glucose flux and phosphoproteomic data from insulin-stimulated adipocytes and built a kinetic mathematical model to identify key allosteric regulatory and phosphorylation events for enzymes. We identified nine reactions regulated by allosteric effectors and one by enzyme phosphorylation and determined the regulatory mechanisms for three of these reactions. Insulin stimulated glycolysis by promoting Glut4 activity by enhancing phosphorylation of AS160 at S595, stimulated fatty acid synthesis by promoting Acly activity through allosteric activation by glucose 6-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate, and stimulated glutamate synthesis by alleviating allosteric inhibition of Gls by glutamate. Most of glycolytic reactions were regulated by amounts of substrates and products. Thus, phosphorylation or allosteric modulator-based regulation of only a few key enzymes was sufficient to change insulin-induced metabolism.","2665":"Fermentation processes are used to sustainably produce chemicals and as such contribute to the transition to a circular economy. The maximum theoretical yield of a conversion can only be approached if all electrons present in the substrate end up in the product. Control over the electrons is therefore crucial. However, electron transfer via redox cofactors results in a diffuse distribution of electrons over metabolism. To overcome this challenge, we propose to apply non-canonical redox cofactors (NRCs) in metabolic networks: cofactors that channel electrons exclusively from substrate to product, forming orthogonal circuits for electron transfer.","2666":"Currently, more than 1,200 agrochemicals are listed and many of these are regularly used by farmers to generate the food supply to support the expanding global population. However, resistance to pesticides is an ever more frequently occurring phenomenon, and thus, a continuous supply of novel agrochemicals with high efficiency, selectivity, and low toxicity is required. Moreover, the demand for a more sustainable society, by reducing the risk chemicals pose to human health and by minimizing their environmental footprint, renders the development of novel agrochemicals an ever more challenging undertaking. In the last two decades, fluoro-chemicals have been associated with significant advances in the agrochemical development process. We herein analyze the contribution that organofluorine compounds make to the agrochemical industry. Our database covers 424 fluoro-agrochemicals and is subdivided into several categories including chemotypes, mode of action, heterocycles, and chirality. This in-depth analysis reveals the unique relationship between fluorine and agrochemicals.","2667":null,"2668":"Two opposing viewpoints are held regarding the need for understanding a drug's molecular target and mechanism of action.

It has also been used to treat delayed gastric emptying. However, it exerts several side effects. We found that deglycosylated AZM (Deg-AZM or CP0119), an AZM metabolite, is a positively strong intestinal agonist that may result in the intestinal mobility experienced by patients after AZM administration. We confirmed that Deg-AZM can function strongly on intestinal peristalsis and identified transgelin as its potential molecular target. Furthermore, our pharmacological studies showed that the binding of Deg-AZM to transgelin enhanced the contractility of intestinal smooth muscle cells by facilitating the assembly of actin filaments into tight bundles and stress fibers. Specifically, Deg-AZM promoted intestinal peristaltic activity in wild-type mice but not in transgelin (-\/-) mice. Moreover, Deg-AZM did not exert antibacterial activity and did not disrupt intestinal flora. Thus, Deg-AZM may become a potential drug for slow-transit constipation treatment.","2671":null,"2672":null,"2673":null,"2674":"RAS proteins function as highly regulated molecular switches that control cellular growth. In addition to regulatory proteins, RAS undergoes a number of posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that regulate its activity. Lysine 104, a hot spot for multiple PTMs, is a highly conserved residue that forms key interactions that stabilize the RAS helix-2(H2)\/helix-3(H3) interface. Mutation at 104 attenuates interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), whereas ubiquitination at lysine 104 retains GEF regulation. To elucidate how ubiquitination modulates RAS function, we generated monoubiquitinated KRAS at 104 using chemical biology approaches and conducted biochemical, NMR, and computational analyses. We find that ubiquitination promotes a new dynamic interaction network and alters RAS conformational dynamics to retain GEF function. These findings reveal a mechanism by which ubiquitination can regulate protein function.","2675":"ADAMTSs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs) are secreted metalloproteinases that play a major role in the assembly and degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In this study, we show that ADAMTS18, produced by the epithelial cells of distal airways and mesenchymal cells in lung apex at early embryonic stages, serves as a morphogen in lung development. ADAMTS18 deficiency leads to reduced number and length of bronchi, tipped lung apexes, and dilated alveoli. These developmental defects worsen lipopolysaccharide-induced acute lung injury and bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in adult Adamts18-deficient mice. ADAMTS18 deficiency also causes increased levels of fibrillin1 and fibrillin2, bronchial microfibril accumulation, decreased focal adhesion kinase signaling, and disruption of F-actin organization. Our findings indicate that ECM homeostasis mediated by ADAMTS18 is pivotal in airway branching morphogenesis.","2676":"Indirect pathway medium-sized spiny neurons (iMSNs) in the neostriatum are well known to project to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). Although direct MSNs (dMSNs) also send axon collaterals to the GPe, it remains unclear how dMSNs and iMSNs converge within the GPe. Here, we selectively labeled neighboring dMSNs and iMSNs with green and red fluorescent proteins using an adeno-associated virus vector and examined axonal projections of dMSNs and iMSNs to the GPe in mice. Both dMSNs and iMSNs formed two axonal arborizations displaying topographical projections in the dorsoventral and mediolateral planes. iMSNs displayed a wider and denser axon distribution, which included that of dMSNs. Density peaks of dMSN and iMSN axons almost overlapped, revealing convergence of dMSN axons in the center of iMSN projection fields. These overlapping projections suggest that dMSNs and iMSNs may work cooperatively via interactions within the GPe.","2677":null,"2678":null,"2679":null,"2680":null,"2681":null,"2682":"SIRT7 is a member of the mammalian sirtuins and functions as an NAD+-dependent deacylase.

This in turn causes CENP-A dislocation at the centromere, which further affects chromatin assembly. SIRT7 ablation results in aneuploidy and aging phenotypes, including senescence and nucleolar expansion. Moreover, SIRT7 knockout mice are susceptible to DSS-induced colitis and alcohol-derived epithelial disturbance, revealing a disrupted intestinal epithelial homeostasis. Notably, absence of SIRT7 aggravates the susceptibility of colorectal cancer incidence in APCMin\/+ mouse model and elicits further the Wnt signaling. Our findings indicate a tumor suppressive role of SIRT7 in the case of colorectal cancer. Together with the activities in maintaining genome integrity and intestinal homeostasis, activating SIRT7 may serve as a strategy to treat bowel diseases and colorectal cancer.","2683":"Hypoxia is serving crucial roles in cancers. This study aims to comprehensively analyze the molecular features and clinical relevance of a well-defined hypoxia-associated signature in pan-cancer using multi-omics data. Data were acquired from TCGA, CCLE, GDSC, and GEO. RNA expression pattern, copy number variation (CNV), methylation, and mutation of the signature were analyzed. The majority of the 15 genes were upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal tissue, and RNA expression was negatively associated with methylation level. CNV occurred in almost all the cancers, whereas mutation frequency was low across different cancer types. The signature was also closely related to cancer hallmarks and cancer-related metabolism pathways. NDRG1 was upregulated in kidney cancer tissues as indicated by immunohistochemistry. Besides, most of the 15 genes were risk factors for patients' overall survival. Our results provide a valuable resource that will guide both mechanistic and therapeutic analyses of the hypoxia signature in cancers.","2684":null,"2685":null,"2686":null,"2687":null,"2688":null,"2689":"Latent factor modeling applied to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data is a useful approach to discover gene signatures.

By applying this framework to scRNA-seq datasets from biopsies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, we discover disease-relevant gene signatures in specific cellular subsets. In rheumatoid arthritis, we identify an inflammatory OSMR signaling signature active in a subset of synovial fibroblasts and an efferocytic signature in a subset of synovial monocytes.

We addressed this question by eliciting the perceptual illusion that pairs of friends swapped bodies with each other. We found that during the illusion, the participants rated their own personality characteristics more similarly to the way they previously rated their friend's personality, and this flexible adjustment of self-concept to the \"new\" bodily self was related to the strength of illusory ownership of the friend's body. Moreover, a subsequent memory test showed that personality traits rated during the friend-body-swap illusion were generally remembered worse than traits rated during the control conditions; importantly, however, this impairment of episodic recognition memory was reduced for the participants who considerably adjusted their self-concept during the illusory body swapping. These findings demonstrate that our beliefs about own personality are dynamically shaped by the perception of our body and that coherence between the bodily and conceptual self-representations is important for the normal encoding of episodic memories.","2693":"The discovery of the default mode network (DMN), a large-scale brain network that is suppressed during attention-demanding tasks, had major impact in neuroscience. This network exhibits an antagonistic relationship with attention-related networks. A better understanding of the processes underlying modulation of DMN is imperative, as this network is compromised in several neurological diseases. Cholinergic neuromodulation is one of the major regulatory networks for attention, and studies suggest a role in regulation of the DMN. In this study, we unilaterally activated the right basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and observed decreased right intra-hemispheric and interhemispheric FC in the default mode like network (DMLN). Our findings provide critical insights into the interplay between cholinergic neuromodulation and DMLN, demonstrate that differential effects can be exerted between the two hemispheres by unilateral stimulation, and open windows for further studies involving directed modulations of DMN in treatments for diseases demonstrating compromised DMN activity.","2694":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important mediators of intercellular communication. Interest in the role of central nervous system (CNS)-derived EVs has been increasing; however, some skepticism of their importance has persisted because many aspects of their biology remain elusive. This ambiguity is largely due to technical barriers that hamper our ability to achieve a comprehensive understanding of their molecular components and mechanisms responsible for their transmission and uptake. However, accumulating evidence supports the notion that EVs play important roles in basic physiological processes within the CNS during neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, EVs also act to spread toxic polypeptides in neurodegenerative diseases. Developing a more profound understanding of the role that EVs play in the CNS could lead to the identification of biomarkers and potential vehicles for drug delivery. Here we highlight our current understanding of CNS EVs and summarize our current understanding of their complex role in the CNS.","2695":"Identification of safe and effective compounds to increase or activate UCP1 expression in brown or white adipocytes remains a potent therapeutic strategy to combat obesity. Here we reported that, glyburide, one of the FDA-approved drugs currently used to treat type 2 diabetes, can significantly enhance UCP1 expression in both brown and white adipocytes. Glyburide-fed mice exhibited a clear resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity, reduced blood triglyceride level, and increased UCP1 expression in brown adipose tissue. Moreover, in situ injection of glyburide to inguinal white adipose tissue remarkably enhanced UCP1 expression and increased thermogenesis. Further mechanistic studies indicated that the glyburide effect in UCP1 expression in adipocytes was KATP channel independent but may involve the regulation of the Ca2+-Calcineurin-NFAT signal pathway. Overall, our findings revealed the significant effects of glyburide in regulating UCP1 expression and thermogenesis in adipocytes, which can be potentially repurposed to treat obesity.","2696":null,"2697":"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 6 (TRPV6), a calcium-selective channel possessing six transmembrane domains (S1-S6) and intracellular N and C termini, plays crucial roles in calcium absorption in epithelia and bone and is involved in human diseases including vitamin-D deficiency, osteoporosis, and cancer. The TRPV6 function and regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the TRPV6 intramolecular S4-S5 linker to C-terminal TRP helix (L\/C) and N-terminal pre-S1 helix to TRP helix (N\/C) interactions, mediated by Arg470:Trp593 and Trp321:Ile597 bonding, respectively, are autoinhibitory and are required for maintaining TRPV6 at basal states. Disruption of either interaction by mutations or blocking peptides activates TRPV6. The N\/C interaction depends on the L\/C interaction but not reversely. Three cationic residues in S5 or C terminus are involved in binding PIP2 to suppress both interactions thereby activating TRPV6. This study reveals \"PIP2 - intramolecular interactions\" regulatory mechanism of TRPV6 activation-autoinhibition, which will help elucidating the corresponding mechanisms in other TRP channels.","2698":null,"2699":"Events at a receptor ectodomain affect the intracellular domain conformation, activating signal transduction (out-to-in conformational effects). We investigated the reverse direction (in-to-out) where the intracellular domain may impact on ectodomain conformation. The primary sequences of naturally occurring TrkC receptor isoforms (TrkC-FL and TrkC.T1) only differ at the intracellular domain. However, owing to their differential association with Protein Disulfide Isomerase the isoforms have different disulfide bonding and conformations at the ectodomain. Conformations were exploited to develop artificial ligands, mAbs, and small molecules, with isoform-specific binding and biased activation. Consistent, the physiological ligands NT-3 and PTP-sigma bind both isoforms, but NT-3 activates all signaling pathways, whereas PTP-sigma activates biased signals. Our data support an \"in-to-out\" model controlling receptor ectodomain conformation, a strategy that enables heterogeneity in receptors, ligands, and bioactivity. These concepts may be extended to the many wild-type or oncogenic receptors with known isoforms.","2700":"As one of the most important paradigms of recurrent neural networks, the echo state network (ESN) has been applied to a wide range of fields, from robotics to medicine, finance, and language processing. A key feature of the ESN paradigm is its reservoir-a directed and weighted network of neurons that projects the input time series into a high-dimensional space where linear regression or classification can be applied. By analyzing the dynamics of the reservoir we show that the ensemble of eigenvalues of the network contributes to the ESN memory capacity. Moreover, we find that adding short loops to the reservoir network can tailor ESN for specific tasks and optimize learning. We validate our findings by applying ESN to forecast both synthetic and real benchmark time series. Our results provide a simple way to design task-specific ESN and offer deep insights for other recurrent neural networks.","2701":null,"2702":null,"2703":null,"2704":"The anti-inflammatory actions of interleukin-10 (IL10) are thought to be mediated primarily by the STAT3 transcription factor, but pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL6) also act through STAT3. We now report that IL10, but not IL6 signaling, induces formation of a complex between STAT3 and the inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase SHIP1 in macrophages. Both SHIP1 and STAT3 translocate to the nucleus in macrophages. Remarkably, sesquiterpenes of the Pelorol family, which we previously described as allosteric activators of SHIP1 phosphatase activity, could induce SHIP1\/STAT3 complex formation in cells and mimic the anti-inflammatory action of IL10 in a mouse model of colitis. Using crystallography and docking studies we identified a drug-binding pocket in SHIP1. Our studies reveal new mechanisms of action for both STAT3 and SHIP1 and provide a rationale for use of allosteric SHIP1-activating compounds, which mimic the beneficial anti-inflammatory actions of IL10. VIDEO ABSTRACT.","2705":"Cooperation in human groups is challenging, and various mechanisms are required to sustain it, although it nevertheless usually decays over time. Here, we perform theoretically informed experiments involving networks of humans (1,024 subjects in 64 networks) playing a public-goods game to which we sometimes added autonomous agents (bots) programmed to use only local knowledge. We show that cooperation can not only be stabilized, but even promoted, when the bots intervene in the partner selections made by the humans, re-shaping social connections locally within a larger group. Cooperation rates increased from 60.4% at baseline to 79.4% at the end. This network-intervention strategy outperformed other strategies, such as adding bots playing tit-for-tat. We also confirm that even a single bot can foster cooperation in human groups by using a mixed strategy designed to support the development of cooperative clusters. Simple artificial intelligence can increase the cooperation of groups.","2706":"An important viromics challenge is associating bacteriophages to hosts. To address this, we developed adsorption sequencing (AdsorpSeq), a readily implementable method to measure phages that are preferentially adsorbed to specific host cell envelopes. AdsorpSeq thus captures the key initial infection cycle step. Phages are added to cell envelopes, adsorbed phages are isolated through gel electrophoresis, after which adsorbed phage DNA is sequenced and compared with the full virome. Here, we show that AdsorpSeq allows for separation of phages based on receptor-adsorbing capabilities. Next, we applied AdsorpSeq to identify phages in a wastewater virome that adsorb to cell envelopes of nine bacteria, including important pathogens. We detected 26 adsorbed phages including common and rare members of the virome, a minority being related to previously characterized phages. We conclude that AdsorpSeq is an effective new tool for rapid characterization of environmental phage adsorption, with a proof-of-principle application to Gram-negative host cell envelopes.","2707":"","2708":null,"2709":null,"2710":null,"2711":"COVID-19 is becoming a leading cause of mortality throughout the world, and few effective therapies are currently available. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is essential to COVID-19 pathogenesis, as the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) is required for viral entry and development of COVID-19. ACE2 regulates the protective arm of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that endows anti-hypertensive and anti-inflammatory effects in the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Preclinical data suggest ACE2 might be downregulated after SARS-CoV-2 binding, and treatments that increase ACE2 may prevent cardiopulmonary injury. Development, testing, and mass production of novel ACE2 therapies may take years, whereas more effective treatments for COVID-19 are needed urgently. Metformin is a widely available anti-diabetic agent that has an excellent safety profile, and clinical and preclinical data suggest metformin may offer cardiopulmonary protection in COVID-19 via enhanced ACE2 expression.","2712":"Social behavior is widespread in the animal kingdom, and it remarkably influences human personal and professional lives. However, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying social behavior is elusive. Integrating the seemingly different fields of robotics and preclinical research could bring new insight on social behavior. Toward this aim, we established \"behavioral teleporting\" as an experimental solution to independently manipulate multiple factors underpinning social interactions. Behavioral teleporting consists of real-time transfer of the complete ethogram of a live zebrafish onto a remotely-located robotic replica. Through parallel and simultaneous behavioral teleporting, we studied the interaction between two live fish swimming in remotely-located tanks: each live fish interacted with an inanimate robot that mirrored the behavior of the other fish, and the morphology of each robot was independently tailored. Our results indicate that behavioral teleporting can preserve natural interaction between two live animals, while allowing fine control over morphological features that modulate social behavior.","2713":null,"2714":"Three-dimensional (3D) optical imaging techniques can expand our knowledge about physiological and pathological processes that cannot be fully understood with 2D approaches. Standard diagnostic tests frequently are not sufficient to unequivocally determine the presence of a pathological condition. Whole-organ optical imaging requires tissue transparency, which can be achieved by using tissue clearing procedures enabling deeper image acquisition and therefore making possible the analysis of large-scale biological tissue samples. Here, we review currently available clearing agents, methods, and their application in imaging of physiological or pathological conditions in different animal and human organs. We also compare different optical tissue clearing methods discussing their advantages and disadvantages and review the use of different 3D imaging techniques for the visualization and image acquisition of cleared tissues. The use of optical tissue clearing resources for large-scale biological tissues 3D imaging paves the way for future applications in translational and clinical research.","2715":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes thirteen core components of OXPHOS complexes, and its steady expression is crucial for cellular energy homeostasis. However, the regulation of mtDNA expression machinery, along with its sensing mechanism to energetic stresses, is not fully understood. Here, we identified SQSTM1\/p62 as an important regulator of mtDNA expression machinery, which could effectively induce mtDNA expression and the effects were mediated by p38-dependent upregulation of mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 (MRPL12) in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), a highly energy-demanding cell type related to OXPHOS. We further identified a direct binding site within the MRPL12 promoter to ATF2, the downstream effector of p38. Besides, SQSTM1\/p62-induced mtDNA expression is involved in both serum deprivation and hypoxia-induced mitochondrial response, which was further highlighted by kidney injury phenotype of TECs-specific SQSTM1\/p62 knockout mice. Collectively, these data suggest that SQSTM1\/p62 is a key regulator and energetic sensor of mtDNA expression machinery.","2716":"Immunotherapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) treatment faces serious challenges, due particularly to the poor immunogenicity. Cancer cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) play important roles in damaging the immune system. However, the effects of pancreatic cancer-derived sEVs on T lymphocytes are unknown. Here we investigated changes in phenotypes and signal transduction pathways in sEVs-treated T lymphocytes. We identified the overexpression of immune checkpoint proteins PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4, and Tim-3 and the enrichment of FOXP3+ Treg cluster in sEVs-treated T lymphocytes by CyTOF. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that DNA damage response and metabolic pathways might be involved in sEVs-induced Tregs. ATM, AMPK, SIRT1, SIRT2, and SIRT6 were activated sequentially in sEVs-treated T lymphocytes and essential for sEVs-upregulated expressions of FOXO1A, FOXO3A, and FOXP3. Our study reveals the impact and mechanism of pancreatic cancer cell-derived sEVs on T lymphocytes and may provide insights into developing immunotherapy strategies for PDAC treatment.","2717":null,"2718":"Surface colonization allows diatoms, a dominant group of phytoplankton in oceans, to adapt to harsh marine environments while mediating biofoulings to human-made underwater facilities. The regulatory pathways underlying diatom surface colonization, which involves morphotype switching in some species, remain mostly unknown. Here, we describe the identification of 61 signaling genes, including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and protein kinases, which are differentially regulated during surface colonization in the model diatom species, Phaeodactylum tricornutum. We show that the transformation of P. tricornutum with constructs expressing individual GPCR genes induces cells to adopt the surface colonization morphology. P. tricornutum cells transformed to express GPCR1A display 30% more resistance to UV light exposure than their non-biofouling wild-type counterparts, consistent with increased silicification of cell walls associated with the oval biofouling morphotype. Our results provide a mechanistic definition of morphological shifts during surface colonization and identify candidate target proteins for the screening of eco-friendly, anti-biofouling molecules.","2719":null,"2720":null,"2721":"Single-ion conducting polymer electrolytes exhibit great potential for next-generation high-energy-density Li metal batteries, although the lack of sufficient molecular-scale insights into lithium transport mechanisms and reliable understanding of key correlations often limit the scope of modification and design of new materials. Moreover, the sensitivity to small variations of polymer chemical structures (e.g., selection of specific linkages or chemical groups) is often overlooked as potential design parameter. In this study, combined molecular dynamics simulations and experimental investigations reveal molecular-scale correlations among variations in polymer structures and Li+ transport capabilities. Based on polyamide-based single-ion conducting quasi-solid polymer electrolytes, it is demonstrated that small modifications of the polymer backbone significantly enhance the Li+ transport while governing the resulting membrane morphology. Based on the obtained insights, tailored materials with significantly improved ionic conductivity and excellent electrochemical performance are achieved and their applicability in LFP||Li and NMC||Li cells is successfully demonstrated.","2722":null,"2723":null,"2724":"","2725":"Bacteriocins are a distinct family of antimicrobial proteins postulated to porate bacterial membranes. However, direct experimental evidence of pore formation by these proteins is lacking. Here we report a multi-mode poration mechanism induced by four-helix bacteriocins, epidermicin NI01 and aureocin A53. Using a combination of crystallography, spectroscopy, bioassays, and nanoscale imaging, we established that individual two-helix segments of epidermicin retain antibacterial activity but each of these segments adopts a particular poration mode. In the intact protein these segments act synergistically to balance out antibacterial and hemolytic activities. The study sets a precedent of multi-mode membrane disruption advancing the current understanding of structure-activity relationships in pore-forming proteins.","2726":"Glioblastoma (GBM) may arise from astrocytes through a multistep process involving a progressive accumulation of mutations. We explored whether GBM-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may facilitate neoplastic transformation and malignant growth of astrocytes. We utilized conditioned media (CM) of cultured glioma cells, its sequential filtration, diverse cell-based assays, RNA sequencing, and metabolic assays to compare the effects of EV-containing and EV-depleted CM. GBM EVs facilitated the neoplastic growth of pre-transformed astrocytes but not normal human or mouse astrocytes. They induced proliferation, self-renewal, and colony formation of pre-transformed astrocytes and enhanced astrocytoma growth in a mouse allograft model. GBM EVs appear to reprogram astrocyte metabolism by inducing a shift in gene expression that may be partly associated with EV-mediated transfer of full-length mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolytic factors. Our study suggests an EV\/extracellular RNA (exRNA)-mediated mechanism that contributes to astrocyte transformation via metabolic reprograming and implicates horizontal mRNA transfer.","2727":"The emergence of all-inorganic halide perovskites has shown great potential in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices. However, the photo-induced phase segregation in lead mixed-halide perovskites has severely limited their application. Herein, by real-time monitoring the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of metal mixed-halide perovskites under light irradiation, we found that the photo-induced phase transition can be significantly inhibited by B-site doping. For pristine mixed-halide perovskites, an intermediate phase of CsPbBrxI3-x can only be stabilized under low excitation power. After introducing Sn2+ ions, such intermediate phase can be stabilized in nitrogen atmosphere under high excitation power and phase segregation can be started after the exposure in oxygen due to oxidization of Sn2+. Replacing Sn2+ by Mn2+ can further improve the intermediate phase's tolerance to oxygen proving that B-site doping in perovskites structure by Sn2+ or Mn2+ could effectively minimize the light-induced phase segregation and promote them to serve as promising candidates in photovoltaic and light-emitting devices.","2728":"Exome and transcriptome analyses of clinically homogeneous early-stage never-smoker female patients with lung adenocarcinoma were performed to understand tumor-T cell interactions and immune escape points.

Moreover, despite recent advances in third-generation sequencing, researchers still tend to generate accurate short reads for many of the analysis tasks. Here, we present HASLR, a hybrid assembler that uses error-prone long reads together with high-quality short reads to efficiently generate accurate genome assemblies. Our experiments show that HASLR is not only the fastest assembler but also the one with the lowest number of misassemblies on most of the samples, while being on par with other assemblers in terms of contiguity and accuracy.","2732":null,"2733":"Metamaterials have great capabilities and flexibilities in controlling electromagnetic (EM) waves because their subwavelength meta-atoms can be designed and tailored in desired ways. However, once the structure-only metamaterials (i.e., passive metamaterials) are fabricated, their functions will be fixed. To control the EM waves dynamically, active devices are integrated into the meta-atoms, yielding active metamaterials. Traditionally, the active metamaterials include tunable metamaterials and reconfigurable metamaterials, which have either small-range tunability or a few numbers of reconfigurability. Recently, a special kind of active metamaterials, digital coding and programmable metamaterials, have been presented, which can realize a large number of distinct functionalities and switch them in real time with the aid of field programmable gate array (FPGA). More importantly, the digital coding representations of metamaterials make it possible to bridge the digital world and physical world using the metamaterial platform and make the metamaterials process digital information directly, resulting in information metamaterials. In this review article, we firstly introduce the evolution of metamaterials and then present the concepts and basic principles of digital coding metamaterials and information metamaterials. With more details, we discuss a series of information metamaterial systems, including the programmable metamaterial systems, software metamaterial systems, intelligent metamaterial systems, and space-time-coding metamaterial systems.

In this perspective, we introduce the holo-omic approach that incorporates multi-omic data from both host and microbiota domains to untangle the interplay between the two. We revisit the recent literature on biomolecular host-microbe interactions and discuss the implementation and current limitations of the holo-omic approach. We anticipate that the application of this approach can contribute to opening new research avenues and discoveries in biomedicine, biotechnology, agricultural and aquacultural sciences, nature conservation, as well as basic ecological and evolutionary research.","2736":null,"2737":null,"2738":"Sense of motion, spatial orientation, and balance in vertebrates relies on sensory hair cells in the inner ear vestibular system.

Since its first report in December 2019, COVID-19 cases have exploded to over 14 million as of July 2020, claiming more than 600,000 lives. Implementing fast and widespread diagnostic tests is paramount to contain COVID-19, given the current lack of an effective therapeutic or vaccine. This review focuses on a broad description of currently available diagnostic tests to detect either the virus (SARS-CoV-2) or virus-induced immune responses. We specifically explain the working mechanisms of these tests and compare their analytical performance. These analyses will assist in selecting most effective tests for a given application, for example, epidemiology or global pandemic research, population screening, hospital-based testing, home-based and point-of-care testing, and therapeutic trials. Finally, we lay out the shortcomings of certain tests and future needs.","2740":"Traditional lignocellulosic feedstock research has focused on biomass characteristics essential for improving saccharification efficiency, yet the key biomass features underlying high-quality renewable lignin materials remain unknown. Nevertheless, modern biorefinery cannot achieve sustainability and cost-effectiveness unless the lignin stream can be valorized. We hereby addressed these scientific gaps by investigating biomass characteristics defining lignin-based carbon materials properties. Lignin from eight sorghum samples with diverse characteristics was fabricated into carbon fibers (CFs). Remarkably, only lignin uniformity was found to define CF mechanical performance, highlighting the new structure-property relationship. Contrarily, lignin content and composition did not impact on carbon material properties. Mechanistic study by XRD and Raman spectroscopy revealed that higher lignin uniformity enhanced CF microstructures, in particular, turbostratic carbon content. The study for the first time highlighted lignin uniformity as an important biomass structure determinant for renewable products, which opened up new avenues for feedstock design toward diverse products enabling sustainable and cost-effective bioeconomy.","2741":"Successful cell division involves highly regulated transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. The RNA poly(A) tail represents an important layer of RNA post-transcriptional regulation. Previous TAIL-seq analysis of S phase and M phase poly(A) tail information showed that only a small number of genes showed more than 2-fold change in their poly(A) tail length between the two cell cycle stages. In addition, the changes in poly(A) tail length between these two stages showed minimal impact on the translation of the genes as long as the poly(A) tails were longer than 20 nt. Therefore, the significance of poly(A) tail dynamics during the cell cycle remains largely unknown. Here, by re-analyzing the S phase and M phase TAIL-seq data, we uncovered an interesting global dynamics of RNA poly(A) tails in terms of their terminal modifications, implying global RNA regulation between mitotic cell cycles through poly(A) tail terminal modifications.","2742":"The difficulty of obtaining reliable individual identification of animals has limited researcher's ability to obtain quantitative data to address important ecological, behavioral, and conservation questions. Traditional marking methods placed animals at undue risk. Machine learning approaches for identifying species through analysis of animal images has been proved to be successful. But for many questions, there needs a tool to identify not only species but also individuals. Here, we introduce a system developed specifically for automated face detection and individual identification with deep learning methods using both videos and still-framed images that can be reliably used for multiple species. The system was trained and tested with a dataset containing 102,399 images of 1,040 individuals across 41 primate species whose individual identity was known and 6,562 images of 91 individuals across four carnivore species. For primates, the system correctly identified individuals 94.1% of the time and could process 31 facial images per second.","2743":null,"2744":"Oxidative\/nitrosative stress is a major trigger of cardiac dysfunction, involving the unfolded protein response and mitochondrial dysfunction. Activation of nitric oxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate-protein kinase G signaling by sildenafil improves cardiac mal-remodeling during pressure-overload-induced heart failure. Transcriptome analysis was conducted in failing hearts with or without sildenafil treatment. Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) kinase (PERK) downstream signaling pathways, EIF2 and NRF2, were significantly altered. Although EIF2 signaling was suppressed, NRF2 signaling was upregulated, inhibiting the maturation of miR 24-3p through EGFR-mediated Ago2 phosphorylation. To study the effect of sildenafil on these pathways, we generated cardiac-specific PERK knockout mice. In these mice, sildenafil could not inhibit the maturations, the nuclear translocation of NRF2 was suppressed, and mitochondrial dysfunction advanced. Altogether, these results show that PERK-mediated suppression of miRNAs by sildenafil is vital for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response.","2745":null,"2746":"As one of the most promising candidates for next-generation mobile platform, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have potential to revolutionize the ways we perceive and interact with various digital information.

Therefore, improving muscle innervation at aged NMJs may be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating the impairment. We previously demonstrated that the muscle protein Dok-7 plays an essential role in NMJ formation, and, indeed, its forced expression in muscle enlarges NMJs. Moreover, therapeutic administration of an adeno-associated virus vector encoding human Dok-7 (DOK7 gene therapy) suppressed muscle denervation and enhanced motor activity in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, we show that DOK7 gene therapy significantly enhances motor function and muscle strength together with NMJ innervation in aged mice. Furthermore, the treated mice showed greatly increased compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes compared with the controls, suggesting enhanced neuromuscular transmission. Thus, therapies aimed at enhancing NMJ innervation have potential for treating age-related motor impairment.","2750":null,"2751":"We presented one eye with a monocular-boundary-contour (MBC) square, created by phase-shifting a central region of grating relative to a larger uniform grating surround, and the fellow eye with the larger uniform grating.

Despite this, we found the lower contrast MBC region dominated the perceived cyclopean contrast, with the corresponding region in the fellow eye being suppressed. Secondly, we found for dichoptic stimuli with half-images having square grating regions of different BC strengths, the interocular BC strength ratio determined the perceived contrast of the cyclopean square. Thirdly, we found perceived spatial phase of the cyclopean square was dominated by the spatial phase of the MBC half-image.

Herein, we report a decoupling strategy using dual cocatalysts to tackle the challenge based on joint computational and experimental investigations. Density functional theory calculations indicate the optimization of syngas generation using a combination of fundamentally distinctive catalytic sites. Experimentally, by integrating spatially separated dual cocatalysts of a CO-generating catalyst and a H2-generating catalyst with GaN nanowires on planar Si photocathode, we report a record high applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 1.88% and controllable syngas products with tunable CO\/H2 ratios (0-10) under one-sun illumination.

However, molecular mechanisms controlling innate versus adaptive B cell function are poorly understood. N-glycan branching, via interactions with galectins, controls endocytosis and signaling of cell surface receptors to control cell function. Here we report that N-glycan branching in B cells dose dependently reduces pro-inflammatory innate responses by titrating decreases in Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and TLR2 surface expression via endocytosis. In contrast, a minimal level of N-glycan branching maximizes surface retention of the B cell receptor (BCR) and the CD19 co-receptor to promote adaptive immunity. Branched N-glycans inhibit antigen presentation by B cells to reduce T helper cell-17 (TH17)\/TH1 differentiation and inflammatory demyelination in mice. Thus, N-glycan branching negatively regulates B cell innate function while promoting\/maintaining adaptive immunity via BCR, providing an attractive therapeutic target for MS.","2756":"Water splitting with sunlight is today one of the most promising strategies that can be used to start the imperatively needed transition from fossil to solar fuels. To achieve this, one of the key reactions that need to be mastered is the electrocatalytic oxidation of water to dioxygen.

The intrinsic chemistry of first row transition metals and in particular the lability of their M-L bonds in water imposes serious challenges for the latter to work as real molecular catalysts.

We found that organoids embedded in a dome-shaped hydrogel show significant size heterogeneity in different locations inside the hydrogel. Computational simulations revealed that the instability and diffusion limitation of Wnt3a constitutively generate a concentration gradient inside the hydrogel. The location-dependent heterogeneity of organoids in a hydrogel dome substantially perturbed the transcriptome profile associated with epithelial functions, cytodifferentiation including mucin 2 expression, and morphological characteristics. This heterogeneous phenotype was significantly mitigated when the Wnt3a was frequently replenished in the culture medium. Our finding suggests that the morphological, transcriptional, translational, and functional heterogeneity in conventional organoid cultures may lead to a false interpretation of the experimental results in organoid-based studies.","2758":"Plastic pollution is entering the world's oceans at alarming rates and is expected to outweigh fish populations by 2050. This plastic waste originates from land-based applications, like consumer product packaging, and is composed of high-durability polyolefins. These conventional plastics possess desirable properties, including high chemical stability, moisture barrier, and thermoplastic characteristics. Unfortunately, if these materials reach marine environments, they fragment into microplastics that cannot be biologically assimilated. The aim of this review is to investigate commercial polymers that are biodegradable in marine environments but have comparable product stability and moisture barrier properties to polyolefins. Among commercially available biopolymers, thermoplastic starches (TPS) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been shown to biodegrade in marine environments. Moreover, these biopolymers are thermoplastics and possess similar thermoforming properties to polyolefins. At present, TPS and PHAs have limitations, including chemical instability, limited moisture barrier properties, and high production costs. To replace conventional polymers with PHAs and TPS, these properties must be improved.","2759":null,"2760":"","2761":"Cell membranes often contain domains with important physiological functions. A typical example are neuronal synapses, whose capacity to capture receptors for neurotransmitters is central to neuronal functions. Receptors diffuse in the membrane until they are stabilized by interactions with stable elements, the scaffold. Single particle tracking experiments demonstrated that these interactions are rather weak and that lateral diffusion is strongly impaired in the post-synaptic membrane due to molecular crowding. We investigated how the distribution of scaffolding molecules and molecular crowding affect the capture of receptors. In particle-based Monte Carlo simulations, based on experimental data of molecular diffusion and organization, crowding enhanced the receptor-scaffold interaction but reduced the capture of new molecules. The distribution of scaffolding sites in several clusters reduced crowding and fostered the exchange of molecules accelerating synaptic plasticity. Synapses could switch between two regimes, becoming more stable or more plastic depending on the internal distribution of molecules.","2762":null,"2763":null,"2764":null,"2765":null,"2766":"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spillover infection in December 2019 has caused an unprecedented pandemic.

Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution protein network across 1,671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vasodilators. These drugs are expected to perturb the ACE2 network affecting infectivity as well as the pathophysiology of the disease.","2767":"Cell reprogramming has revolutionized cell and regenerative biology field. However, human iPS derivation remains inefficient and variable. A better knowledge of molecular processes and the rationale underlying the importance of somatic cell origin is crucial to uncover reprogramming mechanisms. Here, we analyze the molecular profile of different human somatic cell types. We show menstrual blood-derived stromal cells (MnSCs) have a distinct, reprogramming prone, profile, and we identify SOX15 from their oocyte-related signature as a prominent responsible candidate. SOX15 orchestrates an efficient oocyte-based reprogramming combination when overexpressed with the also oocyte-enriched histone chaperone ASF1A and OCT4 and, through specific mechanism, generates iPSCs with distinguishable pluripotent state that further present higher differentiation capacity than canonical iPSCs. Our work supports the presence of different pluripotency states in reprogramming and the importance of using metaphase-II oocyte and MnSCs information to provide alternative reprogramming combinations and, importantly, to improve and understand pluripotency acquisition.","2768":"Previous studies indicate that motor sampling patterns modulate neuronal excitability in sensory brain regions by entraining brain rhythms, a process termed motor-initiated entrainment. In addition, rhythms of the external environment are also capable of entraining brain rhythms. Our first goal was to investigate the properties of motor-initiated entrainment in the auditory system using a prominent visual motor sampling pattern in primates, saccades. Second, we wanted to determine whether\/how motor-initiated entrainment interacts with visual environmental entrainment. We examined laminar profiles of neuronal ensemble activity in primary auditory cortex and found that whereas motor-initiated entrainment has a suppressive effect, visual environmental entrainment has an enhancive effect. We also found that these processes are temporally coupled, and their temporal relationship ensures that their effect on excitability is complementary rather than interfering. Altogether, our results demonstrate that motor and sensory systems continuously interact in orchestrating the brain's context for the optimal sampling of our multisensory environment.","2769":"Cancer has deep evolutionary roots and is an important source of selective pressure in organismal evolution. Yet, we find a great deal of variation in cancer vulnerabilities across the tree of life. Comparative oncology offers insights into why some species vary in their susceptibility to cancer and the mechanisms responsible for the diversity of cancer defenses. Here we provide an overview for why cancer persists across the tree of life. We then summarize current data on cancer in mammals, reptiles, and birds in comparison with commonly reported human cancers. We report on both novel and shared mechanisms of cancer protection in animals. Cross-discipline collaborations, including zoological and aquarium institutions, wildlife and evolutionary biologists, veterinarians, medical doctors, cancer biologists, and oncologists, will be essential for progress in the field of comparative oncology. Improving medical treatment of humans and animals with cancer is the ultimate promise of comparative oncology.","2770":"This study shows that multiple modes of mitochondrial stress generated by partial mtDNA depletion or cytochrome c oxidase disruption cause ryanodine receptor channel (RyR) dysregulation, which instigates the release of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of C2C12 myoblasts and HCT116 carcinoma cells. We also observed a reciprocal downregulation of IP3R channel activity and reduced mitochondrial uptake of Ca2+. Ryanodine, an RyR antagonist, abrogated the mitochondrial stress-mediated increase in [Ca2+]c and the entire downstream signaling cascades of mitochondrial retrograde signaling. Interestingly, ryanodine also inhibited mitochondrial stress-induced invasive behavior in mtDNA-depleted C2C12 cells and HCT116 carcinoma cells. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation shows reduced FKBP12 protein binding to RyR channel proteins, suggesting the altered function of the Ca2+ channel. These results document how the endoplasmic reticulum-associated RyR channels, in combination with inhibition of the mitochondrial uniporter system, modulate cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and signaling under mitochondrial stress conditions.","2771":"Metamaterials analog of electromagnetically induced reflectance (EIR) has attracted intense attentions since they can provide various applications for novel photonic devices such as optical detectors with a high sensitivity and slow-light devices with a low loss. The development of dynamic photonic devices desires a tunable EIR feature in metamaterials. However, most metamaterials-induced EIR is not spectrally controllable particularly for the near-infrared (NIR) region. Herein, a tuning of EIR is illustrated in Babinet chalcogenide metamaterials in the NIR region. The EIR response is created by weak hybridization of two dipolar (bright) modes of the paired Au slots. Such a mode interference can be engineered through non-volatile phase transition to the refractive index of the Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), resulting in an active controlling of the reflection window. A 15% spectral tuning of the reflectance peak is observed experimentally in the NIR region as switching the GST state between amorphous and crystalline.","2772":null,"2773":"Dopaminergic (DA) neurons have been implicated as key targets in neurological disorders, notably those involving locomotor impairment, and are considered to be highly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction, a common feature of such diseases. Here we investigated a Drosophila model of locomotor disorders in which functional impairment is brought about by pan-neuronal RNAi knockdown of subunit COX7A of cytochrome oxidase (COX). Despite minimal neuronal loss by apoptosis, the expression and activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was decreased by half. Surprisingly, COX7A knockdown specifically targeted to DA neurons did not produce locomotor defect. Instead, using various drivers, we found that COX7A knockdown in specific groups of cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons underlay the phenotype. Based on our main finding, the vulnerability of DA neurons to mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of impaired locomotion in other organisms, including mammals, warrants detailed investigation.","2774":"Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an upcoming technology to harvest energy from ambient movements. A major focus herein is harvesting energy from human movements through wearable TENGs, which are constructed by integrating nanogenerators into clothing or accessories. Textile-based TENGs, which include fiber, yarn, and fabric-based TENG structures, account for the majority of wearable TENGs, with many designs and applications demonstrated recently. This calls for a comprehensive analysis of textile-based TENG technology, and how the state-of-the-art device optimization concepts can be deployed to construct them efficiently. Concurrently, how advanced engineering concepts and industrial manufacturing techniques, which are bound with fiber, yarn, and fabric-related developments, can be applied into the TENG context for their output enhancement is still under investigation. Herein, we fill this vital gap by analyzing the state-of-the-art developments, upcoming trends, output optimization strategies, scalability, and prospects of the textile-based TENG technology, presenting a textile engineering perspective.","2775":"Plants have been used in cosmetic products since ancient times and are the subject of scientific investigation even nowadays. During the years, a deeper understanding of both the behavior of skin and of plants have become available drawing increasingly complex pictures. Plants are complex organisms that produce different metabolites responding to the environment they live in. Applied to the skin, phytomolecules interact with skin cells and affect the skin well-being and appearance. Ethnobotanical studies on the one hand and physico-chemical analyses on the other have pictured a rich inventory of plants with potential to enrich modern cosmetic products.","2776":"","2777":"Cyclin E is a key factor for S phase entry, and deregulation of Cyclin E results in developmental defects and tumors. Therefore, proper cycling of Cyclin E is crucial for normal growth. Here we found that transcription factors Apontic (Apt) and E2f1 cooperate to induce cyclin E in Drosophila. Functional binding motifs of Apt and E2f1 are clustered in the first intron of Drosophila cyclin E and directly contribute to the cyclin E transcription. Knockout of apt and e2f1 together abolished Cyclin E expression. Furthermore, Apt up-regulates Retinoblastoma family protein 1 (Rbf1) for proper chromatin compaction, which is known to repress cyclin E. Notably, Apt-dependent up-regulation of Cyclin E and Rbf1 is evolutionarily conserved in mammalian cells. Our findings reveal a unique mechanism underlying the induction and subsequent decline of Cyclin E expression.","2778":"Glioblastoma is the most common and deadly primary brain malignancy. Despite advances in precision medicine oncology (PMO) allowing the identification of molecular vulnerabilities in glioblastoma, treatment options remain limited, and molecular assays guided by genomic and expression profiling to inform patient enrollment in life-saving trials are lacking. Here, we generate four-dimensional (4D) cell-culture arrays for rapid assessment of drug responses in glioblastoma patient-derived models. The arrays are 3D printed with thermo-responsive shape memory polymer (SMP). Upon heating, the SMP arrays self-transform in time from 3D cell-culture inserts into histological cassettes. We assess the utility of these arrays with glioblastoma cells, gliospheres, and patient derived organoid-like (PDO) models and demonstrate their use with glioblastoma PDOs for assessing drug sensitivity, on-target activity, and synergy in drug combinations. When including genomic and drug testing assays, this platform is poised to offer rapid functional drug assessments for future selection of therapies in PMO.","2779":"Odor perception in humans is initiated by activation of odorant receptors (ORs) in the nose. However, the ORs linked to specific olfactory percepts are unknown, unlike in vision or taste where receptors are linked to perception of different colors and tastes. The large family of ORs (~400) and multiple receptors activated by an odorant present serious challenges. Here, we first use machine learning to screen ~0.5 million compounds for new ligands and identify enriched structural motifs for ligands of 34 human ORs. We next demonstrate that the activity of ORs successfully predicts many of the 146 different perceptual qualities of chemicals. Although chemical features have been used to model odor percepts, we show that biologically relevant OR activity is often superior. Interestingly, each odor percept could be predicted with very few ORs, implying they contribute more to each olfactory percept. A similar model is observed in Drosophila where comprehensive OR-neuron data are available.","2780":null,"2781":null,"2782":null,"2783":null,"2784":"The immune system is a complex biological network composed of hierarchically organized genes, proteins, and cellular components that combat external pathogens and monitor the onset of internal disease. To meet and ultimately defeat these challenges, the immune system orchestrates an exquisitely complex interplay of numerous cells, often with highly specialized functions, in a tissue-specific manner. One of the major methodologies of systems immunology is to measure quantitatively the components and interaction levels in the immunologic networks to construct a computational network and predict the response of the components to perturbations. The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing techniques have provided us with a powerful approach to dissecting the complexity of the immune system. Here we summarize the latest progress in integrating omics data and network approaches to construct networks and to infer the underlying signaling and transcriptional landscape, as well as cell-cell communication, in the immune system, with a focus on hematopoiesis, adaptive immunity, and tumor immunology. Understanding the network regulation of immune cells has provided new insights into immune homeostasis and disease, with important therapeutic implications for inflammation, cancer, and other immune-mediated disorders.","2785":"Malignant tumors exhibit high degrees of genomic heterogeneity at the cellular level, leading to the view that subpopulations of tumor cells drive growth and treatment resistance. To examine the degree to which tumors also exhibit metabolic heterogeneity at the level of individual cells, we employed multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry (MIMS) to quantify utilization of stable isotopes of glucose and glutamine along with a label for cell division. Mouse models of melanoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) exhibited striking heterogeneity of substrate utilization, evident in both proliferating and non-proliferating cells. We identified a correlation between metabolic heterogeneity, proliferation, and therapeutic resistance. Heterogeneity in metabolic substrate usage as revealed by incorporation of glucose and glutamine tracers is thus a marker for tumor proliferation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that MIMS provides a powerful tool with which to dissect metabolic functions of individual cells within the native tumor environment.","2786":"Phosphorylation sites often have key regulatory functions and are central to many cellular signaling pathways, so mutations that modify them have the potential to contribute to pathological states such as cancer. Although many classifiers exist for prioritization of coding genomic variants, to our knowledge none of them explicitly account for the alteration or creation of kinase recognition motifs that alter protein structure, function, regulation of activity, and interaction networks through modifying the pattern of phosphorylation. We present a novel computational pipeline that uses a random forest classifier to predict the pathogenicity of a variant, according to its direct or indirect effect on local phosphorylation sites and the predicted functional impact of perturbing a phosphorylation event. We call this classifier PhosphoEffect and find that it compares favorably and with increased accuracy to the existing classifier PolyPhen 2.2.2 when tested on a dataset of known variants enriched for phosphorylation sites and their neighbors.","2787":"Regular physical activity improves physical and mental health. Here we found that the effect of physical activity extends to the next generation. Voluntary wheel running of dams, from postpartum day 2 to weaning, increased the social dominance and reproductive success, but not the physical\/metabolic health, of their otherwise sedentary offspring. The individual's own physical activity did not improve dominance status. Maternal exercise did not disrupt maternal care or the maternal and offspring microbiota. Rather, the development of dominance behavior in the offspring of running mothers could be explained by the reduction of LIF, CXCL1, and CXCL2 cytokines in breast milk. These data reveal a cytokine-mediated lactocrine pathway that responds to the mother's postpartum physical activity and programs offspring social dominance. As dominance behaviors are highly relevant to the individual's survival and reproduction, lactocrine programming could be an evolutionary mechanism by which a mother promotes the social rank of her offspring.","2788":"Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has remarkably been increased from 3.1% to 25.2%. The fast expansion of the PSCs has been along with the development of compositional and interface engineering, which has been playing a critical role. For the PSCs with record high-efficiency and stability, the perovskite absorber layer has been changed from the initial MAPbI3- to FAPbI3-based compositions. Owing to the enormous engineering works, perovskite absorber layers with monolithic grains could be achieved, in which the interior defects are negligible compared with the surface defects. Therefore, interface engineering, which can passivate the surface defects and\/or isolate the perovskite from the environmental moistures, has been playing a more and more important role to further boost the PCE and stability of the PSCs. Herein, a compact review study of the compositional and interface engineering is presented and promising strategies and directions of the PSCs are discussed.","2789":null,"2790":"","2791":"The highly reversible zinc-bromine redox couple has been successfully applied in the zinc-bromine flow batteries; however, non-electroactive pump\/pipe\/reservoir parts and ion-selective membranes are essential to suppress the bromine diffusion. This work demonstrates a zinc-bromine static (non-flow) battery without these auxiliary parts and utilizing glass fiber separator, which overcomes the high self-discharge rate and low energy efficiency while the advantages of the zinc-bromine chemistry are well preserved. It is achieved by a multifunctional additive, tetrapropylammonium bromide (TPABr), which not only mitigates the bromine cross-diffusion by regulating the fluidic bromine to a condensed solid phase but also provides a favorable interface for zinc electrodeposition toward non-dendritic growth. The proposed zinc-bromine static battery demonstrates a high specific energy of 142 Wh kg-1 with a high energy efficiency up to 94%. By optimizing the porous electrode architecture, the battery shows an ultra-stable cycling life for over 11,000 cycles with controlled self-discharge rate.","2792":"Adhesive hydrogels containing catechol moieties have many important applications, but the fabrication of effective long-lasting adhesive hydrogels remains a challenge because of oxidative damage. Inspired by the traditional use of quercetin in ancient China, here, we have developed a novel method, based on quercetin-assisted photoradical chemistry, to fabricate a durable adhesive hydrogel, Q-hydrogel. In the presence of light, quercetin generates quinone\/semiquinone radicals, which subsequently interact with ammonium persulfate (APS) to produce a large amount of free radicals and initiate polymerization of the hydrogel. As-prepared Q-hydrogel showed good mechanical and adhesive properties, which were attributed to the inherent structural advantages of quercetin. Because of the resistance of quercetin to oxidation, as-prepared Q-hydrogel also showed good adhesive properties even after treatment with oxidizing agents. Capitalizing on its conductivity and adhesive properties, Q-hydrogel was successfully used to produce wearable sensors capable of detecting human motion.","2793":null,"2794":null,"2795":"","2796":null,"2797":null,"2798":null,"2799":null,"2800":"Precise regulation of innate immunity is crucial for development of appropriate host immunity against microbial infections and maintenance of immune homeostasis. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs, post-transcriptional regulator of multiple genes, and act as a rheostat for protein expression. Here, we identified microRNA-30e-5p induced by hepatitis B virus and other viruses that act as a master regulator for innate immunity. Moreover, pegylated interferons treatment of patients with HBV for viral reduction also reduces miRNA. Additionally, we have also shown the immuno-pathological effects of miR-30e in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mouse model. Mechanistically, miR-30e targets multiple negative regulators of innate immune signaling and enhances immune responses. Furthermore, sequestering of miR-30e in patients with SLE and mouse model significantly reduces type-I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Collectively, our study demonstrates the novel role of miR-30e in innate immunity and its prognostic and therapeutic potential in infectious and autoimmune diseases.","2801":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are stable non-coding RNAs with a closed circular structure. One of the best studied circRNAs is ciRS-7 (CDR1as), which acts as a regulator of the microRNA miR-7; however, its biosynthetic pathway has remained an enigma. Here we delineate the biosynthetic pathway of ciRS-7. The back-splicing events that form circRNAs are often facilitated by flanking inverted repeats of the primate-specific Alu elements. The ciRS-7 gene lacks these elements, but, instead, we identified a set of flanking inverted elements belonging to the mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR) family. Splicing reporter assays in HEK293 cells demonstrated that these inverted MIRs are required to generate ciRS-7 through back-splicing, and CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated deletions confirmed the requirement of the endogenous MIR elements in SH-SY5Y cells. Using bioinformatic searches, we identified several other MIR-dependent circRNAs and confirmed them experimentally. We propose that MIR-mediated RNA circularization is used to generate a subset of mammalian circRNAs.","2802":"The substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) are vital for the control of movement, goal-directed behavior, and encoding reward. Here we show that the firing of specific neuronal subtypes in these nuclei can be modulated by physiological changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2). The resting conductance of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons in young animals (postnatal days 7-10) and GABAergic neurons in the VTA is modulated by changes in the level of CO2. We provide several lines of evidence that this CO2-sensitive conductance results from connexin 26 (Cx26) hemichannel expression. Since the levels of PCO2 in the blood will vary depending on physiological activity and pathology, this suggests that changes in PCO2 could potentially modulate motor activity, reward behavior, and wakefulness.","2803":null,"2804":null,"2805":null,"2806":null,"2807":null,"2808":"Plant metabolism is broadly reprogrammed during acclimation to abiotic changes. Most previous studies have focused on transitions from standard to single stressful conditions. Here, we systematically analyze acclimation processes to levels of light, heat, and cold stress that subtly alter physiological parameters and assess their reversibility during de-acclimation. Metabolome and transcriptome changes were monitored at 11 different time points. Unlike transcriptome changes, most alterations in metabolite levels did not readily return to baseline values, except in the case of cold acclimation. Similar regulatory networks operate during (de-)acclimation to high light and cold, whereas heat and high-light responses exhibit similar dynamics, as determined by surprisal and conditional network analyses. In all acclimation models tested here, super-hubs in conditional transcriptome networks are enriched for components involved in translation, particularly ribosomes. Hence, we suggest that the ribosome serves as a common central hub for the control of three different (de-)acclimation responses.","2809":null,"2810":"Fibronectin intrabodies generated with mRNA display (FingRs) are a recently developed tool for labeling excitatory or inhibitory synapses, with the benefit of not altering endogenous synaptic protein expression levels or synaptic transmission. Here, we generated a viral vector FingR toolbox that allows for multi-color, neuron-type-specific labeling of excitatory or inhibitory synapses in multiple brain regions. We screened various fluorophores, FingR fusion configurations, and transcriptional control regulations in adeno-associated virus (AAV) and retrovirus vector designs. We report the development of a red FingR variant and demonstrated dual labeling of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the same cells. Furthermore, we developed cre-inducible FingR AAV variants and demonstrated their utility, finding that the density of inhibitory synapses in aspiny striatal cholinergic interneurons remained unchanged in response to dopamine depletion. Finally, we generated FingR retroviral vectors, which enabled us to track the development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in hippocampal adult-born granule cells.","2811":null,"2812":null,"2813":null,"2814":"Somatic plant cells can regenerate shoots and\/or roots or adventitious embryonic calluses, which may induce organ formation under certain conditions. Such regenerations occur via dedifferentiation of somatic cells, induction of organs, and their subsequent outgrowth. Despite recent advances in understanding of plant regeneration, many details of shoot induction remain unclear. Here, we artificially induced shoot stem-like green organs (SSOs) in Arabidopsis thaliana roots via simultaneous induction of two transcription factors (TFs), ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 25 (ATHB25, At5g65410) and the B3 family transcription factor REPRODUCTIVE MERISTEM 7 (REM7, At3g18960). The SSOs exhibited negative gravitropism and differentiated vascular bundle phenotypes. The ATHB25\/REM7 induced the expression of genes controlling shoot stem characteristics by ectopic expression in roots. Intriguingly, the restoration of root growth was seen in the consecutive and adjacent parts of the SSOs under gene induction conditions. Our findings thus provide insights into the development and regeneration of plant shoot stems.","2815":"Recently, the environmental impacts of microplastics have received extensive attention owing to their accumulation in the environment. However, developing efficient technology for the control and purification of microplastics is still a big challenge. Herein, we investigated the photocatalytic degradation of typical microplastics such as polystyrene (PS) microspheres and polyethylene (PE) over TiO2 nanoparticle films under UV light irradiation. TiO2 nanoparticle film made with Triton X-100 showed complete mineralization (98.40%) of 400-nm PS in 12 h, while degradation for varying sizes of PS was also studied. PE degradation experiment presented a high photodegradation rate after 36 h. CO2 was found as the main end product. The degradation mechanism and intermediates were studied by in situ DRIFTS and HPPI-TOFMS, showing the generation of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and carbon-hydrogen groups during the photodegradation of PS. This study provides a green and cost-efficient strategy for the control of microplastics contamination in the environment.","2816":"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) recognize consensus sequences and regulate specific target mRNAs. However, large-scale CLIP-seq revealed loose and broad binding of RBPs to larger proportion of expressed mRNAs: e.g. SFPQ binds to &gt;10,000 pre-mRNAs but distinctly regulates &lt;200 target genes during neuronal development. Identification of crucial binding for regulation and rules of target recognition is highly anticipated for systemic understanding of RBP regulations. For a breakthrough solution, we developed a bioinformatical method for CLIP-seq and transcriptome data by adopting iterative hypothesis testing. Essential binding was successfully identified in C-rich sequences close to the 5' splice sites of long introns, which further proposed target recognition mechanism via association between SFPQ and splicing factors during spliceosome assembly. The identified features of functional binding enabled us to predict regulons and also target genes in different species. This multilateral bioinformatics approach facilitates the elucidation of functionality, regulatory mechanism, and regulatory networks of RBPs.","2817":null,"2818":"Methylation is envisioned as a promising way to rationally improve key pharmacokinetic characteristics of lead compounds. Although diverse tailoring enzymes are found to be clustered with cyclodipeptide synthases (CDPSs) to perform further modification reactions on the diketopiperazine (DKP) rings generating complex DKP-containing compounds, so far, a limited number of methyltransferases (MTs) co-occurring with CDPS have been experimentally characterized. Herein, we deciphered the methylation steps during drimentines (DMTs) biosynthesis with identification and characterization of DmtMT2-1 (from Streptomyces sp. NRRL F-5123) and DmtMT1 (from Streptomyces youssoufiensis OUC6819). DmtMT2-1 catalyzes N4-methylation of both pre-DMTs and DMTs; conversely, DmtMT1 recognizes the DKP rings, functioning before the assembly of the terpene moiety. Notably, both MTs display broad substrate promiscuity. Their combinatorial expression with the dmt1 genes in different Streptomyces strains successfully generated eight unnatural DMT analogs. Our results enriched the MT tool-box, setting the stage for exploring the structural diversity of DKP derivatives for drug development.","2819":null,"2820":"Skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to modulate its mass in response to changes in nutritional input, functional utilization, systemic disease, and age. This is achieved by the coordination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional networks and the signaling cascades balancing anabolic and catabolic processes with energy and nutrient availability. The extent to which alternative splicing regulates these signaling networks is uncertain. Here we investigate the role of the RNA-binding protein hnRNP-U on the expression and splicing of genes and the signaling processes regulating skeletal muscle hypertrophic growth. Muscle-specific Hnrnpu knockout (mKO) mice develop an adult-onset myopathy characterized by the selective atrophy of glycolytic muscle, the constitutive activation of Akt, increases in cellular and metabolic stress gene expression, and changes in the expression and splicing of metabolic and signal transduction genes. These findings link Hnrnpu with the balance between anabolic signaling, cellular and metabolic stress, and physiological growth.","2821":"Optimization of the 3D battery architecture is crucial to improve the performance of microbatteries. However, such optimization is difficult and time consuming by hand for even experts. In this article, we propose a battery optimization system, which consists of an automatic geometry generator and performance simulators. The geometry generator creates feasible 3D batteries without using any human intuition and experience for the spatial arrangement of positive and negative electrodes. For quick evaluation of the internal resistance, which relates power and energy densities, we propose the transmission line model, the so-called 3D porous electrode model, as one of the performance simulators. To show the effectiveness of the optimization system, we designed the lithium-ion microbatteries. In the trade-off frontier for the internal resistance and the capacity, we successfully found a new battery architecture that has higher power and energy densities over the conventional interdigitated plates configuration.","2822":"Lactate shuttled from blood, astrocytes, and\/or oligodendrocytes may serve as the major glucose alternative in brain energy metabolism. However, its effectiveness in fueling neuronal information processing underlying complex cortex functions like perception and memory is unclear. We show that sole lactate disturbs electrical gamma and theta-gamma oscillations in hippocampal networks by either attenuation or neural bursts. Bursting is suppressed by elevating the glucose fraction in substrate supply. By contrast, lactate does not affect electrical sharp wave-ripple activity featuring lower energy use. Lactate increases the oxygen consumption during the network states, reflecting enhanced oxidative ATP synthesis in mitochondria. Finally, lactate attenuates synaptic transmission in excitatory pyramidal cells and fast-spiking, inhibitory interneurons by reduced neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals, whereas action potential generation in the axon is regular. In conclusion, sole lactate is less effective and potentially harmful during gamma-band rhythms by omitting obligatory ATP delivery through fast glycolysis at the synapse.","2823":"We present here PhotoGal4, a phytochrome B-based optogenetic switch for fine-tuned spatiotemporal control of gene expression in Drosophila explants. This switch integrates the light-dependent interaction between phytochrome B and PIF6 from plants with regulatory elements from the yeast Gal4\/UAS system. We found that PhotoGal4 efficiently activates and deactivates gene expression upon red- or far-red-light irradiation, respectively. In addition, this optogenetic tool reacts to different illumination conditions, allowing for fine modulation of the light-dependent response. Importantly, by simply focusing a laser beam, PhotoGal4 induces intricate patterns of expression in a customized manner. For instance, we successfully sketched personalized patterns of GFP fluorescence such as emoji-like shapes or letterform logos in Drosophila explants, which illustrates the exquisite precision and versatility of this tool. Hence, we anticipate that PhotoGal4 will expand the powerful Drosophila toolbox and will provide a new avenue to investigate intricate and complex problems in biomedical research.","2824":"The accumulation of giant lipid droplets (LDs) increases the risk of metabolic disorders including obesity and insulin resistance. The lipolysis process involves the activation and transfer of lipase, but the molecular mechanism is not completely understood. The translocation of ATGL, a critical lipolysis lipase, from the ER to the LD surface is mediated by an energy catabolism complex. Oxysterol-binding protein-like 2 (OSBPL2\/ORP2) is one of the lipid transfer proteins that regulates intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. A recent study has proven that Osbpl2-\/- pigs exhibit hypercholesterolemia and obesity phenotypes with an increase in adipocytes. In this study, we identified that OSBPL2 links the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with LDs, binds to COPB1, and mediates ATGL transport. We provide important insights into the function of OSBPL2, indicating that it is required for the regulation of lipid droplet lipolysis.","2825":null,"2826":"In most Papilio species, a younger larva mimics bird droppings but changes its pattern to match host plant colors in its final instar. This change is determined by juvenile hormone (JH) during the JH-sensitive period (JHSP) early in the fourth instar. Recently, we found that homeobox genes control the pre-pattern formation specifically during JHSP, but the molecular mechanisms underlying final patterning and pigmentation at molt are unknown. By knockdown of Delta and Notch in Papilio xuthus larvae, we here showed that these genes define the edge and pigmentation area in final patterns, during and even after JHSP, suggesting that they bridge the JHSP and molt. Knockdown of Delta in Papilio machaon led to similar phenotypic changes, and knockdown of Notch caused pigmentation loss in twin spots of the silkworm Multilunar (L) mutant. Our findings suggest the importance of the Notch signaling pathway in caterpillars' adaptive evolution of color pattern formation.","2827":null,"2828":"Cross-coupling reactions between aryl iodide and nucleophiles have been well developed. Iodoniums equipped with a reactive C-I(III) bond accelerate cross-coupling reactions of aryl iodide. Among them, cyclic diaryliodoniums are more atom economical; however; they are often in the trap of metal reliance and encounter regioselectivity issues. Now, we have developed a series of highly reactive cyclic monoaryl-vinyl iodoniums that can be tuned to construct C-N, C-O, and C-C bonds without metal catalysis. Under promotion of triethylamine, coupling reactions with aniline, phenol, aromatic acid, and indole proceed rapidly and regioselectively at room temperature. The carbene species is conceptualized as a key intermediate in our mechanism model. Furthermore, the coupling products enable diversity-oriented synthesis strategy to further build up a chemical library of diverse heterocyclic fragments that are in demand in the drug discovery field.

Through a genome-wide siRNA screen combined with RNA sequencing analysis, we identified hexokinase and downstream O-GlcNAcylation as cell survival factors under proteasome impairment. The inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation synergistically induced massive cell death in combination with proteasome inhibition. We further demonstrated that O-GlcNAcylation was indispensable for maintaining proteasome activity by enhancing biogenesis as well as proteasome degradation in a manner independent of Nrf1, a well-known compensatory transcription factor that upregulates proteasome gene expression. Our results identify a pathway that maintains proteasome function under proteasome impairment, providing potential targets for cancer therapy.","2831":null,"2832":null,"2833":null,"2834":"Complex interactions between mRNAs and microRNAs influence cellular functions. The mRNA-microRNA interactions also determine the post-transcriptional availability of mRNAs and unbound microRNAs.

In this study, we leveraged MREs and their frequencies in cancer and matched normal tissues to obtain insights into disease-specific interactions between mRNAs and microRNAs. We developed a bioinformatics method \"ReMIx\" that utilizes RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data to quantify MRE frequencies across the transcriptome. We applied ReMIx to triple-negative (TN) breast cancer tumor-normal adjacent pairs and identified MREs specific to TN tumors. ReMIx identified candidate mRNAs and microRNAs in the MAPK signaling cascade. Further analysis of MAPK gene regulatory networks revealed microRNA partners that influence and modulate MAPK signaling. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel method of using MREs in the identification of functionally relevant mRNA-microRNA interactions in TN breast cancer.","2835":"Elucidating fine architectures and functions of cellular and synaptic connections requires development of new flexible methods. Here, we created a concept called the \"battle of transgenes,\" based on which we generated strategies using genetically engineered battles of multiple recombinases. The strategies enabled split-tunable allocation of multiple transgenes. We demonstrated the versatility of these strategies and technologies in inducing strong and multi-sparse allocations of multiple transgenes. Furthermore, the combination of our transgenic strategy and expansion microscopy enabled three-dimensional high-resolution imaging of whole synaptic structures in the hippocampus with simultaneous visualizations of endogenous synaptic proteins. These strategies and technologies based on the battle of genes may accelerate the analysis of whole synaptic and cellular connections in diverse life science fields.","2836":"Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes), the specialized translational machinery for mitochondrial genes, exclusively encode the subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Although OXPHOS dysfunctions are associated with hepatic disorders including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), their underlying mechanisms remain poorly elucidated. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of mitoribosome defects on OXPHOS and HCC progression. By generating a gene signature from HCC transcriptome data, we developed a scoring system, i.e., mitoribosome defect score (MDS), which represents the degree of mitoribosomal defects in cancers. The MDS showed close associations with the clinical outcomes of patients with HCC and with gene functions such as oxidative phosphorylation, cell-cycle activation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. By analyzing immune profiles, we observed that mitoribosomal defects are also associated with immunosuppression and evasion. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the roles of mitoribosome defects in HCC progression.","2837":"Tool use is a striking aspect of animal behavior, but it is hard to infer how the capacity for different types of tool use emerged across animal taxa. Here we address this question with HyperTraPS, a statistical approach that uses contemporary observations to infer the likely orderings in which different types of tool use (digging, reaching, and more) were historically acquired. Strikingly, despite differences linked to environment and family, many similarities in these appear across animal taxa, suggesting some universality in the process of tool use acquisition across different animals and environments. Four broad classes of tool use are supported, progressing from simple object manipulations (acquired relatively early) to more complex interactions and abstractions (acquired relatively late or not at all). This data-driven, comparative approach supports existing and suggests new mechanistic hypotheses, predicts future and possible unobserved behaviors, and sheds light on patterns of tool use emergence across animals.","2838":"The inheritance of the midbody remnant (MBR) breaks the symmetry of the two daughter cells, with functional consequences for lumen and primary cilium formation by polarized epithelial cells, and also for development and differentiation. However, despite its importance, neither the relationship between the plasma membrane and the inherited MBR nor the mechanism of MBR inheritance is well known. Here, the analysis by correlative light and ultra-high-resolution scanning electron microscopy reveals a membranous stalk that physically connects the MBR to the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The stalk, which derives from the uncleaved side of the midbody, concentrates the ESCRT machinery. The ESCRT CHMP4C subunit enables MBR inheritance, and its depletion dramatically reduces the percentage of ciliated cells. We demonstrate (1) that MBRs are physically connected to the plasma membrane, (2) how CHMP4C helps maintain the integrity of the connection, and (3) the functional importance of the connection.","2839":null,"2840":"As one of the most extensively cultivated crops, maize (Zea mays L.) has been extensively studied by researchers and breeders for over a century. With advances in high-throughput detection of various omics data, a wealth of multi-dimensional and multi-omics information has been accumulated for maize and its wild relative, teosinte. Integration of this information has the potential to accelerate genetic research and generate improvements in maize agronomic traits. To this end, we constructed ZEAMAP, a comprehensive database incorporating multiple reference genomes, annotations, comparative genomics, transcriptomes, open chromatin regions, chromatin interactions, high-quality genetic variants, phenotypes, metabolomics, genetic maps, genetic mapping loci, population structures, and populational DNA methylation signals within maize inbred lines. ZEAMAP is user friendly, with the ability to interactively integrate, visualize, and cross-reference multiple different omics datasets.","2841":null,"2842":null,"2843":"Metastasis is the leading cause of death for patients with cancer. Consequently it is imperative that we improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie progression of tumor growth toward malignancy. Advances in genome characterization technologies have been very successful in identifying commonly mutated or misregulated genes in a variety of human cancers. However, the difficulty in evaluating whether these candidates drive tumor progression remains a major challenge. Using the genetic amenability of Drosophila melanogaster we generated tumors with specific genotypes in the living animal and carried out a detailed systematic loss-of-function analysis to identify conserved genes that enhance or suppress epithelial tumor progression. This enabled the discovery of functional cooperative regulators of invasion and the establishment of a network of conserved invasion suppressors. This includes constituents of the cohesin complex, whose loss of function either promotes individual or collective cell invasion, depending on the severity of effect on cohesin complex function.","2844":"Designing nanocatalysts with synergetic functional component is a desirable strategy to achieve both high activity and selectivity for industrially important hydrogenation reaction. Herein, we fabricated a core-shell hollow Au@Pt NTs@ZIFs (ZIF, zeolitic imidazolate framework; NT, nanotube) nanocomposite as highly efficient catalysts for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene. Hollow Au@Pt NTs were synthesized by epitaxial growth of Pt shell on Au nanorods followed with oxidative etching of Au@Pt nanorod. The obtained hollow Au@Pt NTs were then homogeneously encapsulated within ZIFs through in situ crystallization. By combining the high activity of bimetallic nanotube and gas enrichment property of porous metal-organic frameworks, hollow Au@Pt NT@ZIF catalyst was demonstrated to show superior catalytic performance for the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene, in terms of both selectivity and activity, over those of monometallic Au and solid bimetal nanorod@ZIF counterparts. This catalysts design idea is believed to be inspirable for the development of highly efficient nanocomposite catalysts.","2845":"Siglec-10 is an inhibitory I-type lectin selectively recognizing sialoglycans exposed on cell surfaces, involved in several patho-physiological processes. The key role Siglec-10 plays in the regulation of immune cell functions has made it a potential target for the development of immunotherapeutics against a broad range of diseases. However, the crystal structure of the protein has not been resolved for the time being and the atomic description of Siglec-10 interactions with complex glycans has not been previously unraveled. We present here the first insights of the molecular mechanisms regulating the interaction between Siglec-10 and naturally occurring sialoglycans. We used combined spectroscopic, computational and biophysical approaches to dissect glycans' epitope mapping and conformation upon binding in order to afford a description of the 3D complexes. Our outcomes provide a structural perspective for the rational design and development of high-affinity ligands to control the receptor functionality.","2846":"Ferroptosis is a type of cell death related to cancer; however, the characteristics of ferroptosis in cancers are still uncertain. Based on the data in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we found that most ferroptosis regulator genes (FRGs) were differentially expressed in tumors, somatic copy number alterations (SCNA) and DNA methylation contributed to their aberrant expression. We established the ferroptosis potential index (FPI) to reveal the functional roles of ferroptosis and noticed that the FPI was higher in tumors than in normal tissues in most cancers and was associated with subtypes and clinical features. The FPI was negatively correlated with several metabolic pathways but positively associated with several important metastasis-related pathways and immune-related pathways. High FPI predicted poor prognosis in several tumors, whereas FPI and FRGs impacted drug sensitivity. Our study presents a systematic analysis of ferroptosis and its regulatory genes and highlights the potential of ferroptosis-based cancer therapy.","2847":null,"2848":null,"2849":"Transcription factor-based biosensors naturally occur in metabolic pathways to maintain cell growth and to provide a robust response to environmental fluctuations. Extended metabolic biosensors, i.e., the cascading of a bio-conversion pathway and a transcription factor (TF) responsive to the downstream effector metabolite, provide sensing capabilities beyond natural effectors for implementing context-aware synthetic genetic circuits and bio-observers. However, the engineering of such multi-step circuits is challenged by stability and robustness issues. In order to streamline the design of TF-based biosensors in metabolic pathways, here we investigate the response of a genetic circuit combining a TF-based extended metabolic biosensor with an antithetic integral circuit, a feedback controller that achieves robustness against environmental fluctuations. The dynamic response of an extended biosensor-based regulated flavonoid pathway is analyzed in order to address the issues of biosensor tuning of the regulated pathway under industrial biomanufacturing operating constraints.","2850":null,"2851":"Reliable and sensitive detection of lipase activity is essential for the early diagnosis and monitoring of acute pancreatitis or progression of digestive diseases. However, the available fluorescent probes for detection of lipase activity are only implemented in a hexane-water two-phase system due to the nature of heterogeneous catalysis of lipase, thus limiting their applications in direct imaging of lipase activity in living cells and tissues. Here we designed and synthesized a \"turn on\" fluorescent probe CPP based on self-assembled micelles for hydrolysis of lipase. The CPP probe exhibits high selectivity and excellent sensitivity for the detection of lipase in such a homogeneous system and is successfully applied for monitoring lipase activity in pancreatic AR42J cells, tissues, and serums. Taken together, the fluorescent CPP probe not only provides a tool for diagnostic potential in pancreatic disease but also demonstrates an application potential for micelle self-assembly-based development of biological probes.","2852":"Advances in the treatment of Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) are desperately needed, particularly in the case of metastatic disease. A deeper understanding of collateral sensitivity, where the evolution of therapeutic resistance to one drug aligns with sensitivity to another drug, may improve our ability to effectively target this disease. For the first time in a solid tumor, we produced a temporal collateral sensitivity map that demonstrates the evolution of collateral sensitivity and resistance in EWS. We found that the evolution of collateral resistance was predictable with some drugs but had significant variation in response to other drugs. Using this map of temporal collateral sensitivity in EWS, we can see that the path toward collateral sensitivity is not always repeatable, nor is there always a clear trajectory toward resistance or sensitivity. Identifying transcriptomic changes that accompany these states of transient collateral sensitivity could improve treatment planning for patients with EWS.","2853":null,"2854":null,"2855":null,"2856":null,"2857":"Phylogeography combines ancestry with location and can be translated to intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) to visualize how tumors spread. ITH is common in human tumors, with many genetic and phenotypic differences between regions. The roles of ITH in progression are uncertain because many subclones lack discernable driver mutations. ITH can be visualized by mapping mutations onto microscopic sections, where subclones are directly associated with phenotypes, especially the deeper areas with the more invasive cells that confer worst clinical outcomes. Instead of a stepwise hierarchy where subclones segregate by phenotype with later branching subclones in more invasive areas, multiple subclones share superficial and invasive phenotype and are jigsaw arrayed in vertical columns. Phylogeography shows that both early and late subclones extend from the surface to the invasive front, suggesting that founder cells start with phenotypic plasticity and essentially all the drivers necessary to rapidly grow into large invasive tumors.","2858":null,"2859":"Natural killer (NK) cells are usually identified by the absence of other lineage markers, due to the lack of cell-surface-specific receptors. CD56neg NK cells, classically identified as CD56negCD16+, are very scarce in the peripheral blood of healthy people but they expand in some pathological conditions. However, studies on CD56neg NK cells had revealed different results regarding the phenotype and functionality. This could be due to, among others, the unstable expression of CD16, which hinders CD56neg NK cells' proper identification. Hence, we aim to determine an alternative surface marker to CD16 to better identify CD56neg NK cells. We have found that NKp80 is superior to CD16. Furthermore, we found differences between the functionality of CD56negNKp80+ and CD56negCD16+, suggesting that the effector functions of CD56neg NK cells are not as diminished as previously thought. We proposed NKp80 as a noteworthy marker to identify and accurately re-characterize human CD56neg NK cells.","2860":"Proper immune system function hinders cancer development, but little is known about whether genetic variants linked to cancer risk alter immune cells. Here, we report 57 cancer risk loci associated with differences in immune and\/or stromal cell contents in the corresponding tissue. Predicted target genes show expression and regulatory associations with immune features. Polygenic risk scores also reveal associations with immune and\/or stromal cell contents, and breast cancer scores show consistent results in normal and tumor tissue. SH2B3 links peripheral alterations of several immune cell types to the risk of this malignancy. Pleiotropic SH2B3 variants are associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA1\/2 mutation carriers. A retrospective case-cohort study indicates a positive association between blood counts of basophils, leukocytes, and monocytes and age at breast cancer diagnosis. These findings broaden our knowledge of the role of the immune system in cancer and highlight promising prevention strategies for individuals at high risk.","2861":null,"2862":null,"2863":null,"2864":null,"2865":"Mimicry is ubiquitous in nature, yet understanding its origin and evolution is complicated by the scarcity of exceptional fossils that enable behavioral inferences about extinct animals. Here we report bizarre true bugs (Hemiptera) that closely resemble beetles (Coleoptera) from mid-Cretaceous amber. The unusual fossil bugs are described as Bersta vampirica gen. et sp. nov. and Bersta coleopteromorpha gen. et sp. nov. and are placed into a new family, Berstidae fam. nov. The specialized mouthparts of berstids indicate that they were predaceous on small arthropods. Their striking beetle-like appearance implies that they were either involved in defensive mimicry or mimicked beetles to attack unsuspecting prey. The latter would represent the first case of aggressive mimicry in the invertebrate fossil record. These findings enrich our understanding of the paleoecological associations and extinct behavioral strategies of Mesozoic insects.","2866":"The rapid and global spread of a new human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has produced an immediate urgency to discover promising targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Drug repositioning is an attractive approach that can facilitate the drug discovery process by repurposing existing pharmaceuticals to treat illnesses other than their primary indications. Here, we review current information concerning the global health issue of COVID-19 including promising approved drugs and ongoing clinical trials for prospective treatment options. In addition, we describe computational approaches to be used in drug repurposing and highlight examples of in silico studies of drug development efforts against SARS-CoV-2.","2867":"Amphibians are known for their skin rich in glands containing toxins employed in passive chemical defense against predators, different from, for example, snakes that have active chemical defense, injecting their venom into the prey. Caecilians (Amphibia, Gymnophiona) are snake-shaped animals with fossorial habits, considered one of the least known vertebrate groups. We show here that amphibian caecilians, including species from the basal groups, besides having cutaneous poisonous glands as other amphibians do, possess specific glands at the base of the teeth that produce enzymes commonly found in venoms. Our analysis of the origin of these glands shows that they originate from the same tissue that gives rise to teeth, similar to the venom glands in reptiles. We speculate that caecilians might have independently developed mechanisms of production and injection of toxins early in their evolutionary history.","2868":null,"2869":"Neoplastic transformation causing cancer is a key problem in tumor biology and can be triggered by exposure to environmental substances. We investigated whether the cellular composition of a tissue contributes to its predisposition to cancer upon a specific carcinogen. Neutrophils are important immune components involved in cancer progression, but their contribution to generation of transformed cells is elusive. Yet, neutrophil-released reactive oxygen species (ROS) can cause tissue damage, which potentially favors tumorigenesis. Here, we show that neutrophils contribute directly to neoplastic transformation by amplifying the genotoxicity of urethane in lung cells via ROS. Neutrophil-driven ROS-dependent DNA damage is timely restricted to urethane exposure and notably uncoupled from broad tissue damage or inflammation. Neutropenic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (Gcsf)-knockout mice show reduced lung tumorigenesis, and forcing neutrophil recruitment only during urethane exposure rescues cancer incidence months later. This study shows that the time-restricted neutrophil response to carcinogens can impact the long-term tissue susceptibility to cancer.","2870":"Cell cycle progression is controlled by the interplay of established cell cycle regulators. Changes in these regulators' activity underpin differences in cell cycle kinetics between cell types. We investigated whether long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) contribute to embryonic stem cell cycle adaptations. Using single-cell RNA sequencing data for mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) staged as G1, S, or G2\/M we found differentially expressed lincRNAs are enriched among cell cycle-regulated genes. These lincRNAs (CC-lincRNAs) are co-expressed with genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We tested the impact of two CC-lincRNA candidates and show using CRISPR activation that increasing their expression is associated with deregulated cell cycle progression. Interestingly, CC-lincRNAs are often differentially expressed between G1 and S, their promoters are enriched in pluripotency transcription factor (TF) binding sites, and their transcripts are frequently co-regulated with genes involved in the maintenance of pluripotency, suggesting a contribution of CC-lincRNAs to mESC cell cycle adaptations.","2871":"Since the outbreak in 2019, researchers are trying to find effective drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus based on de novo drug design and drug repurposing. The former approach is very time consuming and needs extensive testing in humans, whereas drug repurposing is more promising, as the drugs have already been tested for side effects, etc. At present, there is no treatment for COVID-19 that is clinically effective, but there is a huge amount of data from studies that analyze potential drugs. We developed CORDITE to efficiently combine state-of-the-art knowledge on potential drugs and make it accessible to scientists and clinicians. The web interface also provides access to an easy-to-use API that allows a wide use for other software and applications, e.g., for meta-analysis, design of new clinical studies, or simple literature search. CORDITE is currently empowering many scientists across all continents and accelerates research in the knowledge domains of virology and drug design.","2872":null,"2873":"Temporal fluctuations in zinc concentration are essential signals, including during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. In mammals, zinc accumulation and release are required for oocyte maturation and egg activation, respectively. Here, we demonstrate that zinc flux occurs in Drosophila oocytes and activated eggs, and that zinc is required for female fertility. Our synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy reveals zinc as the most abundant transition metal in Drosophila oocytes. Its levels increase during oocyte maturation, accompanied by the appearance of zinc-enriched intracellular granules in the oocyte, which depend on transporters. Subsequently, in egg activation, which mediates the transition from oocyte to embryo, oocyte zinc levels decrease significantly, as does the number of zinc-enriched granules. This pattern of zinc dynamics in Drosophila oocytes follows a similar trajectory to that in mammals, extending the parallels in female gamete processes between Drosophila and mammals and establishing Drosophila as a model for dissecting reproductive roles of zinc.","2874":null,"2875":"Low-frequency oscillations are proposed to be involved in separating neuronal representations belonging to different items. Although item-specific neuronal activity was found to cluster on different oscillatory phases, the influence of this mechanism on perception is unknown. Here, we investigated the perceptual consequences of neuronal item separation through oscillatory clustering. In an electroencephalographic experiment, participants categorized sounds parametrically varying in pitch, relative to an arbitrary pitch boundary. Pre-stimulus theta and alpha phase biased near-boundary sound categorization to one category or the other. Phase also modulated whether evoked neuronal responses contributed stronger to the fit of the sound envelope of one or another category. Intriguingly, participants with stronger oscillatory clustering (phase strongly biasing sound categorization) in the theta, but not alpha, range had steeper perceptual psychometric slopes (sharper sound category discrimination). These results indicate that neuronal sorting by phase directly influences subsequent perception and has a positive impact on discrimination performance.","2876":null,"2877":"A full understanding of the developmental process requires fine-scale characterization of cell divisions and cell types, which are naturally organized as the developmental cell lineage tree (CLT). Technological breakthroughs facilitated determination of more CLTs, but complete comprehension of the data remains difficult without quantitative comparison among CLTs. We hereby quantified phenotypic similarity between CLTs using a novel computational method that exhaustively searches for optimal correspondence between individual cells meanwhile retaining their topological relationships. The revealed CLT similarities allowed us to infer functional similarity at the transcriptome level, identify cell fate transformations, predict functional relationships between mutants, and find evolutionary correspondence between cell types of different species. By allowing quantitative comparison between CLTs, our work is expected to greatly enhance the interpretability of relevant data and help answer the myriad of questions surrounding the developmental process.","2878":"Chirality widely exists in a diverse array of biologically active molecules and life forms, and the catalytic constructions of chiral molecules have triggered a heightened interest in the fields of chemistry and materials and pharmaceutical sciences. However, the synthesis of silicon-stereogenic organosilicon compounds is generally recognized as a much more difficult task than that of carbon-stereogenic centers because of no abundant organosilicon-based chiral sources in nature. Herein, we reported a highly enantioselective rhodium-catalyzed trans-selective hydrosilylation of silicon-tethered bisalkynes to access chiral benzosiloles bearing a silicon-stereogenic center. This protocol featured with chiral Ar-BINMOL-Phos bearing hydrogen-bond donors as a privileged P-ligand for catalytic asymmetric hydrosilylation that is operationally simple and has 100% atom-economy with good functional group tolerability as well as high enantioselectivity (up to &gt;99:1 er). Benefiting from the trans-selective hydrosilylation with the aid of Rh\/Ar-BINMOL-Phos-based asymmetric catalysis, the Si-stereogenic benzosiloles exhibited pronounced aggregation-induced emission (AIE) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity.","2879":null,"2880":null,"2881":"","2882":null,"2883":"Aryl carboxylic acids are stable and readily available in great structural diversity both from natural and well-established synthetic procedures, which make them promising starting materials in organic synthesis. The conversion of benzoic acids into high-value molecules is of great importance and have gained much interest of synthetic chemists. The recent development of single-electron (1e-) activation strategy has been esteemed as a complementary method for the transformation of benzoic acids. In this context, carboxylate groups can be selectively transferred into reactive aryl carboxylic radical, aryl radical, and acyl radical by electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, or in the presence of some SET oxidants. Based on these radical species, remarkable advancements have been achieved for the rapid formation of various chemical bonds over the past 10 years. In this review, we summarize recent advances in single electron activation of aryl carboxylic acids, with an emphasis on reaction scope, catalytic system, limitation, and underlying reaction mechanism.","2884":"Parvalbumin (PV) interneuron dysfunction is associated with various brain disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Here, we asked whether early PV neuron hyperexcitability primes the hippocampus for amyloid beta-induced functional impairment. We show that prolonged chemogenetic activation of PV neurons induces long-term hyperexcitability of these cells, disrupts synaptic transmission, and causes spatial memory deficits on the short-term. On the long-term, pyramidal cells also become hyperexcitable, and synaptic transmission and spatial memory are restored. However, under these conditions of increased excitability of both PV and pyramidal cells, a single low-dose injection of amyloid beta directly into the hippocampus significantly impairs PV neuron function, increases pyramidal neuron excitability, and reduces synaptic transmission, resulting in significant spatial memory deficits. Taken together, our data show that an initial hyperexcitable state of PV neurons renders hippocampal function vulnerable to amyloid beta and may contribute to an increased risk for developing AD.","2885":null,"2886":"Inter-individual transmission of cancer cells represents an intriguing and unexplored host-pathogen system, with significant ecological and evolutionary ramifications. The pathogen consists of clonal malignant cell lines that spread horizontally as allografts and\/or xenografts. Although only nine transmissible cancer lineages in eight host species from both terrestrial and marine environments have been investigated, they exhibit evolutionary dynamics that may provide novel insights into tumor-host interactions particularly in the formation of metastases. Here we present an overview of known transmissible cancers, discuss the necessary and sufficient conditions for cancer transmission, and provide a comprehensive review on the evolutionary dynamics between transmissible cancers and their hosts.","2887":"The significance of organofluorine compounds has inspired the establishment of numerous methods for the functionalization of rather inert C-F bonds. Despite advances achieved in the manipulation of C(sp2)-F bonds by employing transition-metal catalysts, such as Pd, Rh, Cu, Ni, Ru, and Ir, strategies that address the paucity of effective pathways for selective activation of multiple C(sp3)-F bonds remained challenging. In this context, we present an unprecedented coupling-aromatization-cyclization reaction of polyfluorinated ketones with diverse N- and S-nucleophiles that forms regiodefined perfluoroalkylated naphtho[1,2-b]furan\/benzofuran derivatives by harnessing Co-promoted distinctive quadruple C(sp3)-F bonds cleavage relay. This chemistry involving controlled and successive selective defluorination at heteronuclear centers would greatly contribute to the preparation of drug-like heterocycles as well as the late-stage elaboration of biorelevant compounds. Controlled experiments and DFT theoretical studies revealed that the combination of cheap cobalt salt with Cs2CO3 enable expeditious C-F functionalization.","2888":"Many of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins have related counterparts across the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) family. One such protein is non-structural protein 9 (Nsp9), which is thought to mediate viral replication, overall virulence, and viral genomic RNA reproduction. We sought to better characterize the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 and subsequently solved its X-ray crystal structure, in an apo form and, unexpectedly, in a peptide-bound form with a sequence originating from a rhinoviral 3C protease sequence (LEVL). The SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9 structure revealed the high level of structural conservation within the Nsp9 family. The exogenous peptide binding site is close to the dimer interface and impacted the relative juxtapositioning of the monomers within the homodimer. We have established a protocol for the production of SARS-CoV-2 Nsp9, determined its structure, and identified a peptide-binding site that warrants further study to understanding Nsp9 function.","2889":null,"2890":null,"2891":"DNA methylation is a universal epigenetic mechanism involved in regulation of gene expression and genome stability. The DNA maintenance methylase DNMT1 ensures that DNA methylation patterns are faithfully transmitted to daughter cells during cell division. Because loss of DNMT1 is lethal, a pan-organismic analysis of DNMT1 function is lacking. We identified new recessive dnmt1 alleles in medaka and zebrafish and, guided by the structures of mutant proteins, generated a recessive variant of mouse Dnmt1. Each of the three missense mutations studied here distorts the catalytic pocket and reduces enzymatic activity. Because all three DNMT1 mutant animals are viable, it was possible to examine their phenotypes throughout life. The consequences of genome-wide hypomethylation of DNA of somatic tissues in the Dnmt1 mutants are surprisingly mild but consistently affect the development of the lymphoid lineage. Our findings indicate that developing lymphocytes in vertebrates are sensitive to perturbations of DNA maintenance methylation.","2892":"Mitochondria are important cell death checkpoints, and mitochondrial Ca2+ overload is considered as a potent apoptotic intrinsic pathway inducer. Here, we report that this Ca2+ apoptosis link is largely ineffective in inducing cell-death just by itself and required a concomitant inhibition of autophagy to counteract its pro-survival action. In such condition, an acute mitochondrial stress revealed by a DRP1-mediated mitochondrial dynamic remodeling is observed concomitantly with mitochondrial depolarization, release of cytochrome c, and efficient apoptosis induction. We also uncover that mitochondrial Ca2+ status modulates the function of autophagy as a sensitizer for chemotherapies. This priming mediated by mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and inhibition of autophagy sensitizes many cancer cells types to different chemotherapies with independent mechanisms of action. Collectively, our results redefine an important cell signaling pathway, uncovering new combined therapies for the treatment of diseases associated with mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis disorders such as cancer.","2893":null,"2894":null,"2895":"The microtubule-associated tau protein forms pathological inclusions that accumulate in an age-dependent manner in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since age is the major risk factor for AD, we examined endogenous tau species that evolve during aging in physiological and diseased conditions. In aged mouse brain, we found tau-immunoreactive clusters embedded within structures that are reminiscent of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) granules. We showed that PAS granules harbor distinct tau species that are more prominent in 3xTg-AD mice. Epitope profiling revealed hypo-phosphorylated rather than hyper-phosphorylated tau commonly observed in tauopathies. High-resolution imaging and 3D reconstruction suggest a link between tau clusters, reactive astrocytes, and microglia, indicating that early tau accumulation may promote neuroinflammation during aging. Using postmortem human brain, we identified tau as a component of corpora amylacea (CA), age-related structures that are functionally analogous to PAS granules. Overall, our study supports neuroimmune dysfunction as a precipitating event in tau pathogenesis.","2896":"Feedback circuits are one of the major causes underlying tumor resistance. Thus, compounds that target one oncogenic pathway with simultaneously blocking its compensatory pathway will be of great value for cancer treatment. Here, we develop a new MEK inhibitor designated as KZ-02 that exhibits unexpectedly higher cytotoxicity than its starting compound AZD6244, a well-known MEK inhibitor, in colorectal cancer (CRC). Subsequent kinase selectivity study identified Pim-1 as an additional cellular target for KZ-02. Further studies showed that AZD6244 and Pim-1 1 (a Pim-1 inhibitor) have a synergistic effect on CRC suppression. Mechanistic study revealed that MEK inhibition by AZD6244 leads to increased Pim-1 expression, which could be a general mechanism behind the compromised cell-killing activity of MEK inhibitors. KZ-02, despite increasing Pim-1 mRNA expression, simultaneously promotes Pim-1 proteasomal degradation. Therefore, we uncover a new MEK inhibitor KZ-02 with significantly enhanced antitumor activity by co-targeting MEK and Pim-1.","2897":"Histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) has recently been demonstrated as a key regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) phenotype and is associated with abdominal aortic calcification, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. It is uncertain whether HDAC9 is also implicated in other VSMC-driven diseases. Our objective was to assess associations between abdominal aortic calcification-associated genetic variation in HDAC9 and VSMC-associated phenotypes. In this prospective population study of 335,146 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank, the abdominal aortic calcification-associated risk allele of a genetic variant in HDAC9 was associated with increased risk of systolic hypertension, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. There was a suggestive protective association with kidney disease outcomes that did not reach experiment-wise significance. These genetic results lend further support for HDAC9 as a potential therapeutic target for arterial stenotic and calcific disease.","2898":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection can cause severe bronchiolitis in infants requiring hospitalization, whereas the elderly and immunocompromised are prone to RSV-induced pneumonia. RSV primarily infects lung epithelial cells. Given that no vaccine against RSV is currently available, we tested the ability of the epithelial-barrier protective cytokine interleukin-22 (IL-22) to control RSV production. When used in a therapeutic modality, IL-22 efficiently blunted RSV production from infected human airway and alveolar epithelial cells and IL-22 administration drastically reduced virus titer in the lungs of infected newborn mice. RSV infection resulted in increased expression of LC3B, a key component of the cellular autophagic machinery, and knockdown of LC3B ablated virus production. RSV subverted LC3B with evidence of co-localization and caused a significant reduction in autophagic flux, both reversed by IL-22 treatment. Our findings inform a previously unrecognized anti-viral effect of IL-22 that can be harnessed to prevent RSV-induced severe respiratory disease.","2899":"Molecular components that are functionally interdependent in human cells constitute molecular association networks. Disease can be caused by disturbance of multiple molecular interactions. New biomolecular regulatory mechanisms can be revealed by discovering new biomolecular interactions. To this end, a heterogeneous molecular association network is formed by systematically integrating comprehensive associations between miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, mRNAs, proteins, drugs, microbes, and complex diseases. We propose a machine learning method for predicting intermolecular interactions, named MMI-Pred. More specifically, a network embedding model is developed to fully exploit the network behavior of biomolecules, and attribute features are also calculated. Then, these discriminative features are combined to train a random forest classifier to predict intermolecular interactions. MMI-Pred achieves an outstanding performance of 93.50% accuracy in hybrid associations prediction under 5-fold cross-validation. This work provides systematic landscape and machine learning method to model and infer complex associations between various biological components.","2900":"Individuals with the neuropsychiatric disorder mania exhibit hyperactivity, elevated mood, and a decreased need for sleep. The brain areas and neuronal populations involved in mania-like behaviors, however, have not been elucidated. In this study, we found that ablating the ventral medial midbrain\/pons (VMP) GABAergic neurons induced mania-like behaviors in mice, including hyperactivity, anti-depressive behaviors, reduced anxiety, increased risk-taking behaviors, distractibility, and an extremely shortened sleep time. Strikingly, these mice also showed no rebound sleep after sleep deprivation, suggesting abnormal sleep homeostatic regulation. Dopamine D2 receptor deficiency largely abolished the sleep reduction induced by ablating the VMP GABAergic neurons without affecting the hyperactivity and anti-depressive behaviors. Our data demonstrate that VMP GABAergic neurons are involved in the expression of mania-like behaviors, which can be segregated to the short-sleep and other phenotypes on the basis of the dopamine D2 receptors.","2901":"The progesterone receptor (PR) is an inducible transcription factor that plays critical roles in female reproductive processes and in several aspects of breast cancer tumorigenesis. Our report describes the type I protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a cofactor controlling progesterone pathway, through the direct methylation of PR. Mechanistic assays in breast cancer cells indicate that PRMT1 methylates PR at the arginine 637 and reduces the stability of the receptor, thereby accelerating its recycling and finally its transcriptional activity. Depletion of PRMT1 decreases the expression of a subset of progesterone-inducible genes, controlling breast cancer cells proliferation and migration. Consistently, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that low expression of PRMT1 predicts a longer survival among the subgroup with high PR. Our study highlights PR methylation as a molecular switch adapting the transcription requirement of breast cells during tumorigenesis.","2902":null,"2903":null,"2904":"Pairwise whole-genome homology mapping is the problem of finding all pairs of homologous intervals between a pair of genomes. As the number of available whole genomes has been rising dramatically in the last few years, there has been a need for more scalable homology mappers. In this paper, we develop an algorithm (BubbZ) for computing whole-genome pairwise homology mappings, especially in the context of all-to-all comparison for multiple genomes. BubbZ is based on an algorithm for computing chains in compacted de Bruijn graphs. We evaluate BubbZ on simulated datasets, a dataset composed of 16 long mouse genomes, and a large dataset of 1,600 Salmonella genomes. We show up to approximately an order of magnitude speed improvement, compared with MashMap2 and Minimap2, while retaining similar accuracy.","2905":null,"2906":"Although traditional anaerobic digestion (AD) process to produce methane-rich biogas from wet waste is deep-rooted, high carbon footprint and its low value as compared with other renewable sources demand advanced strategies to avoid its production. An emerging conversion pathway to arrest methanogenesis for producing value-added fuels and chemicals instead of biogas is sought as a sustainable alternative. This research provides a comprehensive analysis on current technology development, process challenges, applications, and economics for producing high-value short-chain carboxylic acids from AD of wet wastes. We show that (1) the theoretical energy yields of acids equal or exceed biogas, and (2) the cost of these acids is competitive with those produced from chemical markets, making this economically viable for mass production. With global abundance of wet waste feedstocks, this process of short-chain acid production provides a promising alternative to conventional biogas production technology, while achieving waste management and carbon mitigation goals.","2907":"","2908":null,"2909":"The lacrimal gland (LG) is an exocrine organ responsible for the secretion of aqueous tear film. Regenerative and stem cell therapies that target LG repair are coming to the fore, although our understanding of LG cell lineage hierarchy is still incomplete. We utilize the analysis of label-retaining cells (LRCs) and genetic lineage tracing to define LG cell lineage hierarchy. Our study suggests that embryonic LG contains unique long-lived multipotent stem cells that give rise to all postnatal epithelial cell types. Following birth, lineages become established and the fate of progenitor cell descendants becomes restricted. However, some cell lineages retain plasticity after maturation and can trans-differentiate into other cell types upon injury. The demonstration that the LG contains progenitor cells with different levels of plasticity has profound implications for our understanding of LG gland function in homeostasis and disease and will be helpful for developing stem cell-based therapies in the future.","2910":null,"2911":"A fundamental problem in studies on human microbiome-associated diseases (MADs) is to understand the relationships between microbiome structures and health status of hosts. For example, species diversity metrics have been routinely evaluated in virtually all studies on MADs, yet a recent meta-analysis revealed that, in only approximately one-third of the cases, diversity and diseases were related. In this study, we ask whether Hubbell's neutral theory (supplemented with the normalized stochasticity ratio [NSR]) or critical microbiome network structures may offer better alternatives. Whereas neutral theory and NSR focus on stochastic processes, we use core\/periphery and high-salience skeleton networks to evaluate deterministic, asymmetrical niche effects, assuming that all species or their interactions were not \"born\" equal and focusing on non-neutral, critical network structures. We found that properties of critical network structures are more indicative of disease effects. Finally, seven findings (mechanisms, interpretations, and postulations) regarding medical ecology mechanisms underlying MADs were summarized.","2912":null,"2913":"Transcription factors (TFs) define cellular identity either by activating target cell program or by silencing donor program as demonstrated by intensive cell reprogramming studies. Here, we propose an extended minimum set cover model with stable selection (3Scover) to systematically identify silencing TFs, named safeguard TFs, from omics data. First, a cell type-TF specificity network is constructed to systematically link cell types with their specifically expressed TFs. Then we search the minimum TF set to cover this network with \"many but one specificity\" characteristic and integrate many subsampling models for a stable solution. 3Scover identified 30 safeguard TFs in human and mouse. These safeguard TFs are significantly enriched in the experimentally discovered reprogramming panel with their protein-protein interactors. In addition, they tend to interact closely with chromatin regulators, negatively regulate transcription, and function earlier in development. Collectively, 3Scover allows us to probe master TFs and combinatorial regulation in controlling cell identity.","2914":"The intestinal mucosa requires high levels of nucleotides for energy procurement, proliferation, and innate immunity. This need for nucleotide substrates substantially increases during injury, infection, and wound healing. In the present studies, we profile potential sources of purine nucleotides in murine mucosal tissue. This work reveals the gut microbiota as a prominent source of exogenous purines and that such microbiota-sourced purines (MSPs) are available to the intestinal mucosa. The MSPs are utilized for nucleotide genesis and promote energy balance. Further analyses reveal that colitic tissues lacking MSPs are proliferatively stunted, with notable energetic and endoplasmic reticulum stress to the detriment of mucous barrier integrity. Purine reconstitution either directly or through colonization of germ-free\/antibiotic-treated mice with MSP-sufficient E. coli alleviates such deficits, establishing MSP as a critical source of substrate for tissue metabolism, wound healing, and mucous barrier sterile integrity.","2915":"Decades of artificial selection have significantly improved performance and efficiency of animal production systems. However, little is known about the microevolution of genomes due to intensive breeding. Using whole-genome sequencing, we document dynamic changes of chicken genomes under divergent selection on adiposity over 19 generations. Directional selection reduced within-line but increased between-line genomic differences. We observed that artificial selection tended to result in recruitment of preexisting variations of genes related to adipose tissue growth. In addition, novel mutations contributed to divergence of phenotypes under selection but contributed significantly less than preexisting genomic variants. Integration of 15 generations genome sequencing, genome-wide association study, and multi-omics data further identified that genes involved in signaling pathways important to adipogenesis, such as autophagy and lysosome (URI1, MBL2), neural system (CHAT), and endocrine (PCSK1) pathways, were under strong selection. Our study provides insights into the microevolutionary dynamics of domestic animal genomes under artificial selection.","2916":"Sharks are a taxon of significant conservation concern and associated public interest. The scientific community largely supports management policies focusing on sustainable fisheries exploitation of sharks, but many concerned members of the public and some environmental advocates believe that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist and therefore support total bans on all shark fisheries and\/or trade in shark products. The belief that sustainable shark fisheries cannot and do not exist persists despite scientific evidence showing that they can and do, and are important to livelihoods. Additionally, many concerned members of the public are only aware of one threat to sharks and are unaware of other threats-or of most available policy solutions. Here we assess whether the popular press plays a role in spreading misinformation and misunderstanding about these issues via the agenda-setting, priming, and cultivation roles of the media, with the goal of better understanding the causes and consequences of public confusion.","2917":"Natural and artificial flower pollination are critical processes in the life cycle of flowering plants. Declines in the number of global pollinator insects, the heavy labor of conducting artificial pollination manually, and the rising cost of pollen grains are considered to be significant worldwide problems. Here we show that chemically functionalized soap bubbles exhibit effective and convenient delivery of pollen grains to the targeted flowers thanks to their stickiness, softness, high flexibility, and enhancement of pollen activity. By exploring the physicochemical properties of functional soap bubbles, we could prepare mechanically stabilized soap bubbles capable of withstanding the windmills produced by robotic pollination. An unmanned aerial vehicle equipped with a soap bubble maker was autonomously controlled to pollinate flowers. Such technology of automatic intelligent robotic pollination with functional soft materials would lead to innovative agricultural systems that can tackle the global issues of pollination.","2918":"Although insulin is a life-saving medicine, administration by daily injection remains problematic. Our goal was to exploit the power of DNA-encoded libraries to identify molecules with insulin-like activity but with the potential to be developed as oral drugs. Our strategy involved using a 104-member DNA-encoded library containing 160 Traditional Chinese Medicines (nDEL) to identify molecules that bind to and activate the insulin receptor. Importantly, we used the natural ligand, insulin, to liberate bound molecules. Using this selection method on our relatively small, but highly diverse, nDEL yielded a molecule capable of both binding to and activating the insulin receptor. Chemical analysis showed this molecule to be a polycyclic analog of the guanidine metformin, a known drug used to treat diabetes. By using our protocol with other, even larger, DELs we can expect to identify additional organic molecules capable of binding to and activating the insulin receptor.","2919":null,"2920":"In macromolecular crystallization, success is often dependent on the pH of the experiment. However, little is known about the pH of reagents used, and it is generally assumed that the pH of the experiment will closely match that of any buffering chemical in the solution. We use a large dataset of experimentally measured solution pH values to show that this assumption can be very wrong and generate a model that can be used to successfully predict the overall solution pH of a crystallization experiment. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the pH of some polyethylene glycol polymers widely used in protein crystallization under different storage conditions.","2921":"The microenvironment of postpartum mammary gland promotes tumor growth and metastasis in animal models and is linked to increased risk of breast cancer and poor disease outcome in patients. Our previous studies showed the involvement of the chemokine CCL8 in breast cancer metastasis through modulation of the tumor-promoting activity of the tumor microenvironment. Here we show that CCL8 is highly expressed during mammary gland involution and enhances the infiltration of M2 subtype macrophages at the second phase of involution. Cancer cell inoculation studies in Ccl8-deficient animals indicate that CCL8 accelerates tumor onset during involution but not in nulliparous animals. Depletion of macrophages abolished the tumor-promoting effect of CCL8 in involution suggesting the specific role of CCL8 in promoting tumor growth by recruiting macrophages. These results underscore the role of CCL8 in the development of postpartum breast cancer and suggest the potential value of targeting CCL8 in disease management.","2922":null,"2923":null,"2924":null,"2925":null,"2926":null,"2927":null,"2928":"Despite common consensus about the importance of planar cell polarity (PCP) proteins in tissue orientation, little is known about the mechanisms used by PCP proteins to promote planar polarization of cytoskeletons within individual cells. One PCP protein Fzd6 asymmetrically localizes to the apical cell membrane of multi-ciliated ependymal cells lining the lateral ventricular (LV) wall on the side that contacts cerebrospinal fluid flow. Individual ependymal cells have planar polarized microtubules that connect ciliary basal bodies (BBs) with the cell cortex of the Fzd side to coordinate cilia orientation. Here, we report that cytoplasmic dynein is anchored to the cell cortex of the Fzd side via an adapter protein Daple that regulates microtubule dynamics. Asymmetric localization of cortical dynein generates a pulling force on dynamic microtubules connected to BBs, which in turn orients BBs toward the Fzd side. This is required for coordinated cilia orientation on the LV wall.","2929":"During collective cell migration, front cells tend to extend a predominant leading protrusion, which is rarely present in cells at the side or rear positions. Using Drosophila border cells (BCs) as a model system of collective migration, we revealed the presence of a supracellular actomyosin network at the peripheral surface of BC clusters. We demonstrated that the Myosin II-mediated mechanical tension as exerted by this peripheral supracellular network not only mediated cell-cell communication between leading BC and non-leading BCs but also restrained formation of prominent protrusions at non-leading BCs. Further analysis revealed that a cytoplasmic dendritic actin network that depends on the function of Arp2\/3 complex interacted with the actomyosin network. Together, our data suggest that the outward pushing or protrusive force as generated from Arp2\/3-dependent actin polymerization and the inward restraining force as produced from the supracellular actomyosin network together determine the collective and polarized morphology of migratory BCs.","2930":"Ortho-selective aromatic C-H functionalization is frequently used in organic synthesis and chemical\/pharmaceutical industries. However, this reaction relies heavily on the use of directing groups suffering from limited substrate scope and extra steps to put on and remove the directing\/protecting groups. Herein we present the previously neglected concept that enables good to nearly complete selective ortho position. Proton transfer was utilized to tune the electron density on the aryl ring and determine the positional selectivity of electrophilic substitution. Consistently with deuteration experiments and DFT studies, this work demonstrates that acid-promoted proton transfer directs accelerated ortho-selective halogenation of NH\/OH contained aromatic amines\/phenols with excellent selectivity (&gt;40 examples; up to 98:2 ortho\/para selectivity). The application potential of this Fe-catalyzed method is demonstrated by the convenient synthesis of three alkaloids and tizanidine. This report raises the possibility that proton transfer could serve as the basis of developing new selective C-H functionalization reactions.","2931":"Optical microscope is one of the most widely used imaging tools for its great flexibility, reliable design, and low cost. Optical microsphere nanoscope (OMN) is invented as a method that can greatly enhance the observation power of conventional optical microscopes. In this perspective, the promising outlook for this approach is briefly discussed. There exists a great freedom to apply this method in various applications. OMN has been successfully commercialized. Our past experience and strategies are summarized in this perspective, which serves as a good reference for the future technology entrepreneurs. Based on our story and model, the factors for success are listed. It can be used to evaluate other commercialization projects and find out the directions that require further improvement.","2932":"Many ectotherms hibernate in face of the harsh winter conditions to improve their survival rate. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Here, we explored the hibernation mechanism of Chinese alligator using integrative multi-omics analysis. We revealed that (1) the thyroid hormone biosynthesis, nutrition absorption and metabolism, muscle contraction, urinary excretion and immunity function pathways are overall downregulated during hibernation; (2) the fat catabolism is completely suppressed, contrasting with the upregulation of hepatic fatty-acid-transporter CPT1A, suggesting a unique energy-saving strategy that differs from that in hibernating mammals; (3) the hibernation-related genes are not only directly regulated by DNA methylation but also controlled by methylation-dependent transcription networks. In addition, we identified and compared tissue-specific, species-specific, and conserved season-biased miRNAs, demonstrating complex post-transcriptional regulation during hibernation. Our study revealed the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying hibernation in the Chinese alligator and provided molecular insights into the evolution of hibernation regulation.","2933":"The human gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem that both affects and is affected by its host status. Previous metagenomic analyses of gut microflora revealed associations between specific microbes and host age. Nonetheless there was no reliable way to tell a host's age based on the gut community composition. Here we developed a method of predicting hosts' age based on microflora taxonomic profiles using a cross-study dataset and deep learning. Our best model has an architecture of a deep neural network that achieves the mean absolute error of 5.91 years when tested on external data. We further advance a procedure for inferring the role of particular microbes during human aging and defining them as potential aging biomarkers. The described intestinal clock represents a unique quantitative model of gut microflora aging and provides a starting point for building host aging and gut community succession into a single narrative.","2934":null,"2935":"The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) established a harmonized method for large-scale clinical proteomic studies. SWATH-MS, an instance of data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomic methods, is an alternate proteomic approach. In this study, we used SWATH-MS to analyze remnant peptides from the original retrospective TCGA samples generated for the CPTAC ovarian cancer proteogenomic study. The SWATH-MS results recapitulated the confident identification of differentially expressed proteins in enriched pathways associated with the robust Mesenchymal high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtype and the homologous recombination deficient tumors. Hence, SWATH\/DIA-MS presents a promising complementary or orthogonal alternative to the CPTAC proteomic workflow, with the advantages of simpler and faster workflows and lower sample consumption, albeit with shallower proteome coverage. In summary, both analytical methods are suitable to characterize clinical samples, providing proteomic workflow alternatives for cancer researchers depending on the context-specific goals of the studies.","2936":null,"2937":"Advanced functional electro-thermal conversion phase change materials (PCMs) can efficiently manage the energy conversion from electrical energy to thermal energy, thereby playing a significant role in sustainable energy utilization. Considering the inherent insulating properties of pristine PCMs, electrically conductive supporting materials are widely used to encapsulate PCMs to prepare composite PCMs for electro-thermal conversion and storage. Herein, we comprehensively review the recent advances in different electro-thermal conversion PCMs, mainly including carbon-based PCMs (carbon nanotubes [CNTs], graphene, biomass-derived carbon, graphite, highly graphitized carbon, and metal organic frameworks [MOFs]-derived carbon) and MXene-based PCMs. This review aims to provide an in-depth understanding of the electrothermal conversion mechanism and the relationships between structure design (random and array-oriented structure or single and hybrid supporting materials) and electrothermal properties, thereby contributing profound theoretical and experimental bases for the construction of high-performance electro-thermal conversion PCMs. Finally, we highlight the current challenges and future prospects.","2938":"Mechanistic models of biochemical systems provide a rigorous description of biological phenomena. They are indispensable for making predictions and elucidating biological design principles. To date, mathematical analysis and characterization of these models encounter a bottleneck consisting of large numbers of unknown parameter values. Here, we introduce the Design Space Toolbox v.3.0 (DST3), a software implementation of the Design Space formalism enabling mechanistic modeling without requiring previous knowledge of parameter values. This is achieved by using a phenotype-centric modeling approach, in which the system is first decomposed into a series of biochemical phenotypes. Parameter values realizing phenotypes of interest are subsequently predicted. DST3 represents the most generally applicable implementation of the Design Space formalism and offers unique advantages over earlier versions. By expanding the Design Space formalism and streamlining its distribution, DST3 represents a valuable tool for elucidating biological design principles and designing novel synthetic circuits.","2939":null,"2940":"We report a comprehensive molecular analysis of 34 cases of small cell carcinoma (SCC) and 84 cases of conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC), with The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort of 408 conventional UC bladder cancers used as the reference. SCCs showed mutational landscapes characterized by nearly uniform inactivation of TP53 and were dominated by Sanger mutation signature 3 associated with loss of BRCA1\/2 function. SCCs were characterized by downregulation of luminal and basal markers and were referred to as double-negative. Transcriptome analyses indicated that SCCs displayed lineage plasticity driven by a urothelial-to-neural phenotypic switch with a dysregulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition network. SCCs were depleted of immune cells, and expressed high levels of the immune checkpoint receptor, adenosine receptor A2A (ADORA2A), which is a potent inhibitor of immune infiltration. Our observations have important implications for the prognostication and development of more effective therapies for this lethal bladder cancer variant.","2941":null,"2942":null,"2943":null,"2944":"A primary function of the primate amygdala is to modulate behavior based on emotional cues. To study the underlying neural mechanism, we first inactivated the amygdala locally and temporarily by injecting a GABA agonist. Then, saccadic eye movements and gaze were suppressed only on the contralateral side. Next, we performed optogenetic activation after injecting a viral vector into the amygdala. Optical stimulation in the amygdala excited amygdala neurons, whereas optical stimulation of axon terminals in the substantia nigra pars reticulata inhibited nigra neurons. Optical stimulation in either structure facilitated saccades to the contralateral side. These data suggest that the amygdala controls saccades and gaze through the basal ganglia output to the superior colliculus. Importantly, this amygdala-derived circuit mediates emotional context information, whereas the internal basal ganglia circuit mediates object value information. This finding demonstrates a basic mechanism whereby basal ganglia output can be modulated by other areas conveying distinct information.","2945":null,"2946":"The recent discovery of extracellular RNAs in blood, including RNAs in extracellular vesicles (EVs), combined with low-input RNA-sequencing advances have enabled scientists to investigate their role in human disease. To date, most studies have been focusing on small RNAs, and methodologies to optimize long RNAs measurement are lacking. We used plasma RNA to assess the performance of six long RNA sequencing methods, at two different sites, and we report their differences in reads (%) mapped to the genome\/transcriptome, number of genes detected, long RNA transcript diversity, and reproducibility. Using the best performing method, we further compare the profile of long RNAs in the EV- and no-EV-enriched RNA plasma compartments. These results provide insights on the performance and reproducibility of commercially available kits in assessing the landscape of long RNAs in human plasma and different extracellular RNA carriers that may be exploited for biomarker discovery.","2947":null,"2948":"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytokine storm (CS) in lungs leads to the high mortality in COVID-19 patients. To reduce ARDS, an ideal approach is to diminish virus loading by activating immune cells for CS prevention or to suppress the overactive cytokine-releasing immune cells for CS inhibition. Here, a potential radiation-mediated CS regulation is raised by reevaluating the radiation-mediated pneumonia control in the 1920s, with the following latent advantages of lung radiotherapy (LR) in treatment of COVID-19: (1) radiation accesses poorly circulated tissue more efficiently than blood-delivered medications; (2) low-dose radiation (LDR)-mediated metabolic rewiring and immune cell activation inhibit virus loading; (3) pre-consumption of immune reserves by LDR decreases CS severity; (4) higherdose radiation (HDR) within lung-tolerable doses relieves CS by eliminating in situ overactive cytokine-releasing cells. Thus, LDR and HDR or combined with antiviral and life-supporting modalities may mitigate SARS-CoV-2 and other virus-mediated ARDS.","2949":null,"2950":"Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a set of technologies used to profile gene expression at the level of individual cells. Although the throughput of scRNA-seq experiments is steadily growing in terms of the number of cells, large datasets are not yet commonly generated owing to prohibitively high costs. Integrating multiple datasets into one can improve power in scRNA-seq experiments, and efficient integration is very important for downstream analyses such as identifying cell-type-specific eQTLs. State-of-the-art scRNA-seq integration methods are based on the mutual nearest neighbor paradigm and fail to both correct for batch effects and maintain the local structure of the datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel scRNA-seq dataset integration method called BATMAN (BATch integration via minimum-weight MAtchiNg). Across multiple simulations and real datasets, we show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools with respect to existing metrics for batch effects by up to 80% while retaining cell-to-cell relationships.","2951":null,"2952":"Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an attractive way to produce renewable fuel and chemical feedstock, especially when coupled with efficient CO2 capture and clean energy sources. On the fundamental side, research on improving CO2RR activity still revolves around late transition metal-based catalysts, which are limited by unfavorable scaling relations despite intense investigation. Here, we report a combined experimental and theoretical investigation into electrocatalytic CO2RR on Ti- and Mo-based MXene catalysts. Formic acid is found as the main product on Ti2CTx and Mo2CTx MXenes, with peak Faradaic efficiency of over 56% on Ti2CTx and partial current density of up to -2.5 mA cm-2 on Mo2CTx. Furthermore, simulations reveal the critical role of the Tx group: a smaller overpotential is found to occur at lower amounts of -F termination. This work represents an important step toward experimental demonstration of MXenes for more complex electrocatalytic reactions in the future.","2953":null,"2954":null,"2955":"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) or cellular communication network 2 (CCN2) is a matricellular protein essential for normal embryonic development and tissue repair. CTGF exhibits cell- and context-dependent activities, but CTGF function in vascular development and barrier function is unknown. We show that endothelial cells (ECs) are one of the major cellular sources of CTGF in the developing and adult retinal vasculature. Mice lacking CTGF expression either globally or specifically in ECs exhibit impaired vascular cell growth and morphogenesis and blood barrier breakdown. The global molecular signature of CTGF includes cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix protein, growth factor, and transcriptional co-regulator genes such as yes-associated protein (YAP). YAP, itself a transcriptional activator of CTGF, mediates several CTGF-controlled angiogenic and barriergenic transcriptional programs. Re-expression of YAP rescues, at least partially, angiogenesis and barriergenesis in CTGF mutant mouse retinas. Thus, the CTGF-YAP regulatory loop is integral to retinal vascular development and barrier function.","2956":null,"2957":null,"2958":"Histone chaperone FACT is commonly expressed and essential for the viability of transformed but not normal cells, and its expression levels correlate with poor prognosis in patients with cancer. FACT binds several components of nucleosomes and has been viewed as a factor destabilizing nucleosomes to facilitate RNA polymerase passage. To connect FACT's role in transcription with the viability of tumor cells, we analyzed genome-wide FACT binding to chromatin in conjunction with transcription in mouse and human cells with different degrees of FACT dependence. Genomic distribution and density of FACT correlated with the intensity of transcription. However, FACT knockout or knockdown was unexpectedly accompanied by the elevation, rather than suppression, of transcription and with the destabilization of chromatin in transformed, but not normal cells. These data suggest that FACT stabilizes and reassembles nucleosomes disturbed by transcription. This function is vital for tumor cells because malignant transformation is accompanied by chromatin destabilization.","2959":null,"2960":"Impairments in synapse development are thought to cause numerous psychiatric disorders. Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) gene has been associated with various psychiatric disorders, such as autism and intellectual disabilities. Although roles for AUTS2 in neuronal migration and neuritogenesis have been reported, its involvement in synapse regulation remains unclear. In this study, we found that excitatory synapses were specifically increased in the Auts2-deficient primary cultured neurons as well as Auts2 mutant forebrains. Electrophysiological recordings and immunostaining showed increases in excitatory synaptic inputs as well as c-fos expression in Auts2 mutant brains, suggesting that an altered balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs enhances brain excitability. Auts2 mutant mice exhibited autistic-like behaviors including impairments in social interaction and altered vocal communication. Together, these findings suggest that AUTS2 regulates excitatory synapse number to coordinate E\/I balance in the brain, whose impairment may underlie the pathology of psychiatric disorders in individuals with AUTS2 mutations.","2961":"Importance of sperm-derived transcripts and chromatin imprints in organismal development is poorly investigated. Here using an integrative approach, we show that human sperm transcripts are equally important as oocyte. Sperm-specific and sperm-oocyte common transcripts carry distinct chromatin structures at their promoters correlating with corresponding transcript levels in sperm. Interestingly, sperm-specific H3K4me3 patterns at the lincRNA promoters are not maintained in the germ layers and somatic tissues. However, bivalent chromatin at the sperm-specific protein-coding gene promoters is maintained throughout the development. Sperm-specific transcripts reach their peak expression during zygotic genome activation, whereas sperm-oocyte common transcripts are present during early preimplantation development but decline at the onset of zygotic genome activation. Additionally, there is an inverse correlation between sperm-specific and sperm-oocyte lincRNAs throughout the development. Sperm-lincRNAs also show aberrant activation in tumors. Overall, our observations indicate that sperm transcripts carrying chromatin imprints may play an important role in human development and cancer.","2962":null,"2963":"Brain-resident microglia and bone marrow-derived macrophages represent the most abundant non-cancerous cells in the brain tumor microenvironment with critical functions in disease progression and therapeutic response. To date little is known about genetic programs that drive disease-associated phenotypes of microglia and macrophages in brain metastases. Here we used cytometric and transcriptomic analyses to define cellular and molecular changes of the myeloid compartment at distinct stages of brain metastasis and in response to radiotherapy. We demonstrate that genetic programming of tumor education in myeloid cells occurs early during metastatic onset and remains stable throughout tumor progression. Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct gene signatures in brain-resident microglia and blood-borne monocytes\/macrophages during brain metastasis and in response to therapeutic intervention. Our data provide a framework for understanding the functional heterogeneity of brain metastasis-associated myeloid cells based on their origin.","2964":"An ODE model integrating metabolic mechanisms with clinical data reveals an Ohm's law governing lifetime body mass dynamics, where fat and lean tissues are analogous to a parallel nonlinear capacitor and resistor, respectively. The law unexpectedly decouples weight stability (a cell-autonomous property of adipocytes) and weight change (a parabolic trajectory governed by Ohm's law). In middle age, insulin resistance causes fat accumulation to avoid excessive body shrinkage in old age. Moderate middle-age spread is thus natural, not an anomaly caused by hypothalamic defects, as proposed by lipostatic theory. These discoveries provide valuable insights into health care practices such as weight control and health assessment, explain certain observed phenomena, make testable predictions, and may help to resolve major conundrums in the field. The ODE model, which is more comprehensive than Ohm's law, is useful to study metabolism at the detailed microscopic levels.","2965":"Ischemic damage to the adult rodent forebrain has been widely used as a model system to study injury-induced neurogenesis, resulting in contradictory reports regarding the capacity of the postnatal brain to replace striatal projection neurons. Here we used a software-assisted, confocal approach to survey thousands of cells generated after striatal ischemic injury in rats and showed that injury fails not only to stimulate production of new striatal projection neurons in the adult brain but also to do so in the neonatal brain at early postnatal ages not previously explored. Conceptually this is significant, because it shows that even during periods of active striatal neurogenesis, injury is not a sufficient stimulus to promote replacement of these neurons. Understanding the intrinsic capacity of the postnatal brain to replace neurons in response to injury is fundamental to the development of \"self-repair\" therapies.","2966":"An unprecedented desaturation method via redox-neutral hydrogen transfer process has been disclosed under mild conditions for the selective formation of terminal alkene with alkyl diazo compounds and aza-o-QMs. The control experiments and DFT calculations suggest that the visible light was introduced as a key parameter to enhance the reactivity via a radical process in the formation of closed-shell cyclopropane intermediate, followed by a ring opening and redox-neutral hydrogen transfer process to give the desaturated product. The high regioselectivity in this transformation is enabled by the internal amino species as an ancillary group (AG) in the final olefin formation step. This method provides a missing link in the expeditious preparation of synthetically useful 2-allyl anilines with broad substrate generality. Further applications of these generated products in N-heterocycle construction, including 5- and 6-membered rings with structural diversity, have been tactfully explored, which highlight the potential in methodology development and drug discovery.","2967":"It is still challenging to develop strongly alkali-resistant catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3. It is generally believed that the maintenance of acidity is the most important factor because of neutral effects of alkali. This work discovers that the redox properties rather than acidity play decisive roles in improving alkali resistance of some specific catalyst systems. K-poisoned Fe-decorated SO42--modified CeZr oxide (Fe\/SO42-\/CeZr) catalysts show decreased acidity but reserve the high redox properties. The higher reactivity of NHx species induced by K poisoning compensates for the decreased amount of adsorbed NHx, leading to a desired reaction efficiency between adsorbed NHx and nitrate species. This study provides a unique perspective in designing an alkali-resistant deNOx catalyst via improving redox properties and activating the reactivities of NHx species rather than routinely increasing acidic sites for NHx adsorption, which is of significance for academic interests and practical applications.","2968":null,"2969":"Eating out of phase with daily circadian rhythms induces metabolic desynchrony in peripheral metabolic organs and may increase chronic disease risk. Time-restricted eating (TRE) is a dietary approach that consolidates all calorie intake to 6- to 10-h periods during the active phase of the day, without necessarily altering diet quality and quantity. TRE reduces body weight, improves glucose tolerance, protects from hepatosteatosis, increases metabolic flexibility, reduces atherogenic lipids and blood pressure, and improves gut function and cardiometabolic health in preclinical studies. This review discusses the importance of meal timing on the circadian system, the metabolic health benefits of TRE in preclinical models and humans, the possible mechanisms of action, the challenges we face in implementing TRE in humans, and the possible consequences of delaying initiation of TRE.","2970":null,"2971":null,"2972":"The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy is increasing at a rapid pace in many countries. The association of high food allergy rates with Westernized lifestyles suggests the role of gene-environment interactions, potentially underpinned by epigenetic variation, in mediating this process. Recent studies have implicated innate immune system dysfunction in the development and persistence of food allergy. These responses are characterized by increased circulating frequency of innate immune cells and heightened inflammatory responses to bacterial stimulation in food allergic patients. These signatures mirror those described in trained immunity, whereby innate immune cells retain a \"memory\" of earlier microbial encounters, thus influencing subsequent immune responses. Here, we propose that a robust multi-omics approach that integrates immunological, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets, combined with well-phenotyped and longitudinal food allergy cohorts, can inform the potential role of trained immunity in food allergy.","2973":null,"2974":null,"2975":"The effectiveness of cancer radiotherapy is frequently hindered by the hypoxia of the tumor microenvironment. Direct delivery of oxygen to hypoxic tumor tissues is an attractive strategy to overcome this hypoxia-associated radioresistance. Herein, we report the generation of submicron-sized particles comprising myoglobin fused to the crystal-forming domain of Cry3Aa protein for the targeted delivery of oxygen to cancer cells. We demonstrate that myoglobin-containing particles were successfully produced in Bacillus thuringiensis with the assistance of the Cry3Aa domain I. Furthermore, these particles could be genetically modified to incorporate the cell penetrating peptide TAT and cell targeting peptide A549.1, resulting in particles that exhibited improved cellular uptake and targeting toward A549 cells. Notably, these myoglobin-containing particles increased the intracellular oxygen levels of A549 cells and thereby sensitized them to radiation. These findings suggest that the targeted delivery of O2-bound myoglobin could be an effective approach to enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy.","2976":"Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are more likely to be obese and have difficulty in losing weight. They demonstrate an obesity-independent deficit in adaptive energy expenditure. We used a clinically realistic preclinical model to investigate the molecular basis for the reduced postprandial thermogenesis (PPT) and develop a therapeutic strategy to normalize this deficit. Sheep exposed to increased androgens before birth develop the clinical features of PCOS. In adulthood they develop obesity and demonstrate an obesity-independent reduction in PPT. This is associated with reduced adipose tissue uncoupling protein expression and adipose tissue noradrenaline concentrations. These sheep are insulin resistant with reduced insulin signaling in the brain. Increasing brain insulin concentrations using intranasal insulin administration increased PPT in PCOS sheep without any effects on blood glucose concentrations. Intranasal insulin administration with food is a potential novel strategy to improve adaptive energy expenditure and normalize the responses to weight loss strategies in women with PCOS.","2977":"We have developed and integrated several technologies including whole-organ imaging and software development to support an initial precise 3D neuroanatomical mapping and molecular phenotyping of the intracardiac nervous system (ICN). While qualitative and gross anatomical descriptions of the anatomy of the ICN have each been pursued, we here bring forth a comprehensive atlas of the entire rat ICN at single-cell resolution. Our work precisely integrates anatomical and molecular data in the 3D digitally reconstructed whole heart with resolution at the micron scale. We now display the full extent and the position of neuronal clusters on the base and posterior left atrium of the rat heart, and the distribution of molecular phenotypes that are defined along the base-to-apex axis, which had not been previously described. The development of these approaches needed for this work has produced method pipelines that provide the means for mapping other organs.","2978":null,"2979":"Aging has a profound effect on the immune system, termed immunosenescence, resulting in increased incidence and severity of infections and decreased efficacy of vaccinations. We previously showed that immunosurveillance in the intestine, achieved primarily through antigen sampling M cells in the follicle associated epithelium (FAE) of Peyer's patches, was compromised during aging due to a decline in M cell functional maturation. The intestinal microbiota also changes significantly with age, but whether this affects M cell maturation was not known. We show that housing of aged mice on used bedding from young mice, or treatment with bacterial flagellin, were each sufficient to enhance the functional maturation of M cells in Peyer's patches. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying the influence of the intestinal microbiota on M cells has the potential to lead to new methods to enhance the efficacy of oral vaccination in aged individuals.","2980":"Heading time is a key trait in cereals affecting the maturation period for optimal grain filling before harvest. Here, we aimed to understand the factors controlling heading time in barley (Hordeum vulgare). We characterized a set of 274 barley accessions collected worldwide by planting them for 20 seasons under different environmental conditions at the same location in Kurashiki, Japan. We examined interactions among accessions, known genetic factors, and an environmental factor to determine the factors controlling heading response. Locally adapted accessions have been selected for genetic factors that stabilize heading responses appropriate for barley cultivation, and these accessions show stable heading responses even under varying environmental conditions. We identified vernalization requirement and PPD-H1 haplotype as major stabilizing mechanisms of the heading response for regional adaptation in Kurashiki.","2981":null,"2982":"The Sc(III) MOF-type MFM-300(Sc) is demonstrated in this study to be stable under physiological conditions (PBS), biocompatible (to human skin cells), and an efficient drug carrier for the long-term controlled release (through human skin) of antioxidant ferulate. MFM-300(Sc) also preserves the antioxidant pharmacological effects of ferulate while enhancing the bio-preservation of dermal skin fibroblasts, during the delivery process. These discoveries pave the way toward the extended use of Sc(III)-based MOFs as drug delivery systems (DDSs).","2983":null,"2984":"Optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), a GTPase at the inner mitochondrial membrane involved in regulating mitochondrial fusion, stability, and energy output, is known to be crucial for neural development: Opa1 heterozygous mice show abnormal brain development, and inactivating mutations in OPA1 are linked to human neurological disorders. Here, we used genetically modified human embryonic and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and reveal that OPA1 haploinsufficiency leads to aberrant nuclear DNA methylation and significantly alters the transcriptional circuitry in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). For instance, expression of the forkhead box G1 transcription factor, which is needed for GABAergic neuronal development, is repressed in OPA1+\/- NPCs. Supporting this finding, OPA1+\/- NPCs cannot give rise to GABAergic interneurons, whereas formation of glutamatergic neurons is not affected. Taken together, our data reveal that OPA1 controls nuclear DNA methylation and expression of key transcription factors needed for proper neural cell specification.","2985":"Spin waves offer promising perspectives as information carriers for future computational architectures beyond conventional complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, owing to their benefits for device minimizations and low-ohmic losses. Although plenty of magnonic devices have been proposed previously, scalable nanoscale networks based on spin waves are still missing. Here, we demonstrate a reprogrammable two-dimensional spin wave network by combining the chiral exchange spin waves and chiral domain walls. The spin-wave network can be extended to two dimensions and offers unprecedented control of exchange spin waves. Each cell in the network can excite, transmit, and detect spin waves independently in the chiral domain wall, and spin-wave logics are also demonstrated. Our results open up perspectives for integrating spin waves into future logic and computing circuits and networks.","2986":null,"2987":"The transcription factor BMAL1 is a core element of the circadian clock that contributes to cyclic control of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. By using biochemical cellular fractionation and immunofluorescence analyses we reveal a previously uncharacterized nucleolar localization for BMAL1. We used an unbiased approach to determine the BMAL1 interactome by mass spectrometry and identified NOP58 as a prominent nucleolar interactor. NOP58, a core component of the box C\/D small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein complex, associates with Snord118 to control specific pre-ribosomal RNA (pre-rRNA) processing steps. These results suggest a non-canonical role of BMAL1 in ribosomal RNA regulation. Indeed, we show that BMAL1 controls NOP58-associated Snord118 nucleolar levels and cleavage of unique pre-rRNA intermediates. Our findings identify an unsuspected function of BMAL1 in the nucleolus that appears distinct from its canonical role in the circadian clock system.","2988":"Many biological processes involve precise cellular state transitions controlled by complex gene regulation. Here, we use budding yeast cell cycle as a model system and explore how a gene regulatory circuit encodes essential information of state transitions. We present a generalized random circuit perturbation method for circuits containing heterogeneous regulation types and its usage to analyze both steady and oscillatory states from an ensemble of circuit models with random kinetic parameters. The stable steady states form robust clusters with a circular structure that are associated with cell cycle phases. This circular structure in the clusters is consistent with single-cell RNA sequencing data. The oscillatory states specify the irreversible state transitions along cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we identify possible mechanisms to understand the irreversible state transitions from the steady states. We expect this approach to be robust and generally applicable to unbiasedly predict dynamical transitions of a gene regulatory circuit.","2989":null,"2990":"Over the past decades, asymmetric catalysis has been intensely investigated as a powerful tool for the preparation of numerous chiral biologically active compounds. However, developing general and practical strategies for preparation of both enantiomers of a chiral molecule via asymmetric catalysis is still a challenge, particularly when the two enantiomers of a chiral catalyst are not easily prepared from natural chiral sources. Inspired by the biologic system, we report herein an unprecedented catalytic enantiodivergent Michael addition of pyridazinones to enones by subtle adjustment of achiral amino moiety of dipeptide phosphine catalysts. These two dipeptide phosphine catalysts, P5 and P8, could deliver both enantiomers of a series of N2-alkylpyridazinones in good yields (up to 99%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) via the catalyst-controlled enantiodivergent addition of pyridazinones to enones.","2991":"We demonstrate the nearly quantitative conversion of methanol to methyl formate (MF) with a reliable durability on the reduced-graphene-oxide-confined VTiOx nanoparticles (rGO@VTiO). The rGO@VTiO exhibits superior low-temperature reactivity than the rGO-free VTiO, and the MF yield of 98.8% is even comparable with the noble metal catalysts. Both experiments and simulations demonstrate that the ultrathin rGO shell significantly impacts the shell\/core interfacial electronic structure and the surface chemistry of the resultant catalysts, leading to remarkable reactivity in methanol to MF. rGO enhances the dispersion and loading rates of active monomeric\/oligomeric VOx. In particular, the electron migration between the rGO shell and oxides core reinforces the acidity of rGO@VTiO in the absence of sulfate acidic sites. Moreover, both in situ NAP-XPS and DRIFTS investigations suggest that the lattice oxygen was involved in the oxidation of methanol and the MF was formed via the hemiacetal mechanism.","2992":"Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) photon detection technology is an effective means for the exploration in the field of space science (monitoring the formation and evolution of solar storms), high-energy physics (dark matter detection), large-scale scientific facility (VUV free electron lasers) and electronic industry (high-resolution lithography). The advancement of this technology mainly depends on the performance optimization of VUV photodetectors. In this review, we introduced the research progress on the typical VUV photodetectors based on scintillator, photomultiplier tube, semiconductor, and gas, with their unique advantages and optimal performance indicators in different applications summarized. In particular, during recent years, thanks to the advances in ultra-wide bandgap semiconductors, economical VUV photodetectors with low power consumption and small size have been encouragingly developed. Finally, we pointed out the remaining challenges for each type of VUV detector, with the aim of maximizing the performance in a variety of applications in the future.","2993":"In some malignant tumor, especially for pancreatic tumor, poor solid-tumor penetration of nanotherapeutics impedes their treatment efficacy. Herein, we develop a polymer-peptide conjugate with the deep tissue penetration ability, which undergoes a cascade process under ultrasound (US), including (1) the singlet oxygen 1O2 is generated by P18, (2) the thioketal bond is cleaved by the 1O2, (3) the departure of PEG chains leads to the in situ self-assembly, and (4) the resultant self-assembled PK nanoparticles show considerable cellular internalization. Owing to the synergistic effect of US on increasing the membrane permeability, the endocytosis and lysosome escape of PK nanoparticles are further enhanced effectively, resulting in the improved therapeutic efficacy. Thanks to the high tissue-penetrating depth and spatial precision of US, PTPK presents enhanced tumor inhibition in an orthotopic pancreatic tumor model. Therefore, the US-activated cascade effect offers a novel perspective for precision medicine and disease theranostics.","2994":"The application of machine learning toward DNA encoded library (DEL) technology is lacking despite obvious synergy between these two advancing technologies. Herein, a machine learning algorithm has been developed that predicts the conversion rate for the DNA-compatible reaction of a building block with a model DNA-conjugate. We exemplify the value of this technique with a challenging reaction, the Pictet-Spengler, where acidic conditions are normally required to achieve the desired cyclization between tryptophan and aldehydes to provide tryptolines. This is the first demonstration of using a machine learning algorithm to cull potential building blocks prior to their purchase and testing for DNA-encoded library synthesis. Importantly, this allows for a challenging reaction, with an otherwise very low building block pass rate in the test reaction, to still be used in DEL synthesis. Furthermore, because our protocol is solution phase it is directly applicable to standard plate-based DEL synthesis.","2995":"Recent work provides the first method to measure the relative fitness of genomic variants within a population that scales to large numbers of genomes. A key component of the computation involves finding maximal perfect haplotype blocks from a set of genomic samples for which SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) have been called. Often, owing to low read coverage and imperfect assemblies, some of the SNP calls can be missing from some of the samples. In this work, we consider the problem of finding maximal perfect haplotype blocks where some missing values may be present. Missing values are treated as wildcards, and the definition of maximal perfect haplotype blocks is extended in a natural way. We provide an output-linear time algorithm to identify all such blocks and demonstrate the algorithm on a large population SNP dataset. Our software is publicly available.","2996":null,"2997":"Pathological forms of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) are present in almost all cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 20% of familial ALS cases are due to mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Redox regulation is critical to maintain cellular homeostasis, although how this relates to ALS is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the redox function of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is protective against protein misfolding, cytoplasmic mislocalization of TDP-43, ER stress, ER-Golgi transport dysfunction, and apoptosis in neuronal cells expressing mutant TDP-43 or SOD1, and motor impairment in zebrafish expressing mutant SOD1. Moreover, previously described PDI mutants present in patients with ALS (D292N, R300H) lack redox activity and were not protective against ALS phenotypes. Hence, these findings implicate the redox activity of PDI centrally in ALS, linking it to multiple cellular processes. They also imply that therapeutics based on PDI's redox activity will be beneficial in ALS.","2998":null,"2999":"Number discrimination has been documented in honeybees. It is not known, however, whether it reflects, as in vertebrates, the operating of an underlying general magnitude system that estimates quantities irrespective of dimensions (e.g., number, space, time) and format (discrete, continuous). We trained bees to discriminate between different numerical comparisons having either a 0.5 (2 versus 4; 4 versus 8) or 0.67 ratio (2 versus 3; 4 versus 6). Bees were then tested for spontaneous choice using comparisons with identical numbers but different sizes. Irrespective of the ratio of stimuli, bees trained to select the smaller numerical quantity chose the congruent smaller size; bees trained to select the larger numerical quantity chose the congruent larger size. This finding provides the evidence for a cross-dimensional transfer between discrete (numerical) and continuous (spatial) dimensions in an invertebrate species and supports the hypothesis of a cognitive universality of a coding for general magnitude.","3000":"The osmolyte glycine betaine (GB) ranks among the few widespread biomolecules in all three domains of life. In corals, tissue concentrations of GB are substantially higher than in the ambient seawater. However, the synthetic routes remain unresolved, questioning whether intracellular GB originates from de novo synthesis or heterotrophic input. Here we show that the genomic blueprint of coral metaorganisms encode the biosynthetic and degradation machinery for GB. Member organisms also adopted the prokaryotic high-affinity carrier-mediated uptake of exogenous GB, rendering coral reefs potential sinks of marine dissolved GB. The machinery metabolizing GB is highly expressed in the coral model Aiptasia and its microalgal symbionts, signifying GB's role in the cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis. We estimate that corals store between 106-109 grams of GB globally, representing about 16% of their nitrogen biomass. Our findings provide a framework for further mechanistic studies addressing GB's role in coral biology and reef ecosystem nitrogen cycling.","3001":null,"3002":"In the melanocortin pathway, melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) functions to control energy homeostasis. MC4R is expressed in a sub-population of Sim1 neurons (Sim1\/MC4R neurons) and functions in hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei (PVN) to control food intake. Mapping sites of hypothalamic injury in obesity is essential to counteract the disease. In the PVN of male and female mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) there is neuronal loss. However, the existing subpopulation of PVN Sim1\/MC4R neurons is unchanged, but has a loss of mitochondria and MC4R protein. In mice of both sexes with DIO, dietary intervention to re-establish normal weight restores abundance of MC4R protein in Sim1\/MC4R neurons and neurogenesis in the PVN. However, the number of non-Sim1\/MC4R neurons in the PVN continues to remain decreased. Selective survival and recovery of Sim1\/MC4R neurons after DIO suggests these neurons as preferential target to restore energy homeostasis and of therapy against obesity.","3003":null,"3004":null,"3005":"Protein reduction\/oxidation processes trigger and finely regulate a myriad of physiological and pathological cellular functions. Many biochemical and biophysical stimuli have been recently explored to precisely and effectively modulate intracellular redox signaling, due to the considerable therapeutic potential. Here, we propose a first step toward an approach based on visible light excitation of a thiophene-based semiconducting polymer (P3HT), demonstrating the realization of a hybrid interface with the Cytochrome c protein (CytC), in an extracellular environment. By means of scanning electrochemical microscopy and spectro-electrochemistry measurements, we demonstrate that, upon optical stimulation, a functional interaction between P3HT and CytC is established. Polymer optical excitation locally triggers photoelectrochemical reactions, leading to modulation of CytC redox activity, either through an intermediate step, involving reactive oxygen species formation, or via a direct photoreduction process. Both processes are triggered by light, thus allowing excellent spatiotemporal resolution, paving the way to precise modulation of protein redox signaling.","3006":"Enzymatic biofuel cells (EBFCs) with or without a membrane to separate the anodic and cathodic compartments generally suffered from high internal resistance or interactive interference, both of which restricted the improvement of their performance. Herein, a smart membrane-less EBFC was engineered based on anode-driven controlled release of cathodic acceptor via pH-responsive metal-organic framework ([Fe(CN)6]3-@ZIF-8) nanocarriers. The glucose anodic oxidation would produce gluconic acid accompanied by the change in pH value from neutral to the acidic case, which could drive the degradation of [Fe(CN)6]3-@ZIF-8 nanocarriers and further realize the controlled release of cathodic acceptor [Fe(CN)6]3-. More importantly, compared with controlled EBFC with or without membrane, the power output of the as-proposed EBFC enhanced at least 700 times due to the seamless electronic communication. Therefore, the ingenious strategy not only realized the successful engineering of the membrane-less EBFC but also provided an appealing idea for constructing smart devices.","3007":"Wearable devices that record brain signals may present privacy concerns for consumers. Industry leaders discussed four such concerns with us that pertain to data collection and management, user autonomy and information transparency, exceptionalism of brain data, and regulatory systems.","3008":null,"3009":"The massive size of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets often exceeds the capability of current computational analysis methods to solve routine tasks such as detection of cell types. Recently, geometric sketching was introduced as an alternative to uniform subsampling. It selects a subset of cells (the sketch) that evenly cover the transcriptomic space occupied by the original dataset, to accelerate downstream analyses and highlight rare cell types. Here, we propose algorithm Sphetcher that makes use of the thresholding technique to efficiently pick representative cells within spheres (as opposed to the typically used equal-sized boxes) that cover the entire transcriptomic space. We show that the spherical sketch computed by Sphetcher constitutes a more accurate representation of the original transcriptomic landscape. Our optimization scheme allows to include fairness aspects that can encode prior biological or experimental knowledge. We show how a fair sampling can inform the inference of the trajectory of human skeletal muscle myoblast differentiation.","3010":"Maintaining a balance between protein degradation and protein synthesis is necessary for neurodevelopment. Although the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex and its regulatory subunit Cdh1 (Cdh1-APC) has been shown to regulate learning and memory, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here, we have identified a role of Cdh1-APC as a regulator of protein synthesis in neurons. Proteomic profiling revealed that Cdh1-APC interacts with known regulators of translation, including stress granule proteins. Inhibition of Cdh1-APC activity caused an increase in stress granule formation that is dependent on fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). We propose a model in which Cdh1-APC targets stress granule proteins, such as FMRP, and inhibits the formation of stress granules, leading to protein synthesis. Elucidation of a role for Cdh1-APC in regulation of stress granules and protein synthesis in neurons has implications for how Cdh1-APC can regulate protein-synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory.","3011":null,"3012":"We present experimental results demonstrating that, relative to continuous illumination, an increase of a factor of 3-10 in the photon efficiency of algal photosynthesis is attainable via the judicious application of pulsed light for light intensities of practical interest (e.g., average-to-peak solar irradiance). We also propose a simple model that can account for all the measurements. The model (1) reflects the essential rate-limiting elements in bioproductivity, (2) incorporates the impact of photon arrival-time statistics, and (3) accounts for how the enhancement in photon efficiency depends on the timescales of light pulsing and photon flux density. The key is avoiding \"clogging\" of the photosynthetic pathway by properly timing the light-dark cycles experienced by algal cells. We show how this can be realized with pulsed light sources, or by producing pulsed-light effects from continuous illumination via turbulent mixing in dense algal cultures in thin photobioreactors.","3013":null,"3014":"Increased flux of glucose through glycolysis is a hallmark of inflammatory macrophages and is essential for optimal effector functions. Solute carrier (SLC) 37A2 is an endoplasmic reticulum-anchored phosphate-linked glucose-6-phosphate transporter that is highly expressed in macrophages and neutrophils. We demonstrate that SLC37A2 plays a pivotal role in murine macrophage inflammatory activation and cellular metabolic rewiring. Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rapidly increases macrophage SLC37A2 protein expression. SLC37A2 deletion reprograms macrophages to a hyper-glycolytic process and accelerates LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production, which partially depends on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis. Blockade of glycolysis normalizes the differential expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines between control and SLC37A2 deficient macrophages. Conversely, overexpression of SLC37A2 lowers macrophage glycolysis and significantly reduces LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In conclusion, our study suggests that SLC37A2 dampens murine macrophage inflammation by down-regulating glycolytic reprogramming as a part of macrophage negative feedback system to curtail acute innate activation.","3015":null,"3016":null,"3017":null,"3018":"Understanding microbial communities' roles in human health and disease requires methods that accurately characterize the microbial composition and their activity and effects within human biological samples. We present sMETASeq (small RNA Metagenomics by Sequencing), a novel method that uses sequencing of small RNAs to jointly measure host small RNA expression and create metagenomic profiles and detect small bacterial RNAs. We evaluated the performance of sMETASeq on a mock bacterial community and demonstrated its use on different human samples, including colon cancer, oral leukoplakia, cervix cancer, and a panel of human biofluids. In all datasets, the detected microbes reflected the biology of the different sample types.","3019":null,"3020":null,"3021":null,"3022":"Cooperation between DNA polymerases and DNA sliding clamp proteins is essential for DNA replication and repair. However, it is still challenging to clarify the binding mechanism and the movements of Y-family DNA polymerase IV (DPO4) on the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ring. Here we develop the simulation models of DPO4-PCNA123 and DPO4-PCNA12 complexes and uncover the underlying dynamics of DPO4 during binding and the binding order of the DPO4 domains. Two important intermediate states are found on the free energy surface before reaching the final bound state. Our results suggest that both PCNA3 and DPO4 can influence the PCNA12 planar conformation, whereas the impact of PCNA3 on PCNA12 is more significant than DPO4. These findings provide the crucial information of the conformational dynamics of DPO4 and PCNA, as well as the clue of the underlying mechanism of the cooperation between DPO4 and PCNA during DNA replication.","3023":null,"3024":null,"3025":"Many metabolic diseases disrupt endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, but little is known about how metabolic activity is communicated to the ER. Here, we show in hepatocytes and other metabolically active cells that decreasing the availability of substrate for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle diminished NADPH production, elevated glutathione oxidation, led to altered oxidative maturation of ER client proteins, and attenuated ER stress. This attenuation was prevented when glutathione oxidation was disfavored. ER stress was also alleviated by inhibiting either TCA-dependent NADPH production or Glutathione Reductase. Conversely, stimulating TCA activity increased NADPH production, glutathione reduction, and ER stress. Validating these findings, deletion of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier-which is known to decrease TCA cycle activity and protect the liver from steatohepatitis-also diminished NADPH, elevated glutathione oxidation, and alleviated ER stress. Together, our results demonstrate a novel pathway by which mitochondrial metabolic activity is communicated to the ER through the relay of redox metabolites.","3026":"Core regulatory transcription factors (CR TFs) establish enhancers with logical ordering during embryogenesis and development. Here we report that in fusion-positive rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer of the muscle lineage, the chief oncogene PAX3-FOXO1 is driven by a translocated FOXO1 super enhancer (SE) restricted to a late stage of myogenesis. Using chromatin conformation capture techniques, we demonstrate that the extensive FOXO1 cis-regulatory domain interacts with PAX3. Furthermore, RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data in tumors bearing rare PAX translocations implicate enhancer miswiring across all fusion-positive tumors. HiChIP of H3K27ac showed connectivity between the FOXO1 SE, additional intra-domain enhancers, and the PAX3 promoter. We show that PAX3-FOXO1 transcription is diminished when this network of enhancers is ablated by CRISPR. Our data reveal a hijacked enhancer network that disrupts the stepwise CR TF logic of normal skeletal muscle development (PAX3 to MYOD to MYOG), replacing it with an \"infinite loop\" enhancer logic that locks rhabdomyosarcoma in an undifferentiated stage.","3027":null,"3028":"In everyday life, people control objects in the world around them to varying degrees. The processes people actively use to establish their control, while interacting with an environment containing large ambiguity, remain unknown. This study examines how people explore their control over the environment and how they detect small differences in control among objects. In the experimental task, participants moved three dots on a screen and identified one dot over which the level of control is different from that of the other two. The results support a two-step behavior mechanism underlying the sensing of control difference: People first explore their overall control in the environment, and then the results of the initial exploration are used to selectively tune the direction (i.e., either more or less) of the detected control difference, ensuring efficient and rapid detection of the type of control difference that is potentially important for further action selections.","3029":"The traditional sound absorption problem has not been completely resolved over the last 200 years. At every stage, its research has changed depending on practical requirements and current technologies. Phononic crystals (PCs) and acoustic metamaterials (AMs) have gained attention because of their extensive investigation and development over the past 30 years. Especially, the use of these materials brings new vitality into the traditional sound absorption problem to figure out broad working band and low-frequency absorption. This review highlights recent progress in sound absorption-from airborne to waterborne absorption-and gradient-index AMs. Progress in gradient-index AMs is singled out because of their favorable impedance matching, good viscous and thermal dissipation, and lengthened propagation paths compared with those of other materials. The progress in sound absorption of PCs and AMs is promising to serve as the next-generation sound absorbing materials, trap and reuse acoustic energy, and attenuate earthquake\/tsunami wave in the future.","3030":"Eclosion hormone (EH) was originally identified as a brain-derived hormone capable of inducing the behavioral sequences required for molting across insect species. However, its role in this process (called ecdysis) has since been confounded by discrepancies in the effects of genetic and cellular manipulations of EH function in Drosophila. Although knock-out of the Eh gene results in severe ecdysis-associated deficits accompanied by nearly complete larval lethality, ablation of the only neurons known to express EH (i.e. Vm neurons) is only partially lethal and surviving adults emerge, albeit abnormally. Using new tools for sensitively detecting Eh gene expression, we show that EH is more widely expressed than previously thought, both within the nervous system and in somatic tissues, including trachea. Ablating all Eh-expressing cells has effects that closely match those of Eh gene knock-out; developmentally suppressing them severely disrupts eclosion. Our results thus clarify and extend the scope of EH action.","3031":null,"3032":"Excessive levels of saturated fatty acids are toxic to vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We previously reported that mice lacking VSMC-stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a major enzyme catalyzing the detoxification of saturated fatty acids, develop severe vascular calcification from the massive accumulation of lipid metabolites containing saturated fatty acids. However, the mechanism by which SCD deficiency causes vascular calcification is not completely understood. Here, we demonstrate that saturated fatty acids significantly inhibit autophagic flux in VSMCs, contributing to vascular calcification and apoptosis. Mechanistically, saturated fatty acids are accumulated as saturated lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs) (i.e. 1-stearoyl-LPA) possibly synthesized through the reaction of GPAT4 at the contact site between omegasomes and the MAM. The accumulation of saturated LPAs at the contact site causes abnormal formation of omegasomes, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomal precursor isolation membranes, leading to inhibition of autophagic flux. Thus, saturated LPAs are major metabolites mediating autophagy inhibition and vascular calcification.","3033":"This work investigates the relationship between high-glucose (HG) culture, CpG methylation of genes involved in cell signaling pathways, and the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in hepatocytes. The results indicate that HG leads to an increase in nuclear 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which specifically activates DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1), and regulates gene expression involved in intracellular lipid metabolism. The results show significant increases in 5mCpG levels in at least 2,225 genes involved in 57 signaling pathways. The hypermethylated genes directly involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism are of PI3K, cAMP, insulin, insulin secretion, diabetic, and NAFLD signaling pathways. The studies indicate a close relationship between the increase in nuclear 25HC levels and activation of DNMT1, which may regulate lipid metabolism via DNA CpG methylation. Our results indicate an epigenetic regulation of hepatic cell metabolism that has relevance to some common diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and metabolic syndrome.","3034":"Ultrafast fiber lasers have gained rapid advances in last decades for their intrinsic merits such as potential of all-fiber format, excellent beam quality, superior power scalability, and high single-pass gain, which opened widespread applications in high-field science, laser machining, precision metrology, optical communication, microscopy and spectroscopy, and modern ophthalmology, to name a few. Performance of an ultrafast fiber laser is well defined by the laser parameters including repetition rate, spectral bandwidth, pulse duration, pulse energy, wavelength tuning range, and average power. During past years, these parameters have been pushed to an unprecedented level. In this paper, we review these enabling technologies and explicitly show that the nonlinear interaction between ultrafast pulses and optical fibers plays the essential role. As a result of rapid development in both active and passive fibers, the toolbox of ultrafast fiber lasers will continue to expand and provide solutions to scientific and industrial problems.","3035":"Drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathies of infancy have been associated with KCNT1 gain-of-function mutations, which increase the activity of KNa1.1 sodium-activated potassium channels. Pharmacological inhibition of hyperactive KNa1.1 channels by quinidine has been proposed as a stratified treatment, but mostly this has not been successful, being linked to the low potency and lack of specificity of the drug. Here we describe the use of a previously determined cryo-electron microscopy-derived KNa1.1 structure and mutational analysis to identify how quinidine binds to the channel pore and, using computational methods, screened for compounds predicated to bind to this site. We describe six compounds that inhibited KNa1.1 channels with low- and sub-micromolar potencies, likely also through binding in the intracellular pore vestibule. In hERG inhibition and cytotoxicity assays, two compounds were ineffective. These may provide starting points for the development of new pharmacophores and could become tool compounds to study this channel further.","3036":"We evaluated the contribution of organic anion transporting polypeptide 2A1 (OATP2A1\/SLCO2A1), a high-affinity carrier for prostaglandins (PGs), to the parturition process. At gestational day (GD) 15.5, OATP2A1 is co-localized with 15-hydroxy-PG dehydrogenase in the mouse placental junctional zone and facilitates PG degradation by delivering PGs to the cytoplasm. Slco2a1 (+\/-) females mated with Slco2a1 (-\/-) males frequently showed elevated circulating progesterone at GD18.5 and delayed parturition. Progesterone receptor inhibition by RU486 treatment at GD18.5 blocked the delay of parturition. In the junctional zone, PGE2 stimulated placental lactogen II (PL-II) production, resulting in higher expression of PL-II in Slco2a1 (-\/-) placenta at GD18.5. Indomethacin treatment at GD15.5 suppressed the PL-II overproduction at GD18.5 in Slco2a1 (-\/-) embryo-bearing dams, which promoted progesterone withdrawal and corrected the delayed parturition. These results suggest that extracellular PGE2 reduction by OATP2A1 at mid-pregnancy would be associated with progesterone withdrawal by suppressing PL-II production, triggering parturition onset.","3037":"The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia COVID-19 has caused great number of cases and deaths, but our understanding about the pathogen SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unclear. The attachment of the virus with the cell-surface receptor and a cofactor is the first step for the infection. Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 are identical to those that are bound to the MERS-CoV-S. Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with SARS-CoV-S. This potential utilization of DPP4 as a binding target for SARS-CoV-2 may offer novel insight into the viral pathogenesis and help the surveillance and therapeutics strategy for meeting the challenge of COVID-19.","3038":null,"3039":"","3040":null,"3041":null,"3042":"Although Li-metal anodes are extremely attractive owing to the ultrahigh theoretical specific capacity, the low Coulombic efficiency and severe safety hazards resulting from uncontrollable Li dendrites growth hinder their widespread implementation. Herein, we propose a novel design of Ni macropore arrays for the functional Li deposition host. Benefiting from the regulated electric field distribution, Li nucleation and growth can be well confined within conductive Ni macropores. Consequently, the Ni macropore array electrode exhibits stable Li deposition behavior, i.e., high Coulombic efficiency of above 97% over 400 cycles for 1.0 mAh cm-2. Most importantly, the LiFePO4 || Li-Ni macropore arrays full cell also shows greatly enhanced cycling stability (90.3 mAh g-1 at 1 C after 700 cycles), holding great promise for high-performance rechargeable Li metal batteries.","3043":null,"3044":null,"3045":"Expansion of pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) is a pathological feature of many human lung diseases. Human PNECs are inherently difficult to study due to their rarity (&lt;1% of total lung cells) and a lack of established protocols for their isolation. We used induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate induced PNECs (iPNECs), which express core PNEC markers, including ROBO receptors, and secrete major neuropeptides, recapitulating known functions of primary PNECs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that differentiation efficiency is increased in the presence of an air-liquid interface and inhibition of Notch signaling. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed a PNEC-associated gene expression profile that is concordant between iPNECs and human fetal PNECs. In addition, pseudotime analysis of scRNA-seq results suggests a basal cell origin of human iPNECs. In conclusion, our model has the potential to provide an unlimited source of human iPNECs to explore PNEC pathophysiology associated with several lung diseases.","3046":"Interest in novel uses of biogas has increased recently due to concerns about climate change and greater emphasis on renewable energy sources. Although biogas is frequently used in low-value applications such as heating and fuel in engines or even just flared, reforming is an emerging strategy for converting biogas to syngas, which could then be used to obtain high-value-added liquid fuels and chemicals. Interest also exists due to the role of dry, bi-, and tri-reforming in the capture and utilization of CO2. New research efforts have explored efficient and effective reforming catalysts, as specifically applied to biogas. In this paper, we review recent developments in dry, bi-, and tri-reforming, where the CO2 in biogas is used as an oxidant\/partial oxidant. The synthesis, characterization, lifetime, deactivation, and regeneration of candidate reforming catalysts are discussed in detail. The thermodynamic limitation and techno-economics of biogas conversion are also discussed.","3047":"It is critical to develop a low-cost and environmentally friendly system to manufacture and recycle lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) as the demand on LIBs keeps increasing dramatically. Conventional LIB cathodes are manufactured using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone as the solvent, which is expensive, highly toxic, flammable, and energy intensive to produce and recover. Ideally, a close-loop industrial supply chain should be built, in which the batteries are manufactured, market harvested, and recycled with minimal external toxic solvent through the whole system. This work demonstrates a green and more sustainable manufacturing method for LIBs where no hazardous organic solvent is used during electrode manufacturing and recycling. The electrodes fabricated via water-based processing demonstrate comparable rate performance and cycle life to the ones from conventional solvent-based processing. Utilization of a water-soluble binder enables recovering the cathode compound from spent electrodes using water, which is successfully regenerated to deliver comparable electrochemical performance to the pristine one.","3048":null,"3049":null,"3050":"STOX1 is a transcription factor involved in preeclampsia and Alzheimer disease. We show that the knock-down of the gene induces rather mild effect on gene expression in trophoblast cell lines (BeWo). We identified binding sites of STOX1 shared by the two major isoforms, STOX1A and STOX1B. Profiling gene expression of cells overexpressing either STOX1A or STOX1B, we identified genes downregulated by both isoforms, with a STOX1 binding site in their promoters. Among those, STOX1-induced Annexin A1 downregulation led to abolished membrane repair in BeWo cells. By contrast, overexpression of STOX1A or B has opposite effects on trophoblast fusion (acceleration and inhibition, respectively) accompanied by syncytin genes deregulation. Also, STOX1A overexpression led to abnormal regulation of oxidative and nitrosative stress. In sum, our work shows that STOX1 isoform imbalance is a cause of gene expression deregulation in the trophoblast, possibly leading to placental dysfunction and preeclampsia.","3051":"Digital cytometry aims to identify different cell types in the tumor microenvironment, with the current focus on immune cells. Yet, identifying how changes in tumor cell phenotype, such as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, influence the immune contexture is emerging as an important question. To extend digital cytometry, we developed an unsupervised feature extraction and selection strategy to capture functional plasticity tailored to breast cancer and melanoma separately. Specifically, principal component analysis coupled with resampling helped develop gene expression-based state metrics that characterize differentiation within an epithelial to mesenchymal-like state space and independently correlate with metastatic potential. First developed using cell lines, the orthogonal state metrics were refined to exclude the contributions of normal fibroblasts and provide tissue-level state estimates using bulk tissue RNA-seq measures. The resulting metrics for differentiation state aim to inform a more holistic view of how the malignant cell phenotype influences the immune contexture within the tumor microenvironment.","3052":"","3053":null,"3054":"Current challenge for dynamic pathway control in metabolic engineering is enabling the components of the artificial regulatory system to be tunable. Here, we designed and built a heme-responsive regulatory system containing a heme biosensor HrtR and CRISPRi to regulate chemicals production while maintaining the intracellular heme homeostasis. A series of engineered biosensors with varied sensitivity and threshold were obtained by semi-rational design with site saturated mutation of HrtR. The modified metabolite-binding affinity of HrtR was confirmed by heme titration and molecular dynamic simulation. Dynamic regulation pattern of the system was validated by the fluctuation of gene expression and intracellular heme concentration. The efficiency of this regulatory system was proved by improving the 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) production to 5.35g\/L, the highest yield in batch fermentation of Escherichia coli. This system was also successfully used in improving porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrins biosynthesis and can be applied in many other biological processes.","3055":null,"3056":"","3057":"In the rodent ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) neurons are generated throughout life. They migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) into the olfactory bulb before their final differentiation into interneurons and integration into local circuits. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are steroid hormone receptors with important functions in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In this study, we show that the ER GPER1 is expressed in subsets of cells within the V-SVZ of female animals and provide evidence for a potential local estrogen source from aromatase-positive astrocytes surrounding the RMS. Blocking of GPER1 in Matrigel cultures of female animals significantly impairs migration of V-SVZ-derived cells. This outgrowth is accompanied by regulation of phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein cofilin by GPER1 signaling including an involvement of the p21-Ras pathway. Our results point to a prominent role of GPER1 in the initiation of neuronal migration from the V-SVZ to the olfactory bulb.","3058":null,"3059":"The distribution patterns of cancer metastasis depend on a sequence of steps involving adhesion molecules and on mechanical and geometrical effects related to blood circulation, but how much each of these two aspects contributes to the metastatic spread of a specific tumor is still unknown. Here we address this question by simulating cancer cell trajectories in a high-resolution humanoid model of global blood circulation, including stochastic adhesion events, and comparing the results with the location of metastasis recorded in thousands of human autopsies for seven different solid tumors, including lung, prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, showing that on average 40% of the variation in the metastatic distribution can be attributed to blood circulation. Our humanoid model of circulating tumor cells allows us to predict the metastatic spread in specific realistic conditions and can therefore guide precise therapeutic interventions to fight metastasis.","3060":null,"3061":"Ultrasound stimulation has recently emerged as a non-invasive method for modulating brain activity in animal and human studies with healthy subjects. Whether brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and depression can be treated using ultrasound stimulation still needs to be explored. Recent studies have reported that ultrasound stimulation suppressed epileptic seizures in a rodent model of epilepsy. These findings raise the crucial question of whether ultrasound stimulation can inhibit seizures in non-human primates with epilepsy. Here, we addressed this critical question. We confirmed that ultrasound stimulation significantly reduced the frequency of seizures in acute epileptic monkeys. Furthermore, the results showed that the number and duration of seizures were reduced, whereas the inter-seizure interval was increased after ultrasound stimulation. Besides, no significant brain tissue damage was observed by T2-weighted MR imaging. Our results are of great importance for future clinical applications of ultrasound neuromodulation in patients with epilepsy.","3062":"Early in brain development, impaired neuronal signaling during time-sensitive windows triggers the onset of neurodevelopmental disorders. GABA, through its depolarizing and excitatory actions, drives early developmental events including neuronal circuit formation and refinement. BDNF\/TrkB signaling cooperates with GABA actions. How these developmental processes influence the formation of neural circuits and affect adult brain function is unknown. Here, we show that early deletion of Ntrk2\/Trkb from immature mouse hippocampal dentate granule cells (DGCs) affects the integration and maturation of newly formed DGCs in the hippocampal circuitry and drives a premature shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABAergic actions in the target of DGCs, the CA3 principal cells of the hippocampus, by reducing the expression of the cation-chloride importer Nkcc1. These changes lead to the disruption of early synchronized neuronal activity at the network level and impaired morphological maturation of CA3 pyramidal neurons, ultimately contributing to altered adult hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes.","3063":null,"3064":null,"3065":"Exit from the cell cycle during the establishment of quiescence and upon cell differentiation requires the sustained inactivation of CDK complexes. Fission yeast cells deprived of nitrogen halt cell cycle progression in pre-Start G1, before becoming quiescent or undergoing sexual differentiation. The CDK inhibitor Rum1 and the APC\/C activator Ste9 are fundamental for this arrest, but both are down-regulated by CDK complexes. Here, we show that PP2A-B56Par1 is instrumental for Rum1 stabilization and Ste9 activation. In the absence of PP2A-B56Par1, cells fail to accumulate Rum1, and this results in persistent CDK activity, Ste9 inactivation, retention of the mitotic cyclin Cdc13, and impaired withdrawal from the cell cycle during nitrogen starvation. Importantly, mutation of a putative B56 interacting motif in Rum1 recapitulates these defects. These results underscore the relevance of CDK-counteracting phosphatases in cell differentiation, establishment of the quiescent state, and escape from it in cancer cells.","3066":null,"3067":null,"3068":"Cholesterol is an essential nutrient for the function of diverse biological processes and for steroid biosynthesis across metazoans. However, the role of cholesterol in immune function remains understudied. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which depends on the external environment for cholesterol, we studied the relationship between cholesterol and innate immunity. We found that the transporter CHUP-1 is required for the effect of cholesterol in the development of innate immunity and that the cholesterol-mediated immune response requires the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-8. Cholesterol acts through NHR-8 to transcriptionally regulate immune genes that are controlled by conserved immune pathways, including a p38\/PMK-1 MAPK pathway, a DAF-2\/DAF-16 insulin pathway, and an Nrf\/SKN-1 pathway. Our results indicate that cholesterol plays a key role in the activation of conserved microbicidal pathways that are essential for survival against bacterial infections.","3069":"Organoids are becoming widespread in drug-screening technologies but have been used sparingly for cell therapy as current approaches for producing self-organized cell clusters lack scalability or reproducibility in size and cellular organization. We introduce a method of using hydrogels as sacrificial scaffolds, which allow cells to form self-organized clusters followed by gentle release, resulting in highly reproducible multicellular structures on a large scale. We demonstrated this strategy for endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells to self-organize into blood-vessel units, which were injected into mice, and rapidly formed perfusing vasculature. Moreover, in a mouse model of peripheral artery disease, intramuscular injections of blood-vessel units resulted in rapid restoration of vascular perfusion within seven days. As cell therapy transforms into a new class of therapeutic modality, this simple method-by making use of the dynamic nature of hydrogels-could offer high yields of self-organized multicellular aggregates with reproducible sizes and cellular architectures.","3070":"Central to our subjective lives is the experience of different emotions. Recent behavioral work mapping emotional responses to 2,185 videos found that people experience upward of 27 distinct emotions occupying a high-dimensional space, and that emotion categories, more so than affective dimensions (e.g., valence), organize self-reports of subjective experience. Here, we sought to identify the neural substrates of this high-dimensional space of emotional experience using fMRI responses to all 2,185 videos. Our analyses demonstrated that (1) dozens of video-evoked emotions were accurately predicted from fMRI patterns in multiple brain regions with different regional configurations for individual emotions; (2) emotion categories better predicted cortical and subcortical responses than affective dimensions, outperforming visual and semantic covariates in transmodal regions; and (3) emotion-related fMRI responses had a cluster-like organization efficiently characterized by distinct categories. These results support an emerging theory of the high-dimensional emotion space, illuminating its neural foundations distributed across transmodal regions.","3071":"Ca2+ oscillations that depend on inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) have been ascribed to biphasic Ca2+ regulation of the IP3 receptor (IP3R) or feedback mechanisms controlling IP3 levels in different cell types. IP3 uncaging in hepatocytes elicits Ca2+ transients that are often localized at the subcellular level and increase in magnitude with stimulus strength. However, this does not reproduce the broad baseline-separated global Ca2+ oscillations elicited by vasopressin. Addition of hormone to cells activated by IP3 uncaging initiates a qualitative transition from high-frequency spatially disorganized Ca2+ transients, to low-frequency, oscillatory Ca2+ waves that propagate throughout the cell. A mathematical model with dual coupled oscillators that integrates Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release at the IP3R and mutual feedback mechanisms of cross-coupling between Ca2+ and IP3 reproduces this behavior. Thus, multiple Ca2+ oscillation modes can coexist in the same cell, and hormonal stimulation can switch from the simpler to the more complex to yield robust signaling.","3072":"Cisplatin (CDDP) has been a highly successful anticancer drug in cancer therapy; however, its further application suffers severe nephrotoxicity. Herein, we identify bismuth tetraphenylporphyrinate [Bi(TPP)] as a potent protective agent against CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. Bi(TPP) attenuates CDDP-induced acute kidney injury and prevents the death of mice exposed to a lethal dose of CDDP. The protective potency of bismuth porphyrin complexes could be optimized by varying lipophilic TPP ligands with ideal ClogP values of 8-14. Unexpectedly, Bi(TPP) exhibited a protective role via metallothionein-independent pathways, i.e., maintenance of redox homeostasis and energy supplement, elimination of accumulated platinum in the kidney, and inactivation of caspases cascade in apoptotic pathway. Significantly, Bi(TPP) does not compromise the antitumor activity of CDDP in the orthotopic tumor xenograft mouse model. These findings suggest that Bi(TPP) could be incorporated into current CDDP-based cancer therapy as a nephroprotective agent.","3073":"Engagement of neural stem\/progenitor cells (NSPCs) into proper neuronal differentiation requires the spatiotemporally regulated generation of metabolites. Purines are essential building blocks for many signaling molecules. Enzymes that catalyze de novo purine synthesis are assembled as a huge multienzyme complex called \"purinosome.\" However, there is no evidence of the formation or physiological function of the purinosome in the brain. Here, we showed that a signal transduction ATPases with numerous domains (STAND) protein, NACHT and WD repeat domain-containing 1 (Nwd1), interacted with Paics, a purine-synthesizing enzyme, to regulate purinosome assembly in NSPCs. Altered Nwd1 expression affected purinosome formation and induced the mitotic exit and premature differentiation of NSPCs, repressing neuronal migration and periventricular heterotopia. Overexpression\/knockdown of Paics or Fgams, other purinosome enzymes, in the developing brain resulted in a phenocopy of Nwd1 defects. These findings indicate that strict regulation of purinosome assembly\/disassembly is crucial for maintaining NSPCs and corticogenesis.","3074":null,"3075":"The axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential initiation and serves as a cargo transport filter and diffusion barrier that helps maintain neuronal polarity. The AIS actin cytoskeleton comprises actin patches and periodic sub-membranous actin rings. We demonstrate that tropomyosin isoform Tpm3.1 co-localizes with actin patches and that the inhibition of Tpm3.1 led to a reduction in the density of actin patches. Furthermore, Tpm3.1 showed a periodic distribution similar to sub-membranous actin rings but Tpm3.1 was only partially congruent with sub-membranous actin rings. Nevertheless, the inhibition of Tpm3.1 affected the uniformity of the periodicity of actin rings. Furthermore, Tpm3.1 inhibition led to reduced accumulation of AIS structural and functional proteins, disruption in sorting somatodendritic and axonal proteins, and a reduction in firing frequency. These results show that Tpm3.1 is necessary for the structural and functional maintenance of the AIS.","3076":"Telomeres are maintained by telomerase or in a subset of cancer cells by a homologous recombination (HR)-based mechanism, Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). The mechanisms regulating telomere-homeostasis in ALT cells remain unclear. We report that a replication initiator protein, Origin Recognition Complex-Associated (ORCA\/LRWD1), by localizing at the ALT-telomeres, modulates HR activity. ORCA's localization to the ALT-telomeres is facilitated by its interaction to SUMOylated shelterin components. The loss of ORCA in ALT-positive cells elevates the levels of two mediators of HR, RPA and RAD51, and consistent with this, we observe increased ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia body formation and telomere sister chromatid exchange. ORCA binds to RPA and modulates the association of RPA to telomeres. Finally, the loss of ORCA causes global chromatin decondensation, including at the telomeres. Our results demonstrate that ORCA acts as an inhibitor of HR by modulating RPA binding to ssDNA and inducing chromatin compaction.","3077":"Understanding how fungi interact with other organisms has significant medical, environmental, and agricultural implications. Nematode-trapping fungi (NTF) can switch to pathogens by producing various trapping devices to capture nematodes. Here we perform comparative genomic analysis of the NTF with four representative trapping devices. Phylogenomic reconstruction of these NTF suggested an evolutionary trend of trapping device simplification in morphology. Interestingly, trapping device simplification was accompanied by expansion of gene families encoding adhesion proteins and their increasing adhesiveness on trap surfaces. Gene expression analysis revealed a consistent up-regulation of the adhesion genes during their lifestyle transition from saprophytic to nematophagous stages. Our results suggest that the expansion of adhesion genes in NTF genomes and consequential increase in trap surface adhesiveness are likely the key drivers of fungal adaptation in trapping nematodes, providing new insights into understanding mechanisms underlying infection and adaptation of pathogenic fungi.","3078":"The applications of nanotechnology are wide ranging, and developing functional nanomaterials for agri-food applications from nature-derived polymers is widely conceived as a sustainable approach that is safer for human and animal consumption. In light of this, this review focuses on the advances in the development of nano-delivery systems using nature-derived polymers for agri-food applications. The review opens with a section detailing the different types of nature-derived polymers currently being used in various applications in the agri-food industry with a special mention on microbial extracellular polymeric materials. The major applications of nano-delivery systems in the food sector, such as food fortification and food preservation, as well as in the agricultural sector for controlled release of agrochemicals using nature-derived polymers are discussed. The review ends with a perspective on the safety and public perception of nano-enabled foods with a concluding remark on future directions of incorporating nano-delivery systems for agri-food purposes.","3079":null,"3080":null,"3081":"Tissue fibrosis compromises organ function and occurs as a potential long-term outcome in response to acute tissue injuries. Currently, lack of mechanistic understanding prevents effective prevention and treatment of the progression from acute injury to fibrosis. Here, we combined quantitative experimental studies with a mouse kidney injury model and a computational approach to determine how the physiological consequences are determined by the severity of ischemia injury and to identify how to manipulate Wnt signaling to accelerate repair of ischemic tissue damage while minimizing fibrosis. The study reveals that memory of prior injury contributes to fibrosis progression and ischemic preconditioning reduces the risk of death but increases the risk of fibrosis. Furthermore, we validated the prediction that sequential combination therapy of initial treatment with a Wnt agonist followed by treatment with a Wnt antagonist can reduce both the risk of death and fibrosis in response to acute injuries.","3082":"Early-onset Parkinson's disease-associated PINK1-Parkin signaling maintains mitochondrial health. Therapeutic approaches for enhancing PINK1-Parkin signaling present a potential strategy for treating various diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. We report two chemical enhancers of PINK1-Parkin signaling, identified using a robust cell-based high-throughput screening system. These small molecules, T0466 and T0467, activate Parkin mitochondrial translocation in dopaminergic neurons and myoblasts at low doses that do not induce mitochondrial accumulation of PINK1. Moreover, both compounds reduce unfolded mitochondrial protein levels, presumably through enhanced PINK1-Parkin signaling. These molecules also mitigate the locomotion defect, reduced ATP production, and disturbed mitochondrial Ca2+ response in the muscles along with the mitochondrial aggregation in dopaminergic neurons through reduced PINK1 activity in Drosophila. Our results suggested that T0466 and T0467 may hold promise as therapeutic reagents in Parkinson's disease and related disorders.","3083":"Direct conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high-energy fuels and high-value chemicals is a fascinating sustainable strategy. For most of the current electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, however, multi-carbon products are inhibited by large overpotentials and low selectivity. Herein, we exploit dispersed 3d transition metal dimers as spatially confined dual reaction centers for selective reduction of CO2 to liquid fuels. Various nitrogenated holey carbon monolayers are shown to be promising templates to stabilize these metal dimers and dictate their electronic structures, allowing precise control of the catalytic activity and product selectivity. By comprehensive first-principles calculations, we screen the suitable transition metal dimers that universally have high activity for ethanol (C2H5OH). Furthermore, remarkable selectivity for C2H5OH against other C1 and C2 products is found for Fe2 dimer anchored on C2N monolayer. The role of electronic coupling between the metal dimer and the carbon substrates is thoroughly elucidated.","3084":null,"3085":null,"3086":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication and regulate a broad range of biological processes. Novel therapeutic strategies have emerged based on the use of EVs as biological nanoparticles. To separate isolated EVs from protein aggregates and the external part of EVs membrane proteins, we performed a Trypsin\/Lys C digestion treatment of EVs pellets, followed by Amicon filtration. After these steps, all the fractions have been subjected to proteomic analyses. Comparison between 6 h Trypsin\/Lys C treatment or non-treated EVs revealed a quantitative variation of the surface proteins. Some surface proteins have been demasked after 6 h enzymatic digestion like CD81, CD82, Ust, Vcan, Lamp 1, Rab43, Annexin A2, Synthenin, and VSP37b. Moreover, six ghost proteins have also been identified and one corresponds to a long noncoding RNA. We thus demonstrate the presence of ghost proteins in EVs produced by glioma cells that can contribute to tumorigenesis.","3087":null,"3088":"Evidence showed that bad posture in adulthood is often formed from the childhood, and individuals with severe incorrect posture may be associated with the progress of scoliosis.

A total of 595,057 students were screened; the overall prevalence of incorrect posture in children and adolescents was 65.3%, and around 3.7% of the students were referred to radiography. Girls had a higher prevalence of incorrect posture than boys, students aged &gt;10 years accounted for a higher rate of incorrect posture than students aged &lt;10 years. We found that Chinese children and adolescents had a high prevalence of incorrect posture, with girls and older students being an especially high-risk group. Early interventions targeted for students with incorrect posture are urgently needed.","3089":"Many animals perceive features of higher-order visual motion that are beyond the spatiotemporal correlations of luminance defined in first-order motion. Although the neural mechanisms of first-order motion detection have become understood in recent years, those underlying higher-order motion perception remain unclear. Here, we established a paradigm to assess the detection of theta motion-a type of higher-order motion-in freely walking Drosophila. Behavioral screening using this paradigm identified two clusters of neurons in the central brain, designated as R18C12, which were required for perception of theta motion but not for first-order motion. Furthermore, theta motion-activated R18C12 neurons were structurally and functionally located downstream of visual projection neurons in lobula, lobula columnar cells LC16, which activated R18C12 neurons via interactions of acetylcholine (ACh) and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). The current study provides new insights into LC neurons and the neuronal mechanisms underlying visual information processing in complex natural scenes.","3090":null,"3091":"","3092":"Wing polyphenism is a phenomenon in which one genotype can produce two or more distinct wing phenotypes adapted to the particular environment. What remains unknown is how wing pad development is controlled downstream of endocrine signals such as insulin and JNK pathways. We show that genes important in cellular proliferation, cytokinesis, and cell cycle progression are necessary for growth and development of long wings. Wing pad cellular development of the long-winged morph was characterized by a highly structured epithelial layer with microvilli-like structures. Cells of adult short wing pads are largely in the G2\/M phase of the cell cycle, whereas those of long wings are largely in G1. Our study is the first to report the comparative developmental and cellular morphology and structure of the wing morphs and to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the cell cycle genes necessary for wing development of this unique, adaptive life history strategy.","3093":"Three-dimensional chromatin structures undergo dynamic reorganization during mammalian spermatogenesis; however, their impacts on gene regulation remain unclear. Here, we focused on understanding the structure-function regulation of meiotic chromosomes by Hi-C and other omics techniques in mouse spermatogenesis across five stages. Beyond confirming recent reports regarding changes in compartmentalization and reorganization of topologically associating domains (TADs), we further demonstrated that chromatin loops are present prior to and after, but not at, the pachytene stage. By integrating Hi-C and RNA-seq data, we showed that the switching of A\/B compartments between spermatogenic stages is tightly associated with meiosis-specific mRNAs and piRNAs expression. Moreover, our ATAC-seq data indicated that chromatin accessibility per se is not responsible for the TAD and loop diminishment at pachytene. Additionally, our ChIP-seq data demonstrated that CTCF and cohesin remain bound at TAD boundary regions throughout meiosis, suggesting that dynamic reorganization of TADs does not require CTCF and cohesin clearance.","3094":"Higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (AF) associates with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with the underlying mechanism largely unknown. The present study reported a subset of circulating immunoglobulin G autoantibodies (IgGs) from patients with T2DM with AF (T2DM\/AF)-induced intracellular calcium elevation in both human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived and mouse atrial cardiomyocytes, whereas (identical concentrations of) IgGs from patients with T2DM without AF could not. The IgG-evoked intracellular calcium elevation was insensitive to verapamil, mibefradil, or BTP-2, indicating calcium source from neither voltage-gated calcium channels nor store-operated calcium entry. On the other hand, pharmacological antagonism or genetic knockdown of inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor significantly decreased T2DM\/AF IgG-induced intracellular calcium elevation. Furthermore, pharmacological blockage of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), heterotrimeric G protein or phospholipase C dampened IgG-induced intracellular calcium elevation. Taken together, circulating IgGs from patients with T2DM\/AF stimulated arrhythmogenic intracellular calcium elevation through IP3 pathway in atrial cardiomyocytes.","3095":null,"3096":null,"3097":"The Central nucleus of amygdala (CeA) contains distinct populations of neurons that play opposing roles in feeding. The circuit mechanism of how CeA neurons process information sent from their upstream inputs to regulate feeding is still unclear. Here we show that activation of the neural pathway projecting from insular cortex neurons to the CeA suppresses food intake. Surprisingly, we find that the inputs from insular cortex form excitatory connections with similar strength to all types of CeA neurons. To reconcile this puzzling result, and previous findings, we developed a conductance-based dynamical systems model for the CeA neuronal network. Computer simulations showed that both the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of individual CeA neurons and the overall synaptic organization of the CeA circuit play a functionally significant role in shaping CeA neural dynamics. We successfully identified a specific CeA circuit structure that reproduces the desired circuit output consistent with existing experimentally observed feeding behaviors.","3098":"The AKP (Anna Karenina principle), which refers to observations inspired by the opening line of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, \"all happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,\" predicts that all \"healthy\" microbiomes are alike and each disease-associated microbiome is \"sick\" in its own way in human microbiome-associated diseases (MADs). The AKP hypothesis predicts the rise of heterogeneity\/stochasticity in human microbiomes associated with dysbiosis due to MADs. We used the beta-diversity in Hill numbers and stochasticity analysis to detect AKP and anti-AKP effects. We tested the AKP with 27 human MAD studies and discovered that the AKP, anti-AKP, and non-AKP effects were exhibited in approximately 50%, 25%, and 25% of the MAD cases, respectively. Mechanistically, AKP effects are primarily influenced by highly dominant microbial species and less influenced by rare species. In contrast, all species appear to play equal roles in influencing anti-AKP effects.","3099":null,"3100":null,"3101":"Haploinsufficiency of SETD5 is implicated in syndromic autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the molecular mechanism underlying the pathological role of this protein has remained unclear. We have now shown that Setd5+\/- mice manifest ASD-related behavioral phenotypes and that the expression of ribosomal protein genes and rDNA is disturbed in the brain of these mice. SETD5 recruited the HDAC3 complex to the rDNA promoter, resulting in removal of the histone mark H4K16ac and its reader protein TIP5, a repressor of rDNA expression. Depletion of SETD5 attenuated rDNA expression, translational activity, and neural cell proliferation, whereas ablation of TIP5 in SETD5-deficient cells rescued these effects. Translation of cyclin D1 mRNA was specifically down-regulated in SETD5-insufficient cells. Our results thus suggest that SETD5 positively regulates rDNA expression via an HDAC3-mediated epigenetic mechanism and that such regulation is essential for translation of cyclin D1 mRNA and neural cell proliferation.","3102":"Bacteria have evolved diverse mechanisms to survive environments with antibiotics. Temperature is both a key factor that affects the survival of bacteria in the presence of antibiotics and an environmental trait that is drastically increasing due to climate change. Therefore, it is timely and important to understand links between temperature changes and selection of antibiotic resistance. This review examines these links by synthesizing results from laboratories, hospitals, and environmental studies. First, we describe the transient physiological responses to temperature that alter cellular behavior and lead to antibiotic tolerance and persistence. Second, we focus on the link between thermal stress and the evolution and maintenance of antibiotic resistance mutations. Finally, we explore how local and global changes in temperature are associated with increases in antibiotic resistance and its spread. We suggest that a multidisciplinary, multiscale approach is critical to fully understand how temperature changes are contributing to the antibiotic crisis.","3103":null,"3104":null,"3105":"Carbon-carbon bond formation through polarity reversal ketyl radical anion coupling of carbonyls has inspired new reaction modes to this cornerstone carbonyl group and played significant roles in organic chemistry. The introduction of this resplendent polarity reversal ketyl strategy into polymer chemistry will inspire new polymerization mode with unpredicted discoveries. Here we show the successful introduction of polarity reversal ketyl approach to polymer chemistry to realize self-condensing ketyl polymerization with polymerization-induced emission. In this polarity reversal approach, it exhibits intriguing reversed polymerizability, where traditional excellent leaving groups are not suitable for polymerization but challenging polymerizations involving the cleavage of challenging C-F and C-CF3 bonds are realized under mild Barbier conditions. This polarity reversal approach enables the polymer chemistry with polarity reversal ketyl mode, opens up a new avenue toward the polymerization of challenging C-X bonds under mild conditions, and sparks design inspiration of new reaction, polymerization, and functional polymer.","3106":"The adult hair follicle (HF) undergoes successive regeneration driven by resident epithelial stem cells and neighboring mesenchyme. Recent work described the existence of HF dermal stem cells (hfDSCs), but the genetic regulation of hfDSCs and their daughter cell lineages in HF regeneration remains unknown. Here we prospectively isolate functionally distinct mesenchymal compartment in the HF (dermal cup [DC; includes hfDSCs] and dermal papilla) and define the transcriptional programs involved in hfDSC function and acquisition of divergent mesenchymal fates. From this, we demonstrate cross-compartment mesenchymal signaling within the HF niche, whereby DP-derived R-spondins act to stimulate proliferation of both hfDSCs and epithelial progenitors during HF regeneration. Our findings describe unique transcriptional programs that underlie the functional heterogeneity among specialized fibroblasts within the adult HF and identify a novel regulator of mesenchymal progenitor function during tissue regeneration.","3107":null,"3108":"BRAF V600 mutation influences cellular signaling pathways for melanoma development. However, the role of oncogenic BRAF in adaptive stress response pathways is not fully understood. Here, we show that oncogenic BRAF plays an essential role in the induction of ATF4 following the activation of general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2) kinase during nutrient stress and BRAF-targeted, therapeutic stress. Under GCN2 activation, BRAF ensures ATF4 induction by utilizing mTOR and eIF4B as downstream regulators. In contrast to the MEK-ERK pathway, this signaling pathway remains temporarily active even during treatment with BRAF inhibitors, thereby enabling the transient induction of ATF4. We also identify a chemical compound that prevents BRAF inhibitor-induced activation of the GCN2-ATF4 pathway and produces synergistic cell killing with BRAF inhibitors. Our findings establish a collaborative relationship between oncogenic BRAF and the GCN2-ATF4 signaling pathway, which may provide a novel therapeutic approach to target the adaptive stress response.","3109":null,"3110":null,"3111":"The hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapse has been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Alterations of dopaminergic and serotonergic modulations at this synapse are candidate mechanisms underlying antidepressant and other related treatments. However, these monoaminergic modulations share the intracellular signaling pathway at the MF synapse, which implies redundancy in their functions. We here show that endogenous monoamines can potentiate MF synaptic transmission in mouse hippocampal slices by activating the serotonin 5-HT4 receptor. Dopamine receptors were not effectively activated by endogenous agonists, suggesting that the dopaminergic modulation is latent. Electroconvulsive treatment enhanced the 5-HT4 receptor-mediated serotonergic synaptic potentiation specifically at the MF synapse, increased the hippocampal serotonin content, and produced an anxiolytic-like behavioral effect in a 5-HT4 receptor-dependent manner. These results suggest that serotonin plays a predominant role in monoaminergic modulations at the MF synapse. Augmentation of this serotonergic modulation may mediate anxiolytic effects of electroconvulsive treatment.","3112":null,"3113":"Erythroid commitment and differentiation are regulated by the coordinated action of a host of transcription factors, including GATA2 and GATA1. Here, we explored GATA-mediated transcriptional regulation through the integrative analysis of gene expression, chromatin modifications, and GATA factors' binding in human multipotent hematopoietic stem\/progenitor cells, early erythroid progenitors, and late precursors. A progressive loss of H3K27 acetylation and a diminished usage of active enhancers and super-enhancers were observed during erythroid commitment and differentiation. GATA factors mediate transcriptional changes through a stage-specific interplay with regulatory elements: GATA1 binds different sets of regulatory elements in erythroid progenitors and precursors and controls the transcription of distinct genes during commitment and differentiation. Importantly, our results highlight a pivotal role of promoters in determining the transcriptional program activated upon erythroid differentiation. Finally, we demonstrated that GATA1 binding to a stage-specific super-enhancer sustains the expression of the KIT receptor in human erythroid progenitors.","3114":"MCL-1 is a well-characterized inhibitor of cell death that has also been shown to be a regulator of mitochondrial dynamics in human pluripotent stem cells. We used cardiomyocytes derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) to uncover whether MCL-1 is crucial for cardiac function and survival. Inhibition of MCL-1 by BH3 mimetics resulted in the disruption of mitochondrial morphology and dynamics as well as disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Interfering with MCL-1 function affects the homeostatic proximity of DRP-1 and MCL-1 at the outer mitochondrial membrane, resulting in decreased functionality of hiPSC-CMs. Cardiomyocytes display abnormal cardiac performance even after caspase inhibition, supporting a nonapoptotic activity of MCL-1 in hiPSC-CMs. BH3 mimetics targeting MCL-1 are promising anti-tumor therapeutics. Progression toward using BCL-2 family inhibitors, especially targeting MCL-1, depends on understanding its canonical function not only in preventing apoptosis but also in the maintenance of mitochondrial dynamics and function.","3115":"Proper immune cell development at early ontogenic stages is critical for life-long health. How resident immune cells are established in barrier tissues at neonatal stages to provide early protection is an important but still poorly understood question. We herein report that a developmentally programmed preferential generation of skin-homing group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILC1s) at perinatal stages helps regulate early skin microbiota colonization. We found that a population of skin-homing NK1.1+ ILC1s was preferentially generated in the perinatal thymi of mice. Unique thymic environments and progenitor cells are responsible for the preferential generation of skin-homing NK1.1+ ILC1s at perinatal stages. In the skin, NK1.1+ ILC1s regulate proper microbiota colonization and control the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in neonatal mice. These findings provide insight into the development and function of tissue-specific immune cells at neonatal stages, a critical temporal window for establishment of local tissue immune homeostasis.","3116":"Bacterial gene expression depends on the allocation of limited transcriptional resources provided a particular growth rate and growth condition. Early studies in a few genes suggested this global regulation to generate a unifying hyperbolic expression pattern. Here, we developed a large-scale method that generalizes these experiments to quantify the response to growth of over 700 genes that a priori do not exhibit any specific control. We distinguish a core subset following a promoter-specific hyperbolic response. Within this group, we sort genes with regard to their responsiveness to the global regulatory program to show that those with a particularly sensitive linear response are located near the origin of replication. We then find evidence that this genomic architecture is biologically significant by examining position conservation of E. coli genes in 100 bacteria. The response to the transcriptional resources of the cell results in an additional feature contributing to bacterial genome organization.","3117":null,"3118":"Solar hydrogen and electricity are promising high energy-density renewable sources. Although photochemistry or photovoltaics are attractive routes, special challenge arises in sunlight conversion efficiency. To improve efficiency, various semiconductor materials have been proposed with selective sunlight absorption. Here, we reported a hybrid system synergizing photo-thermochemical hydrogen and photovoltaics, harvesting full-spectrum sunlight in a cascade manner. A simple suspension of Au-TiO2 in water\/methanol serves as a spectrum selector, absorbing ultraviolet-visible and infrared energy for rapid photo-thermochemical hydrogen production. The transmitted visible and near-infrared energy fits the photovoltaic bandgap and retains the high efficiency of a commercial photovoltaic cell under different solar concentration values. The experimental design achieved an overall efficiency of 4.2% under 12 suns solar concentration. Furthermore, the results demonstrated a reduced energy loss in full-spectrum energy conversion into hydrogen and electricity. Such simple integration of photo-thermochemical hydrogen and photovoltaics would create a pathway toward cascading use of sunlight energy.","3119":"Selective linkage of renewable alcohols and ammonia into functional products would not only eliminate the prepreparation steps to generate active amino agents but also help in the conservation of our finite fossil carbon resources and contribute to the reduction of CO2 emission. Herein the development of a novel 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,8-naphthyridine-based iridium (III) complex is reported, which exhibits excellent catalytic performance toward a new hydrogen transfer-mediated annulation reaction of 2-nitrobenzylic alcohols with alcohols and ammonia. The catalytic transformation proceeds with the striking features of good substrate and functional group compatibility, high step and atom efficiency, no need for additional reductants, and liberation of H2O as the sole by-product, which endows a new platform for direct access to valuable quinazolines. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the non-coordinated N-atom in the ligand serves as a side arm to significantly promote the condensation process by hydrogen bonding.","3120":"Lithium-ion batteries are commonly used as sources of power for electric vehicles (EVs). Battery safety is a major concern, due to a large number of accidents, for which short circuit has been considered as one of the main causes. Therefore, diagnosing and prognosticating short circuit are of great significance to improve EV safety. This work reviews the current state of the art about the diagnosis and prognosis of short circuit, covering the method and the key indicators. The findings provide important insights regarding how to improve the battery safety.","3121":"Cancer metabolism is critical for understanding the mechanism of tumorigenesis, yet the understanding is still challenging. We studied gene-metabolism regulatory interactions and quantified the global driving forces for cancer-metabolism dynamics as the underlying landscape and probability flux. We uncovered four steady-state attractors: a normal state attractor, a cancer OXPHOS state attractor, a cancer glycolysis state attractor, and an intermediate cancer state attractor. We identified the key regulatory interactions through global sensitivity analysis based on the landscape topography. Different landscape topographies of glycolysis switch between normal cells and cancer cells were identified. We uncovered that the normal state to cancer state transformation is associated with the peaks of the probability flux and the thermodynamic dissipation, giving dynamical and thermodynamic origin of cancer formation. We found that cancer metabolism oscillations consume more energy to support cancer malignancy. This study provides a quantitative understanding of cancer metabolism and suggests a metabolic therapeutic strategy.","3122":"Explaining biodiversity in nature is a fundamental problem in ecology. An outstanding challenge is embodied in the so-called Competitive Exclusion Principle: two species competing for one limiting resource cannot coexist at constant population densities, or more generally, the number of consumer species in steady coexistence cannot exceed that of resources. The fact that competitive exclusion is rarely observed in natural ecosystems has not been fully understood. Here we show that, by forming chasing pairs and chasing triplets among the consumers and resources in the consumption process, the Competitive Exclusion Principle can be naturally violated. The modeling framework developed here is broadly applicable and can be used to explain the biodiversity of many consumer-resource ecosystems and hence deepens our understanding of biodiversity in nature.","3123":null,"3124":null,"3125":null,"3126":null,"3127":null,"3128":null,"3129":"Caregivers hug their infants to express affection and joy. However, it remains unknown how infants react to being hugged. Here we examined heart rate responses in first-year infants during a hug, hold, and tight hug from parents. Infants older than four months showed an increased R-R interval (RRI) during a hug, indicating reduced heart rates and pronounced parasympathetic activity. Few head movements predicted a higher RRI increase in infants during a parental hug compared with that during a hold and tight hug. Infants did not show an increased RRI during a hug from a female stranger. Infants younger than four months did not show RRI increase during parental hug but exhibited a decreased RRI correlated with contact pressure. Parents showed an increased RRI during hugging their infants. These results suggest the parent-infant hug underlies the parent-infant bonding and psychophysiological development of infants.","3130":null,"3131":"The coordination of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis supports neurotransmitter release from presynaptic terminals. Although inositol pyrophosphates, such as 5-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (5-IP7), are versatile signaling metabolites in many biological events, physiological actions of 5-IP7 on synaptic membrane vesicle trafficking remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of 5-IP7 in synaptic transmission in hippocampal brain slices from inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (Ip6k1)-knockout mice. We found that presynaptic release probability was significantly increased in Ip6k1-knockout neurons, implying enhanced activity-dependent synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Expression of wild-type but not catalytically inactive IP6K1 in the Ip6k1-knockout hippocampus restored the altered presynaptic release probability. Moreover, Ip6k1-knockout neurons were insensitive to folimycin, a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, and dynasore, a dynamin inhibitor, suggesting marked impairment in synaptic endocytosis during exocytosis. Our findings collectively establish that IP6K1 and its product, 5-IP7, act as key physiological determinants for inhibition of presynaptic vesicle exocytosis and stimulation of endocytosis at central synapses.","3132":"The 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak coupled with the most recent outbreaks in Central Africa underscore the need to develop effective treatment strategies against EBOV. Although several therapeutic options have shown great potential, developing a wider breadth of countermeasures would increase our efforts to combat the highly lethal EBOV. Here we show that human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (AMP) LL-37 and engineered LL-37 AMPs inhibit the infection of recombinant virus pseudotyped with EBOV glycoprotein (GP) and the wild-type EBOV. These AMPs target EBOV infection at the endosomal cell-entry step by impairing cathepsin B-mediated processing of EBOV GP. Furthermore, two engineered AMPs containing D-amino acids are particularly potent in blocking EBOV infection in comparison with other AMPs, most likely owing to their resistance to intracellular enzymatic degradation. Our results identify AMPs as a novel class of anti-EBOV therapeutics and demonstrate the feasibility of engineering AMPs for improved therapeutic efficacy.","3133":null,"3134":null,"3135":null,"3136":"Motile cilia and flagella require ATP for their formation and function. Although glycolytic enzymes are components of flagellar proteomes, how they translocate to flagella is unknown. Here we show that the expression pattern of the functionally nonannotated gene 4833427G06Rik (C11orf88), which is found only in vertebrates and is designated here as Hoatzin (Hoatz), suggests a functional association of its product with motile cilia and flagella. Hoatz knockout (KO) mice developed hydrocephalus and male infertility in an autosomal recessive manner, and the ependymal cilia frequently showed disorganized axonemes, reducing motility associated with collapsed spermatid flagella during cytodifferentiation. HOATZ was associated with certain proteins, including the flagellar glycolytic enzyme ENO4. In the testes of the Hoatz KO mice, the immature form of ENO4 accumulated in abnormal cytoplasmic puncta of developing spermatids. These data indicate that HOATZ is required for motile ciliogenesis and flagellar genesis in vertebrates by mediating the maturation of ENO4.","3137":"Increasingly available microbial reference data allow interpreting the composition and function of previously uncharacterized microbial communities in detail, via high-throughput sequencing analysis. However, efficient methods for read classification are required when the best database matches for short sequence reads are often shared among multiple reference sequences. Here, we take advantage of the fact that microbial sequences can be annotated relative to established tree structures, and we develop a highly scalable read classifier, PRROMenade, by enhancing the generalized Burrows-Wheeler transform with a labeling step to directly assign reads to the corresponding lowest taxonomic unit in an annotation tree. PRROMenade solves the multi-matching problem while allowing fast variable-size sequence classification for phylogenetic or functional annotation. Our simulations with 5% added differences from reference indicated only 1.5% error rate for PRROMenade functional classification. On metatranscriptomic data PRROMenade highlighted biologically relevant functional pathways related to diet-induced changes in the human gut microbiome.","3138":"Mammalian skeletal muscle possesses a unique ability to regenerate, which is primarily mediated by a population of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs) and requires a concerted response from other supporting cell populations. Previous targeted analysis has described the involvement of various specific populations in regeneration, but an unbiased and simultaneous evaluation of all cell populations has been limited. Therefore, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to uncover gene expression signatures of over 53,000 individual cells during skeletal muscle regeneration. Cells clustered into 25 populations and subpopulations, including a subpopulation of immune gene enriched myoblasts (immunomyoblasts) and subpopulations of fibro-adipogenic progenitors. Our analyses also uncovered striking spatiotemporal dynamics in gene expression, population composition, and cell-cell interaction during muscle regeneration. These findings provide insights into the cellular and molecular underpinning of skeletal muscle regeneration.","3139":"Flax has been cultivated for its oil and fiber for thousands of years. However, it remains unclear how the modifications of agronomic traits occurred on the genetic level during flax cultivation. In this study, we conducted genome-wide variation analyses on multiple accessions of oil-use, fiber-use, landraces, and pale flax to identify the genomic variations during flax cultivation. Our findings indicate that, during flax domestication, genes relevant to flowering, dehiscence, oil production, and plant architecture were preferentially selected. Furthermore, regardless of origins, the improvement of the modern oil-use flax preceded that of the fiber-use flax, although the dual selection on oil-use and fiber-use characteristics might have occurred in the early flax domestication. We also found that the expansion of MYB46\/MYB83 genes may have contributed to the unique secondary cell wall biosynthesis in flax and the directional selections on MYB46\/MYB83 may have shaped the morphological profile of the current oil-use and fiber-use flax.","3140":null,"3141":null,"3142":null,"3143":"An iron-catalyzed highly anti-Markovnikov selective, enantioselective hydrosilylation of vinylcyclopropanes with PhSiH3 was reported for the preparation of valuable chiral allylic silanes via stereospecific C-C bond cleavage.

The chiral Z-allylic silanes could be converted to various chiral allylic derivatives. A possible mechanism via an iron-silyl species was proposed based on experimental and computational studies.","3144":null,"3145":"The polyextremotolerant black yeast Exophiala dermatitidis is a tractable model system for investigation of adaptations that support growth under extreme conditions. Foremost among these adaptations are melanogenesis and carotenogenesis. A particularly important question is their metabolic production cost. However, investigation of this issue has been hindered by a relatively poor systems-level understanding of E. dermatitidis metabolism. To address this challenge, a genome-scale model (iEde2091) was developed. Using iEde2091, carotenoids were found to be more expensive to produce than melanins. Given their overlapping protective functions, this suggests that carotenoids have an underexplored yet important role in photo-protection. Furthermore, multiple defensive pigments with overlapping functions might allow E. dermatitidis to minimize cost. Because iEde2091 revealed that E. dermatitidis synthesizes the same melanins as humans and the active sites of the key tyrosinase enzyme are highly conserved this model may enable a broader understanding of melanin production across kingdoms.","3146":"Glutamine is a central nutrient for many cancers, contributing to the generation of building blocks and energy-promoting signaling necessary for neoplastic proliferation. In this study, we hypothesized that lowering systemic glutamine levels by exercise may starve tumors, thereby contributing to the inhibitory effect of exercise on tumor growth. We demonstrate that limiting glutamine availability, either pharmacologically or physiologically by voluntary wheel running, significantly attenuated the growth of two syngeneic murine tumor models of breast cancer and lung cancer, respectively, and decreased markers of atrophic signaling in muscles from tumor-bearing mice. In continuation, wheel running completely abolished tumor-induced loss of weight and lean body mass, independently of the effect of wheel running on tumor growth. Moreover, wheel running abolished tumor-induced upregulation of muscular glutamine transporters and myostatin signaling. In conclusion, our data suggest that voluntary wheel running preserves muscle mass by counteracting muscular glutamine release and tumor-induced atrophic signaling.","3147":"5hmC, 6mA, and 4mC are three common DNA modifications and are involved in various of biological processes. Accurate genome-wide identification of these sites is invaluable for better understanding their biological functions. Owing to the labor-intensive and expensive nature of experimental methods, it is urgent to develop computational methods for the genome-wide detection of these sites. Keeping this in mind, the current study was devoted to construct a computational method to identify 5hmC, 6mA, and 4mC. We initially used K-tuple nucleotide component, nucleotide chemical property and nucleotide frequency, and mono-nucleotide binary encoding scheme to formulate samples. Subsequently, random forest was utilized to identify 5hmC, 6mA, and 4mC sites. Cross-validated results showed that the proposed method could produce the excellent generalization ability in the identification of the three modification sites. Based on the proposed model, a web-server called iDNA-MS was established and is freely accessible at http:\/\/lin-group.cn\/server\/iDNA-MS.","3148":"Protons are highly related to cell viability during physiological and pathological processes. Developing new probes to monitor the pH variation could be extremely helpful to understand the viability of cells and the cell death study. Carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are superior biocompatible and have been widely applied in bioimaging field. Herein, a new type of extreme-pH suitable CPDs was prepared from citric acid and o-phenylenediamine (CA\/oPD-CPDs). Due to the co-existence of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, CA\/oPD-CPDs tend to aggregate in neutral condition with a dramatic decrease of fluorescence, but disperse well in both acidic and alkaline conditions with brighter emission. This specialty enables them to selectively illuminate lysosomes in cells. Moreover, CA\/oPD-CPDs in the cytoplasm could serve as a sustained probe to record intracellular pH variation during apoptosis. Furthermore, CA\/oPD-CPDs present a continuous fluorescence increase upon 2-h laser irradiation in living cells, underscoring this imaging system for long-term biological recording.","3149":"Environment-friendly manufacturing and mechanical robustness are imperative for commercialization of flexible OSCs as green-energy source, especially in portable and wearable self-powered flexible electronics. Although, the commonly adopted PEDOT:PSS electrodes that are treated with severely corrosive and harmful acid lack foldability. Herein, efficient folding-flexible OSCs with highly conductive and foldable PEDOT:PSS electrodes processed with eco-friendly cost-effective acid and polyhydroxy compound are demonstrated. The acid treatment endows PEDOT:PSS electrodes with high conductivity. Meanwhile, polyhydroxy compound doping contributes to excellent bending flexibility and foldability due to the better film adhesion between PEDOT:PSS and PET substrate. Accordingly, folding-flexible OSCs with high efficiency of 14.17% were achieved. After 1,000 bending or folding cycles, the device retained over 90% or 80% of its initial efficiency, respectively. These results represent one of the best performances for ITO-free flexible OSC reported so far and demonstrate a novel approach toward commercialized efficient and foldable green-processed OSCs.","3150":"Human mononuclear phagocytes comprise several subsets of dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages. Distinguishing one population from another is challenging, especially in inflamed tissues, owing to the promiscuous expression of phenotypic markers. Using a synthetic library of humanized llama single domain antibodies, we identified a novel surface marker for human naturally occurring monocyte-derived DCs. Our antibody targets an extra-cellular domain of LSP-1, specifically on monocyte-derived DCs, but not on other leukocytes, in particular monocytes, macrophages, classical DCs, or the recently described blood DC3 population. Our findings will pave the way for a better characterization of human mononuclear phagocytes in pathological settings.","3151":null,"3152":null,"3153":"Somitogenesis, the primary segmentation of the vertebrate embryo, is associated with oscillating genes that interact with a wave of cell differentiation. The necessity of cell-matrix adherence and embryonic tension, however, suggests that mechanical cues are also involved. To explicitly investigate this, we applied surplus axial strain to live chick embryos. Despite substantial deformations, the embryos developed normally and somite formation rate was unaffected. Surprisingly, however, we observed slow cellular reorganizations of the most elongated somites into two or more well-shaped daughter somites. In what appeared to be a regular process of boundary formation, somites divided and fibronectin was deposited in between. Cell counts and morphology indicated that cells from the somitocoel underwent mesenchymal-epithelial transition; this was supported by a Cellular Potts model of somite division. Thus, although somitogenesis appeared to be extremely robust, we observed new boundary formation in existing somites and conclude that mechanical strain can be morphologically instructive.","3154":null,"3155":"Human genetics studies have uncovered genetic variants that can be used to guide biological research and prioritize molecular targets for therapeutic intervention for complex diseases. We have identified a missense variant (P746S) in EDEM3 associated with lower blood triglyceride (TG) levels in &gt;300,000 individuals. Functional analyses in cell and mouse models show that EDEM3 deficiency strongly increased the uptake of very-low-density lipoprotein and thereby reduced the plasma TG level, as a result of up-regulated expression of LRP1 receptor. We demonstrate that EDEM3 deletion up-regulated the pathways for RNA and endoplasmic reticulum protein processing and transport, and consequently increased the cell surface mannose-containing glycoproteins, including LRP1. Metabolomics analyses reveal a cellular TG accumulation under EDEM3 deficiency, a profile consistent with individuals carrying EDEM3 P746S. Our study identifies EDEM3 as a regulator of blood TG, and targeted inhibition of EDEM3 may provide a complementary approach for lowering elevated blood TG concentrations.","3156":null,"3157":"Coral reefs are one of the most diverse and productive ecosystems on the planet, yet they have suffered tremendous losses due to anthropogenic disturbances and are predicted to be one of the most adversely affected habitats under future climate change conditions.

Microorganisms play vital roles in maintaining holobiont health and ecosystem resilience under environmental stress; however, they are also key players in positive feedback loops that intensify coral reef decline, with cascading effects on biogeochemical cycles and marine food webs.

In this work, we describe the development of a precise and cost-effective Nanopore sequencing-based pipeline that provides comprehensive and accurate information at candidate loci to identify potential causal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We demonstrate the utility of this technique via the fine-mapping of a GWAS positive hit comprising a synonymous SNP that is associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. In this work, we provide a proof of principle for the application of Nanopore sequencing in post-GWAS fine-mapping and pinpointing of potential causal SNPs with a minimal cost of just ~$10\/100 kb\/sample.","3160":null,"3161":null,"3162":"The UGA codon signals protein translation termination, but it can also be translated into selenocysteine (Sec, U) to produce selenocysteine-containing proteins (selenoproteins) by dedicated machinery. As Sec incorporation can fail, Sec-containing longer and Sec-lacking shorter proteins co-exist. Cul2-type ubiquitin ligases were recently shown to destabilize such truncated proteins; however, which ubiquitin ligase targets truncated proteins for degradation remained unclear. We report that the Cul5-type ubiquitin ligase KLHDC1 targets truncated SELENOS, a selenoprotein, for proteasomal degradation. SELENOS is involved in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation, which is linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and the knockdown of KLHDC1 in U2OS cells decreased ER stress-induced cell death. Knockdown of SELENOS increased the cell population with lower ROS levels. Our findings reveal that, in addition to Cul2-type ubiquitin ligases, KLHDC1 is involved in the elimination of truncated oxidoreductase-inactive SELENOS, which would be crucial for maintaining ROS levels and preventing cancer development.","3163":null,"3164":"The Suzuki-Miyaura coupling is a fundamentally important transformation in modern organic synthesis.

However, little is known about whether it plays a role in other types of tissue morphogenesis. Using an ascidian Halocynthia roretzi, we found that differently oriented cell divisions in the epidermis of the future trunk (anterior) and tail (posterior) regions create an hourglass-like epithelial bending between the two regions to shape the tailbud embryo. Our results show that posterior epidermal cells are polarized with dynein protein anteriorly localized, undergo dynein-dependent spindle rotation, and divide along the anteroposterior axis. This cell division facilitates constriction around the embryo's circumference only in the posterior region and epithelial bending formation. Our findings, therefore, provide an important insight into the role of oriented cell division in tissue morphogenesis.","3167":null,"3168":null,"3169":null,"3170":null,"3171":"The Cretaceous fossil record of amber provides a variety of evidence that is essential for greater understanding of early pollination strategies.

To counteract infections with viruses, bats have evolved enhanced mechanisms to limit virus replication and immunopathology. However, molecular and cellular drivers of antiviral responses in bats largely remain an enigma. In this study, we demonstrate that a serine residue in IRF3 is positively selected for in multiple bat species. IRF3 is a central regulator of innate antiviral responses in mammals. Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased antiviral protection in bat cells, whereas the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and functional evidence for enhanced IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiviral immune responses.","3174":"The SUSD4 (Sushi domain-containing protein 4) gene encodes a complement inhibitor that is frequently deleted in 1q41q42 microdeletion syndrome, a multisystem congenital disorder that includes neurodevelopmental abnormalities. To understand SUSD4's role in the mammalian nervous system, we analyzed Susd4 knockout (KO) mice. Susd4 KO mice exhibited significant defects in motor performance and significantly higher levels of anxiety-like behaviors. Susd4 KO brain had abnormal \"hairy\" basket cells surrounding Purkinje neurons within the cerebellum and significantly reduced dendritic spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells of wild-type mice were found to express Susd4 mRNA. Protein expression of the complement component C1q was increased in the brains of Susd4 KO mice. Our data indicate that SUSD4 plays an important role in neuronal functions, possibly via the complement pathway, and that SUSD4 deletion may contribute to the nervous system abnormalities in patients with 1q41q42 deletions.","3175":"The maintenance of the intestinal epithelium is ensured by the controlled proliferation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and differentiation of their progeny into various cell types, including enterocytes (ECs) that both mediate nutrient absorption and provide a barrier against pathogens. The signals that regulate transition of proliferative ISCs into differentiated ECs are not fully understood. IRBIT is an evolutionarily conserved protein that regulates ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), an enzyme critical for the generation of DNA precursors. Here, we show that IRBIT expression in ISC progeny within the Drosophila midgut epithelium cells regulates their differentiation via suppression of RNR activity. Disruption of this IRBIT-RNR regulatory circuit causes a premature loss of intestinal tissue integrity. Furthermore, age-related dysplasia can be reversed by suppression of RNR activity in ISC progeny. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a role of the IRBIT-RNR pathway in gut homeostasis.","3176":null,"3177":null,"3178":null,"3179":"Cell-cycle quiescence is a common feature of early germline development in many animal species. In Drosophila germline progenitors (pole cells), both G2\/M and G1\/S transitions are blocked. G2\/M transition is repressed by maternal Nanos through suppression of Cyclin B production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying blockage of G1\/S transition remains elusive. We found that repression of miR-10404 expression is required to block G1\/S transition in pole cells. Expression of miR-10404, a microRNA encoded within the internal transcribed spacer 1 of rDNA, is repressed in early pole cells by maternal polar granule component. This repression delays the degradation of maternal dacapo mRNA, which encodes an inhibitor of G1\/S transition. Moreover, derepression of G1\/S transition in pole cells causes defects in their maintenance and their migration into the gonads. Our observations reveal the mechanism inhibiting G1\/S transition in pole cells and its requirement for proper germline development.","3180":"Semiconductor\/Faradaic layer\/liquid junctions have been widely used in solar energy conversion and storage devices. However, the charge transfer mechanism of these junctions is still unclear, which leads to inconsistent results and low performance of these devices in previous studies. Herein, by using Fe2O3 and Ni(OH)2 as models, we precisely control the interface structure between the semiconductor and the Faradaic layer and investigate the charge transfer mechanism in the semiconductor\/Faradaic layer\/liquid junction. The results suggest that the short circuit severely restricts the performance of the junction for both solar water splitting cells and solar charging supercapacitors. More importantly, we also find that the charge-discharge potential window of a Faradaic material sensitively depends on the energy band positions of a semiconductor, which provides a new way to adjust the potential window of a Faradaic material. These new insights offer guidance to design high-performance devices for solar energy conversion and storage.","3181":null,"3182":"Many animals, including humans, have evolved to live and move in groups. In humans, disrupted social interactions are a fundamental feature of many psychiatric disorders. However, we know little about how genes regulate social behavior. Zebrafish may serve as a powerful model to explore this question. By comparing the behavior of wild-type fish with 90 mutant lines, we show that mutations of genes associated with human psychiatric disorders can alter the collective behavior of adult zebrafish. We identify three categories of behavioral variation across mutants: \"scattered,\" in which fish show reduced cohesion; \"coordinated,\" in which fish swim more in aligned schools; and \"huddled,\" in which fish form dense but disordered groups. Changes in individual interaction rules can explain these differences. This work demonstrates how emergent patterns in animal groups can be altered by genetic changes in individuals and establishes a framework for understanding the fundamentals of social information processing.","3183":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy in most parts of the world, but is endemic in some ethnic groups. The association of NPC with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is firmly established; however, the mechanism is still unclear. TLR9 is well known for its essential role in viral pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. Here, we report a set of TLR9 polymorphisms in the TIR-2 domain of the TLR9 protein collected from the EBV-infected NPC samples from northeast Indian populations sharing the aforesaid ethnicity. The occurrence of mutations is significantly high in these samples as we found a p value of &lt;0.0001 at a significance level of 0.05. These might play an important role for the lack of function of TLR9 and thus for the higher occurrence of EBV-mediated NPC in such ethnic groups.","3184":"Cancerous Inhibitor of Protein Phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is an oncogene and a potential cancer therapy target protein. Accordingly, a better understanding of the physiological function of CIP2A, especially in the context of immune cells, is a prerequisite for its exploitation in cancer therapy. Here, we report that CIP2A negatively regulates interleukin (IL)-17 production by Th17 cells in human and mouse. Interestingly, concomitant with increased IL-17 production, CIP2A-deficient Th17 cells had increased strength and duration of STAT3 phosphorylation. We analyzed the interactome of phosphorylated STAT3 in CIP2A-deficient and CIP2A-sufficient Th17 cells and indicated together with genome-wide gene expression profiling, a role of Acylglycerol Kinase (AGK) in the regulation of Th17 differentiation by CIP2A. We demonstrated that CIP2A regulates the strength of the interaction between AGK and STAT3, and thereby modulates STAT3 phosphorylation and expression of IL-17 in Th17 cells.","3185":"Repair of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) during lymphocyte development is essential for V(D)J recombination and forms the basis of immunoglobulin variable region diversity. Understanding of this process in lymphogenesis has historically been centered on the study of RAG1\/2 recombinases and a set of classical non-homologous end-joining factors. Much less has been reported regarding the role of chromatin modifications on this process. Here, we show a role for the non-redundant histone H3 lysine methyltransferase, Setd2, and its modification of lysine-36 trimethylation (H3K36me3), in the processing and joining of DNA ends during V(D)J recombination. Loss leads to mis-repair of Rag-induced DNA DSBs, especially when combined with loss of Atm kinase activity. Furthermore, loss reduces immune repertoire and a severe block in lymphogenesis as well as causes post-mitotic neuronal apoptosis. Together, these studies are suggestive of an important role of Setd2\/H3K36me3 in these two mammalian developmental processes that are influenced by double-stranded break repair.","3186":"Missense mutations may affect proteostasis by destabilizing or over-stabilizing protein complexes and changing the pathway flux. Predicting the effects of stabilizing mutations on protein-protein interactions is notoriously difficult because existing experimental sets are skewed toward mutations reducing protein-protein binding affinity and many computational methods fail to correctly evaluate their effects. To address this issue, we developed a method MutaBind2, which estimates the impacts of single as well as multiple mutations on protein-protein interactions. MutaBind2 employs only seven features, and the most important of them describe interactions of proteins with the solvent, evolutionary conservation of the site, and thermodynamic stability of the complex and each monomer. This approach shows a distinct improvement especially in evaluating the effects of mutations increasing binding affinity. MutaBind2 can be used for finding disease driver mutations, designing stable protein complexes, and discovering new protein-protein interaction inhibitors.","3187":"The design and development of specific recognition and sensing systems for biologically important anionic species has received growing attention in recent years, as they play significant roles in biology, pharmacy, and environmental sciences. Herein, a new supramolecular sensing probe L1 was developed for highly selective differentiation of nucleotides. L1 displayed extremely marked absorption and emission differentiation upon binding with nucleotide homologs of AMP, ADP, and ATP, due to the divergent spatial orientations of guests upon binding, which allowed for a naked-eye colorimetric differentiation for nucleotides. A differentiating mechanism was unambiguously rationalized by using various spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrated that L1 can be applied to the real-time monitoring of the enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation\/dephosphorylation processes and thus demonstrated an unprecedented visualizable strategy for selectively differentiating the structurally similar nucleotides and real-time monitoring of biological processes via fluorescent and colorimetric changes.","3188":"Seeds are central to plant life cycle and to human nutrition, functioning as the major supplier of human population energy intake. To understand better the roles of enzymic writers and erasers of the epigenetic marks, in particular, histone ubiquitylation and the corresponding histone modifiers, involved in control of seed development, we identified the otubain-like cysteine protease OTU1 as a histone deubiquitinase involved in transcriptional repression of the DA1 and DA2 genes known to regulate seed and organ size in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutants of OTU1 accumulate H2B monoubiquitylation and such euchromatic marks as H3 trimethylation and hyperacetylation in the DA1 and DA2 chromatin. These data advance our knowledge about epigenetic regulation of the DA1 and DA2 genes by recognizing OTU1 as a member of a putative repressor complex that negatively regulates their transcription.","3189":"Performance-stability contradiction of high-energy-density materials (HEDMs) is a long-standing puzzle in the field of chemistry and material science. Bridging the gap that exists between detonation performance of new HEDMs and their stability remains a formidable challenge. Achieving optimal balance between the two contradictory factors is of a significant demand for deep-well oil and gas drilling, space exploration, and other civil and defense applications. Herein, supercomputers and latest quantitative computational strategies were employed and high-throughput quantum calculations were conducted for 67 reported HEDMs. Based on statistical analysis of large amounts of physico-chemical data, in-crystal interspecies interactions were identified to be the one that provokes the performance-stability contradiction of HEDMs. To design new HEDMs with both good detonation performance and high stability, the proposed systematic and comprehensive strategies must be satisfied, which could promote the development of crystal engineering of HEDMs to an era of theory-guided rational design of materials.","3190":null,"3191":"Parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking interneurons (PV-INs) control network firing and the gain of cortical response to sensory stimulation. Crucial for these functions, PV-INs can sustain high-frequency firing with no accommodation. However, PV-INs also exhibit short-term depression (STD) during sustained activation, largely due to the depletion of synaptic resources (vesicles). In most synapses the rate of replenishment of depleted vesicles is constant, determining an inverse relationship between depression levels and the activation rate, which theoretically, severely limits rate-coding capabilities. We examined STD of the PV-IN to pyramidal cell synapse in the mouse visual cortex and found that in these synapses the recovery from depression is not constant but increases linearly with the frequency of use. By combining modeling, dynamic clamp, and optogenetics, we demonstrated that this recovery enables PV-INs to reduce pyramidal cell firing in a linear manner, which theoretically is crucial for controlling the gain of cortical visual responses.","3192":null,"3193":"Pathogenic bacteria secrete virulence factors that interact with the human host to establish infections. The human immune system evolved multiple mechanisms to fight bacterial invaders, including immune proteases that were demonstrated to contribute crucially to antibacterial defense. Here we show that granzyme B degrades multiple secreted virulence mediators from Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, and Mycobacteria tuberculosis. Pathogenic bacteria, when infected in the presence of granzyme B or granzyme-secreting killer cells, fail to grow in human macrophages and epithelial cells owing to their crippled virulence. A granzyme B-uncleavable mutant form of the major Listeria virulence factor, listeriolysin O, rescued the virulence defect in response to granzyme treatment. Hence, we link the degradation of a single factor with the observed decrease in virulent bacteria growth. Overall, we reveal here an innate immune barrier function of granzyme B by disrupting bacterial virulence to facilitate bacteria clearance by bystander immune and non-immune cells.","3194":"Mice overexpressing the nuclear form of CREBH mainly in the liver (CREBH-Tg) showed suppression of high-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) diet-induced obesity accompanied by an increase in plasma fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) levels. CREBH overexpression induced browning in inguinal white adipose tissue (WAT) and whole-body energy expenditure, which was canceled in Fgf21-\/- mice. Deficiency of FGF21 in CREBH-Tg mice mostly canceled the improvement of obesity, but the suppression of inflammation of epidermal WAT, amelioration of insulin resistance, and improvement of glucose metabolism still sustained. Kisspeptin 1 (Kiss1) was identified as a novel hormone target for CREBH to explain these FGF21-independent effects of CREBH. Knockdown of Kiss1 in HFHS-fed CREBH-Tg Fgf21-\/- mice showed partially canceled improvement of glucose metabolism. Taken together, we propose that hepatic CREBH pleiotropically improves diet-induced obesity-mediated dysfunctions in peripheral tissues by improving systemic energy metabolism in FGF21-dependent and FGF21-independent mechanisms.","3195":null,"3196":"The power of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) stems from its ability to uncover cell type-dependent phenotypes, which rests on the accuracy of cell type identification. However, resolving cell types within and, thus, comparison of scRNA-seq data across conditions is challenging owing to technical factors such as sparsity, low number of cells, and batch effect. To address these challenges, we developed scID (Single Cell IDentification), which uses the Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis-like framework to identify transcriptionally related cell types between scRNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of scID relative to existing methods on several published datasets. By increasing power to identify transcriptionally similar cell types across datasets with batch effect, scID enhances investigator's ability to integrate and uncover development-, disease-, and perturbation-associated changes in scRNA-seq data.","3197":"The mammalian cochlea is one of the least accessible organs for drug delivery. Systemic administration of many drugs is severely limited by the blood-labyrinth barrier. Local intratympanic administration into the middle ear would be a preferable option in this case, and the only option for many newly emerging classes of drugs, but it leads to the formation of drug concentration gradients along the extensive, narrow cochlea. The gradients are orders of magnitude and well outside the therapeutic windows. Here we present an efficient, quick, and simple method of cochlear pumping, through large-amplitude, low-frequency reciprocal oscillations of the stapes and round window, which can consistently and uniformly deliver drugs along the entire length of the intact cochlea within minutes without disrupting the cochlear boundaries. The method should facilitate novel ways of approaching the treatment of inner ear disorders because it overcomes the challenge of delivering therapeutics along the entire cochlear length.","3198":"Cyanobacteriochrome (CBCRs) photoreceptors show various photochemical properties, but their ecophysiological functions remain elusive. Here, we report that the blue\/green CBCRs SesA\/B\/C can serve as physiological sensors of cell density. Because cyanobacterial cells show lower transmittance of blue light than green light, higher cell density gives more green-light-enriched irradiance to cells. The cell-density-dependent suppression of cell aggregation under blue-\/green-mixed light and white light conditions support this idea. Such a sensing mechanism may provide information about the cell position in cyanobacterial mats in hot springs, the natural habitat of Thermosynechococcus. This cell-position-dependent SesA\/B\/C-mediated regulation of cellular sessility (aggregation) might be ecophysiologically essential for the reorganization and growth of phototrophic mats. We also report that the green-light-induced dispersion of cell aggregates requires red-light-driven photosynthesis. Blue\/green CBCRs might work as shade detectors in a different niche than red\/far-red phytochromes, which may be why CBCRs have evolved in cyanobacteria.","3199":"Many cancer vaccines are not successful in clinical trials, mainly due to the challenges associated with breaking immune tolerance. Herein, we report a new strategy using an adjuvant-protein-antigen (three-in-one protein conjugates with built-in adjuvant) as an anticancer vaccine, in which both the adjuvant (small-molecule TLR7 agonist) and tumor-associated antigen (mucin 1, MUC1) are covalently conjugated to the same carrier protein (BSA). It is shown that the protein conjugates with built-in adjuvant can increase adjuvant's stimulation, prevent adjuvant's systemic toxicities, facilitate the codelivery of adjuvants and antigens, and enhance humoral and cellular immune responses. The IgG antibody titers elicited by the self-adjuvanting three-in-one protein conjugates were significantly higher than those elicited by the vaccine mixed with TLR7 agonist (more than 15-fold) or other traditional adjuvants. Importantly, the potent immune responses against cancer cells suggest that this new vaccine construct is an effective strategy for the personalized antitumor immunotherapy.","3200":"The phenomenon of protein misfolding and aggregation is associated with a wide range of neurodegenerative conditions that cause progressive loss of function in specific regions of the human brain. To understand the causes of the selective cell and tissue vulnerability to the formation of these deposits, we analyzed the ability of different cell and tissue types to respond, in the absence of disease, to the presence of high levels of aggregation-prone proteins. By performing a transcriptional analysis, we found that the protein homeostasis system that regulates protein aggregation is weaker in neurons than in other cell types and in brain tissues than in other body tissues. These results suggest that the intrinsic level of regulation of protein aggregation in the healthy state is correlated with the selective vulnerability of cells and tissues to protein misfolding diseases.","3201":null,"3202":"The juvenile phase is characterized by continuously progressing physiological processes such as growth and maturation, which are accompanied by transitions in gene expression. The contribution of transcriptome dynamics to the establishment of juvenile properties remains unclear. Here, we investigated alternative splicing (AS) events in postnatal growth and elucidated the landscape of age-dependent alternative splicing (ADAS) in C57BL\/6 mice. Our analysis of ADAS in the cerebral cortex, cardiomyocytes, and hepatocytes revealed numerous juvenile-specific splicing isoforms that shape the juvenile transcriptome, which in turn functions as a basis for the highly anabolic status of juvenile cells. Mechanistically, the juvenile-expressed splicing factor Srsf7 mediates ADAS, as exemplified by switching from juvenile to adult forms of anabolism-associated genes Eif4a2 and Rbm7. Suppression of Srsf7 results in \"fast-forwarding\" of this transcriptome transition, causing impaired anabolism and growth in mice. Thus, juvenile-specific AS is indispensable for the anabolic state of juveniles and differentiates juveniles from adults.","3203":"Long decoherence time is a key consideration for molecular magnets in the application of the quantum computation. Although previous studies have shown that the local symmetry of spin carriers plays a crucial part in the spin-lattice relaxation process, its role in the spin decoherence is still unclear. Herein, two nine-coordinated capped square antiprism neodymium moieties [Nd(CO3)4H2O]5- with slightly different local symmetries, C1 versus C4 (1 and 2), are reported, which feature in the easy-plane magnetic anisotropy as shown by the high-frequency electron paramagnetic resonance (HF-EPR) studies. Detailed analysis of the relaxation time suggests that the phonon bottleneck effect is essential to the magnetic relaxation in the crystalline samples of 1 and 2. The 240 GHz Pulsed EPR studies show that the higher symmetry results in longer decoherence times, which is supported by the first principle calculations.","3204":"Polyketides produced by modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) are important small molecules widely used as drugs, pesticides, and biological probes. Tagging these polyketides with a clickable functionality enables the visualization, diversification, and mode of action study through bio-orthogonal chemistry. We report the de novo biosynthesis of alkyne-tagged polyketides by modular type I PKSs through starter unit engineering. Specifically, we use JamABC, a terminal alkyne biosynthetic machinery from the jamaicamide B biosynthetic pathway, in combination with representative modular PKSs. We demonstrate that JamABC works as a trans loading system for engineered type I PKSs to produce alkyne-tagged polyketides. In addition, the production efficiency can be improved by enhancing the interactions between the carrier protein (JamC) and PKSs using docking domains and site-directed mutagenesis of JamC. This work thus provides engineering guidelines and strategies that are applicable to additional modular type I PKSs to produce targeted alkyne-tagged metabolites for chemical and biological applications.","3205":"Limited knowledge exists on the quality of polyclonal antibody response generated following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection compared with vaccination. Polyclonal antibody repertoire in plasma following EBOV infection in survivors was compared with ChAd3-MVA prime-boost human vaccination. Higher antibody binding and affinity to GP was observed in survivors compared with vaccinated plasma that correlated with EBOV neutralization. Surprisingly, a predominant IgM response was generated after prime-boost vaccination, whereas survivors demonstrated IgG-dominant antibody response. EBOV infection induced more diverse antibody epitope repertoire compared with vaccination. A strong binding to antigenic sites in the fusion peptide and another in the highly conserved GP2-HR2 domain was preferentially recognized by EBOV survivors than vaccinated individuals that correlated strongly with EBOV neutralization titers. These findings will help development and evaluation of effective Ebola countermeasures including therapeutics and vaccines.","3206":null,"3207":null,"3208":null,"3209":"Advances in microfabrication technologies and biomaterials have enabled a growing class of electronic devices that can stimulate and record bioelectronic signals. Many of these devices have been developed for humans or vertebrate animals, where miniaturization allows for implantation within the body. There are, however, another class of bioelectronic interfaces that exploit microfabrication and nanoelectronics to record signals from tiny, millimeter-sized organisms. In these cases, rather than implanting a device inside an animal, animals themselves are loaded in large numbers into bioelectronic devices for neural circuit and behavioral interrogation. These scalable interfaces provide platforms to develop new therapeutics as well as better understand basic principles of bioelectronic communication, neuroscience, and behavior. Here we review recent progress in these bioelectronic technologies and describe how they can complement on-chip optical, mechanical, and chemical interrogation methods to achieve high-throughput, multimodal studies of millimeter-sized small animals.","3210":null,"3211":"Ten-eleven translocation (Tet) enzymes are involved in DNA demethylation, important in regulating embryo development, stem cell pluripotency and tumorigenesis. Alterations of DNA methylation with age have been shown in various somatic cell types. We investigated whether Tet1 and Tet2 regulate aging. We showed that Tet1-deficient mice undergo a progressive reduction of spermatogonia stem cells and spermatogenesis and thus accelerated infertility with age. Tet1 deficiency decreases 5hmC levels in spermatogonia and downregulates a subset of genes important for cell cycle, germ cell differentiation, meiosis and reproduction, such as Ccna1 and Spo11, resulting in premature reproductive aging. Moreover, Tet1 and 5hmC both regulate signaling pathways key for stem cell development, including Wnt and PI3K-Akt, autophagy and stress response genes. In contrast, effect of Tet2 deficiency on male reproductive aging is minor. Hence, Tet1 maintains spermatogonia stem cells with age, revealing an important role of Tet1 in regulating stem cell aging.","3212":null,"3213":null,"3214":null,"3215":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short non-coding RNAs that function in RNA silencing and post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, direct characterization of miRNA is challenging due to its unique properties such as its low abundance, sequence similarities, and short length. Although urgently needed, single molecule sequencing of miRNA has never been demonstrated, to the best of our knowledge. Nanopore-induced phase-shift sequencing (NIPSS), which is a variant form of nanopore sequencing, could directly sequence any short analytes including miRNA. In practice, NIPSS clearly discriminates between different identities, isoforms, and epigenetic variants of model miRNA sequences. This work thus demonstrates direct sequencing of miRNA, which serves as a complement to existing miRNA sensing routines by the introduction of the single molecule resolution. Future engineering of this technique may assist miRNA-based early stage diagnosis or inspire novel cancer therapeutics.","3216":"In this perspective we compare plasmon-enhanced electrochemical conversion (PEEC) with photoelectrochemistry (PEC). PEEC is the oxidation or reduction of a reactant at the illuminated surface of a plasmonic metal (or other conductive material) while a potential bias is applied. PEC uses solar light to generate photoexcited electron-hole pairs to drive an electrochemical reaction at a biased or unbiased semiconductor photoelectrode. The mechanism of photoexcitation of charge carriers is different between PEEC and PEC. Here we explore how this difference affects the response of PEEC and PEC systems to changes in light, temperature, and surface morphology of the photoelectrode.","3217":"Altered states of embodiment are fundamental to the scientific understanding of bodily self consciousness. The feeling of disembodiment during everyday activities is common to clinical conditions; however, the direct study of disembodiment in experimental setups is rare compared to the extensive investigation of illusory embodiment of an external object. Using mixed reality to modulate embodiment through temporally mismatching sensory signals from the own body, we assessed how such mismatches affect phenomenal and physiological aspects of embodiment and measured perceptual thresholds for these across multimodal signals. The results of a principal component analysis suggest that multimodal mismatches generally induce disembodiment by increasing the sense of disownership and deafference and decreasing embodiment; however, this was not generally reflected in physiological changes. Although visual delay decreased embodiment both during active movement and passive touch, the effect was stronger for the former. We discuss the relevance of these findings for understanding bodily self plasticity.","3218":"The formation of biofilm facilitates the synthesis of valuable natural product menaquinone-7 (MK-7) in static culture of Bacillus subtilis, whereas the essential role and mechanism of biofilm in MK-7 synthesis have not been revealed. Herein, comparative transcriptomics show that the formation of biofilm affected MK-7 synthesis by changing the transcription levels of signal receptor (BSU02010), transmembrane transporter (BSU29340, BSU03070), and signal transduction (BSU02630). Moreover, we also found that oxalate decarboxylase OxdC has an important effect on electron generation and MK-7 synthesis, when the transcriptional level of NADH dehydrogenase decreases in static culture. Our results revealed that cell membrane and electron transfer are important factors in promoting MK-7 synthesis.","3219":"One of the remaining challenges to describing an individual's genetic variation lies in the highly heterogeneous and complex genomic regions that impede the use of classical reference-guided mapping and assembly approaches. Once such region is the Immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGH), which is critical for the development of antibodies and the adaptive immune system. We describe ImmunoTyper, the first PacBio-based genotyping and copy number calling tool specifically designed for IGH V genes (IGHV). We demonstrate that ImmunoTyper's multi-stage clustering and combinatorial optimization approach represents the most comprehensive IGHV genotyping approach published to date, through validation using gold-standard IGH reference sequence. This preliminary work establishes the feasibility of fine-grained genotype and copy number analysis using error-prone long reads in complex multi-gene loci and opens the door for in-depth investigation into IGHV heterogeneity using accessible and increasingly common whole-genome sequence.","3220":"Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) is a powerful technique that enables relatively deep proteomic profiling with superior quantification reproducibility. DIA data mining predominantly relies on a spectral library of sufficient proteome coverage that, in most cases, is built on data-dependent acquisition-based analysis of the same sample. To expand the proteome coverage for a pre-determined protein family, we report herein on the construction of a hybrid spectral library that supplements a DIA experiment-derived library with a protein family-targeted virtual library predicted by deep learning. Leveraging this DIA hybrid library substantially deepens the coverage of three transmembrane protein families (G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and transporters) in mouse brain tissues with increases in protein identification of 37%-87% and peptide identification of 58%-161%. Moreover, of the 412 novel GPCR peptides exclusively identified with the DIA hybrid library strategy, 53.6% were validated as present in mouse brain tissues based on orthogonal experimental measurement.","3221":null,"3222":"Long-term care facilities are significant reservoirs of antimicrobial-resistant organisms, and patients with advanced dementia are particularly vulnerable to multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) acquisition and antimicrobial overuse. In this study, we longitudinally examined a group of patients with advanced dementia using metagenomic sequencing. We found significant inter- and intra-subject heterogeneity in microbiota composition, suggesting temporal instability. We also observed a link between the antimicrobial resistance gene density in a sample and the relative abundances of several pathobionts, particularly Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, and used this relationship to predict resistance gene density in samples from additional subjects. Furthermore, we used metagenomic assembly to demonstrate that these pathobionts had higher resistance gene content than many gut commensals. Given the frequency and abundances at which these pathobionts were found in this population and the underlying vulnerability to MDRO of patients with advanced dementia, attention to microbial blooms of these species may be warranted.","3223":"Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most widely used materials in the world, but it is virtually undegradable and quickly accumulates in nature, which may contaminate the environment. We utilized the cobalt-mediated radical copolymerization (CMRP) of ethylene and cyclic ketene acetals (CKAs) to effectively incorporate ester groups into PE backbone as cleavable structures to make PE-based copolymer degradable under mild conditions. The content of ethylene and ester units in the produced copolymer could be finely regulated by CKA concentration or ethylene pressure. Also, the copolymerization of ethylene and CKA with other functional vinyl monomers can produce functional and degradable PE-based copolymer. All the formed PE-based copolymers could degrade in the presence of trimethylamine (Et3N).","3224":null,"3225":"Among diverse stalked barnacles, Rugilepas pearsei (Thoracica: Cirripedia: Arthropoda) is a rare unique species that is associated with echinoids and has highly atrophied cirri. We rediscovered the barnacle for the first time from description and verified that the barnacles live obligately in half-open galls formed on the test of the sea urchin Echinothrix diadema (Diadematidae: Echinodermata). A molecular phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the obligate association with echinoids derived from epizoic life on crustaceans. A stable isotope analysis suggests that the barnacle feeds on particulate organic matter (POM) without parasitizing the host echinoids. These findings suggest that the host shift caused losses of plates and feather-like cirri, changes in the attachment device from cementation to anchoring, and a shift in feeding mode from filter feeding to POM collection. The barnacle's epizoic, superficially sub-endozoic, communal life in stout but narrow galls causes repetitive reproduction at the cost of reduced growth.","3226":null,"3227":"SynNotch receptor technology is a versatile tool that uses the regulatory notch core portion with an extracellular scFv and an intracellular transcription factor that enables to program customized input and output functions in mammalian cells. In this study, we designed a novel synNotch receptor comprising scFv against HBs antigen linked with an intracellular artificial transcription factor and exploited it for viral sensing and cellular immunotherapy. The synNotch receptor expressing cells sensed HBV particles and membrane-bound HBs antigens and responded by expressing reporter molecules, secNL or GFP. We also programmed these cells to dispense antiviral responses such as type I interferon and anti-HBV neutralizing mouse-human chimeric antibodies. Our data reveal that synNotch receptor signaling works for membrane-bound ligands such as enveloped viral particles and proteins borne on liposomal vesicles. This study establishes the concepts of \"engineered immunity\" where the synNotch platform is utilized for cellular immunotherapy against viral infections.","3228":"Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) method is widely used in investigating protein structures in solution, but high-quality 3D model reconstructions are challenging. We present a new algorithm based on a deep learning method for model reconstruction from SAXS data. An auto-encoder for protein 3D models was trained to compress 3D shape information into vectors of a 200-dimensional latent space, and the vectors are optimized using genetic algorithms to build 3D models that are consistent with the scattering data. The program has been tested with experimental SAXS data, demonstrating the capacity and robustness of accurate model reconstruction. Furthermore, the model size information can be optimized using this algorithm, enhancing the automation in model reconstruction directly from SAXS data. The program was implemented using Python with the TensorFlow framework, with source code and webserver available from http:\/\/liulab.csrc.ac.cn\/decodeSAXS.","3229":null,"3230":null,"3231":"Emerging evidence demonstrates that radiotherapy induces immunogenic death on tumor cells that emit immunostimulating signals resulting in tumor-specific immune responses. However, the impact of tumor features and microenvironmental factors on the efficacy of radiation-induced immunity remains to be elucidated. Herein, we use a calibrated model of tumor-effector cell interactions to investigate the potential benefits and immunological consequences of radiotherapy. Simulations analysis suggests that radiotherapy success depends on the functional tumor vascularity extent and reveals that the pre-treatment tumor size is not a consistent determinant of treatment outcomes. The one-size-fits-all approach of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy is predicted to result in some overtreated patients. In addition, model simulations also suggest that an arbitrary increase in treatment duration does not necessarily result in better tumor control. This study highlights the potential benefits of tumor-immune ecosystem profiling during treatment planning to better harness the immunogenic potential of radiotherapy.","3232":"Ventral hippocampus (vHIP) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are both critical regions for social behaviors. However, how their interactions affect social behavior is not well understood. By viral tracing, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and fiber photometry, we demonstrated that inhibition of vHIP or direct projections from vHIP to mPFC impaired social memory expression. Via rabies retrograde tracing, we found that all three major GABAergic neurons in mPFC received direct inputs from vHIP. Activation of parvalbumin positive (PV+) neurons in mPFC but not somatostatin positive (SST+) neurons can rescue the social memory impairment caused by vHIP inhibition. Furthermore, fiber photometry results demonstrated that social behaviors preferentially recruited PV+ neurons and inhibition of hippocampal neurons disrupted the activity of PV+ neurons during social interactions. These results revealed a new mechanism of how vHIP and mPFC regulate social behavior in complementarity with the existing neural circuitry mechanism.","3233":"By investigating the long-term observations at Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP), we find that the routinely used Beer-Bouguer-Lambert law and the models that empirically separate direct normal irradiance (DNI) from measurements of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) have dramatic and unexpected bias in computing cloudy-sky DNI. This bias has led to tremendous uncertainty in estimating the electricity generation by solar energy conversion systems. To effectively reduce the bias, this study proposes a physical solution of all-sky DNI that computes solar radiation in the infinite-narrow beam along the sun direction and the scattered radiation falls within the circumsolar region. In sharp contrast with the other DNI models, this method uses a finite-surface integration algorithm that computes solar radiation in differential solid angles and efficiently infers its contribution to a surface perpendicular to the sun direction. The new model substantially reduces the uncertainty in DNI by a factor of 2-7.","3234":null,"3235":"Core components of plastid protein import and the principle of using N-terminal targeting sequences are conserved across the Archaeplastida, but lineage-specific differences exist. Here we compare, in light of plastid protein import, the response to high-light stress from representatives of the three archaeplastidal groups. Similar to land plants, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii displays a broad response to high-light stress, not observed to the same degree in the glaucophyte Cyanophora paradoxa or the rhodophyte Porphyridium purpureum. We find that only the Chloroplastida encode both Toc75 and Oep80 in parallel and suggest that elaborate high-light stress response is supported by changes in plastid protein import. We propose the origin of a phenylalanine-independent import pathway via Toc75 allowed higher import rates to rapidly service high-light stress, but with the cost of reduced specificity. Changes in plastid protein import define the origin of the green lineage, whose greatest evolutionary success was arguably the colonization of land.","3236":"The characterization of mutational processes in terms of their signatures of activity relies mostly on the assumption that mutations in a given cancer genome are independent of one another. Recently, it was discovered that certain segments of mutations, termed processive groups, occur on the same DNA strand and are generated by a single process or signature. Here we provide a first probabilistic model of mutational signatures that accounts for their observed stickiness and strand coordination. The model conditions on the observed strand for each mutation and allows the same signature to generate a run of mutations. It can both use known signatures or learn new ones. We show that this model provides a more accurate description of the properties of mutagenic processes than independent-mutation achieving substantially higher likelihood on held-out data. We apply this model to characterize the processivity of mutagenic processes across multiple types of cancer.","3237":"","3238":null,"3239":"Although a variety of remarkable molecular tools for studying neural circuits have recently been developed, the ability to deploy them in particular neuronal subtypes is limited by the fact that native promoters are almost never specific enough. We recently showed that one can generate transgenic mice with anatomical specificity surpassing that of native promoters by combining enhancers uniquely active in particular brain regions with a heterologous minimal promoter, an approach we call EDGE (Enhancer-Driven Gene Expression). Here we extend this strategy to the generation of viral (rAAV) vectors, showing that some EDGE rAAVs can recapitulate the specificity of the corresponding transgenic lines in wild-type animals, even of another species. This approach thus holds the promise of enabling circuit-specific manipulations in wild-type animals, not only enhancing our understanding of brain function, but perhaps one day even providing novel therapeutic avenues to approach disorders of the brain.","3240":"Natural products account for more than 50% of all small-molecule pharmaceutical agents currently in clinical use. However, low availability often becomes problematic when a bioactive natural product is promising to become a pharmaceutical or leading compound. Advances in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering provide a feasible solution for sustainable supply of these compounds. In this review, we have summarized current progress in engineering yeast cell factories for production of natural products, including terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenylpropanoids. We then discuss advanced strategies in metabolic engineering at three different dimensions, including point, line, and plane (corresponding to the individual enzymes and cofactors, metabolic pathways, and the global cellular network). In particular, we comprehensively discuss how to engineer cofactor biosynthesis for enhancing the biosynthesis efficiency, other than the enzyme activity. Finally, current challenges and perspective are also discussed for future engineering direction.","3241":null,"3242":null,"3243":"The axon initial segment (AIS) cytoskeleton undergoes rapid and irreversible disruption prior to cell death after injury, and loss of AIS integrity can produce profound neurological effects on the nervous system. Here we described a previously unrecognized mechanism for ischemia-induced alterations in AIS integrity. We show that in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons Nav1.6 mostly preserves at the AIS after disruption of the cytoskeleton in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Genetic removal of neurofascin-186 leads to rapid disruption of Nav1.6 following injury, indicating that neurofascin is required for Nav1.6 maintenance at the AIS after cytoskeleton collapse. Importantly, calcineurin inhibition with FK506 fully protects AIS integrity and sufficiently prevents impairments of spatial learning and memory from injury. This study provides evidence that calcineurin activation is primarily involved in initiating disassembly of the AIS cytoskeleton and that maintaining AIS integrity is crucial for therapeutic strategies to facilitate recovery from injury.","3244":null,"3245":"Re-establishing normal binocular visual processing is the key to amblyopia recovery beyond the critical period of visual development. Here, by combining perceptual learning, behavioral testing, and steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs), we examined how monocular perceptual learning in the amblyopic eye could change binocular visual processing in the adolescent and adult amblyopic visual system. We found that training reduced the interocular difference between amblyopic and fellow eyes and increased the amplitude of a binocular SSVEP component, with a significant negative correlation between the two measures. Our results demonstrate that training in the amblyopic eye primarily improves binocular rather than monocular visual processing in the amblyopic visual system, suggesting that behavioral training could potentially address key neural deficits in adolescent and adult amblyopia.","3246":"Mechanical forces are known to be involved in various biological processes. However, it remains unclear whether brain functions are mechanically regulated under physiological conditions. Here, we demonstrate that treadmill running and passive head motion (PHM), both of which produce mechanical impact on the head, have similar effects on the hallucinogenic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtype 2A (5-HT2A) signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rodents. PHM generates interstitial fluid movement that is estimated to exert shear stress of a few pascals on cells in the PFC. Fluid shear stress of a relevant magnitude on cultured neuronal cells induces ligand-independent internalization of 5-HT2A receptor, which is observed in mouse PFC neurons after treadmill running or PHM. Furthermore, inhibition of interstitial fluid movement by introducing polyethylene glycol hydrogel eliminates the effect of PHM on 5-HT2A receptor signaling in the PFC. Our findings indicate that neuronal cell function can be physiologically regulated by mechanical forces in the brain.","3247":null,"3248":null,"3249":"Although the dynamic features of type I coherent feedforward loop (C1-FFL) has been well studied, how C1-FFL shapes cell-to-cell heterogeneity remains unclear. Here, we found that C1-FFL with OR logic serves as \"noise reducer,\" whereas C1-FFL with AND logic functions as \"noise propagator\" to fine-tune the heterogeneity of signaling molecule's activation. Within Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway, we demonstrated that MyD88 together with TRIF generates a C1-FFL to control TBK1 phosphorylation and reduce its cell-to-cell heterogeneity, whereas noisy TRIF activation induced high heterogeneity of IRF3 activation through another C1-FFL. We further developed a mathematical model with dual C1-FFLs to uncover how MyD88 and TRIF encoded differential dynamics for TBK1 and IRF3 activation. Integration of dual FFLs drives MyD88-TBK1 axis to determine the specificity of IFN-stimulated genes transcription. Collectively, our work elucidates a paradigm that tunable TLR4-mediated type I IFN responses are subtly controlled by dual FFLs.","3250":"Despite many years of work on dopaminergic mechanisms of alcohol addiction, much of the evidence remains mostly correlative in nature. Fortunately, recent technological advances have provided the opportunity to explore the causal role of alterations in neurotransmission within circuits involved in addictive behaviors. Here, we address this critical gap in our knowledge by integrating an optogenetic approach and an operant alcohol self-administration paradigm to assess directly how accumbal dopamine (DA) release dynamics influences the appetitive (seeking) component of alcohol-drinking behavior. We show that appetitive reward-seeking behavior in rats trained to self-administer alcohol can be shaped causally by ventral tegmental area-nucleus accumbens (VTA-NAc) DA neurotransmission. Our findings reveal that phasic patterns of DA release within this circuit enhance a discrete measure of alcohol seeking, whereas tonic patterns of stimulation inhibit this behavior. Moreover, we provide mechanistic evidence that tonic-phasic interplay within the VTA-NAc DA circuit underlies these seemingly paradoxical effects.","3251":"Recent advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have facilitated the classification of thousands of cells through transcriptome profiling, wherein accurate cell type identification is critical for mechanistic studies. In most current analysis protocols, cell type-based cluster annotation is manually performed and heavily relies on prior knowledge, resulting in poor replicability of cell type annotation. This study aimed to introduce a single-cell Cluster-based Automatic Annotation Toolkit for Cellular Heterogeneity (scCATCH, https:\/\/github.com\/ZJUFanLab\/scCATCH). Using three benchmark datasets, the feasibility of evidence-based scoring and tissue-specific cellular annotation strategies were demonstrated by high concordance among cell types, and scCATCH outperformed Seurat, a popular method for marker genes identification, and cell-based annotation methods. Furthermore, scCATCH accurately annotated 67%-100% (average, 83%) clusters in six published scRNA-seq datasets originating from various tissues. The present results show that scCATCH accurately revealed cell identities with high reproducibility, thus potentially providing insights into mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and progression.","3252":"Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are widely used to clinically detect cardiac arrhythmias (CAs). They are also being used to develop computer-assisted methods for heart disease diagnosis. We have developed a convolution neural network model to detect and classify CAs, using a large 12-lead ECG dataset (6,877 recordings) provided by the China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) 2018. Our model, which was ranked first in the challenge competition, achieved a median overall F1-score of 0.84 for the nine-type CA classification of CPSC2018's hidden test set of 2,954 ECG recordings. Further analysis showed that concurrent CAs were adequately predictive for 476 patients with multiple types of CA diagnoses in the dataset. Using only single-lead data yielded a performance that was only slightly worse than using the full 12-lead data, with leads aVR and V1 being the most prominent. We extensively consider these results in the context of their agreement with and relevance to clinical observations.","3253":null,"3254":"Protein drugs own a large share in the market and hold great prospects for the treatment of many diseases. However, the available protein drugs are limited to the extracellular target, owing to the inefficient transduction and activity modulation of proteins targeting intracellular environment. In this study, we constructed ATP-charged platforms to overcome the above-mentioned barriers for cancer theranostics. The phenylboronic acid-modified polycations (PCD) were synthesized to assemble with enzymes and shield its activity in the blood circulation. When the PCD nanoclusters reached tumor site, they effectively transported the enzymes into the cells, followed by recovering its catalytic activity after being charged with ATP. Importantly, the cascaded enzyme systems (GOx&amp;HRPA) selectively induced starvation therapy as well as photoacoustic imaging of tumor. Our results revealed that the intelligent nanoclusters were broadly applicable for protein transduction and enzyme activity modulation, which could accelerate the clinical translation of protein drugs toward intracellular target.","3255":null,"3256":"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive subtype of breast cancer lacking targeted therapies. This is attributed to its high heterogeneity that complicates elucidation of its molecular aberrations. Here, we report identification of specific proteome expression profiles pertaining to two TNBC subclasses, basal A and basal B, through in-depth proteomics analysis of breast cancer cells. We observed that kinases and proteases displayed unique expression patterns within the subclasses. Systematic analyses of protein-protein interaction and co-regulation networks of these kinases and proteases unraveled dysregulated pathways and plausible targets for each TNBC subclass. Among these, we identified kinases AXL, PEAK1, and TGFBR2 and proteases FAP, UCHL1, and MMP2\/14 as specific targets for basal B subclass, which represents the more aggressive TNBC cell lines. Our study highlights intricate mechanisms and distinct targets within TNBC and emphasizes that these have to be exploited in a subclass-specific manner rather than a one-for-all TNBC therapy.","3257":null,"3258":null,"3259":null,"3260":"The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway senses unfolded proteins and regulates proteostasis and cell fate through activity of the transcription factors ATF4, ATF6, and XBP1 within a complex network of three main branches. Here, we investigated contributions of the three branches to UPR activity in single cells using microscopy-based quantification and dynamic modeling. BAC-GFP HepG2 reporter cell lines were exposed to tunicamycin, and activation of various UPR components was monitored for 24 h. We constructed a dynamic model to describe the adaptive UPR signaling network, for which incorporation of all three branches was required to match the data. Our calibrated model suggested that ATF6 shapes the early dynamics of pro-apoptotic CHOP. We confirmed this hypothesis by measurements beyond 24 h, by perturbing single siRNA knockdowns and by ATF6 measurements. Overall, our work indicates that ATF6 is an important regulator of CHOP, which in turn regulates cell fate decisions.","3261":"Polarized distribution of organelles and molecules inside a cell is vital for a range of cellular processes and its loss is frequently encountered in disease. Polarization during planar cell migration is a special condition in which cellular orientation is triggered by cell-cell contact. We demonstrate that the protein Daple (CCDC88C) is a component of cell junctions in epithelial cells which serves like a cellular \"compass\" for establishing and maintaining contact-triggered planar polarity. Furthermore, these processes may be mediated through interaction with the polarity regulator PARD3. This interaction, mediated by Daple's PDZ-binding motif (PBM) and the third PDZ domain of PARD3, is fine-tuned by tyrosine phosphorylation on Daple's PBM by receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src. Hypophosphorylation strengthens the interaction, whereas hyperphosphorylation disrupts it, thereby revealing an unexpected role of Daple as a platform for signal integration and gradient sensing for tyrosine-based signals within the planar cell polarity pathway.","3262":null,"3263":null,"3264":"Circadian patterns of locomotor activity are influenced by social interactions. Studies on insects highlight the importance of volatile odors and the olfactory system. Wild-type Drosophila exhibit immediate re-entrainment to new light:dark (LD) cycles, whereas cryb and jetc mutants show deficits in re-entrainability. We found that both male mutants re-entrained faster to phase-shifted LD cycles when social interactions with WT female flies were promoted than the isolated males. In addition, we found that accelerated re-entrainment mediated by social interactions depended on both visual and olfactory cues, and the effect of both cues presented jointly was nearly identical to the sum of the effects of the two cues presented separately. Moreover, we found that re-entrainment deficits in period (per) expression-oscillation in jetc mutants were partially restored by promoting social interactions. Our results demonstrated that, in addition to olfaction, social interactions through the visual system also play important roles in clock entrainment.","3265":"Cellular metabolism is dynamic, but quantifying non-steady metabolic fluxes by stable isotope tracers presents unique computational challenges. Here, we developed an efficient 13C-tracer dynamic metabolic flux analysis (13C-DMFA) framework for modeling central carbon fluxes that vary over time. We used B-splines to generalize the flux parameterization system and to improve the stability of the optimization algorithm. As proof of concept, we investigated how 3T3-L1 cultured adipocytes acutely metabolize glucose in response to insulin. Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose uptake, but intracellular pathways responded with differing speeds and magnitudes. Fluxes in lower glycolysis increased faster than those in upper glycolysis. Glycolysis fluxes rose disproportionally larger and faster than the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with lactate a primary glucose end product. The uncovered array of flux dynamics suggests that glucose catabolism is additionally regulated beyond uptake to help shunt glucose into appropriate pathways. This work demonstrates the value of using dynamic intracellular fluxes to understand metabolic function and pathway regulation.","3266":null,"3267":null,"3268":null,"3269":null,"3270":null,"3271":null,"3272":null,"3273":"Circadian output genes act downstream of the clock to promote rhythmic changes in behavior and physiology, yet their molecular and cellular functions are not well understood. Here we characterize an interaction between regulators of circadian entrainment, output, and synaptic development in Drosophila that influences clock-driven anticipatory increases in morning and evening activity. We previously showed the JETLAG (JET) E3 ubiquitin ligase resets the clock upon light exposure, whereas the PDZ protein DYSCHRONIC (DYSC) regulates circadian locomotor output and synaptic development. Surprisingly, we find that JET and DYSC antagonistically regulate synaptic development at the larval neuromuscular junction, and reduced JET activity rescues arrhythmicity of dysc mutants. Consistent with our prior finding that DYSC regulates SLOWPOKE (SLO) potassium channel expression, jet mutations also rescue circadian and synaptic phenotypes in slo mutants. Collectively, our data suggest that JET, DYSC, and SLO promote circadian output in part by regulating synaptic morphology.","3274":"Self-generated touch feels less intense than external touch of the same intensity. According to theory, this is because the brain predicts and attenuates the somatosensory consequences of our movements using a copy of the motor command, i.e., the efference copy. However, whether the efference copy is necessary for this somatosensory attenuation is unclear. Alternatively, a predictable contact of two body parts could be sufficient. Here we quantified the attenuation of touch applied on the participants' left index finger when the touch was triggered by the active or passive movement of the right index finger and when it was externally generated. We observed attenuation only when the touch was triggered by the participants' active movement. In contrast, during the passive movement, the touch was perceived to be as strong as when the touch was externally triggered. Our results suggest that the efference copy is necessary for the attenuation of self-generated touch.","3275":null,"3276":"Tissue repair is a protective response after injury, but repetitive or prolonged injury can lead to fibrosis, a pathological state of excessive scarring. To pinpoint the dynamic mechanisms underlying fibrosis, it is important to understand the principles of the cell circuits that carry out tissue repair. In this study, we establish a cell-circuit framework for the myofibroblast-macrophage circuit in wound healing, including the accumulation of scar-forming extracellular matrix. We find that fibrosis results from multistability between three outcomes, which we term \"hot fibrosis\" characterized by many macrophages, \"cold fibrosis\" lacking macrophages, and normal wound healing. This framework clarifies several unexplained phenomena including the paradoxical effect of macrophage depletion, the limited time-window in which removing inflammation leads to healing, and why scar maturation takes months. We define key parameters that control the transition from healing to fibrosis, which may serve as potential targets for therapeutic reduction of fibrosis.","3277":null,"3278":null,"3279":null,"3280":"Growth cones (GCs) are structures associated with growing neurons. GC membrane expansion, which necessitates protein-lipid interactions, is critical to axonal elongation in development and in adult neuritogenesis.

We combine lipidomic data from GC and adult axonal regeneration following optic nerve crush. Our results reveal significant molecular variability in GCs across developmental ages that aligns with the upregulation and downregulation of lipid metabolic processes and correlates with distinct changes in the lipid composition of GC plasmalemma. We find that these processes also define the transition into a growth-permissive state in the adult central nervous system. The insight derived from these analyses will aid in promoting adult regeneration and functional innervation in devastating neurodegenerative diseases.","3281":null,"3282":"","3283":null,"3284":null,"3285":null,"3286":null,"3287":null,"3288":"Insects have developed intriguing cuticles with very specific structures and functions, including microstructures governing their interactions with transmitted microbes, such as in aphid mouthparts harboring virus receptors within such microstructures. Here, we provide the first transcriptome analysis of an insect mouthpart cuticle (\"retort organs\" [ROs], the stylets' precursors). This analysis defined stylets as a complex composite material. The retort transcriptome also allowed us to propose an algorithmic definition of a new cuticular protein (CP) family with low complexity and biased amino acid composition. Finally, we identified a differentially expressed gene encoding a pyrokinin (PK) neuropeptide precursor and characterizing the mandibular glands. Injection of three predicted synthetic peptides PK1\/2\/3 into aphids prior to ecdysis caused a molt-specific phenotype with altered head formation. Our study provides the most complete description to date of the potential protein composition of aphid stylets, which should improve the understanding of the transmission of stylet-borne viruses.","3289":"Cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but clinical biomarkers to predict chemosensitivity remain elusive. Here, we show the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) LINC01011, which we termed cisplatin-sensitivity-associated lncRNA (CISAL), controls mitochondrial fission and cisplatin sensitivity by inhibiting BRCA1 transcription in tongue SCC (TSCC) models. Mechanistically, we found CISAL directly binds the BRCA1 promoter and forms an RNA-DNA triplex structure, sequestering BRCA1 transcription factor-GABPA away from the downstream regulatory binding region. Importantly, the clinical relevance of these findings is suggested by the significant association of CISAL and BRCA1 expression levels in TSCC tumors with neoadjuvant chemosensitivity and overall survival. We propose a new model where lncRNAs are tethered at gene promoter by RNA-DNA triplex formation, spatially sequestering transcription factors away from DNA-binding sites. Our study uncovers the potential of CISAL-BRCA1 signaling as a potential target to predict or improve chemosensitivity.","3290":"","3291":"Achieving efficient and biocompatible detachment between adhered wet materials (i.e., tissues and hydrogels) is a major challenge. Recently, photodetachable topological adhesion has shown great promise as a strategy for conquering this hurdle. However, this photodetachment was triggered by UV light with poor biocompatibility and penetration capacity. This study describes near-infrared (NIR) light-detached topological adhesion based on polyacrylic acid coated upconverting nanoparticles (UCNP@PAA) and a photodetachable adhesive (termed Cell-Fe). Cell-Fe is a coordinated topological adhesive consisting of carboxymethylcellulose and Fe3+ that can be photodecomposed by UV light. To prepare a substrate for NIR-detached topological adhesion, UCNP@PAA and Cell-Fe were mixed and brushed on the surface of the model adherent. The UCNP@PAA can harvest NIR light and convert it into UV light, triggering the decomposition of the Cell-Fe and inducing the detachment. This NIR-detached topological adhesion is also feasible in deep tissue because of the ability of NIR light to penetrate tissue.","3292":"How do flat sheets of cells form gut and neural tubes? Across systems, several mechanisms are at play: cells wedge, form actomyosin cables, or intercalate. As a result, the cell sheet bends, and the tube elongates. It is unclear to what extent each mechanism can drive tube formation on its own. To address this question, we computationally probe if one mechanism, either cell wedging or intercalation, may suffice for the entire sheet-to-tube transition. Using a physical model with epithelial cells represented by polarized point particles, we show that either cell intercalation or wedging alone can be sufficient and that each can both bend the sheet and extend the tube. When working in parallel, the two mechanisms increase the robustness of the tube formation. The successful simulations of the key features in Drosophila salivary gland budding, sea urchin gastrulation, and mammalian neurulation support the generality of our results.","3293":null,"3294":null,"3295":null,"3296":null,"3297":null,"3298":"Long-term potentiation and depression, inferred from analysis on brain slices, are considered the cellular processes underlying learning and memory formation. They have not so far been demonstrated in human stem cell-derived neurons. By expressing channelrhodopsin in hESCs-derived glutamate neurons and co-culturing them with GABA neurons, we found that blue light stimulation increased the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and decreased the ratio of paired pulse facilitation (PPF) in non-ChR2-expressing GABA neurons, indicating a facilitating action at the presynaptic terminals. When paired with postsynaptic depolarization, the repetitive stimulation significantly increased the amplitude of light-evoked EPSCs that persisted during the period, indicating long-term potentiation (LTP). In contrast, low-frequency light stimulation induced long-term depression (LTD). These effects were blocked by N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonists, suggesting NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in human neural networks. Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons of patient with Down syndrome showed absence of LTP or LTD. Thus, our platform offers a versatile model for assessing human neural plasticity under physiological and pathological conditions.","3299":"Tumor-associated p53 mutations endow cells with malignant phenotypes, including chemoresistance. Amyloid-like oligomers of mutant p53 transform this tumor suppressor into an oncogene. However, the composition and distribution of mutant p53 oligomers are unknown and the mechanism involved in the conversion is sparse. Here, we report accumulation of a p53 mutant within amyloid-like p53 oligomers in glioblastoma-derived cells presenting a chemoresistant gain-of-function phenotype. Statistical analysis from fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy, pressure-induced measurements, and thioflavin T kinetics demonstrates the distribution of oligomers larger than the active tetrameric form of p53 in the nuclei of living cells and the destabilization of native-drifted p53 species that become amyloid. Collectively, these results provide insights into the role of amyloid-like mutant p53 oligomers in the chemoresistance phenotype of malignant and invasive brain tumors and shed light on therapeutic options to avert cancer.","3300":null,"3301":"Mammary ductal dysplasia is a phenotype observed in precancerous lesions and early-stage breast cancer.

We injected estradiol (E2), the most active form of estrogen, daily into scid mice with a defect in non-homologous end joining repair and observed dysplasia formation with cell proliferation at day 30. The protooncogene Myc is a downstream target of estrogen signaling, and we found that its expression is augmented in mammary epithelial cells in this dysplasia model. Treatment with a Myc inhibitor reduced E2-induced dysplasia formation. Moreover, we found that isoflavones inhibited E2-induced dysplasia formation. Our dysplasia model system provides insights into the mechanistic understanding of breast tumorigenesis and the development of breast cancer prevention.","3302":"","3303":null,"3304":"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men in the Western world.

There is an emergent need for a computational model that can accurately stratify patients into docetaxel-tolerable and docetaxel-intolerable groups. Here we present the best-performing algorithm in the Prostate Cancer DREAM Challenge for predicting adverse events caused by docetaxel treatment. We integrated the survival status and severity of adverse events into our model, which is an innovative way to complement and stratify the treatment discontinuation information. Critical stratification biomarkers were further identified in determining the treatment discontinuation.

These and other features suggest a suite of functional attributes, including (1) retinotopic organization through the optic lobes and into other brain areas well beyond that previously recognized, (2) a level of complexity and sub-division in the basal lobe supporting ideas of convergence with the vertebrate basal ganglia, and (3) differential lobe-dependent growth rates that mirror complexity and transitions in ontogeny.","3307":null,"3308":null,"3309":null,"3310":null,"3311":"Is the control of movement less stable when we walk or run in challenging settings? Intuitively, one might answer that it is, given that challenging locomotion externally (e.g., rough terrain) or internally (e.g., age-related impairments) makes our movements more unstable. Here, we investigated how young and old humans synergistically activate muscles during locomotion when different perturbation levels are introduced. Of these control signals, called muscle synergies, we analyzed the local stability and the complexity (or irregularity) over time. Surprisingly, we found that perturbations force the central nervous system to produce muscle activation patterns that are less unstable and less complex. These outcomes show that robust locomotion control in challenging settings is achieved by producing less complex control signals that are more stable over time, whereas easier tasks allow for more unstable and irregular control.","3312":"How the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genome in recombinant protein producing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines relates to phenotype is not well described. We therefore defined the CHO cell lncRNA transcriptome from cells grown in controlled miniature bioreactors under fed-batch conditions using RNA-Seq to identify lncRNAs and how the expression of these changes throughout growth and between IgG producers. We identify lncRNAs including Adapt15, linked to ER stress, GAS5, linked to mTOR signaling\/growth arrest, and PVT1, linked to Myc expression, which are differentially regulated during fed-batch culture and whose expression correlates to productivity and growth. Changes in (non)-coding RNA expression between the seed train and the equivalent day of fed-batch culture are also reported and compared with existing datasets.

We applied support vector machine classifiers to two datasets of twins (adult, pediatric) and two datasets of repeat-scan individuals (adult, pediatric). Classifiers were trained on resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) data and used to predict individuals and co-twin pairs from independent data. The classifiers successfully identified individuals from a previous scan with 100% accuracy, even when scans were separated by months. In twin samples, classifier accuracy decreased as genetic similarity decreased. Our results demonstrate that classification is stable within individuals, similar within families, and contains similar representations of functional connections over a few decades of life. Moreover, the degree to which these patterns of connections predict siblings' data varied by genetic relatedness, suggesting that genetic influences on rs-fcMRI connectivity are established early in life.","3315":null,"3316":"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have recently emerged as intercellular conveyors of biological information and disease biomarkers.

Here, we generated RBCs-derived EVs by complement activation and tested the ability of MBs coupled with CPP to detect miRNAs from RBC-EVs. Our results showed that RBC and RBC-EVs miRNA-451a can be detected using MB-CPP, and the respective fluorescence levels can be measured by nano-flow cytometry. MB-based detection of RNA via nano-flow cytometry creates a powerful new analytical framework in which a simple addition of a reagent allows profiling of specific RNA species present within certain EV subsets.","3317":"We investigated whether a task requiring concurrent perceptual decision-making and response control can be performed concurrently, whether evidence accumulation and response control are accomplished by the same neurons, and whether perceptual decision-making and countermanding can be unified computationally.

Additionally, a general approach for acylgermanes preparation has been established as well.

The protective effect of miR-127 was largely dependent on its regulation of macrophage bactericidal activity and the generation of IL-22, IL-17, and anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), the pathway primarily driven by STAT3. Importantly, we revealed that the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, a genuine target of miR-127, specifically interacted with and repressed K63-ubiquitination of STAT3, thereby compromising its phosphorylation upon bacterial infection. Thus, our data not only identify miR-127 as a non-coding molecule with anti-bacterial activity but also delineate an unappreciated mechanism whereby A20 regulates STAT3-driven anti-microbial signaling via modulating its ubiquitination.","3320":null,"3321":"Domestication dramatically alters phenotypes across animal species. Standing variation among ancestral populations often drives phenotypic change during domestication, but some changes are caused by novel mutations. In dogs (Canis familiaris) specifically, it has been suggested that the ability to interpret social-communicative behavior expressed by humans originated post-domestication and this behavior is thus not expected to occur in wolves (Canis lupus). Here we report the observation of three 8-week-old wolf puppies spontaneously responding to social-communicative behaviors from an unfamiliar person by retrieving a ball. This behavioral expression in wolves has significant implications for our understanding and expectations of the genetic foundations of dog behavior. Importantly, our observations indicate that behavioral responses to human social-communicative cues are not unique to dogs. This suggests that, although probably rare, standing variation in the expression of human-directed behavior in ancestral populations could have been an important target for early selective pressures exerted during dog domestication.","3322":null,"3323":null,"3324":"The manipulation of molecule-electrode interaction is essential for the fabrication of molecular devices and determines the connectivity from electrodes to molecular components. Although the connectivity of molecular devices could be controlled by molecular design to place anchor groups in different positions of molecule backbones, the reversible switching of such connectivities remains challenging. Here, we develop an electric-field-induced strategy to switch the connectivity of single-molecule junctions reversibly, leading to the manipulation of different connectivities in the same molecular backbone. Our results offer a new concept of single-molecule manipulation and provide a feasible strategy to regulate molecule-electrode interaction.","3325":"Stoichiometric metabolic modeling, particularly genome-scale models (GSMs), is now an indispensable tool for systems biology. The model reconstruction process typically involves collecting information from public databases; however, incomplete systems knowledge leaves gaps in any reconstruction. Current tools for addressing gaps use databases of biochemical functionalities to address gaps on a per-metabolite basis and can provide multiple solutions but cannot avoid thermodynamically infeasible cycles (TICs), invariably requiring lengthy manual curation. To address these limitations, this work introduces an optimization-based multi-step method named OptFill, which performs TIC-avoiding whole-model gapfilling. We applied OptFill to three fictional prokaryotic models of increasing sizes and to a published GSM of Escherichia coli, iJR904. This application resulted in holistic and infeasible cycle-free gapfilling solutions. In addition, OptFill can be adapted to automate inherent TICs identification in any GSM. Overall, OptFill can address critical issues in automated development of high-quality GSMs.","3326":"Since the initial discovery of ribozymes in the early 1980s, catalytic nucleic acids have been used in different areas. Compared with protein enzymes, catalytic nucleic acids are programmable in structure, easy to modify, and more stable especially for DNA. We take a historic view to summarize a few main interdisciplinary areas of research on nucleic acid enzymes that may have broader impacts. Early efforts on ribozymes in the 1980s have broken the notion that all enzymes are proteins, supplying new evidence for the RNA world hypothesis. In 1994, the first catalytic DNA (DNAzyme) was reported. Since 2000, the biosensor applications of DNAzymes have emerged and DNAzymes are particularly useful for detecting metal ions, a challenging task for enzymes and antibodies. Combined with nanotechnology, DNAzymes are key building elements for switches allowing dynamic control of materials assembly. The search for new DNAzymes and ribozymes is facilitated by developments in DNA sequencing and computational algorithms, further broadening our fundamental understanding of their biochemistry.","3327":null,"3328":null,"3329":"Biogenesis of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins involves their integration into the lipid bilayer. Among these proteins are those that form a single-span topology, but our understanding of their biogenesis is scarce. In this study, we found that the MIM complex is required for the membrane insertion of some single-span proteins. However, other such proteins integrate into the membrane in a MIM-independent manner. Moreover, the biogenesis of the studied proteins was dependent to a variable degree on the TOM receptors Tom20 and Tom70. We found that Atg32 C-terminal domain mediates dependency on Tom20, whereas the cytosolic domains of Atg32 and Gem1 facilitate MIM involvement. Collectively, our findings (1) enlarge the repertoire of MIM substrates to include also tail-anchored proteins, (2) provide new mechanistic insights to the functions of the MIM complex and TOM import receptors, and (3) demonstrate that the biogenesis of MOM single-span proteins shows variable dependence on import factors.","3330":"Micro-\/nanofibers (MNFs) are optical fibers with diameters close to or below the wavelength of the guided light. These tiny fibers can offer engineerable waveguiding properties including optical confinement, fractional evanescent fields, and surface intensity, which is very attractive to optical sensing on the micro-\/nano scale. In this review, we first introduce the basics of MNF optics and MNF optical sensors from physical and chemical to biological applications and review the progress and current status of this field. Then, we review and discuss hybrid MNF structures for advanced optical sensing by merging MNFs with functional structures including chemical indicators, quantum dots, dye molecules, plasmonic nanoparticles, 2-D materials, and optofluidic chips. Thirdly, we introduce the emerging trends in developing MNF-based advanced sensing technology for ultrasensitive, active, and wearable sensors and discuss the future prospects and challenges in this exciting research field. Finally, we end the review with a brief conclusion.","3331":"The development of adequate model systems to study human malignancies is crucial for basic and preclinical research. Here, we exploit the \"immune-privileged\" developmental time window to achieve orthotopic xenotransplantation of human brain tumor cells in wild-type (WT) mice. We find that, when transplanted in utero, human glioblastoma (GBM) cells readily integrate in the embryonic mouse brain mirroring key tumor-associated pathological features such as infiltration, vascularization, and complex tumor microenvironment including reactive astrocytes and host immune cell infiltration. Remarkably, activation of the host IBA1 tumor-associated microglia\/macrophages depends on the type of glioma cell transplanted, suggesting our approach allows one to study human GBM interactions with the immune system of WT host mice. The embryonic engraftment model complements existing ones, providing a rapid and valuable alternative to study fundamental biology of human brain tumors in immune competent mice.","3332":"Approximately 90% of pre-clinically validated drugs fail in clinical trials owing to unanticipated clinical outcomes, costing over several hundred million US dollars per drug. Despite such critical importance, translating pre-clinical data to clinical outcomes remain a major challenge. Herein, we designed a modality-independent and unbiased approach to predict clinical outcomes of drugs. The approach exploits their multi-organ transcriptome patterns induced in mice and a unique mouse-transcriptome database \"humanized\" by machine learning algorithms and human clinical outcome datasets. The cross-validation with small-molecule, antibody, and peptide drugs shows effective and efficient identification of the previously known outcomes of 5,519 adverse events and 11,312 therapeutic indications. In addition, the approach is adaptable to deducing potential molecular mechanisms underlying these outcomes. Furthermore, the approach identifies previously unsuspected repositioning targets. These results, together with the fact that it requires no prior structural or mechanistic information of drugs, illustrate its versatile applications to drug development process.","3333":null,"3334":null,"3335":null,"3336":null,"3337":null,"3338":"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating motor neuron disorder caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. It remains unclear how SMN deficiency leads to the loss of motor neurons. By screening Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we found that the growth defect of an SMN mutant can be alleviated by deletion of the actin-capping protein subunit gene acp1+. We show that SMN mutated cells have splicing defects in the profilin gene, which thus directly hinder actin cytoskeleton homeostasis including endocytosis and cytokinesis. We conclude that deletion of acp1+ in an SMN mutant background compensates for actin cytoskeleton alterations by restoring redistribution of actin monomers between different types of cellular actin networks. Our data reveal a direct correlation between an impaired function of SMN in snRNP assembly and defects in actin dynamics. They also point to important common features in the pathogenic mechanism of SMA and ALS.","3339":null,"3340":"Natural products (NPs), also known as secondary metabolites, are produced in bacteria, fungi, and plants. NPs represent a rich source of antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer agents. Recent advances in DNA sequencing technologies and bioinformatics unveiled nature's great potential for synthesizing numerous NPs that may confer unprecedented structural and biological features. However, discovering novel bioactive NPs by genome mining remains a challenge. Moreover, even with interesting bioactivity, the low productivity of many NPs significantly limits their practical applications. Here we discuss the progress in developing bioinformatics tools for efficient discovery of bioactive NPs. In addition, we highlight computational methods for optimizing the productivity of NPs of pharmaceutical importance.","3341":"Persistence, the stress-tolerant state, is arguably the most vital phenotype since nearly all cells experience nutrient stress, which causes a sub-population to become dormant. However, how persister cells wake to reconstitute infections is not understood well. Here, using single-cell observations, we determined that Escherichia coli persister cells resuscitate primarily when presented with specific carbon sources, rather than spontaneously. In addition, we found that the mechanism of persister cell waking is through sensing nutrients by chemotaxis and phosphotransferase membrane proteins. Furthermore, nutrient transport reduces the level of secondary messenger cAMP through enzyme IIA; this reduction in cAMP levels leads to ribosome resuscitation and rescue. Resuscitating cells also immediately commence chemotaxis toward nutrients, although flagellar motion is not required for waking. Hence, persister cells wake by perceiving nutrients via membrane receptors that relay the signal to ribosomes via the secondary messenger cAMP, and persisters wake and utilize chemotaxis to acquire nutrients.","3342":null,"3343":null,"3344":"The ability to respond to chemosensory cues is critical for survival of most organisms. Among insects, Drosophila melanogaster has the best characterized olfactory system, and the availability of genome sequences of 30 Drosophila species provides an ideal scenario for studies on evolution of chemosensation. Gene duplications of chemoreceptor genes allow for functional diversification of the rapidly evolving chemoreceptor repertoire. Although some species of the genus Drosophila are generalists for host plant selection, rapid evolution of olfactory receptors, gustatory receptors, odorant-binding proteins, and cytochrome P450s has enabled diverse host specializations of different members of the genus. Here, I review diversification of the chemoreceptor repertoire among members of the genus Drosophila along with co-evolution of detoxification mechanisms that may have enabled occupation of diverse host plant ecological niches.","3345":null,"3346":null,"3347":"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a severe, mostly fatal hematopoietic malignancy. We were interested in whether transcriptomic-based machine learning could predict AML status without requiring expert input. Using 12,029 samples from 105 different studies, we present a large-scale study of machine learning-based prediction of AML in which we address key questions relating to the combination of machine learning and transcriptomics and their practical use. We find data-driven, high-dimensional approaches-in which multivariate signatures are learned directly from genome-wide data with no prior knowledge-to be accurate and robust. Importantly, these approaches are highly scalable with low marginal cost, essentially matching human expert annotation in a near-automated workflow. Our results support the notion that transcriptomics combined with machine learning could be used as part of an integrated -omics approach wherein risk prediction, differential diagnosis, and subclassification of AML are achieved by genomics while diagnosis could be assisted by transcriptomic-based machine learning.","3348":"Multiple mazes are routinely used to test the performance of animals because each has disadvantages inherent to its shape. However, the maze shape cannot be flexibly and rapidly reproduced in a repeatable and scalable way in a single environment. Here, to overcome the lack of flexibility, scalability, reproducibility, and repeatability, we develop a reconfigurable maze system that consists of interlocking runways and an array of accompanying parts. It allows experimenters to rapidly and flexibly configure a variety of maze structures along the grid pattern in a repeatable and scalable manner. Spatial navigational behavior and hippocampal place coding were not impaired by the interlocking mechanism. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we demonstrate that the maze morphing induces location remapping of the spatial receptive field. The reconfigurable maze thus provides flexibility, scalability, repeatability, and reproducibility, therefore facilitating consistent investigation into the neuronal substrates for learning and memory and allowing screening for behavioral phenotypes.","3349":"Natural enzymes are mainly composed by the protein part and metallic cofactor part, both of which work cooperatively to achieve high catalytic activity. Here, natural melanin particles (NMPs) were extracted from human hair and further bound with metal ions to mimic natural enzymes. The different metal-bound NMPs (M-NMPs) exhibited different enzyme-like activities with great promise in diverse biomedical applications. It was found that Fe-bound NMPs (Fe-NMPs) showed outstanding peroxidase (POD)-like activity that possessed potential in antibacterial applications, and Mn-bound NMPs (Mn-NMPs) displayed catalase (CAT)-like activity with a remarkable radiotherapy sensitization effect in cancer therapy. Besides, Cu-bound NMPs (Cu-NMPs) could serve as combined POD, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and CAT alternatives, which exhibited prominent reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability, revealing great potential in anti-inflammation. The versatile enzyme-like activities of M-NMPs derived from hair might give extensive perspective for designing biomedical materials and provide a promising tool in solving biomedical problems.","3350":null,"3351":null,"3352":null,"3353":null,"3354":"Glasses-free three-dimensional (3D) display is considered as a potential disruptive technology for display. The issue of visual fatigue, mainly caused by the inaccurate phase reconstruction in terms of image crosstalk, as well as vergence and accommodation conflict, is the critical obstacle that hinders the real applications of glasses-free 3D display. Here we propose a glasses-free 3D display by adopting metagratings for the pixelated phase modulation to form converged viewpoints. When the viewpoints are closely arranged, the holographic sampling 3D display can approximate a continuous light field. We demonstrate a video rate full-color 3D display prototype without visual fatigue under an LED white light illumination. The metagratings-based holographic sampling 3D display has a thin form factor and is compatible with traditional flat panel and thus has the potential to be used in portable electronics, window display, exhibition display, 3D TV, as well as tabletop display.","3355":null,"3356":"Ebola virus, for which we lack effective countermeasures, causes hemorrhagic fever in humans, with significant case fatality rates. Lack of experimental human models for Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a major obstacle that hinders the development of treatment strategies. Here, we model the Ebola hemorrhagic syndrome in a microvessel-on-a-chip system and demonstrate its applicability to drug studies. Luminal infusion of Ebola virus-like particles leads to albumin leakage from the engineered vessels. The process is mediated by the Rho\/ROCK pathway and is associated with cytoskeleton remodeling. Infusion of Ebola glycoprotein (GP1,2) generates a similar phenotype, indicating the key role of GP1,2 in this process. Finally, we measured the potency of a recently developed experimental drug FX06 and a novel drug candidate, melatonin, in phenotypic rescue. Our study confirms the effects of FX06 and identifies melatonin as an effective, safe, inexpensive therapeutic option that is worth investigating in animal models and human trials.","3357":null,"3358":"Li4Ti5O12 anode can operate at extraordinarily high rates and for a very long time, but it suffers from a relatively low capacity. This has motivated much research on Nb2O5 as an alternative. In this work, we present a scalable chemical processing strategy that maintains the size and morphology of nano-crystal precursor but systematically reconstitutes the unit cell composition, to build defect-rich porous orthorhombic Nb2O5-x with a high-rate capacity many times those of commercial anodes. The procedure includes etching, proton ion exchange, calcination, and reduction, and the resulting Nb2O5-x has a capacity of 253 mA h g-1 at 0.5C, 187 mA h g-1 at 25C, and 130 mA h g-1 at 100C, with 93.3% of the 25C capacity remaining after cycling for 4,000 times. These values are much higher than those reported for Nb2O5 and Li4Ti5O12, thanks to more available surface\/sub-surface reaction sites and significantly improved fast ion and electron conductivity.","3359":null,"3360":null,"3361":null,"3362":"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor initiation, chemoresistance, metastasis, and relapse, but the underlying molecular origin of CSCs remains elusive. Here we identified that metastatic phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL-3) transcriptionally upregulates SOX2 in the expansion of CSC sub-population from normal cancer cells. Mechanistically, SOX2 upregulation is attributed to the binding of the acetylated myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) to SOX2 promoter in tumor cells. In parallel, PRL-3 competitively binds to Class IIa histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) to facilitate HDAC4 translocation, leading to the disassociation of HDAC4 from MEF2A and histones. The released MEF2A and histones thus remain acetylated and render the subsequent accessibility of the acetylated MEF2A to SOX2 promoter region. Clinical relevance among PRL-3, SOX2, and HDAC4 is validated in ovary cancer samples. Therefore, this PRL-3-HDAC4-MEF2A\/histones-SOX2 signaling axis would be a potential therapeutic target in inhibiting ovarian cancer metastasis and relapse.","3363":null,"3364":"Despite rapid advances in whole genome sequencing (WGS) technologies, their integration into routine microbiological diagnostics has been hampered by the lack of standardized downstream bioinformatics analysis. We developed a comprehensive and computationally low-resource bioinformatics pipeline (BacPipe) enabling direct analyses of bacterial whole-genome sequences (raw reads or contigs) obtained from second- or third-generation sequencing technologies. A graphical user interface was developed to visualize real-time progression of the analysis. The scalability and speed of BacPipe in handling large datasets was demonstrated using 4,139 Illumina paired-end sequence files of publicly available bacterial genomes (2.9-5.4 Mb) from the European Nucleotide Archive. BacPipe is integrated in EBI-SELECTA, a project-specific portal (H2020-COMPARE), and is available as an independent docker image that can be used across Windows- and Unix-based systems. BacPipe offers a fully automated \"one-stop\" bacterial WGS analysis pipeline to overcome the major hurdle of WGS data analysis in hospitals and public-health and for infection control monitoring.","3365":"The Hantzsch and free-radical polymerization reactions were combined in a one-pot high-throughput (HTP) system to simultaneously prepare 30 unique polymers in parallel. Six aldehydes derived from natural products were used as the starting materials to rapidly prepare the library of 30 poly(1,4-dihydropyridines). From this library, HTP evaluation methods led to the identification of an antibacterial polymer. Mechanistic studies revealed that the dihydropyridine group in the polymer side-chain structure plays an important role in resisting bacterial attachment to the polymer surface, thus leading to the antibacterial function of this polymer. This research demonstrates the value of multicomponent reactions (MCRs) in interdisciplinary fields by discovering functional polymers for possible practical applications. It also provides insights to further developing new functional polymers using MCRs and HTP methods with important implications in organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science.","3366":"DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is critical for cell survival and genome integrity. Upon recognition of DSBs, repair proteins are transiently upregulated to facilitate repair through homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We present evidence that PRMT5 cooperates with pICln to function as a master epigenetic activator of DNA damage response (DDR) genes involved in HR, NHEJ, and G2 arrest (including RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2) to upregulate gene expression upon DNA damage. Contrary to the predominant role of PRMT5 as an epigenetic repressor, our results demonstrate that PRMT5 and pICln can activate gene expression, potentially independent of PRMT5's obligate cofactor MEP50. Targeting PRMT5 or pICln hinders repair of DSBs in multiple cancer cell lines, and both PRMT5 and pICln expression positively correlates with DDR genes across 32 clinical cancer datasets. Thus, targeting PRMT5 or pICln may be explored in combination with radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment.","3367":"During sexual reproduction in the ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila, cells of complementary mating type pair (\"conjugate\") undergo simultaneous meiosis and fertilize each other. In both mating partners only one of the four meiotic products is \"selected\" to escape autophagy, and this nucleus divides mitotically to produce two pronuclei. The migrating pronucleus of one cell translocates to the mating partner and fuses with its stationary pronucleus and vice versa. Selection of the designated gametic nucleus was thought to depend on its position within the cell because it always attaches to the junction with the partner cell. Here we show that a transmembrane protein, Semi1, is crucial for attachment. Loss of Semi1 causes failure to attach and consequent infertility. However, a nucleus is selected and gives rise to pronuclei regardless of Semi1 expression, indicating that attachment of a nucleus to the junction is not a precondition for selection but follows the selection process.","3368":"Viruses need to hijack and manipulate host proteins to guarantee their replication. Herein, we uncovered that the DNA virus white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) established a novel positive feedback loop by hijacking the host JNK pathway via its immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein to drive replication. Specifically, the WSSV IE1 bound to host JNK, and enhanced JNK autoactivation by autophosphorylation, and in turn, elevated JNK kinase activity to its substrate c-Jun and induced IE1, which resulted in a viral gene-mediated positive feedback loop. Moreover, the activation of this loop is able to induce wsv056, wsv249, and wsv403, in addition to IE1 itself. Disruption of this loop during WSSV infection by knockdown of JNK, c-Jun or IE1 led to an increased survival rate and lower viral burdens in shrimp. Taken together, this loop may provide a potential target for the development of specific antiviral strategies or agents against WSSV infection.","3369":null,"3370":"Animal sex-determining genes, which bifurcate for female and male development, are diversified even among closely related species. Most of these genes emerged independently from various sex-related genes during species diversity as neofunctionalization-type genes. However, the common mechanisms of this divergent evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we compared the molecular evolution of two sex-determining genes, the medaka dmy and the clawed frog dm-W, which independently evolved from the duplication of the transcription factor-encoding masculinization gene dmrt1. Interestingly, we detected parallel amino acid substitutions, from serine (S) to threonine (T), on the DNA-binding domains of both ancestral DMY and DM-W, resulting from positive selection. Two types of DNA-protein binding experiments and a luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that these S-T substitutions could strengthen the DNA-binding abilities and enhance the transcriptional regulation function. These findings suggest that the parallel S-T substitutions may have contributed to the establishment of dmy and dm-W as sex-determining genes.","3371":"Visualization plays a central role in the analysis of biochemical network models to identify patterns that arise from reaction dynamics and perform model exploratory analysis. To facilitate these analyses, we developed PyViPR, a visualization tool that generates static and dynamic representations of biochemical network processes within a Python-based environment. PyViPR embeds network visualizations within Jupyter notebooks, thus enabling integration with modeling, simulation, and analysis workflows. To present the capabilities of PyViPR, we explore execution mechanisms of extrinsic apoptosis in HeLa cells. We show that community-detection algorithms identify groups of molecular species that capture key biological functions and ease exploration of the apoptosis network. We then show how different kinetic parameter sets that fit the experimental data equally well exhibit significantly different signal-execution dynamics as the system progresses toward mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization. Therefore, PyViPR aids the conceptual understanding of dynamic network processes and accelerates hypothesis generation for further testing and validation.","3372":null,"3373":null,"3374":"The endogenous melanocortin peptide agouti-related protein (AgRP) plays a well-known role in foraging, but its contribution to metabolic regulation is less understood. Mature AgRP(83-132) has distinct residues for melanocortin receptor binding and heparan sulfate interactions. Here, we show that AgRP increases ad libitum feeding and operant responding for food in mice, decreases oxygen consumption, and lowers body temperature and activity, indicating lower energy expenditure. AgRP increased the respiratory exchange ratio, indicating a reduction of fat oxidation and a shift toward carbohydrates as the primary fuel source. The duration and intensity of AgRP's effects depended on the density of its positively charged amino acids, suggesting that its orexigenic and metabolic effects depend on its affinity for heparan sulfate. These findings may have major clinical implications by unveiling the critical involvement of interactions between AgRP and heparan sulfate to the central regulation of energy expenditure, fat utilization, and possibly their contribution to metabolic disease.","3375":"Learning to perceptually discriminate between chemical signals in the environment (olfactory perceptual learning [OPL]) is critical for survival. Multiple mechanisms have been implicated in OPL, including modulation of neurogenesis and manipulation of cholinergic activity. However, whether these represent distinct processes regulating OPL or if cholinergic effects on OPL depend upon neurogenesis has remained an unresolved question. Using a combination of pharmacological and optogenetic approaches, cholinergic activity was shown to be both necessary and sufficient to drive OPL, and this process was dependent on the presence of newly born cells in the olfactory bulb (OB). This study is the first to directly demonstrate that cholinergic effects on OPL require adult OB neurogenesis.","3376":null,"3377":"Fiber Optics; Information and Communication Technologies; Telecommunication Engineering.","3378":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short double-stranded noncoding RNAs (19-23 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression by suppressing mRNAs through RNA interference. Targeting is determined by the seed sequence (position 2-7\/8) of the mature miRNA. A minimal G-rich seed of just six nucleotides is highly toxic to cells by targeting genes essential for cell survival. A screen of 215 miRNAs encoded by 17 human pathogenic viruses (v-miRNAs) now suggests that a number of v-miRNAs can kill cells through a G-rich 6mer sequence embedded in their seed. Specifically, we demonstrate that miR-K12-6-5p, an oncoviral mimic of the tumor suppressive miR-15\/16 family encoded by human Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus, harbors a noncanonical toxic 6mer seed (position 3-8) and that v-miRNAs are more likely than cellular miRNAs to utilize a noncanonical 6mer seed. Our data suggest that during evolution viruses evolved to use 6mer seed toxicity to kill cells.","3379":null,"3380":null,"3381":"Life on earth has evolved under constant environmental changes; in response to these changes, most organisms have developed an endogenous clock that allows them to anticipate daily and seasonal changes and adapt their biology accordingly. Light cycles synchronize biological rhythms and are controlled by an endogenous clock that is entrained by environmental cues. Light is known to play a key role in the biology of symbiotic corals as they exhibit many biological processes entrained by daily light patterns. In this study, we aimed at determining the effect of constant dim light on coral's perception of diel and monthly cycles. Our results show that under constant dim light corals display a loss of rhythmic processes and constant stimuli by light, which initiates signal transduction that results in an abnormal cell cycle, cell proliferation, and protein synthesis. The results emphasize how constant dim light can mask the biological clock of Acropora digitifera.","3382":"The cellular response to hypoxia is crucial to organismal survival, and hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) are the key mediators of this response. HIF-signaling is central to many human diseases and mediates longevity in the nematode. Despite the rapidly increasing knowledge on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), little is known about their contribution to hypoxia-induced cellular adaptation. We used RNA interactome capture (RIC) in wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans and vhl-1 loss-of-function mutants to fill this gap. This approach identifies more than 1,300 nematode RBPs, 270 of which can be considered novel RBPs. Interestingly, loss of vhl-1 modulates the RBPome. This difference is not primarily explained by protein abundance suggesting differential RNA-binding. Taken together, our study provides a global view on the nematode RBPome and proteome as well as their modulation by HIF-signaling. The resulting RBP atlas is also provided as an interactive online data mining tool (http:\/\/shiny.cecad.uni-koeln.de:3838\/celegans_rbpome).","3383":null,"3384":"A major challenge in using human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in therapy is the risk of teratoma formation due to contaminating undifferentiated stem cells. We used CRISPR-Cas9 for in-frame insertion of a suicide gene, iC9, into the endogenous SOX2 locus in human embryonic stem cell (ESC) line H1 for specific eradication of undifferentiated cells without affecting differentiated cells. This locus was chosen over NANOG and OCT4, two other well-characterized stem cell loci, due to significantly reduced off-target effect. We showed that undifferentiated H1-iC9 cells were induced to apoptosis by iC9 inducer AP1903, whereas differentiated cell lineages including hematopoietic cells, neurons, and islet beta-like cells were not affected. We also showed that AP1903 selectively removed undifferentiated H1-iC9 cells from a mixed cell population. This strategy therefore provides a layer of safety control before transplantation of a stem-cell-derived product in therapy.","3385":"Plants growing at high density are in constant competition for light with each other. The shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) is an effective way to escape neighboring vegetation. Even though the molecular mechanisms regulating SAS have been long studied, interactions between light and other environmental signaling pathways have only recently received attention. Under natural conditions, plants deal with multiple stresses simultaneously. It is, therefore, key to identify commonalities, distinctions, and interactions between plant responses to different environmental cues. This review outlines the current understanding of the interplay between canopy light signaling and other stresses, both biotic and abiotic. Understanding plant responses to multiple stimuli, factoring in the dominance of light for plant life, is essential to generate crops with increased resilience against climate change.","3386":null,"3387":"The gain bandwidth of a single-mode fiber is limited by the atomic transitions of one rare earth gain element. Here we overcome this long-standing challenge by designing a new single-mode fiber with multi-section core, where each section is doped with different gain element. We theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate that this configuration provides a gain bandwidth well beyond the capability of conventional design, whereas the inclusion of multiple sections does not compromise single-mode operation or the quality of the transverse modal profile. This new fiber will be beneficial in realizing all fiber laser systems with few-cycle pulse duration or octave tunability.","3388":"Functional optoacoustic (OA) imaging assisted with genetically encoded calcium ion indicators (GECIs) holds promise for imaging large-scale neuronal activity at depths and spatiotemporal resolutions not attainable with existing optical microscopic techniques. However, currently available GECIs optimized for fluorescence (FL) imaging lack sufficient contrast for OA imaging and respond at wavelengths having limited penetration into the mammalian brain. Here we present an imaging platform capable of rapid assessment and cross-validation between OA and FL responses of sensor proteins expressed in Escherichia coli colonies. The screening system features optimized pulsed light excitation combined with ultrasensitive ultrasound detection to mitigate photobleaching while further allowing the dynamic characterization of calcium ion responses with millisecond precision. Targeted probing of up to six individual colonies per second in both calcium-loaded and calcium-unloaded states was possible with the system. The new platform greatly facilitates optimization of absorption-based labels, thus setting the stage for directed evolution of OA GECIs.","3389":"Cochlear amplification denotes a boost to auditory sensitivity and selectivity that is dependent on outer hair cells from Corti's organ. Voltage-driven electromotility of the cell is believed to feed energy back into the cochlear partition via a cycle-by-cycle mechanism at very high acoustic frequencies. Here we show using wide-band macro-patch voltage-clamp to drive prestin, the molecular motor underlying electromotility, that its voltage-sensor charge movement is unusually low pass in nature, being incapable of following high-frequency voltage changes. Our data are incompatible with a cycle-by-cycle mechanism responsible for high-frequency tuning in mammals.","3390":"Microbial organisms of the human gut microbiome do not exist in isolation but form complex and diverse interactions to maintain health and reduce risk of disease development. The organization of the gut microbiome is assumed to be a singular assortative network, where interactions between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) can readily be clustered into segregated and distinct communities. Here, we leverage recent methodological advances in network modeling to assess whether communities in the human microbiome exhibit a single network structure or whether co-existing mesoscale network architectures are present. We found evidence for core-periphery structures in the microbiome, supported by strong, assortative community interactions. This complex architecture, coupled with previously reported functional roles of OTUs, provides a nuanced understanding of how the microbiome simultaneously promotes high microbial diversity and maintains functional redundancy.","3391":null,"3392":null,"3393":null,"3394":"Neuronal alternative splicing is a core mechanism for functional diversification. We previously found that STAR family proteins (SAM68, SLM1, SLM2) regulate spatiotemporal alternative splicing in the nervous system. However, the whole aspect of alternative splicing programs by STARs remains unclear. Here, we performed a transcriptomic analysis using SAM68 knockout and SAM68\/SLM1 double-knockout midbrains. We revealed different alternative splicing activity between SAM68 and SLM1; SAM68 preferentially targets alternative 3' UTR exons. SAM68 knockout causes a long-to-short isoform switch of a number of neuronal targets through the alteration in alternative last exon (ALE) selection or alternative polyadenylation. The altered ALE usage of a novel target, interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein (Il1rap), results in remarkable conversion from a membrane-bound type to a secreted type in Sam68KO brains. Proper ALE selection is necessary for IL1RAP neuronal function. Thus the SAM68-specific splicing program provides a mechanism for neuronal selection of alternative 3' UTR isoforms.","3395":"","3396":"To establish stable infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb) must overcome host innate immune mechanisms, including those that sense pathogen-derived nucleic acids. Here, we show that the host cytosolic RNA sensing molecules RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling proteins RIG-I and MDA5, their common adaptor protein MAVS, and the RNA-dependent kinase PKR each independently inhibit MTb growth in human cells. Furthermore, we show that MTb broadly stimulates RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, and PKR gene expression and their biological activities. We also show that the oral FDA-approved drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) significantly inhibits intracellular MTb growth and amplifies MTb-stimulated RNA sensor gene expression and activity. This study establishes prototypic cytoplasmic RNA sensors as innate restriction factors for MTb growth in human cells and it shows that targeting this pathway is a potential host-directed approach to treat tuberculosis disease.","3397":"Light filtered through dense planting initiates the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS) in plants, which helps them compete against their neighbors. Quantitative trait loci (QTL)-based analysis identified the nighttime-expressed clock component ELF3 as a new player in the SAS, but its detailed mechanism is unclear. Here, we show that the circadian clock gates shade-induced gene expression and hypocotyl elongation at night. ELF3 is involved in nighttime suppression via interaction with and inactivation of PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 (PIF7). Loss of function of ELF3 restores the shade induction, which is largely reduced in the absence of PIF7, indicating that ELF3 acts upstream of PIF7. Finally, we found that the repressive activity of ELF3 on the shade response is stronger under short days than under long days. Our results reveal that the interaction between ELF3 and PIF7 mediates the circadian gating of the SAS, which coordinates the daily control of physiological outputs.","3398":"Studies of intermolecular interactions enhance our knowledge of chemistry across molecular and supramolecular levels. Here, we show that host-guest quadrupolar interaction has a profound influence on the molecular system. With covalently bonded dimolybdenum complex units as the electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) and a thienylene group (C4H2S) as the bridge (B), the mixed-valence D-B-A complexes are shaped with clefts in the middle of the molecule. Interestingly, in aromatic solvents, the D-A electronic coupling constants (Hab) and electron transfer rates (ket) are dramatically reduced. Theoretical computations indicate that an aromatic molecule is encapsulated in the cleft of the D-B-A array; quadrupole-quadrupole interaction between the guest molecule and the C4H2S bridge evokes a charge redistribution, which increases the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, intervening in the through-bond electron transfer. These results demonstrate that a supramolecular system is unified underlying the characteristics of the assembled molecules through constitutional, electronic, and energetic complementarities.","3399":null,"3400":"Endogenous extracellular Galectins constitute a novel mechanism of membrane protein organization at the cell surface. Although Galectins are also highly expressed intracellularly, their cytosolic functions are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the role of Galectin-9 in dendritic cell (DC) surface organization and function. By combining functional, super-resolution and atomic force microscopy experiments to analyze membrane stiffness, we identified intracellular Galectin-9 to be indispensable for plasma membrane integrity and structure in DCs. Galectin-9 knockdown studies revealed intracellular Galectin-9 to directly control cortical membrane structure by modulating Rac1 activity, providing the underlying mechanism of Galectin-9-dependent actin cytoskeleton organization. Consequent to its role in maintaining plasma membrane structure, phagocytosis studies revealed that Galectin-9 was essential for C-type-lectin receptor-mediated pathogen uptake by DCs. This was confirmed by the impaired phagocytic capacity of Galectin-9-null murine DCs. Together, this study demonstrates a novel role for intracellular Galectin-9 in modulating DC function, which may be evolutionarily conserved.","3401":null,"3402":"C2, C3-disubstituted indole is one of the most frequently encountered motifs in bioactive alkaloids and medicinal chemistry. Thus, developing novel, concise, and efficient access to it is highly desired in drug discovery. Herein, we present such an approach to this scaffold by direct oxidative coupling of C2-substituted indoles and enolates. Compared with indole bearing no C2-substituent, higher yields (up to 96%) were obtained for C2-substituted indoles in most cases. Mechanistic studies showed the reaction went through a Fe-chelated radical-anion oxidative coupling procedure promoted by C2-substituent on indole by two means: (1) stabilizing C2-radical intermediate during the reaction; (2) reducing indole homocoupling. This approach serves as a synthetic useful tool to quickly build up bioactive small molecule library of C2, C3-disubstituted indoles, and several products showed promising anticancer activities. Besides, indomethacin and its analogs were conveniently prepared in three-step sequence efficiently, indicating the potential application of our approach in medicinal chemistry.","3403":"Growing evidence indicates a close link between energy metabolism and neural plasticity as obesity is associated with alterations of cognitive functions, memory, and hippocampal neurogenesis. However, it is still unknown whether obesity can affect low-level sensory plasticity. Here we investigated this issue by probing early visual plasticity induced by short-term (2 h) monocular deprivation in a group of adult volunteers with a wide range of Body Mass Index (BMI), from normal weight to morbid obesity. We found that the effect of monocular deprivation decreased with increasing BMI, and morbidly obese subjects (BMI&gt;40) failed to show the homeostatic plasticity effect seen in normal-weight participants. In addition, morbidly obese subjects exhibited altered binocular rivalry dynamics compared with normal-weight observers. These results show for the first time that the impact of obesity observed at the neural and cognitive level extends to basic sensory processing and plasticity.","3404":"A versatile method for atroposelective synthesis of chiral biaryl diamines and amino alcohols has been developed via para-amination of anilines and phenols with azodicarboxylates enabled by chiral phosphoric acid catalysis. Meanwhile, highly efficient kinetic resolution of the racemic biaryl anilines has also been realized through these reactions, giving selectivity factor up to 246. The gram-scale reaction and facile derivatizations of the chiral products well demonstrate the potential of these reactions in the development of novel chiral ligands and catalysts.","3405":"We show that a system consisting of two interacting particles with mass ratio 3 or 1\/3 in a hard-wall box can be exactly solved by using Bethe-type ansatz. The ansatz is based on a finite superposition of plane waves associated with a dihedral group D6, which enforces the momentums after a series of scattering and reflection processes to fulfill the D6 symmetry. Starting from a two-body elastic collision model in a hard-wall box, we demonstrate how a finite momentum distribution is related to the D2n symmetry for permitted mass ratios. For a quantum system with mass ratio 3, we obtain exact eigenenergies and eigenstates by solving Bethe-type-ansatz equations for arbitrary interaction strength. A many-body excited state of the system is found to be independent of the interaction strength, i.e., the wave function looks exactly the same for non-interacting two particles or in the hard-core limit.","3406":"ASAP1 is a multi-domain ArfGAP that controls cell migration, spreading, and focal adhesion dynamics. Although its GAP activity contributes to remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton, it does not fully explain all cellular functions of ASAP1. Here we find that ASAP1 regulates actin filament assembly directly through its N-BAR domain and controls stress fiber maintenance. ASAP1 depletion caused defects in stress fiber organization. Conversely, overexpression of ASAP1 enhanced actin remodeling. The BAR-PH fragment was sufficient to affect actin. ASAP1 with the BAR domain replaced with the BAR domain of the related ACAP1 did not affect actin. The BAR-PH tandem of ASAP1 bound and bundled actin filaments directly, whereas the presence of the ArfGAP and the C-terminal linker\/SH3 domain reduced binding and bundling of filaments by BAR-PH. Together these data provide evidence that ASAP1 may regulate the actin cytoskeleton through direct interaction of the BAR-PH domain with actin filaments.","3407":"Anatomical homeostasis results from dynamic interactions between gene expression, physiology, and the external environment. Owing to its complexity, this cellular and organism-level phenotypic plasticity is still poorly understood. We establish planarian regeneration as a model for acquired tolerance to environments that alter endogenous physiology. Exposure to barium chloride (BaCl2) results in a rapid degeneration of anterior tissue in Dugesia japonica. Remarkably, continued exposure to fresh solution of BaCl2 results in regeneration of heads that are insensitive to BaCl2. RNA-seq revealed transcriptional changes in BaCl2-adapted heads that suggests a model of adaptation to excitotoxicity. Loss-of-function experiments confirmed several predictions: blockage of chloride and calcium channels allowed heads to survive initial BaCl2 exposure, inducing adaptation without prior exposure, whereas blockade of TRPM channels reversed adaptation. Such highly adaptive plasticity may represent an attractive target for biomedical strategies in a wide range of applications beyond its immediate relevance to excitotoxicity preconditioning.","3408":null,"3409":null,"3410":"Community ecology theory suggests that an individual's phenotype is determined by the phenotypes of its coexisting members to the extent at which this process can shape community evolution. Here, we develop a mapping theory to identify interaction quantitative trait loci (QTL) governing inter-individual dependence. We mathematically formulate the decision-making strategy of interacting individuals. We integrate these mathematical descriptors into a statistical procedure, enabling the joint characterization of how QTL drive the strengths of ecological interactions and how the genetic architecture of QTL is driven by ecological networks. In three fish full-sib mapping experiments, we identify a set of genome-wide QTL that control a range of societal behaviors, including mutualism, altruism, aggression, and antagonism, and find that these intraspecific interactions increase the genetic variation of body mass by about 50%. We showcase how the interaction QTL can be used as editors to reconstruct and engineer new social networks for ecological communities.","3411":"Most animal species reproduce sexually and fully parthenogenetic lineages are usually short lived in evolution. Still, parthenogenesis may be advantageous as it avoids the cost of sex and permits colonization by single individuals. Panagrolaimid nematodes have colonized environments ranging from arid deserts to Arctic and Antarctic biomes. Many are obligatory meiotic parthenogens, and most have cryptobiotic abilities, being able to survive repeated cycles of complete desiccation and freezing. To identify systems that may contribute to these striking abilities, we sequenced and compared the genomes and transcriptomes of parthenogenetic and outcrossing panagrolaimid species, including cryptobionts and non-cryptobionts. The parthenogens are triploids, most likely originating through hybridization. Adaptation to cryptobiosis shaped the genomes of panagrolaimid nematodes and is associated with the expansion of gene families and signatures of selection on genes involved in cryptobiosis. All panagrolaimids have acquired genes through horizontal gene transfer, some of which are likely to contribute to cryptobiosis.","3412":"Searching for an efficient single-atom catalyst for benzene hydroxylation to phenol is of critical importance, but it still remains a challenge. Herein, a single-atom catalyst with unique Cu-N2 moieties (Cu1-N2\/HCNS) was prepared and confirmed by HAADF-STEM and EXAFS. Turnover number (TON) over Cu1-N2\/HCNS (6,935) is 3.4 times of Cu1-N3\/HCNS (2,034) under the same reaction conditions, and both exhibit much higher phenol selectivity (close to 99%) and stability compared with Cu nanoparticles and nanoclusters. Experiments and DFT calculations reveal that atomically dispersed Cu species are active sites for benzene hydroxylation to phenol, and the Cu-N2 is more active than Cu-N3 owing to its much lower energy barrier concerning the activation of H2O2 led by its unique coordination state of local atomic structure. We envision that this work opens a new window for modulating coordination environments of single metallic atoms in catalysis design.","3413":null,"3414":"The ER is composed of distinct structures like tubules, matrices, and sheets, all of which are important for its various functions. However, how these distinct ER structures, especially the perinuclear ER sheets, are formed remains unclear. We report here that the ER membrane protein Climp63 and the ER luminal protein calumenin-1 (Calu1) collaboratively maintain ER sheet morphology. We show that the luminal length of Climp63 is positively correlated with the luminal width of ER sheets. Moreover, the lumen-only mutant of Climp63 dominant-negatively narrows the lumen of ER sheets, demonstrating that Climp63 acts as an ER luminal bridge. We also reveal that Calu1 specifically interacts with Climp63 and antagonizes Climp63 in terms of both ER sheet distribution and luminal width. Together, our data provide insight into how the structure of ER sheets is maintained and regulated.","3415":"The static PN junction is the foundation of integrated circuits. Herein, we pioneer a high current density generation by mechanically moving N-type semiconductor over P-type semiconductor, named as the dynamic PN junction. The establishment and destruction of the depletion layer causes the redistribution and rebounding of diffusing carriers by the built-in field, similar to a capacitive charge\/discharge process of PN junction capacitance during the movement. Through inserting dielectric layer at the interface of the dynamic PN junction, output voltage can be improved and designed numerically according to the energy level difference between the valence band of semiconductor and conduction band of dielectric layer. Especially, the dynamic MoS2\/AlN\/Si generator with open-circuit voltage of 5.1 V, short-circuit current density of 112.0 A\/m2, power density of 130.0 W\/m2, and power-conversion efficiency of 32.5% has been achieved, which can light up light-emitting diode timely and directly. This generator can continuously work for 1 h, demonstrating its great potential applications.","3416":"The diffuse-type gastric cancer (DGC) constitutes a subgroup of gastric cancer with poor prognosis and no effective molecular therapies. Here, we report a phosphoproteomic landscape of DGC derived from 83 tumors together with their nearby tissues. Based on phosphorylation, DGC could be classified into three molecular subtypes with distinct overall survival (OS) and chemosensitivity. We identified 16 kinases whose activities were associated with poor OS. These activated kinases covered several cancer hallmark pathways, with the MTOR signaling network being the most frequently activated. We proposed a patient-specific strategy based on the hierarchy of clinically actionable kinases for prioritization of kinases for further clinical evaluation. Our global data analysis indicates that in addition to finding activated kinase pathways in DGC, large-scale phosphoproteomics could be used to classify DGCs into subtypes that are associated with distinct clinical outcomes as well as nomination of kinase targets that may be inhibited for cancer treatments.","3417":null,"3418":null,"3419":null,"3420":"Cancer is a disease governed by the underlying gene regulatory networks. The hallmarks of cancer have been proposed to characterize the cancerization, e.g., abnormal metabolism, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cancer metastasis. We constructed a metabolism-EMT-metastasis regulatory network and quantified its underlying landscape. We identified four attractors, characterizing epithelial, abnormal metabolic, mesenchymal, and metastatic cell states, respectively. Importantly, we identified an abnormal metabolic state. Based on the transition path theory, we quantified the kinetic transition paths among these different cell states. Our results for landscape and paths indicate that metastasis is a sequential process: cells tend to first change their metabolism, then activate the EMT and eventually reach the metastatic state. This demonstrates the importance of the temporal order for different gene circuits switching on or off during metastatic progression of cancer cells and underlines the cascading regulation of metastasis through an abnormal metabolic intermediate state.","3421":null,"3422":null,"3423":"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key players of post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, relying on competitive and cooperative interactions to fine-tune their action. Several studies have described individual interactions of RBPs with RBP mRNAs. Here we present a systematic network investigation of fifty thousand interactions between RBPs and the UTRs of RBP mRNAs. We identified two structural features in this network. RBP clusters are groups of densely interconnected RBPs co-binding their targets, suggesting a tight control of cooperative and competitive behaviors. RBP chains are hierarchical structures connecting RBP clusters and driven by evolutionarily ancient RBPs. These features suggest that RBP chains may coordinate the different cell programs controlled by RBP clusters. Under this model, the regulatory signal flows through chains from one cluster to another, implementing elaborate regulatory plans. This work thus suggests RBP-RBP interactions as a backbone driving post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression to control RBPs action on their targets.","3424":null,"3425":"Pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation is orchestrated by the action of transcription factors that operate in a gene regulatory network to activate endocrine lineage genes and repress lineage-inappropriate genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important modulators of gene expression, yet their role in endocrine cell differentiation has not been systematically explored. Here we characterize miRNA-regulatory networks active in human endocrine cell differentiation by combining small RNA sequencing, miRNA over-expression, and network modeling approaches. Our analysis identified Let-7g, Let-7a, miR-200a, miR-127, and miR-375 as endocrine-enriched miRNAs that drive endocrine cell differentiation-associated gene expression changes. These miRNAs are predicted to target different transcription factors, which converge on genes involved in cell cycle regulation. When expressed in human embryonic stem cell-derived pancreatic progenitors, these miRNAs induce cell cycle exit and promote endocrine cell differentiation. Our study delineates the role of miRNAs in human endocrine cell differentiation and identifies miRNAs that could facilitate endocrine cell reprogramming.","3426":null,"3427":null,"3428":"Gene regulation in higher organisms involves a sophisticated interplay between genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Despite advances, the logic in selective usage of certain genomic regions as regulatory elements remains unclear. Here we show that the inherent biophysical properties of the DNA encode epigenetic state and the underlying regulatory potential. We find that the propeller twist (ProT) level is indicative of genomic location of the regulatory elements, their strength, the affinity landscape of transcription factors, and distribution in the nuclear 3D space. We experimentally show that ProT levels confer increased DNA flexibility and surface accessibility, and thus potentially primes usage of high ProT regions as regulatory elements. ProT levels also correlate with occurrence and phenotypic consequences of mutations. Interestingly, cell-fate switches involve a transient usage of low ProT regulatory elements. Altogether, our work provides unprecedented insights into the gene regulatory landscape encoded in the DNA biophysical features.","3429":"Biliary tract cancers (BTCs) currently have no approved targeted therapies. Although genomic profiling of primary BTCs has identified multiple potential drug targets, accurate models are needed for their evaluation. Genomic profiling of 22 BTC cell lines revealed they harbor similar mutational signatures, recurrently mutated genes, and genomic alterations to primary tumors. Transcriptomic profiling identified two major subtypes, enriched for epithelial and mesenchymal genes, which were also evident in patient-derived organoids and primary tumors. Interrogating these models revealed multiple mechanisms of MAPK signaling activation in BTC, including co-occurrence of low-activity BRAF and MEK mutations with receptor tyrosine kinase overexpression. Finally, BTC cell lines with altered ERBB2 or FGFRs were exquisitely sensitive to specific targeted agents, whereas surprisingly, IDH1-mutant lines did not respond to IDH1 inhibitors in vitro. These findings establish BTC cell lines as robust models of primary disease, reveal specific molecular disease subsets, and highlight specific molecular vulnerabilities in these cancers.","3430":"Body mass index (BMI) is commonly used to define obesity. However, concerns about its accuracy in predicting adiposity have been raised. The feasibility of using BMI as well as waist-height ratio (WHtR) in assessing adiposity was examined in relation to a more direct measurement of percent body fat (%BF). We analyzed the relation between dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-measured fat mass and BMI and WHtR using the US 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. A considerable proportion of subjects in the healthy BMI range 20-25 were found to have excess adiposity, including 33.1% of males and 51.9% of females. The use of WHtR also supports the notion of normal-weight central obesity (NWCO), which increases with age. These findings have important implications not only for clinical practice but also for many comparative studies where control subjects are usually selected based on age, sex, and BMI.","3431":"The invasion of a suitable host hepatocyte by Plasmodium sporozoites is an essential step in malaria infection. We demonstrate that in infected hepatocytes, lysosomes are redistributed away from the nucleus, and surface exposure of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) is increased. Lysosome exocytosis in infected cells occurs independently of sporozoite traversal. Instead, a sporozoite-secreted factor is sufficient for the process. Knockdown of SNARE proteins involved in lysosome-plasma membrane fusion reduces lysosome exocytosis and Plasmodium infection. In contrast, promoting fusion between the lysosome and plasma membrane dramatically increases infection. Our work demonstrates parallels between Plasmodium sporozoite entry of hepatocytes and infection by the excavate pathogen Trypanosoma cruzi and raises the question of whether convergent evolution has shaped host cell invasion by divergent pathogens.","3432":null,"3433":null,"3434":"Dengue symptoms include alteration of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis, causing severe hemorrhage and death. Here, we demonstrate that higher concentration of plasmin, the human fibrinolytic factor, in blood meal enhances dengue virus (DENV) infection in mosquito midgut and dissemination in mosquitoes. We also show that mosquitoes express a plasmin-selective Kazal-type inhibitor (AaTI) in the midgut to inhibit plasmin proteolysis and revert the enhanced infection. Using bio-layer interferometry, we show that DENV, plasmin, and AaTI interact to form a tripartite complex. Eventually, plasmin increases midgut internalization of dextran molecules and this is reverted by AaTI. Our study demonstrates that (1) DENV recruits plasmin to increase local proteolytic activity in the midgut, thus degrading the glycocalyx and enhancing DENV internalization and (2) AaTI can act as a transmission-blocking agent by inhibiting plasmin proteolysis. Our results indicate that dengue pathogenesis enhances DENV fitness by increasing its infectivity to mosquitoes.","3435":"","3436":"Multi-targeted kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib, have been used in various malignancies, but their efficacy in clinical applications varies among individuals and lacks pretherapeutic prediction measures. We applied the concept of \"click chemistry\" to pathological staining and established a drug-loaded probe staining assay. We stained the cells and different types of pathological sections and demonstrated that the assay was reliable. We further verified in cells, cell-derived xenograft model, and clinical level that the staining intensity of the probe could reflect drug sensitivity. The stained samples from 300 patients who suffered from hepatocellular carcinoma and used the sorafenib probe also indicated that staining intensity was closely related to clinical information and could be used as an independent marker without undergoing sorafenib therapy for prognosis. This assay provided new ideas for multi-target drug clinical trials, pre-medication prediction, and pathological research.","3437":null,"3438":"Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a fundamental regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism. mTOR is activated in renal cancer and accelerates tumor progression. Here, we report that the mTOR inhibitor, DEP domain-containing mTOR-interacting protein (DEPTOR), is strikingly suppressed in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tumors and cell lines. We demonstrate that DEPTOR is repressed by both hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1 and HIF-2, which occurs through activation of the HIF-target gene and transcriptional repressor, BHLHe40\/DEC1\/Stra13. Restoration of DEPTOR- and CRISPR\/Cas9-mediated knockout experiments demonstrate that DEPTOR is growth inhibitory in ccRCC. Furthermore, loss of DEPTOR confers resistance to second-generation mTOR kinase inhibitors through deregulated mTORC1 feedback to IRS-2\/PI3K\/Akt. This work reveals a hitherto unknown mechanism of resistance to mTOR kinase targeted therapy that is mediated by HIF-dependent reprograming of mTOR\/DEPTOR networks and suggests that restoration of DEPTOR in ccRCC will confer sensitivity to mTOR kinase therapeutics.","3439":null,"3440":null,"3441":null,"3442":"Salinity is a devastating abiotic stress accounting for major crop losses yearly. Plant roots can strikingly grow away from high-salt patches. This response is termed halotropism and occurs through auxin redistribution in roots in response to a salt gradient. Here, a natural variation screen for the early and NaCl-specific halotropic response of 333 Arabidopsis accessions revealed quantitative differences in the first 24 h. These data were successfully used to identify genetic components associated with the response through Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Follow-up characterization of knockout mutants in Col-0 background confirmed the role of transcription factor WRKY25, cation-proton exchanger CHX13, and a gene of unknown function DOB1 (Double Bending 1) in halotropism. In chx13 and dob1 mutants, ion accumulation and shoot biomass under salt stress were also affected. Thus, our GWAS has identified genetic components contributing to main root halotropism that provide insight into the genetic architecture underlying plant salt responses.","3443":null,"3444":"With rapid declines in solar photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage costs, futures with PV penetrations approaching or exceeding 50% of total annual US generation are becoming conceivable. The operational merits of such a national-scale system have not been evaluated sufficiently. Here, we analyze in detail the operational impacts of a future US power system with very high annual levels of PV (&gt;50%) with storage. We show that load and operating reserve requirements can be met for all hours while considering key generator operational constraints. Storage plays an active role in maintaining the balance of supply and demand during sunset hours. Under the highest PV penetration scenario, hours with &gt;90% PV penetration are relatively common, which require rapid transitions between predominately conventional synchronous generation and mostly inverter-based generation. We observe hours with almost 400 GW (over 40%) of economic curtailment and frequent (up to 36%) hours with very low energy prices.","3445":"Oncogene amplification is one of the most common drivers of genetic events in cancer, potently promoting tumor development, growth, and progression. The recent discovery that oncogene amplification commonly occurs on extrachromosomal DNA, driving intratumoral genetic heterogeneity and high copy number owing to its non-chromosomal mechanism of inheritance, raises important questions about how the subnuclear location of amplified oncogenes mediates tumor pathogenesis. Next-generation sequencing is powerful but does not provide spatial resolution for amplified oncogenes, and new approaches are needed for accurately quantifying oncogenes located on ecDNA. Here, we introduce ecSeg, an image analysis tool that integrates conventional microscopy with deep neural networks to accurately resolve ecDNA and oncogene amplification at the single cell level.","3446":"The HIV-1 envelope (Env) surface is shrouded with an assortment of oligomannose-, hybrid-, and complex-type glycans that enable virus interaction with carbohydrate-recognizing lectins. This study examined the importance of glycan heterogeneity for HIV-1 transmission through the trans-infection pathway by the host mannose-binding lectin DC-SIGN. A diversity of glycan content was observed among HIV-1 strains and associated with varying degrees of trans-infection via DC-SIGN and sensitivity to trans-infection blockage by antiviral lectins. When Env glycans were modified to display only the oligomannose type, DC-SIGN-mediated virus capture was enhanced; however, virus trans-infection was diminished because of increased degradation, which was alleviated by incorporation with hybrid-type glycans. Amino acid changes in the Env signal peptide (SP) modulated the Env glycan content, leading to alterations in DC-SIGN-dependent trans-infection and virus sensitivity to antiviral lectins. Hence, SP variation and glycosylation that confer varied types of oligosaccharides to HIV-1 Env are critical determinants for virus fitness and phenotypic diversity.","3447":null,"3448":null,"3449":"Epigenomic changes and stem cell deterioration are two hallmarks of aging. Accumulating evidence suggest that senescence of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) perpetuates aging or age-related diseases. Here we report that two H3K9 demethylases, KDM3A and KDM4C, regulate heterochromatin reorganization via transcriptionally activating condensin components NCAPD2 and NCAPG2 during MSC senescence. Suppression of KDM3A or KDM4C by either genetic or biochemical approach leads to robust DNA damage response and aggravates cellular senescence, whereas overexpression of KDM3A\/KDM4C or NCAPD2 promotes heterochromatin reorganization and blunts DNA damage response. Moreover, MSCs derived from Kdm3a-\/- mice exhibit defective chromosome organization and exacerbated DNA damage response, which are associated with accelerated bone aging. Consistently, analysis of human bone marrow MSCs and transcriptome database reveals inverse correlation of KDM3A\/KDM4C and\/or NCAPD2\/NCAPG2 with aging. Taken together, the present finding unveils that H3K9 demethylases function as a surveillance mechanism to restrain DNA damage accumulation in stem cells during aging.","3450":"Precise regulation of neuronal migration termination is crucial for the establishment of brain cytoarchitectures. However, little is known about how neurons terminate migration. Here we focused on interactions between migrating cortical neurons and their substrates, radial glial (RG) cells, and analyzed the role of Plexin A2 and A4 (PlxnA2\/A4) receptors and their repulsive ligand, Semaphorin 6A (Sema6A), for this process. In both PlxnA2\/A4 double-knockout and Sema6A mutant mice, the outermost cortical plate neurons ectopically invade layer 1 at a stage when they should reach their destinations. PlxnA2\/A4 proteins are abundantly expressed on their leading processes, whereas Sema6A mRNA is enriched in RG cell somata. Cell-targeted gene expression and conditional knockouts indicate critical roles for these molecules. We hypothesize that the timely appearance of repulsive signaling mediated by Sema6A-PlxnA2\/A4 weakens migrating neuron-RG cell interactions, leading to migration termination.","3451":"Sustained treatment of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer with ER-targeting drugs results in ER mutations and refractory unresponsive cancers. Androgen receptor (AR), which is expressed in 80%-95% of ER-positive breast cancers, could serve as an alternate therapeutic target. Although AR agonists were used in the past to treat breast cancer, their use is currently infrequent due to virilizing side effects. Discovery of tissue-selective AR modulators (SARMs) has renewed interest in using AR agonists to treat breast cancer. Using translational models, we show that AR agonist and SARM, but not antagonist, inhibit the proliferation and growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells, patient-derived tissues, and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Ligand-activated AR inhibits wild-type and mutant ER activity by reprogramming the ER and FOXA1 cistrome and rendering tumor growth inhibition. These findings suggest that ligand-activated AR may function as a non-canonical inhibitor of ER and that AR agonists may offer a safe and effective treatment for ER-positive breast cancer.","3452":"Digital health promises a paradigm shift for medicine where biomarkers in individuals are continuously monitored to improve diagnosis and treatment of disease. To that end, a technology for minimally invasive quantification of endogenous analytes in bodily fluids will be required. Here, we describe a strategy for designing and fabricating hydrogel microfilaments that can penetrate the skin while allowing for optical fluorescence sensing. The polyacrylamide formulation was selected to provide high elastic modulus in the dehydrated state and optical transparency in the hydrated state. The microfilaments can be covalently tethered to a fluorescent aptamer to enable functional sensing. The microfilament array can penetrate the skin with low pain and without breaking, contact the dermal interstitial fluid, and be easily removed from the skin. In the future, hydrogel microfilaments could be integrated with a wearable fluorometer to serve as a platform for continuous, minimally invasive monitoring of intradermal biomarkers.","3453":null,"3454":null,"3455":null,"3456":"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease affected by diverse factors, and lipid droplets (LDs) are increasingly recognized as major players in PD because of their relevance to neuron activity. However, long-term dynamic changes of LDs and their relative activity remain unclear. Here, an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe named 2-DPAN was prepared and employed to visualize dynamic processes of LDs in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of PD for the first time, and LDs' accumulation-peak\/plateau-decrease were confirmed. We further found a close relationship between LDs and variation in mitochondrial activity. Strikingly, the progression of cell death was accelerated by lipase, whereas pre-stimulation of LDs by unsaturated fatty acid-oleic acid decreased the death process by inhibiting excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fatty acid production, thereby protecting mitochondria. The utilization of 2-DPAN demonstrates the importance of LDs in neuronal homeostasis, and effective tuning of LDs may prevent or inhibit PD progression.","3457":null,"3458":"In this paper, we formulate and quantitatively examine the effect of dissipation on topological systems. We use a specific model of Kitaev quantum wire with an onsite Ohmic dissipation and perform a numerically exact method to investigate the effect of dissipation on the topological features of the system (e.g., the Majorana edge mode) at zero temperature. We find that even though the topological phase is robust against weak dissipation as it is supposed to be, it will eventually be destroyed by sufficiently strong dissipation via either a continuous quantum phase transition or a crossover depending on the symmetry of the system. The dissipation-driven quantum criticality has also been discussed.","3459":"Single-base changes lead to important biological and biomedical implications; however, the discrimination of single-base changes from normal DNA always remains a grand challenge. Herein we developed a DNA recognition and amplification system based on artificial branched DNA, namely, target-triggered polymerization (TTP), to realize enzyme-free and fast discrimination of single-base changes. Branched DNA as monomers rapidly polymerized into DNA nanospheres only with the trigger of specific DNA. Our TTP system worked reliably over a wide range of conditions. Remarkably, our TTP system was capable of discriminating base-changing DNA from normal DNA, including distinguishing 1-4 nucleotide changes and positions of single base, which was attributed to the significant amplification of small differences in hybridization thermodynamics and kinetics. We further proposed a theoretical method for calculating the hybridization probability of nucleic acids, which performed highly consistent with experimental results.","3460":null,"3461":"To overcome limited information on organic cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries, we studied the electrochemical redox properties of pyrenetetrone and its nitrogen-doped derivatives. Three primary conclusions are highlighted from this study. First, the redox potential increases as the number of electron-withdrawing nitrogen dopants increases. Second, the redox potentials of pyrenetetrone derivatives continuously decrease with the number of bound Li atoms during the discharging process owing to the decrease in the reductive ability until the compounds become cathodically deactivated exhibiting negative redox potentials. Notably, pyrenetetrone with four nitrogen dopants loses its cathodic activity after the binding of five Li atoms, indicating remarkably high performance (496 mAh\/g and 913 mWh\/g). Last, the redox potential is strongly correlated not only with electronic properties but also with solvation energy. This highlights that pyrenetetrone derivatives would follow two-stage transition behaviors during the discharging process, implying a crucial contribution of solvation energy to their cathodic deactivation.","3462":"","3463":null,"3464":"The intestinal epithelium is a very dynamic tissue under a high regenerative pressure, which makes it susceptible to malignant transformation. Proper integration of various cell signaling pathways and a balanced cross talk between different cell types composing the organ are required to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Dysregulation of this balance can lead to colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we review important insights into molecular and cellular mechanisms of CRC. We discuss how perturbation in complex regulatory networks, including the Wnt, Notch, BMP, and Hedgehog pathways; and how variations in inflammatory signaling, nutrients, and microbiota can affect intestinal homeostasis contributing to the malignant transformation of intestinal cells.","3465":null,"3466":"Epithelia of the oral cavity exhibit variations in morphologies and turnover rates. Are these differences related to environment or to region-specific stem cell populations? A lineage-tracing strategy allowed visualization of Wnt-responsive cells, and their progeny, in the hard and soft palates. In both anatomic locations, Wnt-responsive basal cells self-renewed and gave rise to supra-basal cells. Palatal injuries triggered an enlargement of this population, and their descendants were responsible for wound re-epithelialization. Compared with the hard palate, soft palate stem cells exhibited an earlier, more robust burst in proliferation, culminating in significantly faster repair. Thereafter, excess Wnt-responsive basal cells were removed, and stem cell numbers were restored back to homeostatic level. Thus, we uncovered a stem cell population in oral mucosa, and its relative abundance is correlate with the rate of oral wound healing. Besides the activation during injury, an endogenous mechanism exists to constrain the stem cell pool after repair.","3467":null,"3468":"Intra-tumor heterogeneity is frequently observed in cancer patients, and it is associated with therapeutic resistance and disease relapse. However, its systematic assessment is still limited and often unfeasible. Here, we use a mathematical model of tumor progression to decipher how multiple clones emerge and organize into complex architectures. We found a trade-off between cancer cell alteration and proliferation rates that defines a transition between low and high heterogeneity, the latter characterized by branching tumor phylogenies. We predict the existence of observed and hidden intra-tumor heterogeneity, which challenges the correct estimation of intrinsic tumor complexity. Although the numbers of observed and hidden clones do not always correlate, we demonstrate that population frequencies of observed clones can be used to estimate the extent of hidden heterogeneity in both simulated and human tumors. The characterization of complex clonal architectures is a critical first step toward understanding their organizing principles and predicting their emergence.","3469":null,"3470":"Cyclic lipopeptide (CLP) antibiotics have a mechanism that causes membrane malfunction. Thus mechanisms of bacterial resistance to CLPs are thought to modify cell surfaces. However, we found that bacterial resistance to CLPs was strongly related to energy metabolism. Using polymyxin B (PB) as a model of CLPs, we showed that PB causes malfunction of respiration and serious depletion of ATP, contributing to PB-induced cell death and carbon starvation. Glucose addition could maintain the intracellular ATP level and reverse the carbon starvation response resulting from PB treatment. Another study revealed that glycolysis was stimulated by the presence of PB and glucose. The mechanism underlying glucose-enabled CLPs' resistance suggests that glucose could maintain the ATP level in PB-treated bacteria by enhancing glycolysis. Similar results were observed in Staphylococcus aureus, where daptomycin resistance was enhanced by glucose. These findings provide insight into the mode of action of CLPs and resistance to these antibiotics.","3471":"The design and synthesis of metal chelators with extraordinary metal affinities is a basic and challenging scientific problem of both fundamental and practical importance. Here, we demonstrate a \"conformational stability effect\" that can significantly enhance the metal affinity of ligands after conjugation to polymer chains with the ability to spontaneously adopt a specific conformation as an optimal \"soft\" scaffold to ensure maximum thermodynamic stability of the metal complexes. Using iron chelators as models, we show that simple conjugation of small molecule catechol ligands to a polyallylamine chain resulted in more than 8-9 orders of magnitude enhancement of the iron-binding affinity, which is comparable to that of enterobactin, the strongest iron chelator ever known. This study demonstrates that flexible polymer chelators may realize the highest possible metal affinities of the conjugated ligands owing to their ability to achieve an optimal conformation, which could advance the identification of strong metal chelators.","3472":"Microvesicles (MVs) are used by various types of cells in the human body for intercellular communication, making them biomarkers of great potential for the early and non-evasive diagnosis of a spectrum of diseases. An integrated analysis including morphological, quantitative, and compositional studies is most desirable for the clinical application of MV detection; however, such integration is limited by the currently available analysis techniques. In this context, exploiting the phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure of MVs, we synthesized a series of dendritic molecules with PS-binding sites at the periphery. PS-dendron binding was studied at the molecular level using NMR approaches, whereas PS-containing membrane-dendron interaction was investigated in an aqueous environment using plasmon waveguide resonance spectroscopy. As a proof of concept, polyethylene terephthalate surface was functionalized with the synthetic dendrons, forming devices that can capture MVs to facilitate their subsequent analyses.","3473":null,"3474":null,"3475":"Two-dimensional atomic single crystals (2DASCs) have drawn immense attention because of their potential for fundamental research and new technologies.

Precise vapor-phase synthesis of 2DASCs with tunable thickness, selectable phase, and controllable chemical composition can be realized to adjust their band structures and electronic properties. This review highlights the latest advances in the precise vapor-phase synthesis of 2DASCs. We thoroughly elaborate on strategies toward the accurate control of layer number, phase, chemical composition of layered 2DASCs, and thickness of non-layered 2DASCs.

Dysregulation in the pathway is linked to the impairments in vascular function associated with many diseases, including cancer, ocular diseases, systemic inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases. The present study uses a computational signaling pathway model validated against experimental data to quantitatively study various mechanistic aspects of the angiopoietin-Tie signaling pathway, including receptor activation, trafficking, turnover, and molecular mechanisms of its regulation. The model provides mechanistic insights into the controversial role of Ang2 and its regulators vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) and Tie1 and predicts synergistic effects of inhibition of VE-PTP, Tie1, and Tie2 cleavage on enhancing the vascular protective actions of Tie2.","3478":null,"3479":"Exploration of predictive descriptors for the performance of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is significant for material development in many energy conversion processes. In this work, we used high-throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate the OER performance of thirty kinds of isolated transition metal atoms-doped ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets (M-UMONs). The results showed that the OER activity could be a function of the decorated transition metal-sulfur (M-S) bond orders with a volcanic-shaped correlation, and a strong correlation could be found when the difference of the M-S bond orders and corresponding metal-oxygen (M-O) bond orders were taken into consideration, implying that the difference in M-S and M-O bond orders could be a predictive descriptor of OER activity for M-UMON system. This successful result also implies this calculation-based method for the exploring of descriptors would also provide a new promising avenue for the discovery of high-performance OER catalysts.","3480":null,"3481":"2-Methylthio-N6-isopentenyl modification of adenosine (ms2i6A) is an evolutionally conserved modification found in mitochondrial (mt)-tRNAs. Cdk5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1) specifically converts N6-isopentenyladenosine (i6A) to ms2i6A at position A37 of four mt-DNA-encoded tRNAs, and the modification regulates efficient mitochondrial translation and energy metabolism in mammals. Here, we report that the ms2 conversion mediated by CDK5RAP1 in mt-tRNAs is required to sustain glioma-initiating cell (GIC)-related traits. CDK5RAP1 maintained the self-renewal capacity, undifferentiated state, and tumorigenic potential of GICs. This regulation was not related to the translational control of mt-proteins. CDK5RAP1 abrogated the antitumor effect of i6A by converting i6A to ms2i6A and protected GICs from excessive autophagy triggered by i6A. The elevated activity of CDK5RAP1 contributed to the amelioration of the tumor-suppressive effect of i6A and promoted GIC maintenance. This work demonstrates that CDK5RAP1 is crucial for the detoxification of endogenous i6A and that GICs readily utilize this mechanism for survival.","3482":null,"3483":"Development of spinel oxides as low-cost and high-efficiency catalysts is highly desirable; however, rational synthesis of efficient and stable spinel systems with precisely controlled structure and components remains challenging. We demonstrate the design of complex nanostructured cobalt-based bimetallic spinel catalysts for low-temperature CO oxidation by a simple template-free method. The self-assembled multi-shelled mesoporous spinel nanostructures provide high surface area (203.5 m2\/g) and favorable unique surface chemistry for producing abundant active sites and lead to the creation of robust microsphere configured by 16-nm spinel nanosheets, which achieve satisfactory water-resisting property and catalytic activity. Theoretical models show that O vacancies at exposed {110} facets in cubic spinel phase guarantee the strong adsorption of reactive oxygen species on the surface of catalysts and play a key role in the prevention of deactivation under moisture-rich conditions. The design concept with architecture and composition control can be extended to other mixed transition metal oxide compositions.","3484":"Aberrant RAS signaling activation is common in cancers with even few Ras mutations, indicating alternative dysregulation other than genetic mutations. We identified a Ras GTPase-activating gene RASA5\/SYNGAP1, at the common 6p21.3 deletion, methylated\/downregulated in multiple carcinomas and different from other RASA family members (RASA1-RASA4), indicating its special functions in tumorigenesis. RASA5 mutations are rare, unlike other RASA members, whereas its promoter CpG methylation is frequent in multiple cancer cell lines and primary carcinomas and associated with patient's poor survival. RASA5 expression inhibited tumor cell migration\/invasion and growth in mouse model, functioning as a tumor suppressor. RASA5 suppressed RAS signaling, depending on its Ras GTPase-activating protein catalytic activity, which could be counteracted by oncogenic HRas Q61L mutant. RASA5 knockdown enhanced Ras signaling to promote tumor cell growth. RASA5 also inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through regulating actin reorganization. Thus, epigenetic inactivation of RASA5 contributing to hyperactive RAS signaling is involved in Ras-driven human oncogenesis.","3485":null,"3486":null,"3487":"Cancer cells rely on mTORC1 activity to coordinate mitogenic signaling with nutrients availability for growth. Based on the metabolic function of E2F1, we hypothesize that glucose catabolism driven by E2F1 could participate on mTORC1 activation. Here, we demonstrate that glucose potentiates E2F1-induced mTORC1 activation by promoting mTORC1 translocation to lysosomes, a process that occurs independently of AMPK activation. We showed that E2F1 regulates glucose metabolism by increasing aerobic glycolysis and identified the PFKFB3 regulatory enzyme as an E2F1-regulated gene important for mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, PFKFB3 and PFK1 were found associated to lysosomes and we demonstrated that modulation of PFKFB3 activity, either by substrate accessibility or expression, regulates the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes by direct interaction with Rag B and subsequent mTORC1 activity. Our results support a model whereby a glycolytic metabolon containing phosphofructokinases transiently interacts with the lysosome acting as a sensor platform for glucose catabolism toward mTORC1 activity.","3488":"To adjust cell growth and metabolism according to environmental conditions, the conserved TORC1 signaling network controls autophagy, protein synthesis, and turnover. Here, we dissected the signals controlling phosphorylation and activity of the TORC1-effector kinase Npr1, involved in tuning the plasma membrane permeability to nitrogen sources. By evaluating a role of pH as a signal, we show that, although a transient cytosolic acidification accompanies nitrogen source entry and is correlated to a rapid TORC1-dependent phosphorylation of Npr1, a pH drop is not a prerequisite for TORC1 activation. We show that the Gtr1\/Gtr2 and Pib2 regulators of TORC1 both independently and differently contribute to regulate Npr1 phosphorylation and activity. Finally, our data reveal that Npr1 mediates nitrogen-dependent phosphorylation of Pib2, as well as a Pib2-dependent inhibition of TORC1. This work highlights a feedback control loop likely enabling efficient downregulation and faster re-activation of TORC1 in response to a novel stimulating signal.","3489":null,"3490":"We identify dynamic topological phenomena such as dynamic Chern numbers and dynamic quantum phase transitions in quantum quenches of the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian with parity-time (PT) symmetry. Their occurrences in the non-unitary dynamics are intimately connected with fixed points in the Brillouin zone, where the density matrices do not evolve in time. Based on our theoretical formalism characterizing topological properties of non-unitary dynamics, we prove the existence of fixed points for quenches between distinct static topological phases in the PT-symmetry-preserving regime, thus unveiling the interplay between dynamic topological phenomena and PT symmetry. Interestingly, non-Hermiticity of the driving Hamiltonian gives rise to rich dynamic topological phenomena which are different, either qualitatively or quantitatively, from their counterparts in unitary dynamics. Our work sheds light on dynamic topological phenomena in open systems and is readily accessible in experiments.","3491":null,"3492":null,"3493":"Excellently preserved fossils often provide important insights into evolutionary histories and adaptations to environmental change in Earth's biogeologic record. Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, for example, is a proven reservoir for spectacular findings. Here we document the first record of a fossil land snail with periostracal hairs preserved in amber. We interpret the development of hairs as an adaptation to the tropical forest environment, serving as a mechanism to increase adhesion of the snail to plants during foraging while collecting and transporting seeds in the process. The present record coincides with a major global radiation of angiosperms, a main food resource for terrestrial snails. As such, the expansion of flowering plants likely triggered this evolutionary adaptation and, thus, the diversification of land snails in the Cretaceous.","3494":"Juveniles must reach a critical body size to become a mature adult. Molecular determinants of critical size have been studied, but the evolutionary importance of critical size is still unclear. Here, using nine fly species, we show that interspecific variation in organism size can be explained solely by species-specific critical size. The observed variation in critical size quantitatively agrees with the interspecific scaling relationship predicted by the life history model, which hypothesizes that critical size mediates an energy allocation switch between juvenile and adult tissues. The mechanism underlying critical size scaling is explained by an inverse relationship between growth duration and growth rate, which cancels out their contributions to the final size. Finally, we show that evolutionary changes in growth duration can be traced back to the scaling of ecdysteroid hormone dynamics. We conclude that critical size adaptively optimizes energy allocation, and has a central role in organism size determination.","3495":null,"3496":"Sporadic Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (sMTC) is a rare but aggressive thyroid tumor.

With this methodology we greatly reduced the number of RET- or RAS-negative cases and we confirmed the central role of RET and RAS mutations. Moreover, we highlighted the bad prognostic role of RET mutations in sMTC and consolidated the favorable prognostic role of RAS mutations. For the first time, we showed that the variant allele frequency represents an additional prognostic marker inside the group of RET-mutated sMTC.","3497":null,"3498":null,"3499":"Primary Investigators at all levels of their career face a range of challenges related to optimizing their activity within the constraints of deadlines and productive research.

The associations between diseases and protein-coding genes (PCGs) have been well investigated, and miRNAs interact with PCGs to trigger them to be functional. We present a computational method, DimiG, to infer miRNA-associated diseases using a semi-supervised Graph Convolutional Network model (GCN). DimiG uses a multi-label framework to integrate PCG-PCG interactions, PCG-miRNA interactions, PCG-disease associations, and tissue expression profiles. DimiG is trained on disease-PCG associations and an interaction network using a GCN, which is further used to score associations between diseases and miRNAs. We evaluate DimiG on a benchmark set from verified disease-miRNA associations. Our results demonstrate that DimiG outperforms the best unsupervised method and is comparable to two supervised methods. Three case studies of prostate cancer, lung cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease further demonstrate the efficacy of DimiG, where top miRNAs predicted by DimiG are supported by literature.","3501":null,"3502":"Circular RNAs (circRNAs), an important class of regulatory RNAs, have been shown to be the most prevalent in the brain compared with other tissues. However the processes governing their biogenesis in neurons are still elusive. Moreover, little is known about whether and how different biogenesis factors work in synchrony to generate neuronal circRNAs. To address this question, we pharmacologically inhibited the spliceosome and profiled rat neuronal circRNAs using RNA sequencing. We identified over 100 circRNAs that were up-regulated and a few circRNAs that were down-regulated upon spliceosome inhibition. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that up-regulated circRNAs possess significantly longer flanking introns compared with the un-changed circRNA population. Moreover, the flanking introns of up-regulated circRNAs harbor a higher number of distinct repeat sequences and more reverse complementary motifs compared with the unchanged circRNAs. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the biogenesis of circRNAs containing distinct intronic features becomes favored under conditions of limited spliceosome activity.","3503":null,"3504":"To facilitate the genetic engineering of diverse cyanobacterial strains, we have modified broad-host-range RSF1010-based plasmids to improve transmissibility, increase copy number, and facilitate cloning. RSF1010-based plasmids replicate in diverse bacterial strains but produce low amounts of useable DNA for cloning. We previously engineered a mobAY25F mutation in RSF1010-based plasmids that improved cloning but decreased conjugation efficiency. Here, we engineered RSF1010-based plasmids to restore conjugation efficiency, which was demonstrated in three diverse laboratory strains of cyanobacteria. We then used an improved RSF1010-based plasmid in mating experiments with cultured samples of wild cyanobacteria. This plasmid, which confers antibiotic resistance and carries a yfp reporter gene, allowed selection of exconjugant cyanobacteria and facilitated the isolation of genetically tractable strains from mixed wild cultures. Improved RSF1010 vectors can be used for bioprospecting genetically tractable strains and are compatible with the CYANO-VECTOR cloning system, a versatile toolbox for constructing plasmids for cyanobacterial genetic engineering.","3505":null,"3506":null,"3507":null,"3508":null,"3509":"Human cytomegalovirus establishes a lifelong, latent infection in the human host and can cause significant morbidity and mortality, particularly, in immunocompromised individuals. One established site of HCMV latency and reactivation is in cells of the myeloid lineage. In undifferentiated myeloid cells, such as CD14+ monocytes, virus is maintained latently. We have recently reported an analysis of the total proteome of latently infected CD14+ monocytes, which identified an increase in hematopoietic lineage cell-specific protein (HCLS1). Here we show that this latency-associated upregulation of HCLS1 occurs in a US28-dependent manner and stabilizes actin structure in latently infected cells. This results in their increased motility and ability to transit endothelial cell layers. Thus, latency-associated increases in monocyte motility could aid dissemination of the latently infected reservoir, and targeting this increased motility could have an impact on the ability of latently infected monocytes to distribute to tissue sites of reactivation.","3510":null,"3511":null,"3512":null,"3513":"Large-scale shale gas exploitation greatly enriches ethane resources, making the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene quite fascinating, but the qualified catalyst with unique combination of enhanced activity\/selectivity, enhanced heat transfer, and low pressure drop presents a grand challenge.

Three NiO-precursors of different morphologies (clump, rod, and nanosheet) were directly grown onto Ni-foam followed by Nb2O5 modification to obtain the catalyst products. Notably, the one from the NiO-precursor of nanosheet achieves the highest ethylene yield, in nature, because of markedly diminished unselective oxygen species due to enhanced interaction between Nb2O5 and NiO nanosheet.

Our expression-informed model expanded the application domain beyond specific tissue types to tissues not present in training and achieved consistently high accuracy in predicting DNA accessibility at promoter and promoter flank regions. We then leveraged our new tool by analyzing the DNA accessibility landscape of promoters across The Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that in lung adenocarcinoma the accessibility perspective uniquely highlights immune pathways inversely correlated with a more open chromatin state and that accessibility patterns learned from even a single tumor type can discriminate immune inflammation across many cancers, often with direct relation to patient prognosis.","3516":"Although gray wolves (Canis lupus) are one of the most widely distributed terrestrial mammals, their origins in China are not well understood.

Of SC gray wolves, one wolf from Zhejiang carries a genetic component from a canid and had gene flow from a population related to or further diverged from wolves than the dhole. This may indicate that interspecific gene flow likely played an important role in shaping the speciation patterns and population structure in the genus Canis.

The enhancer was active during adipogenesis and responded strongly to insulin and isoprenaline. The allele associated with increased waist-hip ratio in human genetic studies was associated with higher enhancer activity. Mutations of the enhancer resulted in less adipocyte differentiation. RNA sequencing of cells with disrupted enhancer showed reduced expression of established adipocyte markers, such as ADIPOQ and LPL, and identified CHI3L1 on chromosome 1 as a potential gene involved in adipocyte differentiation. In conclusion, we identified and characterized an enhancer in the SNX10 locus and outlined its plausible mechanisms of action and downstream targets.","3519":"Pincer complexes are a remarkably versatile family benefited from their stability, diversity, and tunability. Many of them contain aromatic organic rings at the periphery, and aromaticity plays an important role in their stability and properties, whereas their metallacyclic cores are not aromatic.

Rhodapentalenes show good thermal stability, although the rhodium-carbon bonds in such compounds are fragile. Experimental and computational studies suggest that the stabilization of rigid CCC pincer architectures together with an intrinsic aromaticity is vital for these metallacyclic rhodium species. Dearomatization-aromatization reactions, corresponding to metal-ligand cooperation of classical aromatic pincer complexes, were observed in this system. These findings suggest a new concept for pincer chemistry, the internal aromaticity involving metal d-orbitals, which would be useful for exploiting the nature of construction motif and inspire further applications.","3520":null,"3521":"Normal synapse formation is fundamental to brain function.

A planar cell polarity protein, Vangl2, which inhibits synapse formation, was decreased in synaptosome fractions of cultured cortical neurons from Lgl1 knockout embryos. Conditional knockout of Lgl1 in pyramidal neurons led to reduction of AMPA\/NMDA ratio and impaired plasticity. Lgl1 is frequently deleted in Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS). Lgl1 conditional knockout led to increased locomotion, impaired novel object recognition and social interaction. Lgl1+\/- animals also showed increased synapse numbers, defects in open field and social interaction, as well as stereotyped repetitive behavior. Social interaction in Lgl1+\/- could be rescued by NMDA antagonists.

Ox1r-deficient mice were resistant to diet-induced obesity, and their food intake was similar between chow and high-fat food. Ox2r-deficient mice exhibited less energy expenditure than wild-type mice when fed a high-fat diet. Neither Ox1r-deficient nor Ox2r-deficient mice showed body weight gain similar to orexin-deficient mice. Although the presence of a running wheel suppressed diet-induced obesity in wild-type mice, the effect was weaker in orexin neuron-ablated mice. Finally, we did not detect abnormalities in brown adipose tissues of orexin-deficient mice. Thus, each orexin receptor signaling has a unique role in energy metabolism, and orexin neurons are involved in the interactive effect of diet and exercise on body weight gain.","3524":null,"3525":"Embryonic pattern formation relies on positional coordination of cell division and specification. Early axis formation during Arabidopsis embryogenesis requires WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX)-mediated transcription activation and PIN-FORMED7 (PIN7)-mediated auxin asymmetry. How these events are regulated is obscure. We report that Arabidopsis JANUS, a putative subunit of spliceosome, is essential for embryonic pattern formation. Significantly reduced transcription but not mRNA processing of WOX2 and PIN7 in janus suggested its role in transcriptional regulation. JANUS interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) through a region outside of its spliceosome-association domain. We further show that Pol II mediates the transcription of WOX2 and PIN7 in a JANUS-dependent way and is essential for embryonic pattern formation. These findings reveal that JANUS recruits Pol II for the activation of two parallel pathways to ensure proper pattern formation during embryogenesis.","3526":"Atlantic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) is a commercially important species of gadoid fish. In the North Sea, their main spawning areas are located close to the northern continental slope. Eggs and larvae drift with the current across the North Sea. However, fish larvae of many taxa can orient at sea using multiple external cues, including the Earth's magnetic field. In this work, we investigated whether haddock larvae passively drift or orient using the Earth's magnetic field. We observed the behavior of 59 and 102 haddock larvae swimming in a behavioral chamber deployed in the Norwegian North Sea and in a magnetic laboratory, respectively. In both in situ and laboratory settings, where the magnetic field direction was modified, haddock larvae significantly oriented toward the northwest. We conclude that haddock larvae orientation at sea is guided by a magnetic compass mechanism. These results have implications for retention and dispersal of pelagic haddock larvae.","3527":null,"3528":"Walking trajectory is frequently measured to assess animal behavior. Air-supported spherical treadmills have been developed for real-time monitoring of animal walking trajectories. However, current systems for mice mainly employ computer mouse microcameras (chip-on-board sensors) to monitor ball motion, and these detectors exhibit technical issues with focus and rotation scale. In addition, computational methods to analyze and quantify the \"random walk\" of organisms are under-developed. In this work, we overcame the hurdle of frame-to-signal translation to develop a treadmill system with camera-based detection. Moreover, we generated a package of mathematical methods to quantify distinct aspects of Drosophila walking trajectories. By extracting and quantifying certain features of walking dynamics with high temporal resolution, we found that depending on their internal state, flies employ different walking strategies to approach environmental cues. This camera-based treadmill system and method package may also be applicable to monitor the walking trajectories of other diverse animal species.","3529":null,"3530":"Mitochondrial protein (MP) assemblies undergo alterations during neurogenesis, a complex process vital in brain homeostasis and disease.

The resulting networks, encompassing 6,442 high-quality associations among 600 MPs, revealed widespread changes in mitochondrial interactions and site-specific phosphorylation during neuronal differentiation. By leveraging the networks, we show the orphan C20orf24 as a respirasome assembly factor whose disruption markedly reduces respiratory chain activity in patients deficient in complex IV. We also find that a heme-containing neurotrophic factor, neuron-derived neurotrophic factor [NENF], couples with Parkinson disease-related proteins to promote neurotrophic activity. Our results provide insights into the dynamic reorganization of mitochondrial networks during neuronal differentiation and highlights mechanisms for MPs in respirasome, neuronal function, and mitochondrial diseases.","3531":null,"3532":"The large-scale application of economically efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is limited in view of the high cost of polymer binders (Nafion) for immobilizing of powder catalysts. In this work, nitrogen-doped molybdenum carbide nanobelts (N-Mo2C NBs) with porous structure are synthesized through a direct pyrolysis process using the pre-prepared molybdenum oxide nanobelts (MoO3 NBs). Nanocellulose instead of Nafion-bonded N-Mo2C NBs (N-Mo2C@NCs) exhibits superior performance toward HER, because of excellent dispersibility and multiple exposed catalytically active sites. Furthermore, the conductive film composed of N-Mo2C NBs, graphene nanosheets, and nanocellulose (N-Mo2C\/G@NCs) is fabricated by simple vacuum filtration, as flexible and editable electrode, which possesses excellent performance for scale HER applications. This work not only proposes the potential of nanocellulose to replace Nafion for binding powder catalysts, but also offers a facile strategy to prepare flexible and conductive films for a wide variety of nanomaterials.","3533":null,"3534":null,"3535":null,"3536":"Nano-structures of biological systems can produce diverse spectroscopic effects through interactions with broadband light. Although structured coloration at the surface has been extensively studied, natural spectroscopic contrasts in deep tissues are poorly understood, which may carry valuable information for evaluating the anatomy and function of biological systems. Here we investigated the spectroscopic characteristics of an important geometry in deep tissues at the nanometer scale: packed nano-cylinders, in the near-infrared window, numerically predicted and experimentally proved that transversely oriented and regularly arranged nano-cylinders could selectively backscatter light of the long wavelengths. Notably, we found that the spectroscopic contrast of nanoscale fibrous structures was sensitive to the pressure load, possibly owing to the changes in the orientation, the degree of alignment, and the spacing. To explore the underlying physical basis, we further developed an analytical model based on the radial distribution function in terms of their radius, refractive index, and spatial distribution.","3537":"Singlet fission is known to improve solar energy utilization by circumventing the Shockley-Queisser limit. The two essential steps of singlet fission are the formation of a correlated triplet pair and its subsequent quantum decoherence. However, the mechanisms of the triplet pair formation and decoherence still remain elusive. Here we examined both essential steps in single crystalline hexacene and discovered remarkable anisotropy of the overall singlet fission rate along different crystal axes. Since the triplet pair formation emerges on the same timescale along both crystal axes, the quantum decoherence is likely responsible for the directional anisotropy. The distinct quantum decoherence rates are ascribed to the notable difference on their associated energy loss according to the Redfield quantum dissipation theory. Our hybrid experimental\/theoretical framework will not only further our understanding of singlet fission, but also shed light on the systematic design of new materials for the third-generation solar cells.","3538":null,"3539":"Understanding endogenous regulation of stress resistance and homeostasis maintenance is critical to developing neuroprotective therapies. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) is a conserved essential enzyme that confers extraordinary protection and stress resistance in many neurodegenerative disease models. Drosophila Nmnat is alternatively spliced to two mRNA variants, RA and RB. RB translates to protein isoform PD with robust protective activity and is upregulated upon stress to confer enhanced neuroprotection. The mechanisms regulating the alternative splicing and stress response of NMNAT remain unclear. We have discovered a Drosophila microRNA, dme-miR-1002, which promotes the splicing of NMNAT pre-mRNA to RB by disrupting a pre-mRNA stem-loop structure. NMNAT pre-mRNA is preferentially spliced to RA in basal conditions, whereas miR-1002 enhances NMNAT PD-mediated stress protection by binding via RISC component Argonaute1 to the pre-mRNA, facilitating the splicing switch to RB. These results outline a new process for microRNAs in regulating alternative splicing and modulating stress resistance.","3540":"Sleep is beneficial yet antagonistic to critical functions such as foraging and escape, and we aim to understand how these competing drives are functionally integrated. C. elegans, which lives in reduced oxygen environments, engages in developmentally timed sleep (DTS) during larval stage transitions and engages in stress-induced sleep (SIS) during recovery from damaging conditions. Although DTS and SIS use distinct mechanisms to coordinate multiple sleep-associated behaviors, we show that movement quiescence in these sleep states is similarly integrated with the competing drive to avoid oxygen. Furthermore, by manipulating oxygen to deprive animals of SIS, we observe sleep rebound in a wild C. elegans isolate, indicating that sleep debt accrues during oxygen-induced SIS deprivation. Our work suggests that multiple sleep states adopt a common, highly plastic effector of movement quiescence that is suppressed by aversive stimuli and responsive to homeostatic sleep pressure, providing a limited window of opportunity for escape.","3541":"In systems biology modeling, important steps include model parameterization, uncertainty quantification, and evaluation of agreement with experimental observations. To help modelers perform these steps, we developed the software PyBioNetFit, which in addition supports checking models against known system properties and solving design problems. PyBioNetFit introduces Biological Property Specification Language (BPSL) for the formal declaration of system properties. BPSL allows qualitative data to be used alone or in combination with quantitative data. PyBioNetFit performs parameterization with parallelized metaheuristic optimization algorithms that work directly with existing model definition standards: BioNetGen Language (BNGL) and Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). We demonstrate PyBioNetFit's capabilities by solving various example problems, including the challenging problem of parameterizing a 153-parameter model of cell cycle control in yeast based on both quantitative and qualitative data. We demonstrate the model checking and design applications of PyBioNetFit and BPSL by analyzing a model of targeted drug interventions in autophagy signaling.","3542":"Parental care is a notable aspect of reproductive effort in many animals. The interaction between offspring begging and the parental feeding response is an important communication mechanism that regulates offspring food supply, and reducing the cost of superfluous begging is beneficial to both parents and offspring. Here we concluded that parents of the burying beetle Nicrophorus quadripunctatus inform their offspring of their preparation for provisioning by emitting \"provisioning pheromone.\" Female parents emitted an antimicrobial aromatic compound, 2-phenoxyethanol, in their regurgitation before provisioning, and this compound elicits begging behavior from their offspring. Furthermore, begging incurs growth and survival costs, and parents spent more than 85% of their time in close proximity to their offspring without provisioning. Therefore, it is suggested that limiting offspring begging during provisioning is beneficial to both parents and offspring. We report here a novel aspect of parent-offspring communication in family life.","3543":null,"3544":"The tumor microenvironment (TME) polarizes tumor-infiltrating macrophages toward tumor support. Macrophage-abundant tumors are highly malignant and are the cause of poor prognosis and therapeutic resistance. In this study, we show that the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor FG-4592 (FG) inhibits tumor growth of macrophage-abundant tumors and prolongs mouse survival. FG not only normalizes tumor vessels and improves tumor oxygenation but also directly affects macrophages and activates phagocytosis through the PHD-hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) axis. Remarkably, FG can promote phagocytic ability of the Ly6Clo subset of tumor-infiltrating macrophages, leading to tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, Ly6Cneg macrophages contributed to blood vessel normalization. Using a malignant tumor mouse model, we characterized macrophage function and subsets. Altogether, our findings suggest that the PHD inhibitor can promote the anti-tumor potential of macrophages to improve cancer therapy.","3545":null,"3546":null,"3547":null,"3548":null,"3549":null,"3550":null,"3551":"Humans have elegant bodies that allow gymnastics, piano playing, and tool use, but understanding how they do this in detail is difficult because their musculoskeletal systems are extremely complicated. Previous studies have shown that common movements such as reaching for a coffee cup, cycling a bicycle, or playing the piano have common patterns across subjects. This paper shows that an arbitrary set of whole-body movements used to trace large closed curves have common patterns both in the trajectory of the body's limbs and in variations within those trajectories. The commonality of the result should spur the search for explanations for its generality. One such principle could be that humans choose trajectories that are economical in energetic cost. Another synergistic possibility is that common movements can be saved in segments that can be combined to facilitate the process of deployment.","3552":"Cyclin E, a key cell cycle regulatory protein, has been linked to oncogenesis when dysregulated. We have previously shown that overexpression of cyclin E causes replication stress, leading to failure to complete replication at specific chromosomal loci during S phase of the cell cycle. This in turn promotes chromosomal damage during anaphase. Here we show that non-transformed human mammary epithelial cell clones that survive such aberrant mitoses have a specific and reproducible pattern of chromosomal Copy Number Alterations (CNAs) that we have characterized and termed the cyclin E CNA signature. Using a number of computational approaches, we show that this signature resembles one specific CNA pattern enriched in differentiated epithelial-like tumors of the breast and ovary. Analysis of the CNA profile of these clones provides a potential mechanism for cyclin E-mediated oncogenesis.","3553":null,"3554":"The buccal mucosa (BM) is a critical first line of defense in terrestrial animals. To gain further insights into the evolutionary origins and primordial roles of BM in teleosts here we show that rainbow trout, a teleost fish, contains a diffuse mucosal associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) within its buccal cavity. Upon parasite infection, a fish immunoglobulin specialized in mucosal immunity (sIgT) was induced to a high degree, and parasite-specific sIgT responses were mainly detected in the buccal mucus. Moreover, we show that the trout buccal microbiota is prevalently coated with sIgT. Overall our findings revealed that the MALT is present in the BM of a non-tetrapod species. As fish IgT and mucus-producing cells are evolutionarily unrelated to mammalian IgA and salivary glands, respectively, our findings indicate that mucosal immune responses in the BM of teleost fish and tetrapods evolved through a process of convergent evolution.","3555":null,"3556":"Combining catalysts with active colloidal matter could keep catalysts from aggregating, a major problem in chemical reactions. We report a kind of ensemble of bubble-cross-linked magnetic colloidal swarming nanomotors (B-MCS) with enhanced catalytic activity because of the local increase of the nanocatalyst concentration and three-dimensional (3D) fluid convection. Compared with the two-dimensional swarming collective without bubbles, the integral rotation was boosted because of the dynamic dewetting and increased slip length caused by the continuously ejected tiny bubbles. The bubbles cross-link the nanocatalysts and form stack along the vertical axis, generating the 3D network-like B-MCS ensemble with high dynamic stability and low drag resistance. The generated B-MCS ensemble exhibits controllable locomotion performance when applying a rotating magnetic field. Benefiting from locally increased catalyst concentration, good mobility, and 3D fluidic convection, the B-MCS ensemble offers a promising approach to heterogeneous catalysis.","3557":null,"3558":null,"3559":"The downriver migration process of young anadromous fish has a far-reaching impact on their survival rate and the efficacy of hatchery-reared fish release, but it is poorly understood. Moreover, the impact of dams on the fish remains unclear. The Chinese sturgeon is an anadromous and dam-affected fish in the Yangtze River. Here, we propose a novel theoretical framework to reveal the migration process of young Chinese sturgeon. We clarify the effects of active swimming of fish and water flow on the downriver migration and the parametric traits of the migrational stages. Then, we show that the young fish migrate downriver along the inshore waters in a gradually transforming manner from passive drift to active swimming. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of the Gezhouba Dam (GD) on the migration of the young fish, as well as demonstrate the life cycles of Chinese sturgeon in the Yangtze River pre- and post-GD.","3560":"The biaryl motif is a building block in many drugs, agrochemicals, and materials, and as such it is highly desirable as a synthesis target. The state-of-the-art process for biaryl synthesis from ubiquitous carboxylic acids is decarboxylative cross-coupling involving loss of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the scope of these methods is severely limited, mainly due to specific substitution required to promote decarboxylation. The present report implements a decarbonylative version with loss of carbon monoxide (CO) that enables to directly engage carboxylic acids in a Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling to produce biaryls as a general method with high cross-coupling selectivity using a well-defined Pd(0)\/(II) catalytic cycle. This protocol shows a remarkably broad scope (&gt;80 examples) and is performed in the absence of exogenous inorganic bases. In a broader context, the approach shows promise for routine applications in the synthesis of biaryls by carefully controlled decarbonylation of prevalent carboxylic acids.","3561":null,"3562":null,"3563":"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) infection causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and fatal neurological diseases, and there are no effective treatments. Host factors play key roles in establishing viral infection and determining the disease progression and outcome of antiviral therapies. In this study, we found that the expression of Pim1 was significantly upregulated in EV-A71 infection. Ectopic expression or silencing of Pim1 promoted or inhibited EV-A71 replication through two distinct mechanisms. Pim1 enhanced viral IRES activity by increasing viral 2A protease-mediated eIF4G cleavage and blocked AUF1, a suppressor of IRES, translocation from the nucleus to cytosol. More importantly, we discovered that Pim1 inhibitors (SGI-1776, AZD-1208, and CX-6258) reduced EV-A71 reproduction. Particularly, CX-6258 remarkably reduced EV-A71 reproduction more than 1,000 times, providing a potential therapeutic agent for EV-A71 treatment.","3564":null,"3565":"Most marine benthic invertebrates have a pelagic larval phase, after which they settle preferentially on or near conspecific adults, forming aggregations. Although settlement pheromones from conspecific adults have been implicated as critical drivers of aggregation for more than 30 years, surprisingly few have been unambiguously identified. Here we show that in the invasive dreissenid mussel Mytilopsis sallei (an ecological and economic pest), three common purines (adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine) released from adults in a synergistic and precise ratio (1:1.125:3.25) serve as an aggregation pheromone by inducing conspecific larval settlement and metamorphosis. Our results demonstrate that simple common metabolites can function as species-specific pheromones when present in precise combinations. This study provides important insights into our understanding of the ecology and communication processes of invasive organisms and indicates that the combination and ratio of purines might be critical for purine-based signaling systems that are fundamental and widespread in nature.","3566":null,"3567":"Graphdiyne (GDY) as an emerging 2D carbon-network nanomaterial possesses many fascinating properties that lead to numerous exciting applications, but the use of GDY and its derivatives in the antibacterial field has not yet been discovered. In this study, we first report on the use and evaluation of GDY and graphdiyne oxide (GDYO) as antibacterial agents and propose the antibacterial mechanisms of GDY-based nanomaterials. GDYO has been synthesized via the surface oxidation of GDY, and the antibacterial activity of GDYO has been compared with that of GDY through a series of antibacterial tests. Surprisingly, surface oxidation endowed inert GDY with superior antibacterial capability against two representative bacterial models: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial mechanism experiments disclose that the antibacterial function of GDYO is a result of reactive oxygen species-dependent oxidation stress when a dispersed GDYO suspension has a direct contact with bacteria especially under visible light irradiation.","3568":"A wave of technologies transformed sequencing over a decade ago into the high-throughput era, demanding research in new computational methods to analyze these data. The applications of these sequencing technologies have continuously expanded since then. The RECOMB Satellite Workshop on Massively Parallel Sequencing (RECOMB-Seq) meeting, established in 2011, brings together leading researchers in computational genomics and genomic biology to discuss emerging frontiers in algorithm development for massively parallel sequencing data. The ninth edition of this workshop was held in Washington, DC, in George Washington University on May 3 and 4, 2019. There was an exploration of several traditional topics in sequence analysis, including genome assembly, sequence alignment, and data compression, and development of methods for new sequencing technologies, including linked reads and single-molecule long-read sequencing. Here we revisit these topics and discuss the current status and perspectives of sequencing technologies and analyses.","3569":"The Growth Advantage in Stationary Phase (GASP) phenomenon, described in bacteria, reflects the genetic adaptation of bacteria to stress, including starvation, for a long time. Unlike in stationary phase where no cell division occurs, GASP harbors active cell division, concurrent with genetic adaptation. Here we show that GASP occurs also in eukaryotes. Two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc404 and Sc424) have been isolated from 2-year-old sealed bottles of beer. These strains presented advantage in survival and growth over the parent during stress. The differences between the strains are irreversible and therefore genetic in origin rather than epigenetic. Direct competition assays show that Sc404 and Sc424 outcompete the parent in direct competition. DNA sequencing shows changes of the genome: the TOR complexes are mutated, and DNA repair gene mutations confer a mutator phenotype. The differences between the strains are reflected in a difference in taste between beers brewed from them.","3570":null,"3571":null,"3572":null,"3573":"","3574":null,"3575":null,"3576":null,"3577":null,"3578":"RECK in neural precursor cells (NPCs) was previously found to support Notch-dependent neurogenesis in mice. On the other hand, recent studies implicate RECK in endothelial cells (ECs) in WNT7-triggered canonical WNT signaling essential for brain angiogenesis. Here we report that RECK in NPCs is also critical for brain angiogenesis. When Reck is inactivated in Foxg1-positive NPCs, mice die shortly after birth with hemorrhage in the forebrain, with angiogenic sprouts stalling at the periphery and forming abnormal aggregates reminiscent of those in EC-selective Reck knockout mice and Wnt7a\/b-deficient mice. The hemorrhage can be pharmacologically suppressed by lithium chloride. An effect of RECK in WNT7-producing cells to enhance canonical WNT-signaling in reporter cells is detectable in mixed culture but not with conditioned medium. Our findings suggest that NPC-expressed RECK has a non-cell-autonomous function to promote forebrain angiogenesis through contact-dependent enhancement of WNT signaling in ECs, implying possible involvement of RECK in neurovascular coupling.","3579":"Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are liquid-like subcellular compartments providing spatiotemporal control to biological processes. This study reveals that cellular stress leads to the incorporation of the adaptor protein SINTBAD (TBKBP1) into membraneless, cytosolic speckles. Determination of the interactome identified &gt;100 proteins forming constitutive and stress-inducible members of an MLO that we termed SINT-speckles. SINT-speckles partially colocalize with activated TBK1, and deletion of SINTBAD and the SINT-speckle component AZI2 leads to impaired TBK1 phosphorylation. Dynamic formation of SINT-speckles is positively controlled by the acetyltransferase KAT2A (GCN5) and antagonized by heat shock protein-mediated chaperone activity. SINT-speckle formation is also inhibited by the autophagy-initiating kinases ULK1\/2, and knockdown of these kinases prevented focal TBK1 phosphorylation in a pathway-specific manner. The phlebovirus-encoded non-structural protein S enhances ULK1-mediated TBK1 phosphorylation and shows a stress-induced translocation to SINT-speckles, raising the possibility that viruses can also target this signaling hub to manipulate host cell functions.","3580":"Every problem in computing can be cast as decision problems of whether strings are in a language or not. Computations and language recognition are carried out by three classes of automata, the most complex of which is the Turing machine. Living systems compute using biochemistry; in the artificial, computation today is mostly electronic. Thinking of chemical reactions as molecular recognition machines, and without using biochemistry, we realize one automaton in each class by means of one-pot, table top chemical reactors: from the simplest, Finite automata, to the most complex, Turing machines. Language acceptance\/rejection criteria by automata can be formulated using energy considerations. Our Turing machine uses the Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction and checks the same symbol in an Avogadro's number of processors. Our findings have implications for chemical and general computing, artificial intelligence, bioengineering, the study of the origin and presence of life on other planets, and for artificial biology.","3581":"The generation of humanized ectopic ossicles (hOss) in mice has been proposed as an advanced translational and fundamental model to study the human hematopoietic system. The approach relies on the presence of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) supporting the engraftment of transplanted human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the functional distribution of hMSCs within the humanized microenvironment remains to be investigated. Here, we combined genetic tools and quantitative confocal microscopy to engineer and subsequently analyze hMSCs' fate and distribution in hOss. Implanted hMSCs reconstituted a humanized environment including osteocytes, osteoblasts, adipocytes, and stromal cells associated with vessels. By imaging full hOss, we identified rare physical interactions between hMSCs and human CD45+\/CD34+\/CD90+ cells, supporting a functional contact-triggered regulatory role of hMSCs. Our study highlights the importance of compiling quantitative information from humanized organs, to decode the interactions between the hematopoietic and the stromal compartments.","3582":"Cas12a is an RNA-guided endonuclease, which displays great potentials and several advantages over the well-known Cas9 in genome editing and engineering. Here, we established a quantitative kinetic scheme to describe the conformational dynamics of Cas12a\/crRNA\/dsDNA ternary complexes. The highly dynamic nature of Cas12a complexes, including their reversible formation, disassembly, and transition between different conformational states, is likely to be one of the key aspects contributing to their high specificity. The non-target strand is cleaved when its cleavage sites are released from DNA duplex after DNase activation of Cas12a. Cleaved non-target strand stabilizes target strand pre-cleavage states to permit subsequent cleavage and to ensure two DNA strands cleaved in a well-defined order. The extent of complementarity between crRNA and DNA modulates the relative stabilities of target strand pre-cleavage states targeting different cleavage sites. Our discoveries provide insights to fully elucidate the working mechanisms of Cas12a and to optimize it for genome engineering.","3583":"High-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOCs) arise from exfoliation of transformed cells from the fallopian tube, indicating that survival in suspension, and potentially escape from anoikis, is required for dissemination. We report here the results of a multi-omic study to identify drivers of anoikis escape, including transcriptomic analysis, global non-targeted metabolomics, and a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) screen of HGSOC cells cultured in adherent and suspension settings. Our combined approach identified known pathways, including NOTCH signaling, as well as novel regulators of anoikis escape. Newly identified genes include effectors of fatty acid metabolism, ACADVL and ECHDC2, and an autophagy regulator, ULK1. Knockdown of these genes significantly inhibited suspension growth of HGSOC cells, and the metabolic profile confirmed the role of fatty acid metabolism in survival in suspension. Integration of our datasets identified an anoikis-escape gene signature that predicts overall survival in many carcinomas.","3584":null,"3585":"Efficient stem cell differentiation into pancreatic islet cells is of critical importance for the development of cell replacement therapies for diabetes. Here, we identify the expression pattern of connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction (GJ) channel protein, in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived definitive endoderm (DE) and primitive gut tube cells, representing early lineages for posterior foregut (PF), pancreatic progenitors (PP), pancreatic endocrine progenitors (PE), and islet cells. As the function of GJ channels is dependent on their gating status, we tested the impact of supplementing hESC-derived PP cell cultures with AAP10, a peptide that promotes Cx43 GJ channel opening. We found that this treatment promotes the expression of DE markers FoxA2 and Sox17, leads to a more efficient derivation of DE, and improves the yield of PF, PP, and PE cells. These results demonstrate a functional involvement of GJ channels in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into pancreatic cell lineages.","3586":"","3587":"Eukaryotic genomes encode several buffering mechanisms that robustly maintain invariant phenotypic outcome despite fluctuating environmental conditions. Here we show that the Drosophila gut-associated commensals, represented by a single facultative symbiont, Lactobacillus plantarum (LpWJL), constitutes a so far unexpected buffer that masks the contribution of the host's cryptic genetic variation (CGV) to developmental traits while the host is under nutritional stress. During chronic under-nutrition, LpWJL consistently reduces variation in different host phenotypic traits and ensures robust organ patterning during development; LpWJL also decreases genotype-dependent expression variation, particularly for development-associated genes. We further provide evidence that LpWJL buffers via reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling whose inhibition impairs microbiota-mediated phenotypic robustness. We thus identified a hitherto unappreciated contribution of the gut facultative symbionts to host fitness that, beyond supporting growth rates and maturation timing, confers developmental robustness and phenotypic homogeneity in times of nutritional stress.","3588":"In situ, direct 1H NMR chiral analysis by using chiral solvating agents is a convenient and efficient analytical technique. Here we developed a Ga-based chiral anionic metal complex for 1H NMR chiral analysis of alcohols. Utilizing the optimal pKa value, the Ga complex was able to differentiate 1H NMR signals of each (R)- and (S)-enantiomer of alcohols, measured at room temperature. This direct 1H NMR chiral analysis of alcohols was used to rapidly determine enantiomeric excess and conversion in a kinetic resolution and an asymmetric synthesis.","3589":"Inspired by astonishing collective motions and tactic behaviors in nature, here we show phototactic flocking of synthetic photochemical micromotors. When enriched with hydroxyl groups, TiO2 micromotors can spontaneously gather into flocks in aqueous media through electrolyte diffusiophoresis. Under light irradiation, due to the dominant nonelectrolyte diffusiophoretic interaction resulting from the overlap of asymmetric nonelectrolyte clouds around adjacent individuals, these flocks exhibit intriguing collective behaviors, such as dilatational negative phototaxis, high collective velocity, and adaptive group reconfiguration. Consequently, the micromotor flocks can migrate along pre-designed paths and actively bypass obstacles with reversible dilatation (expansion\/contraction) under pulsed light navigation. Furthermore, owing to the enhanced driving force and rapid dilatational area covering, they are able to execute cooperative tasks that single micromotors cannot achieve, such as cooperative large-cargo transport and collective microenvironment mapping. Our discovery would promote the creation of reconfigurable microrobots, active materials, and intelligent synthetic systems.","3590":null,"3591":null,"3592":null,"3593":"Recent studies have reported a strong interaction between spatial and temporal representation when visual experience is missing: blind people use temporal representation of events to represent spatial metrics. Given the superiority of audition on time perception, we hypothesized that when audition is not available complex temporal representations could be impaired, and spatial representation of events could be used to build temporal metrics. To test this hypothesis, deaf and hearing subjects were tested with a visual temporal task where conflicting and not conflicting spatiotemporal information was delivered. As predicted, we observed a strong deficit of deaf participants when only temporal cues were useful and space was uninformative with respect to time. However, the deficit disappeared when coherent spatiotemporal cues were presented and increased for conflicting spatiotemporal stimuli. These results highlight that spatial cues influence time estimations in deaf participants, suggesting that deaf individuals use spatial information to infer temporal environmental coordinates.","3594":"Plants respond actively to changes in their environment. Variations in nutrient availability elicit substantial transcriptional reprogramming, and we aimed to systematically describe these adjustments and identify the regulators responsible. Using gene coexpression analysis based on 13 different nutrient availability anomalies, we defined and analyzed nutrient stress response signatures. We identified known regulators and could predict functions in nutrient responses for transcriptional regulators previously associated with other processes, thus linking development and environmental interaction. Three of the identified transcriptional regulators, PIF4, HY5, and NF-Y, known from their role in light signaling, targeted a substantial part of the network and may participate in remodeling the global Arabidopsis transcriptome in response to variations of nutrient availability. We present gene coexpression and transcriptional regulation networks, which can be used as tools to further explore regulatory events and dependencies even by users with basic informatics skills.","3595":null,"3596":null,"3597":null,"3598":"There is high risk of fetal neurodevelopmental defects in pregestational diabetes mellitus (PGDM). However, the effective mechanism of hyperglycemia-induced neurodevelopmental negative effects, including neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, still remains obscure. Neuropoietic cytokines have been shown to play a vital part during nervous system development and in the coordination of neurons and gliocytes. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) dysfunction might be related to a reduction of self-protective response in brain malformation induced by hyperglycemia. We therefore evaluated the role of Nrf2 and neuropoietic cytokines in fetal neurodevelopmental defects induced by PGDM and determined the mechanisms involved. Our data reveal that PGDM dramatically impairs the developmental switch of neural stem cells from neurogenesis to gliogenesis, principally under the cooperative mediation of neuropoietic cytokine CNTF and Nrf2 antioxidative signaling. This indicates that CNTF and Nrf2 could be potentially used in the prevention or therapy of neurodevelopmental defects of PGDM offspring.","3599":"Neuroprotection is essential for the maintenance of normal physiological functions in the nervous system. This is especially true under stress conditions. Here, we demonstrate a novel protective function of PRL-1 against CO2 stimulation in Drosophila. In the absence of PRL-1, flies exhibit a permanent held-up wing phenotype upon CO2 exposure. Knockdown of the CO2 olfactory receptor, Gr21a, suppresses the phenotype. Our genetic data indicate that the wing phenotype is due to a neural dysfunction. PRL-1 physically interacts with Uex and controls Uex expression levels. Knockdown of Uex alone leads to a similar wing held-up phenotype to that of PRL-1 mutants. Uex acts downstream of PRL-1. Elevated Uex levels in PRL-1 mutants prevent the CO2-induced phenotype. PRL-1 and Uex are required for a wide range of neurons to maintain neuroprotective functions. Expression of human homologs of PRL-1 could rescue the phenotype in Drosophila, suggesting a similar function in humans.","3600":"Here, we show that the US Food and Drug Administration-approved oral drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) broadly amplifies the host innate immune response to viruses and inhibits Ebola virus (EBOV) replication. We find that NTZ enhances retinoic-acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I)-like-receptor, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein, interferon regulatory factor 3, and interferon activities and induces transcription of the antiviral phosphatase GADD34. NTZ significantly inhibits EBOV replication in human cells through its effects on RIG-I and protein kinase R (PKR), suggesting that it counteracts EBOV VP35 protein's ability to block RIG-I and PKR sensing of EBOV. NTZ also inhibits a second negative-strand RNA virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), through RIG-I and GADD34, but not PKR, consistent with VSV's distinct host innate immune evasion mechanisms. Thus, NTZ counteracts varied virus-specific immune evasion strategies by generally enhancing the RNA sensing and interferon axis that is triggered by foreign cytoplasmic RNA exposure, and holds promise as an oral therapy against EBOV.","3601":"Although in recent years there has been an increased awareness of the widespread nature of biofluorescence in the marine environment, the diversity of the molecules responsible for this luminescent phenotype has been mostly limited to green fluorescent proteins (GFPs), GFP-like proteins, and fluorescent fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs). In the present study, we describe a previously undescribed group of brominated tryptophan-kynurenine small molecule metabolites responsible for the green biofluorescence in two species of sharks and provide their structural, antimicrobial, and spectral characterization. Multi-scale fluorescence microscopy studies guided the discovery of metabolites that were differentially produced in fluorescent versus non-fluorescent skin, as well as the species-specific structural details of their unusual light-guiding denticles. Overall, this study provides the detailed description of a family of small molecules responsible for marine biofluorescence and opens new questions related to their roles in central nervous system signaling, resilience to microbial infections, and photoprotection.","3602":null,"3603":null,"3604":null,"3605":"","3606":"Even though the energy density of O3-type layer-structured metal oxide cathode can fully reach the requirement for large-scale energy storage systems, the cycling lifespan still cannot meet the demand for practical application once it is coupled with a non-sodium-metal anode in full-cell system. Transition metal dissolution into the electrolyte occurs along with continuous phase transformation and accelerates deterioration of the crystal structure, followed by migration and finally deposition on the anode to form a vicious circle. Surface engineering techniques are employed to modify the interface between active materials and the electrolyte by coating them with a thin layer of AlPO4 ion conductor. This stable thin layer can stabilize the surface crystal structure of the cathode material by avoiding element dissolution. Meanwhile, it can protect the anode from increased resistance by suppressing the dissolution-migration-deposition process. This technique is a promising method to improve the lifetime for the future commercialization.","3607":"Conversion of sunlight to chemical energy based on photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes has been considered as a promising strategy for solar energy harvesting. Here, we propose a novel platform that converts solar energy into sodium (Na) as a solid-state solar fuel via the PEC oxidation of natural seawater, for which a Na ion-selective ceramic membrane is employed together with photoelectrode (PE)-photovoltaic (PV) tandem cell. Using an elaborately modified bismuth vanadate-based PE in tandem with crystalline silicon PV, we demonstrate unassisted solar-to-Na conversion (equivalent to solar charge of seawater battery) with an unprecedentedly high efficiency of 8% (expected operating point under 1 sun) and measured operation efficiency of 5.7% (0.2 sun) and long-term stability, suggesting a new benchmark for low-cost, efficient, and scalable solid solar fuel production. The sodium turns easily into electricity on demand making the device a nature-friendly, monolithic solar rechargeable seawater battery.","3608":null,"3609":null,"3610":"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, also known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a complex cellular response to ER protein misfolding that involves transcriptional regulatory branches and a PERK-mediated translational regulatory branch. Here we revealed that amino acid biosynthesis regulation is coupled to protein synthesis demands during ER stress. Specifically, we demonstrated that the UPR leads to PERK-dependent induction in the biosynthesis of specific amino acids, and to upregulation of their corresponding tRNA synthetases. Furthermore, we found that sequences of UPR-upregulated proteins are significantly enriched with these UPR-induced amino acids. Interestingly, whereas the UPR leads to repression of ER target proteins, we showed that secreted proteins tended to escape this repression and were highly enriched for the UPR-induced amino acids. Our results unravel coordination between amino acid supply, namely, biosynthesis and tRNA loading, and demand from UPR-induced proteins under ER stress, thus revealing an additional regulatory layer of protein synthesis.","3611":null,"3612":"De novo genetic variants are an important source of causative variation in complex genetic disorders. Many methods for variant discovery rely on mapping reads to a reference genome, detecting numerous inherited variants irrelevant to the phenotype of interest. To distinguish between inherited and de novo variation, sequencing of families (parents and siblings) is commonly pursued. However, standard mapping-based approaches tend to have a high false-discovery rate for de novo variant prediction. Kevlar is a mapping-free method for de novo variant discovery, based on direct comparison of sequences between related individuals. Kevlar identifies high-abundance k-mers unique to the individual of interest. Reads containing these k-mers are partitioned into disjoint sets by shared k-mer content for variant calling, and preliminary variant predictions are sorted using a probabilistic score. We evaluated Kevlar on simulated and real datasets, demonstrating its ability to detect both de novo single-nucleotide variants and indels with high accuracy.","3613":"Polyubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) regulates the error-free template-switching mechanism for the bypass of DNA lesions during DNA replication. PCNA polyubiquitination is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity; however, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that tonicity-responsive enhancer-binding protein (TonEBP) regulates PCNA polyubiquitination in response to DNA damage. TonEBP was recruited to DNA damage sites with bulky adducts and sequentially recruited E3 ubiquitin ligase SHPRH, followed by deubiquitinase USP1, to DNA damage sites, in correlation with the dynamics of PCNA polyubiquitination. Similarly, TonEBP was found to be required for replication fork protection in response to DNA damage. The Rel-homology domain of TonEBP, which encircles DNA, was essential for the interaction with SHPRH and USP1, PCNA polyubiquitination, and cell survival after DNA damage. The present findings suggest that TonEBP is an upstream regulator of PCNA polyubiquitination and of the DNA damage bypass pathway.","3614":"Pig has been proved to be a valuable large animal model used for research on diabetic disease. However, their translational value is limited given their distinct anatomy and physiology. For the last 30 years, we have been developing a laboratory Asian miniature pig inbred line (Bama miniature pig [BM]) from the primitive Bama xiang pig via long-term selective inbreeding. Here, we assembled a BM reference genome at full chromosome-scale resolution with a total length of 2.49 Gb. Comparative and evolutionary genomic analyses identified numerous variations between the BM and commercial pig (Duroc), particularly those in the genetic loci associated with the features advantageous to diabetes studies. Resequencing analyses revealed many differentiated gene loci associated with inbreeding and other selective forces. These together with transcriptome analyses of diabetic pig models provide a comprehensive genetic basis for resistance to diabetogenic environment, especially related to energy metabolism.","3615":"","3616":"Different electrolytes applied in the aqueous electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) considerably influence the catalyst performance. Their concentration, species, buffer capacity, and pH value influence the local reaction conditions and impact the product distribution of the electrocatalyst. Relevant properties of prospective solvents include their basicity, CO2 solubility, conductivity, and toxicity, which affect the CO2RR and the applicability of the solvents. The complexity of an electrochemical system impedes the direct correlation between a single parameter and cell performance indicators such as the Faradaic efficiency; thus the effects of different electrolytes are often not fully comprehended. For an industrial application, a deeper understanding of the effects described in this review can help with the prediction of performance, as well as the development of scalable electrolyzers. In this review, the application of supporting electrolytes and different solvents in the CO2RR reported in the literature are summarized and discussed.","3617":null,"3618":null,"3619":"Conventional printing is worth revisiting because of its established procedures in meeting the surging demand of manufacturing printed electronics, 3D products, etc. However, one goal in penetrating printing into these is to control pattern transfer with no limitation of wettability. Here we introduce a miscible liquid-liquid transfer printing mechanism that can synchronize material preparation and material patterning with desirable properties including limitless selection of raw materials, corrosion resistance, no wetting constraint, and ability to prepare large-area defect-free materials for multi-function applications. Theoretical modeling and experiments demonstrate that donor liquid could be used to make patterns within the bulk of a receiver material, allowing the obtained intrinsically patterned functional materials to be resistant to harsh conditions. Different from current liquid printing technologies, this printing approach enables stable and defect-free material preparation and is expected to prove useful in flexible display, soft electronics, 4D printing, and beyond.","3620":"Fine-tuning of transcriptional responses can be critical for long-term outcomes in response to an environmental challenge. The circadian protein Nocturnin belongs to a family of proteins that include exonucleases, endonucleases, and phosphatases and is most closely related to the CCR4 family of deadenylases that regulate the cellular transcriptome via control of poly(A) tail length of RNA transcripts. In this study, we investigate the role of Nocturnin in regulating the transcriptional response and downstream metabolic adaptations during cold exposure in brown adipose tissue. We find that Nocturnin exhibits dual localization within the cytosol and mitochondria, and loss of Nocturnin causes changes in expression of networks of mRNAs involved in mitochondrial function. Furthermore, Nocturnin-\/- animals display significantly elevated levels of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, indicating that they have distinct metabolic adaptations during a prolonged cold exposure. We conclude that cold-induced stimulation of Nocturnin levels can regulate long-term metabolic adaptations to environmental challenges.","3621":null,"3622":"In all domains of life, mechanisms exist that protect cooperating groups from exploitation by cheaters. Recent observations with the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa have suggested a paradigmatic cheater control mechanism in which cooperator cells punish or \"police\" cheater cells by cyanide poisoning. These cheater cells are deficient in a pleiotropic quorum-sensing regulator that controls the production of cooperative secretions including cyanide, and presumably also cyanide resistance. In this study, we directly tested and refuted the cyanide policing model. Contrary to the hypothesis, cheater fitness was unaffected by the presence of cyanide. Cheater mutants grew equally well in co-cultures with either cyanide-proficient or cyanide-deficient cooperators, and they were as resistant to exogenous cyanide as wild-type cells. We show that these behaviors are the result of quorum-sensing-independent and cyanide-responsive resistance gene regulation. Our results highlight the role of genetic architecture in the evolution of cooperative behavior.","3623":"Trees are commonly regarded as distinct entities, but the roots of many species fuse to form natural root grafts allowing the exchange of water, carbon, mineral nutrients, and microorganisms between individuals. Exploiting the phenomenon of leafless (photosynthetically inactive) tree remnants being kept alive by conspecifics, we show tight physiological coupling of a living kauri (Agathis australis) stump to conspecific neighbors. The trunk remnant displayed greatly reduced, inverted daily sap flow patterns compared with intact kauri trees. Its stem water potential showed strong diel variation with minima during daytime and maxima at night, coinciding with peak and minimal sap flow rates in neighbors, respectively. Sudden atmospherically driven changes in water relations in adjacent kauri trees were very rapidly and inversely mirrored in the living stump's water status. Such intimate hydrological coupling suggests a \"communal physiology\" among (conspecific) trees with far-reaching implications for our understanding of forest functioning, particularly under water shortage.","3624":"Teleost fishes develop remarkable varieties of skin ornaments. The developmental basis of these structures is poorly understood. The order Tetraodontiformes includes diverse fishes such as the ocean sunfishes, triggerfishes, and pufferfishes, which exhibit a vast assortment of scale derivatives. Pufferfishes possess some of the most extreme scale derivatives, dermal spines, erected during their characteristic puffing behavior. We demonstrate that pufferfish scale-less spines develop through conserved gene interactions that underlie general vertebrate skin appendage formation, including feathers and hair. Spine development retains conservation of the EDA (ectodysplasin) signaling pathway, important for the development of diverse vertebrate skin appendages, including these modified scale-less spines of pufferfish. Further modification of genetic signaling from both CRISPR-Cas9 and small molecule inhibition leads to loss or reduction of spine coverage, providing a mechanism for skin appendage diversification observed throughout the pufferfishes. Pufferfish spines have evolved broad variations in body coverage, enabling adaptation to diverse ecological niches.","3625":null,"3626":"The amount of genetic variation discovered in human populations is growing rapidly leading to challenging computational tasks, such as variant calling. Standard methods for addressing this problem include read mapping, a computationally expensive procedure; thus, mapping-free tools have been proposed in recent years. These tools focus on isolated, biallelic SNPs, providing limited support for multi-allelic SNPs and short insertions and deletions of nucleotides (indels). Here we introduce MALVA, a mapping-free method to genotype an individual from a sample of reads. MALVA is the first mapping-free tool able to genotype multi-allelic SNPs and indels, even in high-density genomic regions, and to effectively handle a huge number of variants. MALVA requires one order of magnitude less time to genotype a donor than alignment-based pipelines, providing similar accuracy. Remarkably, on indels, MALVA provides even better results than the most widely adopted variant discovery tools.","3627":"Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes that have been infected with Plasmodium mount a more effective immune response to a subsequent infection. Priming is established when Plasmodium invasion of the mosquito midgut allows contact of the gut microbiota with epithelial cells. This event is followed by a systemic release of a hemocyte differentiation factor (HDF) consisting of Lipoxin A4 bound to Evokin, a lipocalin carrier, which increases the proportion of circulating hemocytes. We show that mosquito midgut cells produce and release prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which attracts hemocytes to the midgut surface and enhances their patrolling activity. Systemic injection of prostaglandins (PGs) recapitulates the priming response and enhances antiplasmodial immunity by triggering HDF production. Although insects lack cyclooxygenases, two heme peroxidases, HPX7 and HPX8, catalyze essential steps in PG biosynthesis in mosquitoes. Mosquito midgut PGE2 release attracts hemocytes and establishes a long-lasting enhanced systemic cellular immune response to Plasmodium infection.","3628":null,"3629":"Insulin-induced AKT activation is dependent on phosphoinositide 3-kinase and opposed by tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). Our previous study demonstrates that myosin 1b (MYO1B) mediates arginase-II-induced activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 that is regulated by AKT. However, the role of MYO1B in AKT activation is unknown. Here we show that silencing MYO1B in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) inhibits insulin-induced nuclear but not cytoplasmic AKT activation accompanied by elevated nuclear PTEN level. Co-immunoprecipitation, co-immunostaining, and proximity ligation assay show an interaction of MYO1B and PTEN resulting in reduced nuclear PTEN. Moreover, the elevated nuclear PTEN upon silencing MYO1B promotes apoptosis of MEFs and melanoma B16F10 cells. Taken together, we demonstrate that MYO1B, by interacting with PTEN, prevents nuclear localization of PTEN contributing to nuclear AKT activation and suppression of cell apoptosis. This may present a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment such as melanoma.","3630":null,"3631":"The construction of synthetic two-dimensional (2D) materials designates a pathway to the versatile chemical functionality by spatial control. However, current 2D materials with intelligence of stimuli-responsibility and adaptiveness have been unfledged. The approach reported here uses a supramolecular strategy to achieve the dynamic non-covalent self-assembly of a rationally designed small molecule monomer, producing large-area, ultra-thin, porous 2D supramolecular assemblies, which are solution-processable in aqueous solution. Importantly, the 2D supramolecular assemblies exhibit distinct adaptive capability to automatically regulate their network density and pore diameters in response to environmental temperature change, which could be developed into an \"on-demand\" filtration application for nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the 2D supramolecular assemblies can also perform reversible degradation\/reformation by photo-irradiation. Our results not only show the simplicity, reliability, and effectiveness of supramolecular strategies in the construction of 2D materials with practical sizes, but also push the dynamic alterability and adaptation features from supramolecular assemblies toward 2D materials.","3632":"The development of C1 synthons to afford the products that add one extra carbon has become an important research theme in the past decade, and significant progress has been achieved with CO2, CO, HCOOH, and others as C1 units. Despite the great advance, the search for new C1 synthons that display unique reactivity, complement to the current C1 sources, and add more value to C1 chemistry is still desirable. Herein, we report a quadruple cleavage of chlorodifluoromethane to yield a C1 source, which was successfully employed in the construction of various N-containing compounds especially with pharmaceutical molecules under mild conditions. This strategy provides a useful method for late-stage modification of pharmaceutical compounds. Four bonds in ClCF2H were orderly cleaved under basic conditions in the absence of transition metals. Preliminary mechanistic studies revealed that (E)-N-phenylformimidoyl fluoride intermediate is involved in this process by in situ1H NMR studies and control experiments.","3633":"Proliferative and invasive breast tumors evolve heterogeneously in individual patients, posing significant challenges in identifying new druggable targets for precision, effective therapy. Here we present a functional multi-omics method, interaction-Correlated Multi-omic Aberration Patterning (iC-MAP), which dissects intra-tumor heterogeneity and identifies in situ the oncogenic consequences of multi-omics aberrations that drive proliferative and invasive tumors. First, we perform chromatin activity-based chemoproteomics (ChaC) experiments on breast cancer (BC) patient tissues to identify genetic\/transcriptomic alterations that manifest as oncogenically active proteins. ChaC employs a biotinylated small molecule probe that specifically binds to the oncogenically active histone methyltransferase G9a, enabling sorting\/enrichment of a G9a-interacting protein complex that represents the predominant BC subtype in a tissue. Second, using patient transcriptomic\/genomic data, we retrospectively identified some G9a interactor-encoding genes that showed individualized iC-MAP. Our iC-MAP findings represent both new diagnostic\/prognostic markers to identify patient subsets with incurable metastatic disease and targets to create individualized therapeutic strategies.","3634":null,"3635":"Skeletal muscle repair and regeneration after injury requires coordinated interactions between the innate immune system and the injured muscle. Myeloid cells predominate in these interactions. This study examined the role of KLF2, a zinc-finger transcription factor that regulates immune cell activation, in specifying myeloid cell functions during muscle regeneration. Loss of KLF2 in myeloid lineage cells (myeKlf2-\/- mice) dramatically enhanced the initial inflammatory response to acute muscle injury (cardiotoxin). Injured muscles showed dramatically elevated expression of inflammatory mediators and greater numbers of infiltrating, pro-inflammatory monocytes that matured earlier into activated macrophages. Notably, the inflammatory phase resolved earlier and regeneration progressed to myogenesis, marked by elevated expression of factors that promote the formation of new fibers from satellite cells. Regeneration was completed earlier, with phenotypically normal adult fibers integrated into the muscle syncytium. These findings identify myeloid KLF2 as a key regulator of myeloid cell functions in adult skeletal muscle regeneration.","3636":"Dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) deficiency causes infantile Parkinson disease, for which there is no effective therapy. We have explored the effects of genetically deleting SLC6A3 in zebrafish. Unlike the wild-type, slc6a3-\/- fish hover near the tank bottom, with a repetitive digging-like behavior. slc6a3-\/- fish manifest pruning and cellular loss of particular tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive neurons in the midbrain. Clozapine, an effective therapeutic for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, rescues the abnormal behavior of slc6a3-\/- fish. Clozapine also reverses the abnormalities in the A8 region of the mutant midbrain. By RNA sequencing analysis, clozapine increases the expression of erythropoietin pathway genes. Transgenic over-expression of erythropoietin in neurons of slc6a3-\/- fish partially rescues the mutant behavior, suggesting a potential mechanistic basis for clozapine's efficacy.","3637":null,"3638":null,"3639":"In the heart, primary microRNA-208b (pri-miR-208b) and Myheart (Mhrt) are long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) encoded by the cardiac myosin heavy chain genes. Although preclinical studies have shown that lncRNAs regulate gene expression and are protective for pathological hypertrophy, the mechanism underlying sex-based differences remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined DNA- and RNA-methylation-dependent regulation of pri-miR-208b and Mhrt. Expression of pri-miR-208b is elevated in the left ventricle of the female heart. Despite indistinguishable DNA methylation between sexes, the interaction of MeCP2 on chromatin is subject to RNase digestion, highlighting that affinity of the methyl-CG reader is broader than previously thought. A specialized procedure to isolate RNA from soluble cardiac chromatin emphasizes sex-based affinity of an MeCP2 co-repressor complex with Rest and Hdac2. Sex-specific Mhrt methylation chromatinizes MeCP2 at the pri-miR-208b promoter and extends the functional relevance of default transcriptional suppression in the heart.","3640":"Bacteria use flagella, the protein nanofibers on their surface, as a molecular machine to swim. Flagella are polymerized from monomers, flagellins, which can display a peptide by genetic means. However, flagella as genetically modifiable nanofibers have not been used in building bone extracellular matrix-like structures for inducing stem cell differentiation in non-osteogenic medium. Here we discovered that interactions between Ca2+ ions and flagella (displaying a collagen-like peptide (GPP)8 on every flagellin) resulted in ordered bundle-like structures, which were further mineralized with hydroxyapatite to form ordered fibrous matrix. The resultant matrix significantly induced the osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, much more efficiently than wild-type flagella and type I collagen. This work shows that flagella can be used as protein building blocks in generating biomimetic materials.","3641":"Enhancing electrochemiluminescence (ECL) with plasmonic materials is promising but still a long-standing barrier to improve its sensitivity for ultrasensitive bioassays, due to the lack of comprehensive understanding and effective strategies to fully utilize plasmonic effects for ECL enhancement. Herein, by insulating gold nanoparticles with silica shells (Au@SiO2 NPs), and finely tuning their core\/shell sizes and controlling interparticle spacing via assembling them into a dense nanomembrane, we develop a novel 2D metasurface. Due to well-controlled high density \"hot spots\" and 2D ordered arrangement of the unit NPs in the nanomembrane, the metasurfaced ECL electrode shows over 1,000-fold plasmonic ECL enhancement for the classical Ru(bpy)32+-tripropylamine system, which is two orders of magnitude higher than ever reported (&lt;30-fold). Such fabricated ECL biosensor demonstrates superior detection performance for prostate-specific antigen with a detection limit of 3 fg mL-1. Our results provide understanding of plasmonic effects for ECL enhancement and will benefit for biosensor construction for ultrasensitive bioassays.","3642":null,"3643":null,"3644":null,"3645":"","3646":null,"3647":"Ammonia is one of the most important bulk chemicals in modern society.

The development of \"sustainable\" nitrogen fixation process represents a grand aspirational chemical pursuit concerning our future human well-being. Herein, we report an ultra-stable nitride-based photosensitizing semiconductor that enables efficient, sustainable, and mild photochemical nitrogen fixation. The catalyst exhibits strong chemisorption of nitrogen and enables immediate electron donation from its surface vacancy to nitrogen. In addition, it was also demonstrated that the nitride-based semiconductor possesses the potential to minimize electron-hole recombination.","3648":"MTOR associated protein, eak-7 homolog (mEAK-7), activates mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in human cells through an alternative mTOR complex to regulate S6K2 and 4E-BP1. However, the role of mEAK-7 in human cancer has not yet been identified. We demonstrate that mEAK-7 and mTOR signaling are strongly elevated in tumor and metastatic lymph nodes of patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma compared with those of patients with normal lung or lymph tissue. Cancer stem cells, CD44+\/CD90+ cells, yield elevated mEAK-7 and activated mTOR signaling. mEAK-7 is required for clonogenic potential and spheroid formation. mEAK-7 associates with DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit isoform 1 (DNA-PKcs), and this interaction is increased in response to X-ray irradiation to regulate S6K2 signaling. DNA-PKcs pharmacologic inhibition or genetic knockout reduced S6K2, mEAK-7, and mTOR binding with DNA-PKcs, resulting in loss of S6K2 activity and mTOR signaling. Therefore, mEAK-7 forms an alternative mTOR complex with DNA-PKcs to regulate S6K2 in human cancer cells.","3649":null,"3650":null,"3651":"Both caloric restriction (CR) and mitochondrial proteostasis are linked to longevity, but how CR maintains mitochondrial proteostasis in mammals remains elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are well known for gene silencing in cytoplasm and have recently been identified in mitochondria, but knowledge regarding their influence on mitochondrial function is limited. Here, we report that CR increases miRNAs, which are required for the CR-induced activation of mitochondrial translation, in mouse liver. The ablation of miR-122, the most abundant miRNA induced by CR, or the retardation of miRNA biogenesis via Drosha knockdown significantly reduces the CR-induced activation of mitochondrial translation. Importantly, CR-induced miRNAs cause the overproduction of mtDNA-encoded proteins, which induces the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), and consequently improves mitochondrial proteostasis and function. These findings establish a physiological role of miRNA-enhanced mitochondrial function during CR and reveal miRNAs as critical mediators of CR in inducing UPRmt to improve mitochondrial proteostasis.","3652":"The majority of land plants have two suberized root barriers: the endodermis and the hypodermis (exodermis). Both barriers bear non-suberized passage cells that are thought to regulate water and nutrient exchange between the root and the soil. We learned a lot about endodermal passage cells, whereas our knowledge on hypodermal passage cells (HPCs) is still very scarce. Here we report on factors regulating the HPC number in Petunia roots. Strigolactones exhibit a positive effect, whereas supply of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and auxin result in a strong reduction of the HPC number. Unexpectedly the strigolactone signaling mutant d14\/dad2 showed significantly higher HPC numbers than the wild-type. In contrast, its mutant counterpart max2 of the heterodimeric receptor DAD2\/MAX2 displayed a significant decrease in HPC number. A mutation in the Petunia karrikin sensor KAI2 exhibits drastically decreased HPC amounts, supporting the hypothesis that the dimeric KAI2\/MAX2 receptor is central in determining the HPC number.","3653":null,"3654":null,"3655":null,"3656":"Linked-read sequencing enables greatly improves haplotype assembly over standard paired-end analysis. The detection of mosaic single-nucleotide variants benefits from haplotype assembly when the model is informed by the mapping between constituent reads and linked reads. Samovar evaluates haplotype-discordant reads identified through linked-read sequencing, thus enabling phasing and mosaic variant detection across the entire genome. Samovar trains a random forest model to score candidate sites using a dataset that considers read quality, phasing, and linked-read characteristics. Samovar calls mosaic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) within a single sample with accuracy comparable with what previously required trios or matched tumor\/normal pairs and outperforms single-sample mosaic variant callers at minor allele frequency 5%-50% with at least 30X coverage. Samovar finds somatic variants in both tumor and normal whole-genome sequencing from 13 pediatric cancer cases that can be corroborated with high recall with whole exome sequencing.

However, despite great efforts to optimize photocatalyst activity, the formation rate has been largely limited by the deficient accessibility of the photocatalysts to sufficient O2 in water. Here we boost the reaction by reporting an air-liquid-solid triphase photocatalytic system for efficient H2O2 generation. The triphase system allows reactant O2 to reach the reaction interface directly from the ambient atmosphere, greatly increasing the interface O2 concentration, which in turn simultaneously enhanced the kinetics of formation constant and suppressed the unwanted electron-hole recombination and the kinetics of H2O2 decomposition reaction. Compared with a conventional liquid-solid diphase reaction system, the triphase system enables an increase in H2O2 formation by a factor of 44. The triphase system is generally applicable to fundamentally understand and maximize the kinetics of semiconductor-based photocatalytic oxygen reduction for H2O2 generation.","3660":"Ankyrin-repeat domains (ARDs) are conserved in large numbers of proteins. ARDs are composed of various numbers of ankyrin repeats (ANKs). ARDs often adopt curved structures reminiscent of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain, which is the dimeric scaffold for membrane tubulation. BAR domains sometimes have amphipathic helices for membrane tubulation and vesiculation. However, it is unclear whether ARD-containing proteins exhibit similar membrane deformation properties. We found that the ARD of ANK and KH domain-containing protein 1 (ANKHD1) dimerize and deform membranes into tubules and vesicles. Among 25 ANKs of ANKHD1, the first 15 ANKs can form a dimer and the latter 10 ANKs enable membrane tubulation and vesiculation through an adjacent amphipathic helix and a predicted curved structure with a positively charged surface, analogous to BAR domains. Knockdown and localization of ANKHD1 suggested its involvement in the negative regulation of early endosome enlargement owing to its membrane vesiculation.","3661":"In developing tissues, sheets of cells become planar polarized, enabling coordination of cell behaviors. It has been suggested that \"signaling\" of polarity information between cells may occur either bidirectionally or monodirectionally between the molecules Frizzled (Fz) and Van Gogh (Vang). Using computational modeling we find that both bidirectional and monodirectional signaling models reproduce known non-autonomous phenotypes derived from patches of mutant tissue of key molecules but predict different phenotypes from double mutant tissue, which have previously given conflicting experimental results. Furthermore, we re-examine experimental phenotypes in the Drosophila wing, concluding that signaling is most likely bidirectional. Our modeling suggests that bidirectional signaling can be mediated either indirectly via bidirectional feedbacks between asymmetric intercellular protein complexes or directly via different affinities for protein binding in intercellular complexes, suggesting future avenues for investigation. Our findings offer insight into mechanisms of juxtacrine cell signaling and how tissue-scale properties emerge from individual cell behaviors.","3662":null,"3663":null,"3664":"Haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene is causally linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in human genetic studies.

Moreover, the expression of Sgk2 (serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 2), a member of the Sgk family, which plays a key role in regulating the membrane trafficking of glutamate receptors, was diminished by Shank3 deficiency and rescued by Gq DREADD activation of PFC. Blocking Sgk function in Shank3-deficient mice prevented Gq DREADD from rescuing social and synaptic deficits, whereas blocking Sgk function in wild-type mice led to the attenuation of PFC glutamatergic signaling and the induction of autism-like social deficits. These results have provided a potential circuit intervention and molecular target for autism treatment.","3665":"Clearance of synaptic vesicle proteins from active zones may be rate limiting for sustained neurotransmission. Issues of clearance are critical at ribbon synapses, which continually release neurotransmitters for prolonged periods of time. We used synaptophysin-pHluorin (SypHy) to visualize protein clearance from active zones in retinal bipolar cell ribbon synapses. Depolarizing voltage steps gave rise to small step-like changes in fluorescence likely indicating release of single SypHy molecules from fused synaptic vesicles near active zones. Temporal and spatial fluorescence profiles of individual responses were highly variable, but ensemble averages were well fit by clearance via free diffusion using Monte Carlo simulations. The rate of fluorescence decay of ensemble averages varied with the time and location of the fusion event, with clearance being most rapid at the onset of a stimulus when release rate is the highest.","3666":"One-dimensional perovskites are an interesting material for energy and optoelectronic applications. However, exploring the full wealth of architectures these materials could allow, through multi-element doping of A-sites and B-sites, is still a challenge. Here, we report a high-yield synthetic strategy for 1D perovskites via a two-step method based on a multi-element topochemical-molten salt method. Typically, a high yield of 1D multicomponent perovskite niobates (Li0.06Na0.47K0.47)(Nb0.94Sb0.06)O3 (LNKNS2) is rapidly achieved from as-synthesized 1D K2(Nb0.94Sb0.06)8O21 with multi-element B-sites. In this process, 1D K2(Nb0.94Sb0.06)8O21 has been first achieved, and the proportion of the ions in A-sites is affected by the radius and molar ratio of ions. The z axis direction of K2(Nb0.94Sb0.06)8O21 rod is transformed into the x axis direction of LNKNS2 rod. Furthermore, the output voltage of the 1D niobates-based flexible piezoelectric device (FPD) was nearly 600% compared with that of the isotropic niobates-based FPD. This work also allows convenient fabrication of other 1D multicomponent perovskites.","3667":"Chiral homoallylic amines not only are found in pharmaceutically relevant compounds but also serve as versatile building blocks for chemical synthesis. However, catalytic allylation of ketimines with allylboronates, an attractive approach to synthesize chiral homoallylic amine scaffolds remain scarce. Herein, we develop a highly enantioselective allylation of isatin-derived ketimines with boron allylation reagents catalyzed by a Bi(OAc)3-chiral phosphoric acid catalyst system. The reactions are remarkably efficient and mild, most of which were completed in less than an hour at room temperature with only 1\/2 mol% (Bi(OAc)3\/CPA) catalyst loading. A wide range of chiral 3-allyl 3-aminooxindoles were obtained in excellent yields and enantioselectivities. The synthetic utility was demonstrated by efficient formal synthesis of (+)-AG-041R and (-)-psychotriasine. Preliminary mechanism was studied by control experiments and theoretical calculations.","3668":"Bacterial blight caused by the infection of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is a devastating disease that severely challenges the yield of rice. Here, we report the identification of a \"SAPK10-WRKY72-AOS1\" module, through which Xoo infection stimulates the suppression of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis to cause Xoo susceptibility. WRKY72 directly binds to the W-box in the promoter of JA biosynthesis gene AOS1 and represses its transcription by inducing DNA hypermethylation on the target site, which finally led to lower endogenous JA level and higher Xoo susceptibility. Abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible SnRK2-type kinase SAPK10 phosphorylates WRKY72 at Thr 129. The SAPK10-mediated phosphorylation impairs the DNA-binding ability of WRKY72 and releases its suppression on AOS1 and JA biosynthesis. Our work highlights a module of how pathogen stimuli lead to plant susceptibility, as well as a potential pathway for ABA-JA interplay with post-translational modification and epigenetic regulation mechanism involved.","3669":"One of the earliest and most significant events in embryonic development is zygotic genome activation (ZGA). In several species, bulk transcription begins at the midblastula transition (MBT) when, after a certain number of cleavages, the embryo attains a particular nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N\/C) ratio, maternal repressors become sufficiently diluted, and the cell cycle slows down. Here we resolve the frog ZGA in time and space by profiling RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) engagement and its transcriptional readout. We detect a gradual increase in both the quantity and the length of RNAPII elongation before the MBT, revealing that &gt;1,000 zygotic genes disregard the N\/C timer for their activation and that the sizes of newly transcribed genes are not necessarily constrained by cell cycle duration. We also find that Wnt, Nodal, and BMP signaling together generate most of the spatiotemporal dynamics of regional ZGA, directing the formation of orthogonal body axes and proportionate germ layers.","3670":"Although mitochondria are known to be involved in host defense against viral infection, the physiological role of mitophagy, a crucial mechanism for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, in antiviral immunity remains poorly defined. Here, we show that Parkin, a central player in mitophagy, has a vital function in regulating host antiviral responses. Parkin-knockout mice exhibit improved viral clearance and survival after viral infection. However, Parkin deficiency does not affect antiviral signaling and interferon production. Instead, Parkin deficiency augments innate antiviral inflammation by enhancing mitochondrial ROS (mtROS)-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and promoting viral clearance. Loss of NLRP3 can reverse the enhanced antiviral responses in Parkin knockout mice. Furthermore, we find that Parkin expression is downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients infected with virus. Collectively, our results suggest that Parkin plays an important role in antiviral immunity by controlling mtROS-NLRP3 axis-mediated inflammation. These findings provide physiological insight of the importance of mitophagy in regulating host antiviral response.","3671":"Melanoma frequently harbors oncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene, which drives melanoma growth. Therefore, BRAF kinase inhibitors (BRAFi) are developed and approved for treating BRAF-mutant melanoma. However, the efficacy of BRAFi is limited due to acquired resistance, and in over 40% of melanoma, the causes of BRAFi resistance remain unknown. Here, using a human phospho-receptor tyrosine kinase array we identified Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) as a driver of acquired BRAFi resistance in melanoma. We found that ALK ligand FAM150A was necessary for ALK activation and ALK via the PI3K\/AKT pathway was sufficient to confer resistance to BRAFi. ALK inhibitor (ALKi) ceritinib inhibited BRAFi-resistant melanoma in cell culture and mice. Residual BRAFi and ALKi dual resistant melanoma cells from ceritinib-treated mice were sensitive to a broad-spectrum anti-apoptotic protein inhibitor, AT101. Collectively, our results provide a framework for treating BRAF-mutant melanoma that sequentially uses different targeted therapies based on post-treatment tumor evolution.","3672":"Rodents in the wild are under nearly constant threat of aerial predation and thus have evolved adaptive innate defensive behaviors, such as freezing or fleeing, in response to a perceived looming threat. Here we employed an ethologically relevant paradigm to study innate fear of aerial predators in male and female rats during a goal-oriented task. Rats foraging for food in a large arena encountered either a 2D or 3D looming stimulus, to which they instinctively fled back to a safe nest. When facing a direct aerial threat, female rats exhibited a greater fear response than males and this divergence maintained when exposed to the environment on subsequent days with no predator interaction, suggesting stronger contextual fear in female rats. These results may have relevance toward exploring neurobiological mechanisms associated with higher diagnosis rates of fear and anxiety-related disorders in women as compared with men.","3673":"An efficient electron transport layer (ETL) between the perovskite absorber and the cathode plays a crucial role in obtaining high-performance planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we incorporate 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) in the commonly used tin oxide (SnO2) ETL, and it successfully improves the power conversation efficiency (PCE) and suppresses the hysteresis of the PSCs: the PCE is increased from 19.17% to 20.92%, and the hysteresis is largely reduced to be almost negligible. The origin of the enhancement is due to the improved electron mobility and optimized work function of the ETL, together with the reduced traps in the perovskite film. In addition, O2 plasma is employed to treat the surface of the TFE-incorporated SnO2 film, and the PCE is further increased to 21.68%. The concept here of incorporating organic small molecules in the ETL provides a strategy for enhancing the performance of the planar PSCs.","3674":null,"3675":null,"3676":"Easily processed, well-defined, and hierarchical uniform artificial architectures with intrinsic strong crystalline emission properties are necessary for a range of light-emitting optoelectronic devices. Herein, we designed and prepared ordered supramolecular spherulites, comprising planar conformational molecules as primary structures and multiple hydrogen bonds as physical cross-links. Compared with serious aggregation-induced fluorescence quenching (up to 70%), these highly ordered architectures exhibited unique and robust crystalline emission with a high PLQY of 55%, which was much higher than those of other terfluorenes. The primary reasons for the high PLQY are the uniform exciton energetic landscape created in the planar conformation and the highly ordered molecular packing in spherulite. Meanwhile, minimal residual defect (green-band) emissions are effectively suppressed in our oriented crystalline framework, whereas the strong and stable blue light radiations are promoted. These findings may confirm that supramolecular ordered artificial architectures may offer higher control and tunability for optoelectronic applications.","3677":null,"3678":"Quality control of offspring is important for the survival of cells. However, the mechanisms by which quality of offspring cells may be checked while running genetic programs of cellular differentiation remain unclear. Here we investigated quality control during sporulating in Bacillus subtilis by combining single-cell time-lapse microscopy, molecular biology, and mathematical modeling. Our results revealed that the quality control via premature germination is coupled with the electrical polarization of outer membranes of developing forespores. The forespores that accumulate fewer cations on their surface are more likely to be aborted. This charge accumulation enables the projection of multi-dimensional information about the external environment and morphological development of the forespore into one-dimensional information of cation accumulation. We thus present a paradigm of cellular regulation by bacterial electrical signaling. Moreover, based on the insight we gain, we propose an electrophysiology-based approach of reducing the yield and quality of Bacillus endospores.","3679":null,"3680":"Store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channels mediate a variety of cellular signaling functions. The CRAC channel pore-forming protein, Orai1, is a hexamer arranged with 3-fold symmetry. Despite its importance in moving Ca2+ ions into cells, a detailed mechanistic understanding of Orai1 activation is lacking. Herein, a working model is proposed for the putative open state of Orai from Drosophila melanogaster (dOrai), which involves a \"twist-to-open\" gating mechanism. The proposed model is supported by energetic, structural, and experimental evidence. Fluorescent imaging demonstrates that each subunit on the intracellular side of the pore is inherently strongly cross-linked, which is important for coupling to STIM1, the pore activator, and graded activation of the Orai1 channel. The proposed model thus paves the way for understanding key aspects of calcium signaling at a molecular level.","3681":null,"3682":null,"3683":null,"3684":null,"3685":null,"3686":null,"3687":null,"3688":"Can social gaze behavior reveal the leader during real-world group interactions? To answer this question, we developed a novel tripartite approach combining (1) computer vision methods for remote gaze estimation, (2) a detailed taxonomy to encode the implicit semantics of multi-party gaze features, and (3) machine learning methods to establish dependencies between leadership and visual behaviors. We found that social gaze behavior distinctively identified group leaders. Crucially, the relationship between leadership and gaze behavior generalized across democratic and autocratic leadership styles under conditions of low and high time-pressure, suggesting that gaze can serve as a general marker of leadership. These findings provide the first direct evidence that group visual patterns can reveal leadership across different social behaviors and validate a new promising method for monitoring natural group interactions.","3689":"Exosomes can serve as delivery vehicles for advanced therapeutics. The components necessary and sufficient to support exosomal delivery have not been established. Here we connect biochemical composition and activity of exosomes to optimize exosome-mediated delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). This information is used to create effective artificial exosomes. We show that serum-deprived mesenchymal stem cells produce exosomes up to 22-fold more effective at delivering siRNAs to neurons than exosomes derived from control cells. Proteinase treatment of exosomes stops siRNA transfer, indicating that surface proteins on exosomes are involved in trafficking. Proteomic and lipidomic analyses show that exosomes derived in serum-deprived conditions are enriched in six protein pathways and one lipid class, dilysocardiolipin. Inspired by these findings, we engineer an \"artificial exosome,\" in which the incorporation of one lipid (dilysocardiolipin) and three proteins (Rab7, Desmoplakin, and AHSG) into conventional neutral liposomes produces vesicles that mimic cargo delivering activity of natural exosomes.","3690":"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an essential system that isolates the central nervous system from the internal environment. Increasing evidence has begun to reveal the molecules that are required for BBB integrity. However, how these components are regulated remains unclear. Here we report that a matrix metalloproteinase, Mmp2, is essential for the establishment of the BBB in Drosophila. In the absence of mmp2, the BBB becomes leaky, which allows the tracer to penetrate the brain. Moreover, the expression pattern of a junctional component, Neuroglian, is altered. We also find that the regulation of the amounts of particular extracellular matrix components is critical for BBB establishment. Furthermore, the process of mesenchymal-epithelial transition of BBB-forming cells is perturbed in the absence of Mmp2. These data indicate that the presence of Mmp(s), which is typically considered to be a risk factor for BBB degradation, is essential for BBB integrity in Drosophila.","3691":null,"3692":null,"3693":"E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3s) play a critical role in molecular and cellular mechanisms. However, a large number of E3-substrate interactions (ESIs) remain unrevealed. Here, we integrated the increasing omics data with biological knowledge to characterize and identify ESIs. Multidimensional features were computed to obtain the association patterns of ESIs, and an ensemble prediction model was constructed to identify ESIs. Comparison with non-ESI cases revealed the specific association patterns of ESIs, which provided meaningful insights into ESI interpretation. Reliability of the prediction model was confirmed from various perspectives. Notably, our evaluations on leucine-rich repeat family of F box (FBXL) family were consistent with a proteomic study, and several substrates for SKP2 and an orphan E3 FBXL6 were experimentally verified. Moreover, a cancer hallmark ESI landscape was studied. Taken together, our study catches a glimpse at the omics-driven ESI association patterns and provides a valuable resource (http:\/\/www.esinet.dicp.ac.cn\/home.php) to assist ubiquitination research.","3694":null,"3695":null,"3696":null,"3697":null,"3698":null,"3699":"Changes in dengue virus (DENV) genome affect viral fitness both clinically and epidemiologically. Even in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), mutations could affect subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) production and its affinity for host proteins, which are necessary for successful viral replication. Indeed, we recently showed that mutations in DENV2 3' UTR of epidemic strains increased sfRNA ability to bind host proteins and reduce interferon expression. However, whether 3' UTR differences shape the overall DENV evolution remains incompletely understood. Herein, we combined RNA phylogeny with phylogenetics to gain insights on sfRNA evolution. We found that sfRNA structures are under purifying selection and highly conserved despite sequence divergence. Only the second flaviviral nuclease-resistant RNA (fNR2) structure of DENV2 sfRNA has undergone strong positive selection. Epidemiological reports suggest that substitutions in fNR2 may drive DENV2 epidemiological fitness, possibly through sfRNA-protein interactions. Collectively, our findings indicate that 3' UTRs are important determinants of DENV fitness in human-mosquito cycles.","3700":"Growth hormone (GH) binds to its receptor (growth hormone receptor [GHR]) to exert its pleiotropic effects on growth and metabolism. Disrupted GH\/GHR actions not only fail growth but also are involved in many metabolic disorders, as shown in murine models with global or tissue-specific Ghr deficiency and clinical observations. Here we constructed an adipose-specific Ghr knockout mouse model Ad-GHRKO and studied the metabolic adaptability of the mice when stressed by high-fat diet (HFD) or cold. We found that disruption of adipose Ghr accelerated dietary obesity but protected the liver from ectopic adiposity through free fatty acid trapping. The heat-producing brown adipose tissue burning and white adipose tissue browning induced by cold were slowed in the absence of adipose Ghr but were recovered after prolonged cold acclimation. We conclude that at the expense of excessive subcutaneous fat accumulation and lower emergent cold tolerance, down-tuning adipose GHR signaling emulates a healthy obesity situation which has metabolic advantages against HFD.","3701":null,"3702":"The structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1\/XPF plays an important role in nucleotide excision repair and interstrand cross-link repair. In this study, we identified new functions of ERCC1\/XPF in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We found that the conserved function of ERCC1\/XPF to remove non-homologous sequences at DSBs is a rate-limiting step for homologous recombination in mammalian cells, and more importantly, we uncovered an indispensable role of ERCC1\/XPF in repair of DSBs containing DNA secondary structures, including the structure-prone AT-rich DNA sequences derived from common fragile sites and G-quadruplexes (G4s). We also demonstrated a synthetic lethal interaction of XPF with DNA translocase FANCM that is involved in removing DNA secondary structures. Furthermore, inactivation of XPF sensitizes FANCM-deficient cells to G4-interacting compounds. These results suggest an important function of ERCC1\/XPF in protecting DNA secondary structures and provide a rationale for targeted treatment of FANCM-deficient tumors through inhibition of XPF.","3703":null,"3704":"Understanding why a transcription factor (TF) binds to a specific DNA element in the genome and whether that binding event affects transcriptional output remains a great challenge. In this study, we demonstrate that TF binding in the genome follows inversion symmetry (IS). In addition, the specific DNA elements where TFs bind in the genome are determined by internal IS within the DNA element. These DNA-binding rules quantitatively define how TFs select the appropriate regulatory targets from a large number of similar DNA elements in the genome to elicit specific transcriptional and cellular responses. Importantly, we also demonstrate that these DNA-binding rules extend to DNA elements that do not support transcriptional activity. That is, the DNA-binding rules are obeyed, but the retention time of the TF at these non-functional DNA elements is not long enough to initiate and\/or maintain transcription. We further demonstrate that IS is universal within the genome. Thus, IS is the DNA code that TFs use to interact with the genome and dictates (in conjunction with known DNA sequence constraints) which of those interactions are functionally active.","3705":"Ascorbic acid-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle represents important antioxidant defense system in planta. Here we utilized Oncidium cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase (OgCytAPX) as a model to demonstrate that CytAPX of several plants possess dual catalytic activity of both AsA and GSH, compared with the monocatalytic activity of Arabidopsis APX (AtCytAPX). Structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified that three amino acid residues, Pro63, Asp75, and Tyr97, are required for oxidization of GSH in dual substrate catalytic type. Enzyme kinetic study suggested that AsA and GSH active sites are distinctly located in cytosolic APX structure. Isothermal titration calorimetric and UV-visible analysis confirmed that cytosolic APX is a heme-containing protein, which catalyzes glutathione in addition to ascorbate. Biochemical and physiological evidences of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing OgCytAPX1 exhibits efficient reactive oxygen species-scavenging activity, salt and heat tolerances, and early flowering, compared with Arabidopsis overexpressing AtCytAPX. Thus results on dual activity CytAPX impose significant advantage on evolutionary adaptive mechanism in planta.","3706":"Direct and efficient photocatalytic overall water splitting is crucial for the sustainable conversion and storage of renewable solar energy. Herein, we present the design of a carbon-rich graphitic carbon nitride (Cco-C3N4), prepared from a layered molecular cocrystal precursor. The cocrystal microsheets were synthesized using a facile hydrothermal process. Following two-step thermal treatment and liquid exfoliation, the product maintains the 2D morphology owing to the toptactic transformation process. The Cco-C3N4 exhibits an enhanced photogenerated electron-hole separation, high charge transport capacity, and prolonged lifetime of the carriers, relative to the g-C3N4 system. In the absence of any sacrificial reagent or co-catalyst, the Cco-C3N4 microsheets exhibit a high photocatalytic activity. The work presented in this report supplies a cocrystal route for the orderly molecular self-assembly of precursor materials to tailor the chemical compositions and electronic structures. Moreover, the generation of a highly efficient water-splitting photocatalyst has larger implications for sustainable energy applications.","3707":"Many patients with visceral inflammation develop pain and psychiatric comorbidities such as major depressive disorder, worsening the quality of life and increasing the risk of suicide. Here we show that neuroimmune activation in mice with dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis is accompanied by the development of pain and depressive behaviors. Importantly, treatment with the flavonoid luteolin prevented both neuroimmune responses and behavioral abnormalities, suggesting a new potential therapeutic approach for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.","3708":"The mechanosensory lateral line system is used by fishes to sense hydrodynamic stimuli in their environment. It provides information about flow regimes, proximity to substrate, and the presence and identity of prey and predators and represents a means of receiving communication signals from other fish. Thus we may expect lateral line system structures to be under strong divergent selection during adaptive radiation. Here, we used X-ray micro-computed tomography scans to quantify variation in cranial lateral line canal morphology within the adaptive radiation of Lake Malawi cichlids. We report that cranial lateral line canal morphology is strongly correlated with diet and other aspects of craniofacial morphology, including the shape of oral jaws. These results indicate an adaptive role for the lateral line system in prey detection and suggest that diversification of this system has taken an important role in the spectacular evolution of Lake Malawi's cichlid fish diversity.","3709":"A short form of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein encoded by CFLARs promotes necroptosis. Although necroptosis is involved in various pathological conditions, the detailed mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we generated transgenic mice wherein CFLARs was integrated onto the X chromosome. All male CFLARs Tg mice died perinatally due to severe ileitis. Although necroptosis was observed in various tissues of CFLARs Tg mice, large numbers of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) died by apoptosis. Deletion of Ripk3 or Mlkl, essential genes of necroptosis, prevented both necroptosis and apoptosis, and rescued lethality of CFLARs Tg mice. Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) were activated and recruited to the small intestine along with upregulation of interleukin-22 (Il22) in CFLARs Tg mice. Deletion of ILC3s or Il22 rescued lethality of CFLARs Tg mice by preventing apoptosis, but not necroptosis of IECs. Together, necroptosis-dependent activation of ILC3s induces lethal ileitis in an IL-22-dependent manner.","3710":"Human neural stem cells (NSCs) offer therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative diseases, such as inherited monogenic nervous system disorders, and neural injuries. Gene editing in NSCs (GE-NSCs) could enhance their therapeutic potential. We show that NSCs are amenable to gene targeting at multiple loci using Cas9 mRNA with synthetic chemically modified guide RNAs along with DNA donor templates. Transplantation of GE-NSC into oligodendrocyte mutant shiverer-immunodeficient mice showed that GE-NSCs migrate and differentiate into astrocytes, neurons, and myelin-producing oligodendrocytes, highlighting the fact that GE-NSCs retain their NSC characteristics of self-renewal and site-specific global migration and differentiation. To show the therapeutic potential of GE-NSCs, we generated GALC lysosomal enzyme overexpressing GE-NSCs that are able to cross-correct GALC enzyme activity through the mannose-6-phosphate receptor pathway. These GE-NSCs have the potential to be an investigational cell and gene therapy for a range of neurodegenerative disorders and injuries of the central nervous system, including lysosomal storage disorders.","3711":null,"3712":null,"3713":null,"3714":null,"3715":null,"3716":"In biomass conversion, Nb2O5 has attracted increasing attention as a catalyst support presenting water-tolerant Lewis acid sites. Herein, we address the design of Ni\/Nb2O5 catalysts for hydrotreating of lignin to hydrocarbons. To optimize the balance between acidic and hydrogenating properties, the catalysts were first evaluated in the hydrotreating of diphenyl ether. The best catalyst candidate was further explored in the conversion of lignin oil obtained by catalytic upstream biorefining of poplar. As primary products, cycloalkanes were obtained, demonstrating the potential of Ni\/Nb2O5 catalysts for the lignin-to-fuels route. However, the Lewis acidity of Nb2O5 also catalyzes coke formation via lignin species condensation. Thereby, an acidity threshold should be found so that dehydration reactions essential to the hydrotreatment are not affected, but the condensation of lignin species prevented. This article provides a critical \"beginning-to-end\" analysis of aspects crucial to the catalyst design to produce lignin biofuels.","3717":null,"3718":null,"3719":"Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB) is a virulence factor produced by locus of enterocyte effacement-negative Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli strains. The toxin recognizes sialoglycans for entry and cleaves an endoplasmic reticulum chaperon, binding immunoglobulin protein, to cause cell death. However, no systematic screening has yet been performed to identify critical host factors. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR\/Cas9 knockout screen for SubAB-induced cell death and identified various sialoglycan-related and membrane-trafficking genes. Analysis of glycan-deficient cells demonstrated that not only N-glycans but also O-glycans serve as SubAB receptors. In addition, SLC39A9, which is a predicted zinc transporter, as well as KDELRs and JTB, were required for SubAB to induce maximal cell death. Disruption of the SLC39A9 gene markedly reduced both complex-type N-glycans and core 1 O-glycans, and the O-glycan reduction was attributed to the reduction of core 1 synthase (C1GalT1). These results provide insights into the post-transcriptional regulation of glycosyltransferases by SLC39A9, as well as sialoglycan species as SubAB receptors.","3720":"We leveraged a human gut-on-a-chip (Gut Chip) microdevice that enables independent control of fluid flow and mechanical deformations to explore how physical cues and morphogen gradients influence intestinal morphogenesis. Both human intestinal Caco-2 and intestinal organoid-derived primary epithelial cells formed three-dimensional (3D) villi-like microarchitecture when exposed to apical and basal fluid flow; however, 3D morphogenesis did not occur and preformed villi-like structure involuted when basal flow was ceased. When cells were cultured in static Transwells, similar morphogenesis could be induced by removing or diluting the basal medium. Computational simulations and experimental studies revealed that the establishment of a transepithelial gradient of the Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-1 and flow-induced regulation of the Frizzled-9 receptor mediate the histogenesis. Computational simulations also predicted spatial growth patterns of 3D epithelial morphology observed experimentally in the Gut Chip. A microengineered Gut Chip may be useful for studies analyzing stem cell biology and tissue development.","3721":"Heparanase is an endoglycosidase involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix and thereby in regulating multiple cellular processes and biological activities. It cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) side chains of HS proteoglycans into smaller fragments and hence regulates tissue morphogenesis, differentiation, and homeostasis. Heparanase is overexpressed in various carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematological malignancies, and its upregulation correlates with increased tumor size, tumor angiogenesis, enhanced metastasis, and poor prognosis. In contrast, knockdown or inhibition of heparanase markedly attenuates tumor progression, further underscoring the potential of anti-heparanase therapy. Heparanase inhibitors were employed to interfere with tumor progression in preclinical studies, and selected heparin mimetics are being examined in clinical trials. However, despite tremendous efforts, the discovery of heparanase inhibitors with high clinical benefit and minimal adverse effects remains a therapeutic challenge. This review discusses the key roles of heparanase in cancer progression focusing on the status of natural, chemically modified, and synthetic heparanase inhibitors in various types of malignancies.","3722":"Expression of tumor suppressor p53 is regulated at multiple levels, disruption of which often leads to cancer. We have adopted an approach combining computational systems modeling with experimental validation to elucidate the translation regulatory network that controls p53 expression post DNA damage. The RNA-binding protein HuR activates p53 mRNA translation in response to UVC-induced DNA damage in breast carcinoma cells. p53 and HuR levels show pulsatile change post UV irradiation. The computed model fitted with the observed pulse of p53 and HuR only when hypothetical regulators of synthesis and degradation of HuR were incorporated. miR-125b, a UV-responsive microRNA, was found to represses the translation of HuR mRNA. Furthermore, UV irradiation triggered proteasomal degradation of HuR mediated by an E3-ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing 21 (TRIM21). The integrated action of miR-125b and TRIM21 constitutes an intricate control system that regulates pulsatile expression of HuR and p53 and determines cell viability in response to DNA damage.","3723":"The early detection of cancers has the potential to save many lives. A recent attempt has been demonstrated successful. However, we note several critical limitations. Given the central importance and broad impact of early cancer detection, we aspire to address those limitations. We explore different supervised learning approaches for multiple cancer type detection and observe significant improvements; for instance, one of our approaches (i.e., CancerA1DE) can double the existing sensitivity from 38% to 77% for the earliest cancer detection (i.e., Stage I) at the 99% specificity level. For Stage II, it can even reach up to about 90% across multiple cancer types. In addition, CancerA1DE can also double the existing sensitivity from 30% to 70% for detecting breast cancers at the 99% specificity level. Data and model analysis are conducted to reveal the underlying reasons.

This strategy features mild reaction condition, no request of transition metal catalyst, and easy formation of various C-X bonds (C-S, C-Si, C-Sn, C-Ge, C-Se, C-N). The method was successfully applied to a late-stage functionalization of an existing antibiotic drug, to a Clickable reaction of NBD-based ammonium salt as turn-on fluorescent probe to recognize L-cysteine and homocysteine, and to the synthesis of a DNA encoded library (DEL) bearing different C-X bonds.","3726":null,"3727":null,"3728":"Cytoskeletal cross talk between actin filaments and microtubules is a common mechanism governing the assembly of cellular structures, i.e., during filopodia formation or cilia organization. However, potential actin-microtubule interactions during mammalian cell divisions are less well understood. At mitotic entry, centrosomes propagate the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby aligning individual chromosomes to the metaphase plate, a process coined chromosome congression. Here, we identify actin filament assembly spatially defined at centrosomes contemporaneously with spindle microtubules forming during prometaphase. We show that pharmacological Arp2\/3 complex inhibition as well as overexpression of the Arp2\/3 complex inhibitory protein Arpin decreased spindle actin. As a consequence, mitotic spindle formation is impaired, which resulted in disorganized chromosome congression and ultimately mitotic defects in non-transformed cells. Thus centrosomal Arp2\/3 complex activity plays a role in the maintenance of genomic integrity during mitosis.","3729":"Visual system development involves the formation of neuronal projections connecting the retina to the thalamic dorso-lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and the thalamus to the visual cerebral cortex. Patients carrying mutations in the SOX2 transcription factor gene present severe visual defects, thought to be linked to SOX2 functions in the retina. We show that Sox2 is strongly expressed in mouse postmitotic thalamic projection neurons. Cre-mediated deletion of Sox2 in these neurons causes reduction of the dLGN, abnormal distribution of retino-thalamic and thalamo-cortical projections, and secondary defects in cortical patterning. Reduced expression, in mutants, of Sox2 target genes encoding ephrin-A5 and the serotonin transport molecules SERT and vMAT2 (important for establishment of thalamic connectivity) likely provides a molecular contribution to these defects. These findings unveil thalamic SOX2 function as a novel regulator of visual system development and a plausible additional cause of brain-linked genetic blindness in humans.","3730":"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling controls skin development and homeostasis in mice and humans, and its deficiency causes severe skin inflammation, which might affect epidermal stem cell behavior. Here, we describe the inflammation-independent effects of EGFR deficiency during skin morphogenesis and in adult hair follicle stem cells. Expression and alternative splicing analysis of RNA sequencing data from interfollicular epidermis and outer root sheath indicate that EGFR controls genes involved in epidermal differentiation and also in centrosome function, DNA damage, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Genetic experiments employing p53 deletion in EGFR-deficient epidermis reveal that EGFR signaling exhibits p53-dependent functions in proliferative epidermal compartments, as well as p53-independent functions in differentiated hair shaft keratinocytes. Loss of EGFR leads to absence of LEF1 protein specifically in the innermost epithelial hair layers, resulting in disorganization of medulla cells. Thus, our results uncover important spatial and temporal features of cell-autonomous EGFR functions in the epidermis.","3731":null,"3732":null,"3733":"The skin is colonized by a diverse microbiome intricately involved in various molecular and cellular processes within the skin and beyond. UV radiation is known to induce profound changes in the skin and modulate the immune response. However, the role of the microbiome in UV-induced immune suppression has been overlooked. By employing the standard model of contact hypersensitivity (using germ-free mice) we found diminished UV-induced systemic immune suppression in the presence of microbiome. Upon UV exposure, we found enhanced epidermal hyperplasia and neutrophilic infiltration in the presence and enhanced numbers of mast cells and monocyte or macrophages in the absence of microbiome. Transcriptome analysis revealed a predominant expression of cytokine genes related to pro-inflammatory milieu in the presence versus immunosuppressive milieu (with increased interleukin-10) in the absence of microbiome. Collectively, microbiome abrogates the immunosuppressive response to UV by modulating gene expression and cellular microenvironment of the skin.","3734":"Temperature, one of the most critical environmental cues, greatly affects plant growth, development, and reproduction. PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), a key transcription factor in light signaling pathway, plays a central role in temperature-mediated growth responses. How higher temperature regulates the function of PIF4, however, is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that three phylogenetically related TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1\/CYCLOIDEA\/PCF (TCP) transcription factors, TCP5, TCP13, and TCP17, play fundamental roles in promoting thermoresponsive hypocotyl growth by positively regulating the activity of PIF4. TCP17 was found to interact with a blue light receptor, CRYPTOCHROME 1 (CRY1), at lower temperature, leading to reduced activity of TCP17. Higher temperature can increase the stability of TCP17, and release TCP17 from the CRY1-TCP17 complex, allowing it to upregulate the expression of PIF4 and enhance the transcriptional activity of PIF4. This study revealed the important roles of TCPs in regulating the activity of PIF4 in thermomorphogenesis.","3735":"Plants display thermomorphogenesis in response to high temperature (HT). PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) is a central integrator regulated by numerous negative regulators. However, the mechanisms underpinning PIF4 positive regulation are largely unknown. Here, we find that TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1\/CYCLOIDEA\/PCF 5 (TCP5), TCP13, and TCP17 transcription factors promote the activity of PIF4 at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. TCP5 is rapidly induced by HT treatment, and TCP5 protein stability increases under HT. The overexpression of TCP5 causes constitutive thermomorphogenic phenotypes, whereas the tcp5 tcp13 tcp17 triple mutant exhibits aberrant thermomorphogenesis. We demonstrate that TCP5 not only physically interacts with PIF4 to enhance its activity but also directly binds to the promoter of PIF4 to increase its transcript. TCP5 and PIF4 share common downstream targets. The tcp5 tcp13 tcp17 mutant partially restores the long hypocotyls caused by PIF4 overexpression. Our findings provide a layer of understanding about the fine-scale regulation of PIF4 and plant thermomorphogenesis.","3736":"Polybromo1 (PBRM1) is a chromatin remodeler subunit highly mutated in cancer, particularly clear cell renal carcinoma. PBRM1 is a member of the SWI\/SNF subcomplex, PBAF (PBRM1-Brg1\/Brm-associated factors), and is characterized by six tandem bromodomains. Here we establish a role for PBRM1 in epithelial cell maintenance through the expression of genes involved in cell adhesion, metabolism, stress response, and apoptosis. In support of a general role for PBRM1 in stress response and apoptosis, we observe that loss of PBRM1 results in an increase in reactive oxygen species generation and a decrease in cellular viability under stress conditions. We find that loss of PBRM1 promotes cell growth under favorable conditions but is required for cell survival under conditions of cellular stress.","3737":null,"3738":null,"3739":null,"3740":null,"3741":"Thalidomide is a teratogen that causes multiple malformations in the developing baby through its interaction with cereblon (CRBN), a substrate receptor subunit of the CRL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. CRBN was originally reported as a gene associated with autosomal recessive non-syndromic mild mental retardation. However, the function of CRBN during brain development remains largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that CRBN promotes brain development by facilitating the proliferation of neural stem cells (NSCs). Knockdown of CRBN in zebrafish embryos impaired brain development and led to small brains, as did treatment with thalidomide. By contrast, overexpression of CRBN resulted in enlarged brains, leading to the expansion of NSC regions and increased cell proliferation in the early brain field and an expanded expression of brain region-specific genes and neural and glial marker genes. These results demonstrate that CRBN functions in the determination of brain size by regulating the proliferation of NSCs during development.","3742":null,"3743":null,"3744":null,"3745":null,"3746":"Benzimidazolone constitutes the core structure of numerous pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, inhibitors, pigments, herbicides, and fine chemicals. Amination of hydrocarbons is an attractive tool for the creation of nitrogen-containing products. However, the multiple steps, harsh conditions, and low atom efficiencies often present in these reactions remain challenging. We present a multicomponent synthesis of functional benzimidazolones from arylamines, dialkylamines, and alcohols, acting via the sequence of copper-catalyzed oxidative tandem C-H aminations and alkyl deconstructive carbofunctionalization. The catalytic transformation forms multiple bonds in one single operation, uses readily available feedstocks and a naturally abundant Cu\/O2 catalyst system, has broad substrate scope, avoids pre-installation of aminating agents and directing groups, and provides high chemo- and regioselectivity, resulting in direct functionalization of inert C-H and C-C bonds via single-electron oxidation-induced activation mode. This platform can be expected to provide structurally diverse products with interesting biological, chemical, and physical properties.","3747":null,"3748":null,"3749":null,"3750":null,"3751":"In Drosophila, long-term memory (LTM) formation requires increases in glial gene expression. Klingon (Klg), a cell adhesion molecule expressed in both neurons and glia, induces expression of the glial transcription factor, Repo. However, glial signaling downstream of Repo has been unclear. Here we demonstrate that Repo increases expression of the glutamate transporter, EAAT1, and EAAT1 is required during consolidation of LTM. The expressions of Klg, Repo, and EAAT1 decrease upon aging, suggesting that age-related impairments in LTM are caused by dysfunction of the Klg-Repo-EAAT1 pathway. Supporting this idea, overexpression of Repo or EAAT1 rescues age-associated impairments in LTM. Pharmacological inhibition of glutamate activity during consolidation improves LTM in klg mutants and aged flies. Altogether, our results indicate that LTM formation requires glial-dependent inhibition of glutamate signaling during memory consolidation, and aging disrupts this process by inhibiting the Klg-Repo-EAAT1 pathway.","3752":"Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin (ETX) is hypothesized to mediate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability by binding to the myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL) on the luminal surface of endothelial cells (ECs). However, the kinetics of this interaction and a general understanding of ETX's behavior in a live organism have yet to be appreciated. Here we investigate ETX binding and BBB breakdown in living Danio rerio (zebrafish). Wild-type zebrafish ECs do not bind ETX. When zebrafish ECs are engineered to express human MAL (hMAL), proETX binding occurs in a time-dependent manner. Injection of activated toxin in hMAL zebrafish initiates BBB leakage, hMAL downregulation, blood vessel stenosis, perivascular edema, and blood stasis. We propose a kinetic model of MAL-dependent ETX binding and neurovascular pathology. By generating a humanized zebrafish BBB model, this study contributes to our understanding of ETX-induced BBB permeability and strengthens the proposal that MAL is the ETX receptor.","3753":"Intercellular contacts are essential for precise organ morphogenesis, function, and maintenance; however, spatiotemporal information of cell-cell contacts or adhesions remains elusive in many systems. We developed a genetically encoded fluorescent indicator for intercellular contacts with optimized intercellular GFP reconstitution using glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, GRAPHIC (GPI anchored reconstitution-activated proteins highlight intercellular connections), which can be used for an expanded number of cell types. We observed a robust GFP signal specifically at the interface between cultured cells, without disrupting natural cell contact. Application of GRAPHIC to the fish retina specifically delineated cone-bipolar connection sites. Moreover, we showed that GRAPHIC can be used in the mouse central nervous system to delineate synaptic sites in the thalamocortical circuit. Finally, we generated GRAPHIC color variants, enabling detection of multiple convergent contacts simultaneously in cell culture system. We demonstrated that GRAPHIC has high sensitivity and versatility, which will facilitate the analysis of the complex multicellular connections without previous limitations.","3754":null,"3755":null,"3756":"Metal carbenes, divalent carbon species, are versatile intermediates that enable novel synthetic pathways. These species exhibit either electrophilic or nucleophilic character, depending on the carbene and metal fragments. Although the metal carbene reactivity is regulated by the metal, the umpolung of carbene reactivity by changing metal remains challenging. Here, we report a unique metal-induced de novo umpolung of carbene reactivity, wherein a carbene precursor can be transformed into either an electrophilic carbene or a nucleophilic carbenoid, depending on the metal promoters. Thus, a chemodivergent reaction of isatins and cyclopropenes is developed. Under the promotion of Zn2+ halides, a nucleophilic zinc carbenoid is formed and trapped by isatins to produce oxindole derivatives containing an alkenyl halide moiety. Using Rh2(esp)2 as a catalyst, the reaction delivers oxindoles carrying a dihydrofuran unit. This work provides a facile approach to harness the metal carbene reactivity and is critical for the development of diversity-oriented synthesis.","3757":"As we begin to design increasingly complex synthetic biomolecular systems, it is essential to develop rational design methodologies that yield predictable circuit performance.

Furthermore, we demonstrate how these principles can be applied to inform the design process of a particular synthetic feedback circuit.","3758":null,"3759":"Echo-imaging evolved as the main remote sense under lightless conditions. It is most precise in the third dimension (depth) rather than in the visually dominating dimensions of azimuth and elevation. We asked how the auditory system accesses spatial information in the dimensions of azimuth and elevation with a sensory apparatus that is fundamentally different from vision. We quantified echo-acoustic parameters of surface-wave patterns with impulse-response recordings and quantified bats' perceptual sensitivity to such patterns with formal psychophysics. We demonstrate that the spectro-temporal auditory representation of a wave pattern implicitly encodes its spatial frequency. We further show that bats are much more sensitive to wave patterns of high spatial frequencies than of low spatial frequencies. We conclude that echo-imaging accesses spatial information by exploiting an inherent environmental high-pass filter for spatial frequency. The functional similarities yet mechanistic differences between visual and auditory system signify convergent evolution of spatial-information processing.","3760":"Animal navigation relies on the available environmental cues and, where present, visual cues typically dominate. While much is known about vision-assisted navigation, knowledge of navigation in the dark is scarce. Here, we combine individual tracking, dynamic modular nest structures, and spatially resolved chemical profiling to study how Camponotus fellah ants navigate within the dark labyrinth of their nest. We find that, contrary to ant navigation above ground, underground navigation cannot rely on long-range information. This limitation emphasizes the ants' capabilities associated with other navigational strategies. Indeed, apart from gravity, underground navigation relies on self-referenced memories of multiple locations and on socially generated chemical cues placed at decision points away from the target. Moreover, the ants quickly readjust the weights attributed to these information sources in response to environmental changes. Generally, studying well-known behaviors in a variety of environmental contexts holds the potential of revealing new insights into animal cognition.","3761":"We show that an imaginary magnetic field (IMF), which can be generated in non-Hermitian systems with spin-dependent dissipations, can greatly enhance the s-wave pairing and superfluidity of spin-1\/2 fermions, in distinct contrast to the effect of a real magnetic field. The enhancement can be attributed to the increased coupling constant in low-energy space and the reduced spin gap in forming singlet pairs. We have demonstrated this effect in a number of different fermion systems with and without spin-orbit coupling, using both the two-body exact solution and many-body mean-field theory. Our results suggest an alternative route toward strong fermion superfluid with high superfluid transition temperature.","3762":null,"3763":"Biological systems are driven by intricate interactions among molecules. Many methods have been developed that draw on large numbers of expression samples to infer connections between genes (or their products). The result is an aggregate network representing a single estimate for the likelihood of each interaction, or \"edge,\" in the network. Although informative, aggregate models fail to capture population heterogeneity. Here we propose a method to reverse engineer sample-specific networks from aggregate networks. We demonstrate our approach in several contexts, including simulated, yeast microarray, and human lymphoblastoid cell line RNA sequencing data. We use these sample-specific networks to study changes in network topology across time and to characterize shifts in gene regulation that were not apparent in the expression data. We believe that generating sample-specific networks will greatly facilitate the application of network methods to large, complex, and heterogeneous multi-omic datasets, supporting the emerging field of precision network medicine.","3764":null,"3765":null,"3766":null,"3767":null,"3768":null,"3769":null,"3770":null,"3771":"LOVE, a robust, scalable latent model-based clustering method for biological discovery, can be used across a range of datasets to generate both overlapping and non-overlapping clusters.

We prove that the allocation matrix and corresponding clusters are uniquely defined. We apply LOVE to biological datasets (gene expression, serological responses measured from HIV controllers and chronic progressors, vaccine-induced humoral immune responses) resulting in meaningful biological output. For all three datasets, the clusters generated by LOVE remain stable across tuning parameters. Finally, we compared LOVE's performance to that of 13 state-of-the-art methods using previously established benchmarks and found that LOVE outperformed these methods across datasets.

Here, we identified two PD-1-targeting mAbs, GY-5 and GY-14, with PD-1\/PD-L1-blocking efficacy. Complex structural information revealed that both mAbs mainly bind to the FG loop of PD-1, which also contributes multiple interactions with PD-L1. The FG loop adopts substantially varied conformations upon binding to different mAbs, providing a novel targetable region for the development of PD-1-specific biologics and small chemical molecules. Glycosylation modifications of PD-1 could be observed in three of the four potential N-linked glycosylation sites. However, the binding of GY-5 and GY-14 to PD-1 was not affected by glycosylation. These findings broaden our understanding of the mechanism of anti-PD-1 mAbs and provide insight into the development of agents targeting PD-1.","3775":"Incorporation of as prepared single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) into the electron transporting layer (ETL) is an effective strategy to enhance the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the fundamental role of the SWCNT electrical types in the PSCs is not well understood. Herein, we prepared semiconducting (s-) and metallic (m-) SWCNT families and integrated them into TiO2 photoelectrodes of the PSCs. Based on experimental and theoretical studies, we found that the electrical type of the nanotubes plays an important role in the devices. In particular, the mixture of s-SWCNTs and m-SWCNTs (2:1 w\/w)-based PSCs exhibited a remarkable efficiency of up to 19.35%, which was significantly higher than that of the best control cell (17.04%). In this class of PSCs, semiconducting properties of s-SWCNTs play a critical role in extracting and transporting electrons, whereas m-SWCNTs provide high conductance throughout the electrode.","3776":"Two catalytic asymmetric vinylogous aldol-type reactions of aldehydes with allyl phosphonate and allyl sulfone have been uncovered in good to high yields for the first time.

Moreover, the present methodology was successfully applied in the asymmetric synthesis of natural products.","3777":"To address the question of why more than one myosin-II isoform is expressed in a single cell to drive cytokinesis, we analyzed the roles of the myosin-II isoforms, Myo2 and Myp2, of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, in cytokinesis under normal and stressed conditions. We found that Myp2 controls the disassembly, stability, and constriction initiation of the Myo2 ring in response to high-salt stress. A C-terminal coiled-coil domain of Myp2 is required for its immobility and contractility during cytokinesis, and when fused to the tail of the dynamic Myo2, renders the chimera the low-turnover property. We also found, by following distinct processes in real time at the single-cell level, that Myo2 and Myp2 are differentially required but collectively essential for guiding extracellular matrix remodeling during cytokinesis. These results suggest that the dynamic and immobile myosin-II isoforms are evolved to carry out cytokinesis with robustness under different growth conditions.","3778":"Cells can communicate mechanically by responding to mechanical deformations generated by their neighbors. Here, we describe a new role for mechanical communication by demonstrating that mechanical coupling between cells acts as a signaling cue that reduces intrinsic noise in the interacting cells. We measure mechanical interaction between beating cardiac cells cultured on a patterned flexible substrate and find that beat-to-beat variability decays exponentially with coupling strength. To demonstrate that such noise reduction is indeed a direct consequence of mechanical coupling, we reproduce the exponential decay in an assay where a beating cell interacts mechanically with an artificial stochastic 'mechanical cell'. The mechanical cell consists of a probe that mimics the deformations generated by a stochastically beating neighboring cardiac cell. We show that noise reduction through mechanical coupling persists long after stimulation stops and identify microtubule integrity, NOX2, and CaMKII as mediators of noise reduction.","3779":null,"3780":null,"3781":"Elevation of the levels of reactive oxygen species and other toxic radicals is an emerging strategy to treat certain cancers by modulating the redox status of cancer cells.

We found that WRN was SL with a DNA mismatch repair protein MutL homolog 1, loss of which is associated with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). MSI-H cells exhibited increased double-stranded DNA breaks, altered cell cycles, and decreased viability in response to WRN knockdown, in contrast to microsatellite stable (MSS) lines, which tolerated depletion of WRN.

The mcoln1a-deficient mutants display phenotypes partially recapitulating the key features of ML-IV disorder, including the accumulation of enlarged late endosomes in microglia and aberrant neuronal activities in both spontaneous and visual-evoking conditions in optic tectal neurons. We further show that the accumulation of enlarged late endosomes in microglia is caused by the impairment of late endosome and lysosome fusion and the aberrant neuronal activities can be partially rescued by the reconstitution of Mcoln1a function in microglia. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of microglial function may contribute to the development and progression of ML-IV disease.","3790":null,"3791":"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) segregation associated with donor-recipient mtDNA mismatch in mitochondria replacement therapy leads to unknown risks.

Meanwhile, we found that distribution of donor mtDNA among the blastomeres of preimplantation embryos from the heteroplasmic mice shared the same tendency as that in adult tissues. Statistical analysis showed that no selective replication of donor mtDNA occurred during lifespan. Tracking donor mtDNA distribution showed that uneven distribution of donor mtDNA among embryonic blastomeres gradually became even as donor mtDNA heteroplasmy increased, indicating that the \"segregation\" in tissues was inherited from the uneven distribution.

The importance of the local microtubule stabilization in this process has been revealed however, the external signals initiating the cytoskeletal rearrangements are not completely understood. In this study, we show that local activation of the canonical Wnt pathway regulates neuronal polarity and axonal outgrowth. We found that in the early stages of neuronal polarization, Wnt3a accumulates in one of the neurites of unpolarized cells and thereby could determine axon positioning. Subsequently, Wnt3a localizes to the growing axon, where it activates the canonical Wnt pathway and controls axon positioning and axonal length. We propose a model in which Wnt3a regulates the formation and growth of the axon by activating local intracellular signaling events leading to microtubule remodeling.","3797":null,"3798":null,"3799":"The lattice directly determines the electronic structure, and it enables controllably tailoring the properties by deforming the lattices of two-dimensional (2D) materials.

Compared with the methods that employed external force fields with intrinsic instability and nonuniformity, the stretched 2D molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) could be uniformly retained and permanently preserved via doping metal atoms with more outermost electrons and smaller electronegativity than Mo.

In the culture, Kv1.1 was down-regulated and not differentiated tonotopically. Chronic depolarization increased Kv1.1 expression in a level-dependent manner. Moreover, the dependence was steeper at higher-frequency regions, which restored the differentiation. The depolarization increased Kv1.1 via activation of Cav1 channels, whereas basal Ca2+ level elevated similarly irrespective of tonotopic regions. Thus, the efficiency of Ca2+-dependent Kv1.1 expression would be fine-tuned in a tonotopic-region-specific manner, emphasizing the importance of neuronal tonotopic identity as well as pattern of afferent input in the tonotopic differentiation of the channel in the auditory circuit.","3806":"Strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been widely used to improve catalytic performance and to identify reaction mechanisms.

The strong Pt-C bonding not only stabilizes single Pt atoms but also modifies their electronic structure, tunes their adsorption properties, and enhances activation of reactants.

However, the molecular mechanisms behind epithelial morphogenesis remain largely unknown. Mammary gland is an excellent model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms of epithelial morphogenesis. In this study, we found that cysteine dioxygenase (CDO), a key enzyme in cysteine oxidative metabolism, was involved in mammary epithelial morphogenesis. CDO knockout (KO) females exhibited severe defects in mammary branching morphogenesis and ductal elongation, resulting in poor lactation. CDO contributes to the luminal epithelial cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis mainly through its downstream product cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA). Exogenous supplementation of CSA not only rescued the defects in CDO KO mouse but also enhanced ductal growth in wild-type mouse. It suggests that CDO regulates luminal epithelial differentiation and regeneration via CSA and consequently contributes to mammary development, which raises important implications for epithelial morphogenesis and pathogenesis of breast cancer.","3808":"The formation and bioelectric performance of anode biofilms in microbial electrochemical systems (MESs) are sensitive to oxygen. Investigating the temporal-spatial structure of anode biofilms will help elucidate the interfaces between oxygen and bacteria, thereby facilitating the applications of MESs in wastewater treatment and energy recovery.

Our results showed that the inner layer of aerobic anode biofilms performed electricity generation, whereas the outer layer only consumed oxygen. In this case, electron donor diffusion through the outer layer became the limiting factor in electricity generation by the bioanode. Consequently, as the anode biofilms matured, current generation decreased.","3809":null,"3810":null,"3811":null,"3812":"Adipocytes function as major players in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, and factors contributing to adipocyte differentiation and function are promising targets for combatting obesity and associated metabolic disorders.

Ablation of ATF7 promotes beige fat biogenesis in inguinal white adipose tissue.

The site and type of amino acid substitution were determined via neutralization escape using an enhancing-activity-only monoclonal antibody that was engineered to reveal neutralizing activity. Mutated dengue type 1 DNA vaccines containing either or both amino acid substitutions induced neutralizing antibodies devoid of enhancing activity against all serotypes. The effect of substitution was further demonstrated using other serotypes and a tetravalent formulation.

The ESCRT-III component CHMP4B localizes to the midbody and \"spreads\" to the site of abscission only during late midbody stage. Strikingly, inhibition of myosin-II motor activity by a low dose of Blebbistatin completely abolishes the formation of the constriction sites, resulting in the localization of all the above-mentioned components to the midbody region. These data strongly suggest that a secondary actomyosin ring provides the primary driving force for the thinning of the intercellular bridge to allow ESCRT-mediated membrane fission.","3817":"CRISPR-Cas systems as adaptive immunity in bacteria and archaea battle against bacteriophages. However, little is known how CRISPR-Cas systems are precisely regulated to effectively eliminate intruders while not inducing self-reactivity. Here, we identify intrinsic negative modulator of CRISPR-Cas that influences interference and adaptation functions. LasI\/RhlI-derived autoinducers activate cas operon by enhancing the binding of virulence factor regulator (Vfr) cis-response elements to cas1 promoter, whereas CdpR represses this intracellular signaling and blocks transcription of cas operon. Importantly, inhibition of Vfr reduces cas1 expression and impairs immunization and immune memory mediated by CRISPR-Cas, leading to more severe phage infection but lower self-targeting activities. In addition, CdpR-mediated LasI\/RhlI\/Vfr intracellular signaling represses cleavage of bacterial endogenous sequences by impeding Cas3 RNA cleavage activity. Thus, CdpR renders important inhibitory effects on CRISPR-Cas systems to avoid possible self-reactivity but potentially heightening infection risk. Our study provides insight into fine regulation of CRISPR-Cas systems for maintaining homeostasis.","3818":"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are promising targets for cancer therapy, although their individual actions remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a role for HDAC2 in the regulation of MDM2 acetylation at previously uncharacterized lysines. Upon inactivation of HDAC2, this acetylation creates a structural signal in the lysine-rich domain of MDM2 to prevent the recognition and degradation of its downstream substrate, MCL-1 ubiquitin ligase E3 (MULE). This mechanism further reveals a therapeutic connection between the MULE ubiquitin ligase function and tumor suppression. Specifically, we show that HDAC inhibitor treatment promotes the accumulation of MULE, which diminishes the t(X; 18) translocation-associated synovial sarcomagenesis by directly targeting the fusion product SS18-SSX for degradation. These results uncover a new HDAC2-dependent pathway that integrates reversible acetylation signaling to the anticancer ubiquitin response.","3819":"Conjugated polymers are emerging as promising organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution from water. However, it is still very challenging for conjugated polymers to realize highly efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient strategy of hydrophilic side chain functionalization to boost the hydrogen evolution rates of conjugated polymers. By functionalizing conjugated polymers with hydrophilic oligo (ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether (OEG) side chains, a 90-fold improvement in hydrogen evolution rate has been achieved than that of alkyl-functionalized conjugated polymer. It is found that the OEG side chains interact robustly with Pt co-catalysts, resulting in more efficient charge transfer. Moreover, OEG side chains in conjugated polymers can adsorb H+ from water, resulting in significantly lowered energy levels on the surfaces of conjugated polymers, which enables cascade energy levels and enhances charge separation and photocatalytic performance. Our results indicate that rational side-chain engineering could facilitate the design of improved organic photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution.","3820":null,"3821":null,"3822":"Metazoan cells can generate unequal-sized sibling cells during cell division. This form of asymmetric cell division depends on spindle geometry and Myosin distribution, but the underlying mechanics are unclear.

We show that initial apical cortical expansion is driven by hydrostatic pressure, peaking shortly after anaphase onset, and enabled by a relief of actomyosin contractile tension on the apical cell cortex. An increase in contractile tension at the cleavage furrow combined with the relocalization of basally located Myosin initiates basal and sustains apical extension. We propose that spatiotemporally controlled actomyosin contractile tension and hydrostatic pressure enable biased cortical expansion to generate sibling cell size asymmetry. However, dynamic cleavage furrow repositioning can compensate for the lack of biased expansion to establish physical asymmetry.","3823":"Live cell imaging has been widely used to generate data for quantitative understanding of cellular dynamics. Various applications have been developed to perform automated imaging data analysis, which often requires tedious manual correction. It remains a challenge to develop an efficient curation method that can analyze massive imaging datasets with high accuracy. Here, we present eDetect, a fast error detection and correction tool that provides a powerful and convenient solution for the curation of live cell imaging analysis results. In eDetect, we propose a gating strategy to distinguish correct and incorrect image analysis results by visualizing image features based on principal component analysis. We demonstrate that this approach can substantially accelerate the data correction process and improve the accuracy of imaging data analysis. eDetect is well documented and designed to be user friendly for non-expert users.

The ability to replace the variable regions of the native B cell receptor (BCR) heavy and light chain loci with defined recombined sequences of a preferred monoclonal antibody could enable curative adoptive cell transfer. We report CRISPR-mediated homologous recombination (HR) into the BCR of primary human B cells. Ribonucleoprotein delivery enabled editing at the model CXCR4 locus, as demonstrated by T7E1 assay, flow cytometry, and TIDE analysis. Insertion via HR was confirmed by sequencing, cross-boundary PCR, and restriction digest. Optimized conditions were used to achieve HR at the BCR variable heavy and light chains. Insertion was confirmed at the DNA level, and transgene expression from the native BCR promoters was observed. Reprogramming the specificity of antibodies in the genomes of B cells could have clinical importance.","3825":"","3826":"The use of beneficial bacteria to promote health is widely practiced. However, experimental evidence corroborating the efficacy of bacteria promoted with such claims remains limited. We address this gap by identifying a beneficial bacterium that protects against tissue damage and injury-induced inflammation in the gut. We first employed the Drosophila animal model to screen for the capacity of candidate beneficial bacteria to protect the fly gut against injury. From this screen, we identified Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris as a bacterium that elicited potent cytoprotective activity. Then, in a murine model, we demonstrated that the same strain confers powerful cytoprotective influences against radiological damage, as well as anti-inflammatory activity in a gut colitis model. In summary, we demonstrate the positive salutary effects of a beneficial bacterium, namely, L. lactis subsp. cremoris on intestinal tissue and propose the use of this strain as a therapeutic to promote intestinal health.","3827":null,"3828":"Reduced poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) levels cause aging-associated muscle wasting. PABPN1 is a multifunctional regulator of mRNA processing. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms causing PABPN1-mediated muscle wasting, we compared the transcriptome with the proteome in mouse muscles expressing short hairpin RNA to PABPN1 (shPab). We found greater variations in the proteome than in mRNA expression profiles. Protein accumulation in the shPab proteome was concomitant with reduced proteasomal activity. Notably, protein acetylation appeared to be decreased in shPab versus control proteomes (63%). Acetylome profiling in shPab muscles revealed prominent peptide deacetylation associated with elevated sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) deacetylase. We show that SIRT1 mRNA levels are controlled by PABPN1 via alternative polyadenylation site utilization. Most importantly, SIRT1 deacetylase inhibition by sirtinol increased PABPN1 levels and reversed muscle wasting. We suggest that perturbation of a multifactorial regulatory loop involving PABPN1 and SIRT1 plays an imperative role in aging-associated muscle wasting.

Segmentation of somites, precursors of the vertebral column among other tissues, is jointly controlled by temporal signals from the segmentation clock and spatial signals from morphogen gradients. To explore how these temporal and spatial signals are integrated, we combined time-controlled genetic perturbation experiments with computational modeling to reconstruct the core segmentation network in zebrafish. We found that Mesp family transcription factors link the temporal information of the segmentation clock with the spatial action of the fibroblast growth factor signaling gradient to establish rostrocaudal (head to tail) polarity of segmented somites. We further showed that cells gradually commit to patterning by the action of different genes at different spatiotemporal positions.

In a 15-mm rat sciatic nerve defect model, we further confirm that the COL\/NC\/PCL conduit markedly alleviates inflammation and oxidative stress, improves microvessel growth, and contributes to functional, electrophysiological, and morphological nerve restoration in the long term. Our findings provide compelling evidence for future research in antioxidant nerve conduit for severe neurological defects.","3838":null,"3839":"The c-Src oncogene is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane through its N-terminal myristoylated SH4 domain. This domain is part of an intramolecular fuzzy complex with the SH3 and Unique domains. Here we show that the N-terminal myristoyl group binds to the SH3 domain in the proximity of the RT loop, when Src is not anchored to a lipid membrane. Residues in the so-called Unique Lipid Binding Region modulate this interaction. In the presence of lipids, the myristoyl group is released from the SH3 domain and inserts into the lipid membrane. The fuzzy complex with the SH4 and Unique domains is retained in the membrane-bound form, placing the SH3 domain close to the membrane surface and restricting its orientation. The apparent affinity of myristoylated proteins containing the SH4, Unique, and SH3 domains is modulated by these intramolecular interactions, suggesting a mechanism linking c-Src activation and membrane anchoring.","3840":"Protein kinase B\/AKT is a highly connected protein involved in a range of signaling pathways. Although it is known to regulate several proteins in the apoptotic pathway, its system-level effects remain poorly understood. We investigated the dynamic interactions between AKT and key apoptotic proteins and constructed a deterministic ordinary differential equation protein interaction model of extrinsic apoptosis. Incorporating AKT and its indirect inhibitor, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), this was used to generate predictions of system dynamics. Using eigen analysis, we identified AKT and cytochrome c as the protein species most sensitive to perturbations. Cell death assays in Type II HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells revealed a tendency toward Type I cell death behavior in the XIAP-\/- background, with cells displaying accelerated TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Finally, AKT inhibition experiments implicated AKT and not PTEN in influencing apoptotic proteins during early phases of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.","3841":"Pioneering human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based pre-clinical studies have raised safety concerns and pinpointed the need for safer and more efficient approaches to generate and maintain patient-specific iPSCs. One approach is searching for compounds that influence pluripotent stem cell reprogramming using functional screens of known drugs. Our high-throughput screening of drug-like hits showed that imidazopyridines-analogs of zolpidem, a sedative-hypnotic drug-are able to improve reprogramming efficiency and facilitate reprogramming of resistant human primary fibroblasts. The lead compound (O4I3) showed a remarkable OCT4 induction, which at least in part is due to the inhibition of H3K4 demethylase (KDM5, also known as JARID1). Experiments demonstrated that KDM5A, but not its homolog KDM5B, serves as a reprogramming barrier by interfering with the enrichment of H3K4Me3 at the OCT4 promoter. Thus our results introduce a new class of KDM5 chemical inhibitors and provide further insight into the pluripotency-related properties of KDM5 family members.","3842":null,"3843":null,"3844":"","3845":"Although electrochemical water splitting is an effective and green approach to produce oxygen and hydrogen, the realization of efficient bifunctional catalysts that are stable in variable electrolytes is still a significant challenge.

Compared with the typical Ir\/C-Pt\/C system, superior catalytic performances and excellent durability of the overall water splitting under universal pH have been demonstrated. The introduction of Ni downshifts the d-band center of the Ru-Ni electrocatalysts, modulating the surface electronic environment. Density functional theory results reveal that the mutually restrictive d-band interaction lowers the binding of (Ru, Ni) and (H, O) for easier O-O and H-H formation. The structure-induced eg-dz2 misalignment leads to minimization of surface Coulomb repulsion to achieve a barrier-free water-splitting process.","3846":null,"3847":null,"3848":null,"3849":"Similar universal phenomena can emerge in different complex systems when those systems share a common symmetry in their governing laws. In physical systems operating near a critical phase transition, the governing physical laws obey a fractal symmetry; they are the same whether considered at fine or coarse scales. This scale-change symmetry is responsible for universal critical phenomena found across diverse systems. Experiments suggest that the cerebral cortex can also operate near a critical phase transition. Thus we hypothesize that the laws governing cortical dynamics may obey scale-change symmetry. Here we develop a practical approach to test this hypothesis. We confirm, using two different computational models, that neural dynamical laws exhibit scale-change symmetry near a dynamical phase transition. Moreover, we show that as a mouse awakens from anesthesia, scale-change symmetry emerges. Scale-change symmetry of the rules governing cortical dynamics may explain observations of similar critical phenomena across diverse neural systems.","3850":"N-linked glycosylation affects the potency, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic clearance of several therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies. A robust control strategy is needed to dial in appropriate glycosylation profile during the course of cell culture processes accurately. However, N-glycosylation dynamics remains insufficiently understood owing to the lack of integrative analyses of factors that influence the dynamics, including sugar nucleotide donors, glycosyltransferases, and glycosidases. Here, an integrative approach involving multi-dimensional omics analyses was employed to dissect the temporal dynamics of glycoforms produced during fed-batch cultures of CHO cells. Several pathways including glycolysis, tricarboxylic citric acid cycle, and nucleotide biosynthesis exhibited temporal dynamics over the cell culture period. The steps involving galactose and sialic acid addition were determined as temporal bottlenecks. Our results show that galactose, and not manganese, is able to mitigate the temporal bottleneck, despite both being known effectors of galactosylation. Furthermore, sialylation is limited by the galactosylated precursors and autoregulation of cytidine monophosphate-sialic acid biosynthesis.","3851":"Obesity has become an explicit public health concern because of its relevance to metabolic syndrome. Evidence points to the significance of beige adipocytes in regulating energy expenditure. Here, using yeast two-hybrid screening, we show that Zfp238 is a Foxo1 co-repressor and that adipose-tissue-specific ablation of Zfp238 (Adipo-Zfp238KO) in mice leads to obesity, decreased energy expenditure, and insulin resistance under normal chow diet. Adipo-Zfp238KO inhibits induction of Ucp1 expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue upon cold exposure or CL316243, but not in brown adipose tissue. Furthermore, knockdown of Zfp238 in 3T3-L1 cells decreases Ucp1 expression in response to cool incubation or forskolin significantly compared with control cells. In contrast, overexpression of Zfp238 in 3T3-L1 cells significantly increases Ucp1 expression in response to forskolin. Finally, double knockdown of both Zfp238 and Foxo1 normalizes Ucp1 induction. These data suggest that Zfp238 in adipose tissue regulates the thermogenic program in cooperation with Foxo1.","3852":null,"3853":"Various in situ synthesis methods have been developed for the polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene monomers, such as electropolymerization, oxidative chemical vapor deposition, and vapor phase polymerization.

The process involves sequential deposition of oxidants (V2O5 in this case) and monomers. Excess reactants and by-products can be completely removed from the PEDOT film by MeOH rinsing. The obtained PEDOT films possess good crystallinity and high doping level, with carrier concentration three orders of magnitude higher than that of the commercial product (PH1000, Heraeus GmbH). The electrical conductivity of the as-cast PEDOT film reaches up to 1,420 S\/cm. In addition, this method is fully compatible with large-scale printing techniques.

How TRAIL protects against atherosclerosis and why levels are reduced in disease is unknown. Here, multiple strategies were used to identify the protective source of TRAIL and its mechanism(s) of action. Samples from patients with coronary artery disease and bone-marrow transplantation experiments in mice lacking TRAIL revealed monocytes\/macrophages as the main protective source. Accordingly, deletion of TRAIL caused a more inflammatory macrophage with reduced migration, displaying impaired reverse cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis. Furthermore, interleukin (IL)-18, commonly increased in plasma of patients with cardiovascular disease, negatively regulated TRAIL transcription and gene expression, revealing an IL-18-TRAIL axis. These findings demonstrate that TRAIL is protective of atherosclerosis by modulating monocyte\/macrophage phenotype and function. Manipulating TRAIL levels in these cells highlights a different therapeutic avenue in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.","3857":"The DNA damage response (DDR) protects cells against genomic instability. Surprisingly, little is known about the differences in DDR across tissues, which may affect cancer evolutionary trajectories and chemotherapy response. Using mathematical modeling and quantitative experiments, we found that the DDR is regulated differently in human breast and lung primary cells. Equal levels of cisplatin-DNA lesions caused stronger Chk1 activation in lung cells, leading to resistance. In contrast, breast cells were more resistant and showed more Chk2 activation in response to doxorubicin. Further analyses indicate that Chk1 activity played a regulatory role in p53 phosphorylation, whereas Chk2 activity was essential for p53 activation and p21 expression. We propose a novel \"friction model,\" in which the balance of p53 and p21 levels contributes to the apoptotic response in different tissues. Our results suggest that modulating the balance of p53 and p21 dynamics could optimize the response to chemotherapy.","3858":null,"3859":null,"3860":null,"3861":null,"3862":"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are produced by various GSL-synthesizing enzymes, but post-translational regulation of these enzymes is incompletely understood. To address this knowledge disparity, we focused on biosynthesis of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the Shiga toxin (STx) receptor, and performed a genome-wide CRISPR\/CAS9 knockout screen in HeLa cells using STx1-mediated cytotoxicity. We identified various genes including sphingolipid-related genes and membrane-trafficking genes. In addition, we found two proteins, LAPTM4A and TM9SF2, for which physiological roles remain elusive. Disruption of either LAPTM4A or TM9SF2 genes reduced Gb3 biosynthesis, resulting in accumulation of its precursor, lactosylceramide. Loss of LAPTM4A decreased endogenous Gb3 synthase activity in a post-transcriptional mechanism, whereas loss of TM9SF2 did not affect Gb3 synthase activity but instead disrupted localization of Gb3 synthase. Furthermore, the Gb3-regulating activity of TM9SF2 was conserved in the TM9SF family. These results provide mechanistic insight into the post-translational regulation of the activity and localization of Gb3 synthase.","3863":null,"3864":null,"3865":null,"3866":"A recent phylogenetic analysis showed global co-evolution of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and receptor-activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs) suggesting global interactions between these two protein families. Experimental validation of these findings is challenging because in humans whereas there are only three genes encoding RAMPs, there are about 800 genes encoding GPCRs. Here, we report an experimental approach to evaluate GPCR-RAMP interactions. As a proof-of-concept experiment, we over-expressed RAMP2 in HEK293T cells and evaluated the effect on the transcriptional levels of 14 representative GPCRs that were selected based on the earlier phylogenetic analysis. We utilized a multiplexed error-correcting fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH) method to detect message levels for individual GPCRs in single cells. The MERFISH results showed changes in GPCR message levels with RAMP2 over-expression in a concordant pattern that was predicted by the earlier phylogenetic analysis. These results provide additional evidence that GPCR-RAMP interactions are more widespread than previously appreciated and that these interactions have functional consequences.","3867":null,"3868":"Th17 cells contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer.

However, when compared with corresponding published mouse data, we found very limited overlap between the proteins differentially regulated in response to Th17 differentiation. Validations were made for a panel of selected proteins with known and unknown functions. Finally, using RNA interference, we showed that SATB1 negatively regulates human Th17 cell differentiation. Overall, the current study illustrates a comprehensive picture of the global protein landscape during early human Th17 cell differentiation. Poor overlap with mouse data underlines the importance of human studies for translational research.","3869":null,"3870":null,"3871":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron cell death. However, not all motor neurons are equally susceptible. Most of what we know about the surviving motor neurons comes from gene expression profiling; less is known about their functional traits. We found that resistant motor neurons cultured from SOD1 ALS mouse models have enhanced axonal outgrowth and dendritic branching. They also have an increase in the number and size of actin-based structures like growth cones and filopodia. These phenotypes occur in cells cultured from presymptomatic mice and mutant SOD1 models that do not develop ALS but not in embryonic motor neurons. Enhanced outgrowth and upregulation of filopodia can be induced in wild-type adult cells by expressing mutant SOD1. These results demonstrate that mutant SOD1 can enhance the regenerative capability of ALS-resistant motor neurons. Capitalizing on this mechanism could lead to new therapeutic strategies.","3872":"Nanoparticles (NPs) of controlled size, shape, and composition are important building blocks for the next generation of devices. There are numerous recent examples of organizing uniformly sized NPs into ordered arrays or superstructures in processes such as solvent evaporation, heterogeneous solution assembly, Langmuir-Blodgett receptor-ligand interactions, and layer-by-layer assembly. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of surfactant-assisted cooperative self-assembly method using amphiphilic surfactants and NPs to synthesize new classes of highly ordered active nanostructures. Driven by cooperative interparticle interactions, surfactant-assisted NP nucleation and growth results in optically and electrically active nanomaterials with hierarchical structure and function. How the approach works with nanoscale materials of different dimensions into active nanostructures is discussed in details. Some applications of these self-assembled nanostructures in the areas of nanoelectronics, photocatalysis, and biomedicine are highlighted. Finally, we conclude with the current research progress and perspectives on the challenges and some future directions.","3873":"There is currently no treatment for myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), the most frequent myopathy of genetic origin. This progressive neuromuscular disease is caused by nuclear-retained RNAs containing expanded CUG repeats. These toxic RNAs alter the activities of RNA splicing factors, resulting in alternative splicing misregulation. By combining human mutated pluripotent stem cells and phenotypic drug screening, we revealed that cardiac glycosides act as modulators for both upstream nuclear aggregations of DMPK mRNAs and several downstream alternative mRNA splicing defects. However, these occurred at different drug concentration ranges. Similar biological effects were recorded in a DM1 mouse model. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrated that this effect was calcium dependent and was synergic with inhibition of the ERK pathway. These results further underscore the value of stem-cell-based assays for drug discovery in monogenic diseases.","3874":"The cochlear sensory epithelium contains a functionally important triangular fluid-filled space between adjacent pillar cells referred to as the tunnel of Corti. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to local cell-cell separation during development remain elusive. Here we show that EphA4 associates with ADAM10 to promote the destruction of E-cadherin-based adhesions between adjacent pillar cells. These cells fail to separate from each other, and E-cadherin abnormally persists at the pillar cell junction in EphA4 forward-signaling-deficient mice, as well as in the presence of ADAM10 inhibitor. Using immunolabeling and an in situ proximity ligation assay, we found that EphA4 forms a complex with E-cadherin and its sheddase ADAM10, which could be activated by ephrin-B2 across the pillar cell junction to trigger the cleavage of E-cadherin. Altogether, our findings provide a new molecular insight into the regulation of adherens junctions, which might be extended to a variety of physiological or pathological processes.","3875":"","3876":null,"3877":null,"3878":"Binary gene regulatory tools such as the Tetracycline (Tet)-controlled transcription system have revolutionized genetic research in multiple organisms, but their applications to the worm remain very limited.

The resultant Tet\/Q hybrid system proves more robust and flexible than either of its precursors, enabling elaborate modes of transgene manipulation previously hard to achieve in the worm, including inducible intersectional regulation and, in combination with the Q system, independent control of distinct transgenes within the same cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated, as an example of its applications, that the hybrid system can tightly and efficiently control Cre expression. This study establishes Tet\/Q as a premier binary system for worm genetic research.","3879":null,"3880":"Monocytic leukemia zinc-finger protein (MOZ) has been found to form fusion proteins with many regulators in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the molecular functions and underlying mechanism of MOZ in AML is not well understood. Here, clinical MOZ expression analysis combined with data integration from the TCGA and GEO databases indicated that a low level of MOZ was associated with poor prognosis. MOZ knockdown inhibited monocyte differentiation and increased resistance to chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis in THP-1 or U937 cells. In addition, we found that genetic silencing of MOZ suppressed AP-1 and AKT activity in the context of lipopolysaccharide stimulation, resulting in diminished M1 activation of macrophages. We further showed that MOZ was a validated target of miR-223 and functioned as a repressor of miR-223 expression. Our study indicates that a molecular network involving MOZ and miR-223 contributes to the monocyte differentiation and polarization program, which is deregulated in AML.","3881":"Single-cell analysis is a rapidly evolving to characterize molecular information at the individual cell level. Here, we present a new approach with the potential to overcome several key challenges facing the currently available techniques. The approach is based on the identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), viz. organic compounds having relatively high vapor pressure, emitted to the cell's headspace. This concept is demonstrated using lung cancer cells with various p53 genetic status and normal lung cells. The VOCs were analyzed by gas chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Among hundreds of detected compounds, 18 VOCs showed significant changes in their concentration levels in tumor cells versus control. The composition of these VOCs was found to depend, also, on the sub-molecular structure of the p53 genetic status. Analyzing the VOCs offers a complementary way of querying the molecular mechanisms of cancer as well as of developing new generation(s) of biomedical approaches for personalized screening and diagnosis.","3882":null,"3883":"Development of a general catalytic and highly efficient method utilizing readily available precursors for the regio- and stereoselective construction of bioactive natural-product-inspired spiro architectures remains a formidable challenge in chemical research. Transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylides produces numerous N-heterocycles, but reaction control with the regioselectivity opposite to the conventional fashion has rarely been demonstrated. Herein, we report a unique ligand-controlled Cu(I)-catalyzed umpolung-type 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of azomethine ylide to realize efficient kinetic resolution of racemic alkylidene norcamphors with the concomitant construction of previously inaccessible spiro N-heterocycles with high levels of regio- and stereoselectivity. The success of this methodology relies on the strategy of kinetic resolution, and the serendipitous discovery of a unique ligand-enabled regiospecific cycloaddition, which not only provides evidence for the existence of the minor zwitterionic resonance form in metallated azomethine ylide but also diversifies the existing chemistry of azomethine ylide-involved 1,3-dipolar cycloadditions with rare polarity inversion.","3884":"The second messenger 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) stimulates gene expression via the cAMP-regulated transcriptional coactivator (CRTC) family of cAMP response element-binding protein coactivators. In the basal state, CRTCs are phosphorylated by salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) and sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins. cAMP signaling inhibits the SIKs, leading to CRTC dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Here we show that although all CRTCs are regulated by SIKs, their interactions with Ser\/Thr-specific protein phosphatases are distinct. CRTC1 and CRTC2 associate selectively with the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, whereas CRTC3 interacts with B55 PP2A holoenzymes via a conserved PP2A-binding region (amino acids 380-401). CRTC3-PP2A complex formation was induced by phosphorylation of CRTC3 at S391, facilitating the subsequent activation of CRTC3 by dephosphorylation at 14-3-3 binding sites. As stimulation of mitogenic pathways promoted S391 phosphorylation via the activation of ERKs and CDKs, our results demonstrate how a ubiquitous phosphatase enables cross talk between growth factor and cAMP signaling pathways at the level of a transcriptional coactivator.","3885":"Timely centrosome separation is critical for accurate chromosome separation. It is initiated by Nek2A at the onset of mitosis, but the mechanism for the strict requirement of phosphorylated Nek2A for its own activation remains unclear. In this study, we have found that Plk1 interacts with Cep85 and forms a ternary complex with Cep85-Nek2A. Nek2A binding, but not its kinase activity, is pre-required for Cep85 to be phosphorylated by Plk1. Nek2A-dependent Cep85 phosphorylation, in turn, leads to the dissociation of phosphorylated Cep85 exclusively from phospho-Nek2A, thereby increasing the freed phospho-Nek2A activity. Both kinases are also required for phosphorylating endogenous Cep85 in cells, and timely phosphorylation of Cep85 and Nek2A is crucial for initiating centrosome disjunction at G2\/M. Overall, our study has uncovered a previously unrecognized role of Plk1 and Nek2A and identified Cep85 as a missing piece directly relaying Plk1 activity to Nek2A for its activation in centrosome disjunction.","3886":"The peptide hormone H2 relaxin has demonstrated promise as a therapeutic, but mimetic development has been hindered by the poorly understood relaxin receptor RXFP1 activation mechanism. H2 relaxin is hypothesized to bind to two distinct ECD sites, which reorientates the N-terminal LDLa module to activate the transmembrane domain. Here we provide evidence for this model in live cells by measuring bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) between nanoluciferase-tagged RXFP1 constructs and fluorescently labeled H2 relaxin (NanoBRET). Additionally, we validate these results using the related RXFP2 receptor and chimeras with an inserted RXFP1-binding domain utilizing NanoBRET and nuclear magnetic resonance studies on recombinant proteins. We therefore provide evidence for the multi-component molecular mechanism of H2 relaxin binding to RXFP1 on the full-length receptor in cells. Also, we show the utility of NanoBRET real-time binding kinetics to reveal subtle binding complexities, which may be overlooked in traditional equilibrium binding assays.","3887":null,"3888":null,"3889":null,"3890":"The emerging field of bioelectricity has revealed numerous new roles for ion channels beyond the nervous system, which can be exploited for applications in regenerative medicine.

The channel is cooperatively affected by vacuolar Ca2+ (Hill coefficient, 1.5), suggesting that it may accommodate a Ca2+ receptor that can bind two calcium ions. Alanine scanning of six negatively charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane S5 and S6 linker, facing the vacuolar lumen, revealed that two aspartate residues, 401 and 405, are essential for current inhibition and direct binding of 45Ca2+. Expressed in HEK-293 cells, a significant fraction of TRPY1, present in the plasma membrane, retained its Ca2+ sensitivity. Based on these data and on homology with TRPV channels, we conclude that D401 and D405 are key residues within the vacuolar vestibule of the TRPY1 pore that decrease cation access or permeation after Ca2+ binding.","3895":"Directed transport of transmembrane proteins is generally believed to occur via intracellular transport vesicles. However, using single-particle tracking in rat hippocampal neurons with a pH-sensitive quantum dot probe that specifically reports surface movement of receptors, we have identified a subpopulation of neuronal EphB2 receptors that exhibit directed motion between synapses within the plasma membrane itself. This receptor movement occurs independently of the cytoskeleton but is dependent on cholesterol and is regulated by neuronal activity.","3896":"Distal-less has been repeatedly co-opted for the development of many novel traits. Here, we document its curious role in the development of a novel abdominal appendage (\"sternite brushes\") in sepsid flies. CRISPR\/Cas9 deletions in the homeodomain result in losses of sternite brushes, demonstrating that Distal-less is necessary for their development. However, deletions in the upstream coding exon (Exon 2) produce losses or gains of brushes. A dissection of Exon 2 reveals that the likely mechanism for gains involves a deletion in an exon-splicing enhancer site that leads to exon skipping. Such contradictory phenotypes are also observed in butterflies, suggesting that mutations in the conserved upstream regions have the potential to generate phenotypic variability in insects that diverged 300 million years ago. Our results demonstrate the importance of Distal-less for the development of a novel abdominal appendage in insects and highlight how site-specific mutations in the same exon can produce contradictory phenotypes.","3897":"CellMinerCDB provides a web-based resource (https:\/\/discover.nci.nih.gov\/cellminercdb\/) for integrating multiple forms of pharmacological and genomic analyses, and unifying the richest cancer cell line datasets (the NCI-60, NCI-SCLC, Sanger\/MGH GDSC, and Broad CCLE\/CTRP). CellMinerCDB enables data queries for genomics and gene regulatory network analyses, and exploration of pharmacogenomic determinants and drug signatures. It leverages overlaps of cell lines and drugs across databases to examine reproducibility and expand pathway analyses.

We tested several possible mechanisms to explain Pax6's tissue-specific actions and found that the presence of the transcription factor Foxg1 in the cortex but not in the diencephalon was most influential. We found that Foxg1 is responsible for many of the differences in cell cycle gene expression between the diencephalon and cortex and, in cortex lacking Foxg1, Pax6's action on the balance of proliferation versus differentiation becomes diencephalon like. Our findings reveal a mechanism for generating regional forebrain diversity in which one transcription factor completely reverses the actions of another.","3902":null,"3903":null,"3904":"","3905":null,"3906":null,"3907":"The dynamics of cellular membranes is primarily determined by lipid species forming a bilayer. Proteins are considered mainly as effector molecules of diverse cellular processes. In addition to large assemblies of proteins, which were found to influence properties of fluid membranes, biological membranes are densely populated by small, highly mobile proteins. However, little is known about the effect of such proteins on the dynamics of membranes. Using synthetic peptides, we demonstrate that transmembrane helices interfere with the mobility of membrane components by trapping lipid acyl chains on their rough surfaces. The effect is more pronounced in the presence of cholesterol, which segregates from the rough surface of helical peptides. This may contribute to the formation or stabilization of membrane heterogeneities. Since roughness is a general property of helical transmembrane segments, our results suggest that, independent of their size or cytoskeleton linkage, integral membrane proteins affect local membrane dynamics and organization.","3908":"Commercially available electrochromic (EC) windows are based on solid-state devices in which WO3 and NiOx films commonly serve as the EC and counter electrode layers, respectively. These metal oxide layers are typically physically deposited under vacuum, a time- and capital-intensive process when using rigid substrates. Herein we report a facile solution deposition method for producing amorphous WO3 and NiOx layers that prove to be effective materials for a solid-state EC device. The full device containing these solution-processed layers demonstrates performance metrics that meet or exceed the benchmark set by devices containing physically deposited layers of the same compositions. The superior EC performance measured for our devices is attributed to the amorphous nature of the NiOx produced by the solution-based photodeposition method, which yields a more effective ion storage counter electrode relative to the crystalline NiOx layers that are more widely used. This versatile method yields a distinctive approach for constructing EC windows.","3909":"The developing eye lens presents an exceptional paradigm for spatial transcriptomics. It is composed of highly organized long, slender transparent fiber cells, which differentiate from the edges of the anterior epithelium of the lens (equator), attended by high expression of crystallins, which generates transparency. Every fiber cell, therefore, is an optical unit whose refractive properties derive from its gene activity. Here, we probe this tangible relationship between the gene activity and the phenotype by studying the expression of all known 17 crystallins and 77 other non-crystallin genes in single fiber cells isolated from three states\/regions of differentiation, allowing us to follow molecular progression at the single-cell level. The data demonstrate highly variable gene activity in cortical fibers, interposed between the nascent and the terminally differentiated fiber cell transcription. These data suggest that the so-called stochastic, highly heterogeneous gene activity is a regulated intermediate in the realization of a functional phenotype.","3910":null,"3911":"Most of the currently developed sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) have potential safety hazards due to the use of highly volatile and flammable alkyl carbonate electrolytes. To overcome this challenge, we report an electrochemically compatible and nonflammable electrolyte, tris(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) phosphate (TFEP) with low-concentration sodium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (0.9 M), which is designed not only to match perfectly with the hard carbon (HC) anode but also to enhance the thermal stability of SIBs. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that TFEP molecules have a significantly low barrier to decompose before Na+ inserts into HC, forming a stable inorganic solid-electrolyte interface layer, thus improving the electrochemical and structural stabilities of HC anodes. An HC\/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell using TFEP electrolyte shows a high capacity retention of 89.2% after 300 cycles and a dramatically reduced exothermic heat at elevated temperature, implying its potential application for safe and low-cost larger-scale energy storage.","3912":"Molecular imaging of metastatic \"potential\" is an unvanquished challenge. To engineer biosensors that can detect and measure the metastatic \"potential\" of single living cancer cells, we carried out a comprehensive analysis of the pan-cancer phosphoproteome to search for actin remodelers required for cell migration, which are enriched in cancers but excluded in normal cells. Only one phosphoprotein emerged, tyr-phosphorylated CCDC88A (GIV\/Girdin), a bona fide metastasis-related protein across a variety of solid tumors. We designed multi-modular biosensors that are partly derived from GIV, and because GIV integrates prometastatic signaling by multiple oncogenic receptors, we named them \"'integrators of metastatic potential (IMP).\" IMPs captured the heterogeneity of metastatic potential within primary lung and breast tumors at steady state, detected those few cells that have acquired the highest metastatic potential, and tracked their enrichment during metastasis. These findings provide proof of concept that IMPs can measure the diversity and plasticity of metastatic potential of tumor cells in a sensitive and unbiased way.","3913":null,"3914":"The design of blue fluorescent materials combining both deep-blue emission (CIEy&lt;0.06) and high-efficiency climbing over the typically limited exciton production efficiency of 25% is a challenge for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).

Intriguingly, we have proposed a strategy to avoid aggregation-caused quenching, which can effectively reduce the undesirable excimeric emission by introducing two host matrices with twisted molecular structure, 9,10-di(naphth-2-yl) anthracene and 10,10'-bis-(4-fluorophenyl)-3,3'-dimethyl-9,9'-bianthracene (MBAn-(4)-F), in the BBPA emission layer.

Here we demonstrate that Ezh2 controls cutaneous tolerance by regulating Langerhans cell (LC) transmigration across the epidermal basement membrane directly via Talin1 methylation. Ezh2 deficiency impaired disassembly of adhesion structures in LCs, leading to their defective integrin-dependent emigration from the epidermis and failure in tolerance induction. Moreover, mobilization of Ezh2-deficient Langerin- dermal dendritic cells (dDCs) via high-dose treatment with a weak allergen restored tolerance, which is associated with an increased tolerogenic potential of Langerin- dDCs likely due to epigenetic de-repression of Aldh in the absence of Ezh2. Our data reveal novel roles for Ezh2 in governing LC- and dDC-mediated host protection against cutaneous allergen via distinct mechanisms.","3916":"In transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis, enantioselectivity strongly depends on the structures of chiral ligands, so the development of new chiral ligands is crucial. Here, an efficient and highly enantioselective palladium-catalyzed intramolecular hydroarylation has been developed, and a new kind of N-heterocycles, 1H-pyrazolo[5,1-a]isoindol-2(8H)-ones containing a quaternary stereocenter, was prepared in high yields and excellent enantiomeric excess values. The reaction was effectively catalyzed by palladium-diphosphine complexes with numerous functional group tolerance, in which the newly developed axially chiral cyclic diphosphine ligands played key roles in the reactivity and enantioselectivity of the substrates. We believe that the cyclic diphosphine ligands with adjustable dihedral angles will find wide application in asymmetric synthesis.","3917":null,"3918":null,"3919":null,"3920":"Rapid cell migration requires efficient rear de-adhesion. It remains undetermined whether cells mechanically detach or biochemically disassemble integrin-mediated rear adhesion sites in highly motile cells such as keratocytes. Using molecular tension sensor, we calibrated and mapped integrin tension in migrating keratocytes. Our experiments revealed that high-level integrin tension abbreviated as HIT, in the range of 50-100 pN (piconewton) and capable of rupturing integrin-ligand bonds, is exclusively and narrowly generated at cell rear margin during cell migration. Co-imaging of HIT and focal adhesions (FAs) shows that HIT is produced to mechanically peel off FAs that lag behind, and HIT intensity is correlated with the local cell retraction rate. High-level molecular tension was also consistently generated at the cell margin during artificially induced cell front retraction and during keratocyte migration mediated by biotin-streptavidin bonds. Collectively, these experiments provide direct evidence showing that migrating keratocytes concentrate force at the cell rear margin to mediate rear de-adhesion.","3921":null,"3922":"Supported Pt catalyst has been intensively investigated for formaldehyde elimination owing to its superior reactivity at room temperature (RT). However, the high Pt content is challenging because of its high cost. Herein, we report PbO-supported Pt catalysts with only 0.1 wt % Pt, which can achieve complete conversion of formaldehyde and reliable stability at RT under demanding conditions. Both experiments and simulations demonstrate that PbO interacts strongly with the Pt species, resulting in tight Pb-O-Pt bonding at the metal\/support interface and concomitant activation of the surface lattice oxygen of the support. Moreover, PbO exhibits an extremely high capacity of formaldehyde capture through methylene glycol chemisorption rather than the common hydroxyl-associated adsorption, presenting a different reaction mechanism because the active surface lattice oxygen in the vicinity of Pt species offers improved reactivity. This work provides a valuable example for the design of an efficient catalyst for formaldehyde and potentially oxidation of other carbohydrates.","3923":"BCL-2-related ovarian killer (BOK) is a pro-apoptotic BAX-like member of the BCL-2 family with suggested tumor suppressor activity. The molecular mechanisms regulating BOK expression are poorly understood and fail to explain a frequent lack of concordance between protein and transcript levels. Here, we describe a potent post-transcriptional mechanism that negatively regulates BOK expression mediated by conserved (AU\/U)-rich elements within its 3' UTR. Using proteomics approaches we identified TRIM28 as a key component associating with U-rich elements in the human BOK 3' UTR, resulting in a dramatic reduction of BOK expression. TRIM28 is overexpressed in several cancers, correlating with poor patient outcome, whereas the BOK locus is frequently deleted or its expression downregulated in human cancers. Data mining indicated that, for certain cancers, high TRIM28 and low BOK expression are significantly correlated in the stratum of patients with the worst survival, suggesting that this mechanism might be of potential therapeutic value.","3924":null,"3925":null,"3926":"FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that is known to localize in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Here, we have identified an interaction of FMRP with a specific set of C\/D box snoRNAs in the nucleus. C\/D box snoRNAs guide 2'O methylations of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) on defined sites, and this modification regulates rRNA folding and assembly of ribosomes. 2'O methylation of rRNA is partial on several sites in human embryonic stem cells, which results in ribosomes with differential methylation patterns. FMRP-snoRNA interaction affects rRNA methylation on several of these sites, and in the absence of FMRP, differential methylation pattern of rRNA is significantly altered. We found that FMRP recognizes ribosomes carrying specific methylation patterns on rRNA and the recognition of methylation pattern by FMRP may potentially determine the translation status of its target mRNAs. Thus, FMRP integrates its function in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm.","3927":"Chemical modifications to nucleobases have a great influence on various cellular processes, by making gene regulation more complex, thus indicating their profound impact on aspects of heredity, growth, and disease. Here, we provide the first genome-wide map of 5-formyluracil (5fU) in living tissues and evaluate the potential roles for 5fU in genomics. We show that an azido derivative of (2-benzimidazolyl)acetonitrile has high selectivity for enriching 5fU-containing genomic DNA. The results have demonstrated the feasibility of using this method to determine the genome-wide distribution of 5fU. Intriguingly, most 5fU sites were found in intergenic regions and introns. Also, distribution of 5fU in human thyroid carcinoma tissues is positively correlated with binding sites of POLR2A protein, which indicates that 5fU may distributed around POLR2A-binding sites.","3928":"Epidermal homeostasis requires balanced and coordinated adult stem cell renewal and differentiation. These processes are controlled by both extracellular signaling and by cell intrinsic transcription regulatory networks, yet how these control mechanisms are integrated to achieve this is unclear. Here, we developed single-cell Immuno-Detection by sequencing (scID-seq) and simultaneously measured 69 proteins (including 34 phosphorylated epitopes) at single-cell resolution to study the activation state of signaling pathways during human epidermal differentiation. Computational pseudo-timing inference revealed dynamic activation of the JAK-STAT, WNT, and BMP pathways along the epidermal differentiation trajectory. We found that during differentiation, cells start producing BMP2-ligands and activate the canonical intracellular effectors SMAD1\/5\/9. Mechanistically, the BMP pathway is responsible for activating the MAF\/MAFB\/ZNF750 transcription factor network to drive late-stage epidermal differentiation. Our work indicates that incorporating signaling pathway activation into this transcription regulatory network enables coordination of transcription programs during epidermal differentiation.","3929":"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi anterograde transport is driven by COPII vesicles mainly composed of a Sec23\/Sec24 inner shell and a Sec13\/Sec31 outer cage. How COPII vesicles are tethered to the Golgi is not completely understood. We demonstrated here that PAQR3 can facilitate tethering of COPII vesicles to the Golgi. Proximity labeling using PAQR3 fused with APEX2 identified that many proteins involved in intracellular transport are in close proximity to PAQR3. ER-to-Golgi trafficking of N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 on removal of brefeldin A is delayed by PAQR3 deletion. RUSH assay also revealed that ER-to-Golgi trafficking is affected by PAQR3. The N-terminal end of PAQR3 can interact with the WD domains of Sec13 and Sec31A. PAQR3 enhances Golgi localization of Sec13 and Sec31A. Furthermore, PAQR3 is localized in the ERGIC and cis-Golgi structures, the acceptor sites for COPII vesicles. Taken together, our study uncovers a role for PAQR3 as a player in regulating ER-to-Golgi transport of COPII vesicles.","3930":null,"3931":"The plasma membrane is the site of intercellular communication and subsequent intracellular signal transduction. The specific visualization of the plasma membrane in living cells, however, is difficult using fluorescence-based techniques owing to the high background signals from intracellular organelles. In this study, we show that second harmonic generation (SHG) is a high-resolution plasma membrane-selective imaging technique that enables multifaceted investigations of the plasma membrane. In contrast to fluorescence imaging, SHG specifically visualizes the plasma membrane at locations that are not attached to artificial substrates and allows high-resolution imaging because of its subresolution nature. These properties were exploited to measure the distances from the plasma membrane to subcortical actin and tubulin fibers, revealing the precise cytoskeletal organization beneath the plasma membrane. Thus, SHG imaging enables the specific visualization of phenomena at the plasma membrane with unprecedented precision and versatility and should facilitate cell biology research focused on the plasma membrane.","3932":"At early stages of organismal development, endothelial cells self-organize into complex networks subsequently giving rise to mature blood vessels. The compromised collective behavior of endothelial cells leads to the development of a number of vascular diseases, many of which can be life-threatening. Cerebral cavernous malformation is an example of vascular diseases caused by abnormal development of blood vessels in the brain. Despite numerous efforts to date, enlarged blood vessels (cavernomas) can be effectively treated only by risky and complex brain surgery. In this work, we use a comprehensive simulation model to dissect the mechanisms contributing to an emergent behavior of the multicellular system. By tightly integrating computational and experimental approaches we gain a systems-level understanding of the basic mechanisms of vascular tubule formation, its destabilization, and pharmacological rescue, which may facilitate the development of new strategies for manipulating collective endothelial cell behavior in the disease context.","3933":null,"3934":"Metal-catalyzed reactions have revolutionized synthetic chemistry, allowing access to unprecedented molecular architectures with powerful properties and activities. Nonetheless, some transformations remain sparse in number, or out of reach, even with the diverse modern catalytic chemical arsenal, including bimolecular alkene hydroarylation reactions. We report here a broad-scope, palladium-catalyzed pyrroline hydroarylation process that gives 3-aryl pyrrolidines, a class of small molecules with potency in a diverse range of biological scenarios. Thus, whereas N-acyl pyrrolines usually undergo palladium-catalyzed arylation to give alkene products, the corresponding reactions of N-alkyl pyrrolines deliver products of hydroarylation, pyrrolidines. The process has broad substrate scope and can be used to directly deliver drug-like molecules in a single step from readily available precursors.","3935":"Centromeres are specialized chromosomal regions epigenetically defined by the histone H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). CENP-A needs to be replenished in every cell cycle, but how new CENP-A is stably incorporated into centromeric chromatin remains unclear. We have discovered that a cytoskeletal protein, diaphanous formin mDia2, is essential for the stable incorporation of new CENP-A proteins into centromeric nucleosomes. Here we report that mDia2-mediated formation of dynamic and short nuclear actin filaments in G1 nucleus is required to maintain CENP-A levels at the centromere. Importantly, mDia2 and nuclear actin are required for constrained centromere movement during CENP-A loading, and depleting nuclear actin or MgcRacGAP, which lies upstream of mDia2, extends centromeric association of the CENP-A loading chaperone Holliday junction recognition protein (HJURP). Our findings thus suggest that nuclear actin polymerized by mDia2 contributes to the physical confinement of G1 centromeres so that HJURP-mediated CENP-A loading reactions can be productive, and centromere's epigenetic identity can be stably maintained.","3936":"We apply stable isotope tracing, mass-spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics, to reveal the biochemical space labeled by 13C-substrates in bone-marrow-derived macrophages. At the pathway level, classically (lipopolysaccharide [LPS]-polarized, M1) and alternatively (interleukin [IL]-4-polarized, M2) polarized macrophages were 13C-labeled with surprising concordance. Total pools of uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), an intermediate in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, were equally abundant in LPS- and IL-4-polarized macrophages. Informatic scrutiny of 13C-isotopologues revealed that LPS-polarized macrophages leverage the pentose phosphate pathway to generate UDP-GlcNAc, whereas IL-4-polarized macrophages rely on intact glucose and mitochondrial metabolism of glucose carbon. Labeling from [13C]glucose is competed by unlabeled fatty acids and acetoacetate, underscoring the broad roles for substrate metabolism beyond energy conversion. Finally, the LPS-polarized macrophage metabolite itaconate is imported into IL-4-polarized macrophages, in which it reprograms [13C]glucose metabolism. Thus, use of fully unsupervised isotope tracing metabolomics in macrophages reveals polarization-state-specific metabolic pathway connectivity, substrate competition, and metabolite allocation among cellular compartments.","3937":"Photovoltaic devices based on perovskite materials have a great potential to become an exceptional source of energy while preserving the environment. However, to enter the global market, they require further development to achieve the necessary performance requirements. The environmental performance of a pre-industrial process of production of a large-area carbon stack perovskite module is analyzed in this work through life cycle assessment (LCA). From the pre-industrial process an ideal process is simulated to establish a benchmark for pre-industrial and laboratory-scale processes. Perovskite is shown to be the most harmful layer of the carbon stack module because of the energy consumed in the preparation and annealing of the precursor solution, and not because of its Pb content. This work stresses the necessity of decreasing energy consumption during module preparation as the most effective way to reduce environmental impacts of perovskite solar cells.","3938":"Intra-embryo genome editing by CRISPR\/Cas9 enables easy generation of gene-modified animals by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-mediated frameshift mutations or homology-directed repair (HDR)-mediated point mutations. However, large modifications, such as gene replacement or gene fusions, are still difficult to introduce in embryos without costly micromanipulators. Moreover, micromanipulation techniques for intra-embryo genome editing have been established in only a small set of animals. To overcome these issues, we developed a method of large-fragment DNA knockin without micromanipulation. In this study, we successfully delivered the knockin donor DNA into zygotes by adeno-associated virus (AAV) without removing the zona pellucida, and we succeeded in both large-DNA fragment knockin and whole exon exchange with electroporation of CRISPR\/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. By this method, we can exchange large DNA fragments conveniently in various animal species without micromanipulation.","3939":null,"3940":null,"3941":"","3942":"Nodal signaling controls asymmetric organ placement during vertebrate embryogenesis. Nodal is induced by a leftward fluid flow at the ciliated left-right organizer (LRO). The mechanism of flow sensing, however, has remained elusive. pkd2 encodes the calcium channel Polycystin-2, which is required for kidney development and laterality, and may act in flow perception. Here, we have studied the role of Polycystin-2 in Xenopus and show that pkd2 is indispensable for left-right (LR) asymmetry. Knockdown of pkd2 prevented left-asymmetric nodal cascade induction in the lateral plate mesoderm. Defects were due to failure of LRO specification, morphogenesis, and, consequently, absence of leftward flow. Polycystin-2 synergizes with the unconventional nodal-type signaling molecule Xnr3 to induce the LRO precursor tissue before gastrulation, upstream of symmetry breakage. Our data uncover an unknown function of pkd2 in LR axis formation, which we propose represents an ancient role of Polycystin-2 during LRO induction in lower vertebrates.","3943":"Plant adaptation in variable soil nitrate concentrations involves sophisticated signaling and transport systems that modulate a variety of physiological and developmental responses. However, we know very little about their molecular mechanisms. It has recently been reported that many of these responses are regulated by a transceptor NRT1.1, a transporter cum receptor of nitrate signaling. NRT1.1 displays dual-affinity modes of nitrate binding and establishes phosphorylated\/non-phosphorylated states at the amino acid residue threonine 101 in response to fluctuating nitrate concentrations. Here we report that intrinsic structural asymmetries between the protomers of the homodimer NRT1.1 provide a functional basis for having dual-affinity modes of nitrate binding and play a pivotal role for the phosphorylation switch. Nitrate-triggered local conformational changes facilitate allosteric communications between the nitrate binding and the phosphorylation site in one protomer, but such communications are impeded in the other. Structural analysis therefore suggests the functional relevance of NRT1.1 interprotomer asymmetries.","3944":null,"3945":"Virtually all diseases affect multiple organs. However, our knowledge of the body-wide effects remains limited. Here, we report the body-wide transcriptome landscape across 13-23 organs of mouse models of myocardial infarction, diabetes, kidney diseases, cancer, and pre-mature aging. Using such datasets, we find (1) differential gene expression in diverse organs across all models; (2) skin as a disease-sensor organ represented by disease-specific activities of putative gene-expression network; (3) a bone-skin cross talk mediated by a bone-derived hormone, FGF23, in response to dysregulated phosphate homeostasis, a known risk-factor for kidney diseases; (4) candidates for the signature activities of many more putative inter-organ cross talk for diseases; and (5) a cross-species map illustrating organ-to-organ and model-to-disease relationships between human and mouse. These findings demonstrate the usefulness and the potential of such body-wide datasets encompassing mouse models of diverse disease types as a resource in biological and medical sciences. Furthermore, the findings described herein could be exploited for designing disease diagnosis and treatment.","3946":"There is considerable interest in improving the performance of organic optoelectronic devices through processing techniques. Here, we study the effect of high-temperature annealing on the properties of the semiconducting polymer PTB7 and PTB7:fullerene blends, of interest as efficient organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. Annealing to moderate temperature improves the PTB7 morphology and optoelectronic properties. High-temperature annealing also improves morphology but results in poorer optoelectronic properties. This is a result of side chain cleavage that creates by-products that act as trap states, increasing electronic disorder and decreasing mobility. We further observe changes to the PTB7 chemical structure after thermal cleavage that are similar to those following solar irradiation. This implies that side chain cleavage is an important mechanism in device photodegradation, which is a major \"burn-in\" loss mechanism in OPV. These results lend insight into side chain cleavage as a method of improving optoelectronic properties and suggest strategies for improvement in device photostability.","3947":"Of the ?4,400 genes that constitute Escherichia coli's genome, ?300 genes are indispensable for its growth in nutrient-rich conditions. These encode housekeeping functions, including cell wall, DNA, RNA, and protein syntheses. Under conditions in which nutrients are limited to a carbon source, nitrogen source, essential phosphates, and salts, more than 100 additional genes become essential. These largely code for the synthesis of amino acids, vitamins, and nucleobases. Although much is known about this collection of ?400 genes, their interactions under nutrient stress are uncharted. Using a chemical biology approach, we focused on 45 chemical probes targeting encoded proteins in this collection and mapped their interactions under nutrient-limited conditions. Encompassing 990 unique pairwise chemical combinations, we revealed a highly connected network of 186 interactions, of which 81 were synergistic and 105 were antagonistic.

They act on single-stranded DNA and catalyze the synthesis of short RNA primers used by DNA polymerases. Here, we investigate the DNA binding and activity of the bacteriophage T7 primase using a new workflow called high-throughput primase profiling (HTPP). Using a unique combination of high-throughput binding assays and biochemical analyses, HTPP reveals a complex landscape of binding specificity and functional activity for the T7 primase, determined by sequences flanking the primase recognition site. We identified specific features, such as G\/T-rich flanks, which increase primase-DNA binding up to 10-fold and, surprisingly, also increase the length of newly formed RNA (up to 3-fold). To our knowledge, variability in primer length has not been reported for this primase. We expect that applying HTPP to additional enzymes will reveal new insights into the effects of DNA sequence composition on the DNA recognition and functional activity of primases.","3951":null,"3952":"","3953":"","3954":"Organocatalytic domino processes have become a rapidly growing area of research.

Here, we describe the potential role of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) in promoting CSFV replication via virus-induced hypophosphorylation of the Akt\/mTORC1\/S6 pathway, especially at an early stage of viral infection. Conversely, activation of mTORC1 inhibited the replication of CSFV. Furthermore, we revealed the underlying mechanisms of mTORC1 pathway in mediating CSFV replication; in addition, our data also showed that CSFV-induced transient inhibition of mTORC1 elicited a negative feedback activation of PI3K\/Akt\/mTORC1pathway, likely contributing to maintain the dynamic balance between viral replication and host cell survival. This study has provided strong evidence showing how CSFV utilizes mTORC1 pathway for viral replication at an early stage in the viral replicative cycle and how the mTORC1 rescues itself by eliciting a feedback loop to limit viral replication and maintain cell survival.","3956":"","3957":null,"3958":"Alkaline zinc-iron flow battery is a promising technology for electrochemical energy storage.

Herein, we put forth a sustainable and cost-effective way to repurpose a commonly used food waste for solar steam generation, an important part of water desalination. Making use of moldy bread, a new route for steam generation is demonstrated. The moldy bread was converted into a solar absorber by a simple and cost-effective carbonization process mimicking outdoor barbeque cooking. Carbonizing food waste to facilitate better absorption of sunlight for effective evaporation of water is an unprecedented concept in this field. Interestingly, the carbonized bread repurposed from the food waste served as an effective solar steam generator with an efficiency as high as 71.4% under 1 sun illumination. The structural and thermal absorption properties of the carbonized bread facilitated efficient solar energy absorption, heat management, and water transpiration in the system.","3960":null,"3961":"Adhesion G-protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) play critical roles in diverse cellular processes in neurobiology, development, immunity, and numerous diseases.

Latrophilin-1\/ADGRL1 is a model aGPCR that regulates synapse formation and embryogenesis, and its mutations are associated with cancer and attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. Here, we established functional assays to monitor latrophilin-1 function and showed the activation of latrophilin-1 by its endogenous agonist peptide. Via a comprehensive mutagenesis screen, we identified transmembrane domain residues essential for latrophilin-1 basal activity and for agonist peptide response. Strikingly, a cancer-associated mutation exhibited increased basal activity and failed to rescue the embryonic developmental phenotype in transgenic worms.

This report presents a rare case of a porous MOF retaining structural integrity under basic conditions, and an even rarer case of a porous cationic MOF. The features of stability and porosity in this ionic MOF have been harnessed for the function of charge- and size-selective capture of small organic dye through ion-exchange process across a wide pH range.","3967":null,"3968":null,"3969":null,"3970":"Transition metal oxides\/carbon (TMOs\/C) composites are important for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), but the development of interface-stable TMOs\/C composite anodes for robust lithium storage is still a challenge. Herein, mesoporous TiO2\/TiC@C composite membranes were synthesized by an in situ carbothermic reduction method. TiC nanodots with high conductivity and electrochemical inactivity at the TiO2-C interface can significantly enhance the electrical conductivity and structural stability of the membranes. Finite element simulations demonstrate that the TiO2\/TiC@C membranes can effectively alleviate tensile and compression stress effects upon lithiation, which is beneficial for robust lithium storage. When used as additives and binder-free electrodes, the TiO2\/TiC@C membranes show excellent cycling capability and rate performance. Moreover, a flexible full battery can be assembled by employing the TiO2\/TiC@C membranes and shows good performance, highlighting the potential of these membranes in flexible electronics. This work opens an avenue to constructing interface-stable composite structures for the next-generation high-performance LIBs.","3971":null,"3972":"Non-lithium energy storage devices, especially sodium ion batteries, are drawing attention due to insufficient and uneven distribution of lithium resources. Prussian blue and its analogs (Prussian blue analogs [PBAs]), or hexacyanoferrates, are well-known since the 18th century and have been used for hydrogen storage, cancer therapy, biosensing, seawater desalination, and sewage treatment. Owing to their unique features, PBAs are receiving increasing interest in the field of energy storage, such as their high theoretical specific capacity, ease of synthesis, as well as low cost. In this review, a general summary and evaluation of the applications of PBAs for rechargeable batteries are given. After a brief review of the history of PBAs, their crystal structure, nomenclature, synthesis, and working principle in rechargeable batteries are discussed. Then, previous works classified based on the combination of insertion cations and transition metals are analyzed comprehensively. The review includes an outlook toward the further development of PBAs in electrochemical energy storage.","3973":"Stochasticity affects accurate signal detection and robust generation of correct cell fates. Although many known regulatory mechanisms may reduce fluctuations in signals, most simultaneously influence their mean dynamics, leading to unfaithful cell fates. Through analysis and computation, we demonstrate that a reversible signaling mechanism acting through intermediate states can reduce noise while maintaining the mean. This mean-independent noise control (MINC) mechanism is investigated in the context of an intracellular binding protein that regulates retinoic acid (RA) signaling during zebrafish hindbrain development. By comparing our models with experimental data, we find that the MINC mechanism allows for sharp boundaries of gene expression without sacrificing boundary accuracy. In addition, this MINC mechanism can modulate noise to levels that we show are beneficial to spatial patterning through noise-induced cell fate switching. These results reveal a design principle that may be important for noise regulation in many systems that control cell fate determination.","3974":null,"3975":"The growing appetite of behavioral neuroscience for automated data production is prompting the need for new computational standards allowing improved interoperability, reproducibility, and shareability. We show here how these issues can be solved by repurposing existing genomic formats whose structure perfectly supports the handling of time series. This allows existing genomic analysis and visualization tools to be deployed onto behavioral data. As a proof of principle, we implemented the conversion procedure in Pergola, an open source software, and used genomics tools to reproduce results obtained in mouse, fly, and worm. We also show how common genomics techniques such as principal component analysis, hidden Markov modeling, and volcano plots can be deployed on the reformatted behavioral data. These analyses are easy to share because they depend on the scripting of public software. They are also easy to reproduce thanks to their integration within Nextflow, a workflow manager using containerized software.","3976":"Intestinal barrier dysfunction is an evolutionarily conserved hallmark of aging, which has been linked to microbial dysbiosis, altered expression of occluding junction proteins, and impending mortality. However, the interplay between intestinal junction proteins, age-onset dysbiosis, and lifespan determination remains unclear. Here, we show that altered expression of Snakeskin (Ssk), a septate junction-specific protein, can modulate intestinal homeostasis, microbial dynamics, immune activity, and lifespan in Drosophila. Loss of Ssk leads to rapid and reversible intestinal barrier dysfunction, altered gut morphology, dysbiosis, and dramatically reduced lifespan. Remarkably, restoration of Ssk expression in flies showing intestinal barrier dysfunction rescues each of these phenotypes previously linked to aging. Intestinal up-regulation of Ssk protects against microbial translocation following oral infection with pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, intestinal up-regulation of Ssk improves intestinal barrier function during aging, limits dysbiosis, and extends lifespan. Our findings indicate that intestinal occluding junctions may represent prolongevity targets in mammals.","3977":null,"3978":"The provenance of several components of major uniquely eukaryotic molecular machines are increasingly being traced back to prokaryotic biological conflict systems. Here, we demonstrate that the N-terminal single-stranded DNA-binding domain from the anti-restriction protein ArdC, deployed by bacterial mobile elements against their host, was independently acquired twice by eukaryotes, giving rise to the DNA-binding domains of XPC\/Rad4 and the Tc-38-like proteins in the stem kinetoplastid. In both instances, the ArdC-N domain tandemly duplicated forming an extensive DNA-binding interface. In XPC\/Rad4, the ArdC-N domains (BHDs) also fused to the inactive transglutaminase domain of a peptide-N-glycanase ultimately derived from an archaeal conflict system. Alongside, we delineate several parallel acquisitions from conjugative elements\/bacteriophages that gave rise to key components of the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) replication apparatus. These findings resolve two outstanding questions in eukaryote biology: (1) the origin of the unique DNA lesion-recognition component of NER and (2) origin of the unusual, plasmid-like features of kDNA.","3979":null,"3980":null,"3981":null,"3982":null,"3983":null,"3984":"The p53 tumor suppressor pathway is frequently inactivated in human cancers. However, there are some cancer types without commonly recognized alterations in p53 signaling. Here we report that histone demethylase KDM5A is involved in the regulation of p53 activity. KDM5A is significantly amplified in multiple types of cancers, an event that tends to be mutually exclusive to p53 mutation. We show that KDM5A acts as a negative regulator of p53 signaling through inhibition of p53 translation via suppression of a subgroup of eukaryotic translation initiation genes. Genetic deletion of KDM5A results in upregulation of p53 in multiple lineages of cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in a p53-dependent manner. In addition, we have identified a regulatory loop between p53, miR-34, and KDM5A, whereby the induction of miR-34 leads to suppression of KDM5A. Thus, our findings reveal a mechanism by which KDM5A inhibits p53 translation to modulate cancer progression.","3985":null,"3986":"High-grade gliomas (HGGs) are the most aggressive and invasive primary brain tumors. The platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling pathway drives HGG progression, and enhanced expression of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) is a well-established aberration in a subset of glioblastomas (GBMs). PDGFRA is expressed in glioma cells, whereas PDGFRB is mostly restricted to the glioma-associated stroma. Here we show that the spatial location of TAMMs correlates with the expansion of a subset of tumor cells that have acquired expression of PDGFRB in both mouse and human low-grade glioma and HCGs. Furthermore, M2-polarized microglia but not bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages (BMDMs) induced PDGFRB expression in glioma cells and stimulated their migratory capacity. These findings illustrate a heterotypic cross-talk between microglia and glioma cells that may enhance the migratory and invasive capacity of the latter by inducing PDGFRB.","3987":null,"3988":"The extraction of temporal information from sensory input streams is of paramount importance in the auditory system. In this study, amplitude-modulated sounds were used as stimuli to drive auditory cortex (AC) neurons of the bat species Carollia perspicillata, to assess the interactions between cortical spikes and local-field potentials (LFPs) for the processing of temporal acoustic cues. We observed that neurons in the AC capable of eliciting synchronized spiking to periodic acoustic envelopes were significantly more coherent to theta- and alpha-band LFPs than their non-synchronized counterparts. These differences occurred independently of the modulation rate tested and could not be explained by power or phase modulations of the field potentials. We argue that the coupling between neuronal spiking and the phase of low-frequency LFPs might be important for orchestrating the coding of temporal acoustic structures in the AC.","3989":null,"3990":"Genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP) proteins have been reported for imaging cardiac cell activity based on intracellular calcium transients. To bring human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (CMs) to the clinic, it is critical to evaluate the functionality of CMs. Here, we show that GCaMP6s-expressing hPSCs can be generated and used for CM characterization. By leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tools, we generated a knockin cell line that constitutively expresses GCaMP6s, an ultrasensitive calcium sensor protein. We further showed that this clone maintained pluripotency and cardiac differentiation potential. These knockin hPSC-derived CMs exhibited sensitive fluorescence fluctuation with spontaneous contraction. We then compared the fluorescence signal with mechanical contraction signal. The knockin hPSC-derived CMs also showed sensitive response to isoprenaline treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, the GCaMP6s knockin hPSC line provides a non-invasive, sensitive, and economic approach to characterize the functionality of hPSC-derived CMs.","3991":null,"3992":"Although the brain accounts for only 2% of the total body mass, it consumes the most energy. Neuronal metabolism is tightly controlled, but it remains poorly understood how neurons meet their energy demands to sustain synaptic transmission. Here we provide evidence that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is pivotal to sustain neuronal energy levels upon synaptic activation by adapting the rate of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, this metabolic plasticity is required for the expression of immediate-early genes, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation. Important in this context, in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, dysregulation of AMPK impairs the metabolic response to synaptic activation and processes that are central to neuronal plasticity. Altogether, our data provide proof of concept that AMPK is an essential player in the regulation of neuroenergetic metabolic plasticity induced in response to synaptic activation and that its deregulation might lead to cognitive impairments.","3993":"","3994":null,"3995":"GPRC5B recruitment of Src family kinases has been implicated in diet-induced insulin resistance. However, the mechanism of this action is not fully understood. Here, we report that GPRC5B-mediated phosphorylation of sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) by Fyn is a crucial step in the development of insulin resistance. Lipid-induced metabolic stress augments SMS2 phosphorylation by facilitating the interaction of GPRC5B and SMS2. SMS2 phosphorylation reduces its ubiquitination, and consequently increases SMS2 protein abundance. Although ceramide and diacylglycerol (DAG) have been known to be central mediators of lipid-induced insulin resistance, the accumulation of these lipids fails to impair insulin signaling in SMS2 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Conversely, exogenous expression of a phosphomimetic SMS2 impairs insulin action in SMS2 knockout MEFs under metabolic stress conditions. We demonstrate that SMS2-generated DAG in sphingomyelin synthesis inhibits insulin signaling through JNK activation. Thus, GPRC5B links sphingolipid metabolism to diet-induced insulin resistance via SMS2-dependent DAG production.","3996":null,"3997":"We report that p73 is expressed in ovarian granulosa cells and that loss of p73 leads to attenuated follicle development, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation, resulting in decreased levels of circulating progesterone and defects in mammary gland branching. Ectopic progesterone in p73-deficient mice completely rescued the mammary branching and partially rescued the ovarian follicle development defects. Performing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on transcripts from murine wild-type and p73-deficient antral follicles, we discovered differentially expressed genes that regulate biological adhesion programs. Through modulation of p73 expression in murine granulosa cells and transformed cell lines, followed by RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, we discovered p73-dependent regulation of a gene set necessary for cell adhesion and migration and components of the focimatrix (focal intra-epithelial matrix), a basal lamina between granulosa cells that promotes follicle maturation. In summary, p73 is essential for ovarian folliculogenesis and functions as a key regulator of a gene network involved in cell-to-cell adhesion and migration.","3998":"Centrioles, the cores of centrosomes and cilia, duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful inheritance. How only a single procentriole is produced on each mother centriole remains enigmatic. We propose the first mechanistic biophysical model for procentriole initiation which posits that interactions between kinase PLK4 and its activator-substrate STIL are central for procentriole initiation. The model recapitulates the transition from a uniform \"ring\" of PLK4 surrounding the mother centriole to a single PLK4 \"spot\" that initiates procentriole assembly. This symmetry breaking requires autocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4 by phosphorylated STIL. We find that in situ degradation of active PLK4 cannot break symmetry. The model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for PLK4-STIL complexes destabilizes the PLK4 ring and produces instead a single PLK4 spot. Weakening of competition by overexpression of PLK4 and STIL causes progressive addition of supernumerary procentrioles, as observed experimentally.","3999":null,"4000":null,"4001":"Constructing a functioning nervous system requires the precise orchestration of a vast array of mechanical, molecular, and neural-activity-dependent cues.

In this communication, we developed an interesting nickel-catalyzed carbonylative synthesis of functionalized alkyl iodides from aryl iodides and ethers. With Mo(CO)6 as the solid CO source, both cyclic and acyclic ethers were activated, which is also a challenging topic in organic synthesis. Functionalized alkyl iodides were prepared in moderate to excellent yields with outstanding functional group tolerance. Besides the high value of the obtained products, all the atoms from the starting materials were incorporated in the final products and the reaction had high atom efficiency as well.","4003":"Information is encoded in neural networks through changes in synaptic weights. Synaptic learning rules involve a combination of rapid Hebbian plasticity and slower homeostatic synaptic plasticity that regulates neuronal activity through global synaptic scaling. Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity have been extensively investigated, whereas much less is known about their interaction. Here we investigated structural and functional consequences of homeostatic plasticity at dendritic spines of mouse hippocampal neurons. We found that prolonged activity blockade induced spine growth, paralleling synaptic strength increases. Following activity blockade, glutamate uncaging-mediated stimulation at single spines led to size-dependent structural potentiation: smaller spines underwent robust growth, whereas larger spines remained unchanged. Moreover, spines near the stimulated spine exhibited volume changes following homeostatic plasticity, indicating that there was a breakdown of input specificity following homeostatic plasticity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity interact to shape neural connectivity through non-uniform structural plasticity at inputs.","4004":null,"4005":null,"4006":"Plants experience light intensity over several orders of magnitude. High light is stressful, and plants have several protective feedback mechanisms against this stress. Here we asked how plants respond to sudden rises at low ambient light, far below stressful levels. For this, we studied the fluorescence of excited chlorophyll a of photosystem II in Arabidopsis thaliana plants in response to step increases in light level at different background illuminations. We found a response at low-medium light with characteristics of a sensory system: fold-change detection (FCD), Weber law, and exact adaptation, in which the response depends only on relative, and not absolute, light changes. We tested various FCD circuits and provide evidence for an incoherent feedforward mechanism upstream of known stress response feedback loops. These findings suggest that plant photosynthesis may have a sensory modality for low light background that responds early to small light increases, to prepare for damaging high light levels.","4007":null,"4008":null,"4009":"In response to stress, cancer cells generate nutrients and energy through a cellular recycling process called autophagy, which can promote survival and tumor progression. Accordingly, autophagy inhibition has emerged as a potential cancer treatment strategy. Inhibitors targeting ULK1, an essential and early autophagy regulator, have provided proof of concept for targeting this kinase to inhibit autophagy; however, these are limited individually in their potency, selectivity, or cellular activity. In this study, we report two small molecule ULK1 inhibitors, ULK-100 and ULK-101, and establish superior potency and selectivity over a noteworthy published inhibitor. Moreover, we show that ULK-101 suppresses autophagy induction and autophagic flux in response to different stimuli. Finally, we use ULK-101 to demonstrate that ULK1 inhibition sensitizes KRAS mutant lung cancer cells to nutrient stress. ULK-101 represents a powerful molecular tool to study the role of autophagy in cancer cells and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibition.","4010":null,"4011":null,"4012":"Protein kinases constitute a large class of signaling molecules frequently targeted in research and clinical uses. However, kinase inhibitors are notoriously non-specific, making it difficult to select an appropriate inhibitor for a given kinase.

Here, we present KInhibition (https:\/\/kinhibition.fredhutch.org), an online portal that allows users to search publicly available datasets to find selective inhibitors for a chosen kinase or group of kinases. Compounds are sorted by a KInhibition Selectivity Score, calculated based on compounds' activity against the selected kinase(s) versus activity against all other kinases for which that compound has been profiled. The current version allows users to query four datasets, with a framework that can easily accommodate additional datasets. KInhibition represents a powerful platform through which researchers from broad areas of biology, chemistry, and pharmacology can easily interrogate large datasets to help guide their selection of kinase inhibitors.","4013":"The anti-digestive features given to hydrogels can prolong their action time in gut environment; however, these types of hydrogels have rarely been reported. Inspired by indigestibility of dietary fibers, we introduced an injectable covalent hydrogel through photopolymerization of glycidyl methacrylate-modified xanthan. This newly synthesized hydrogel exhibited a specific concentration-dependent porosity, swelling ratio, and stiffness. The intestinal epithelial cells-6 could grow on the surface of the stiffer hydrogel, and achieved their gut barrier functions. A simulated gut microfluidic chip was manufactured to demonstrate the hydrogel's good performance of anti-digestion compared with the current product, fibrin sealant. Furthermore, calcium ions could induce the swelling-shrinking behavior of the hydrogel, which assisted in removing the hydrogels at the proper time so as to avoid the mismatch of hydrogel degradation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, this hydrogel is expected to be an outstanding gut repair material, especially for closing gastrointestinal fistula.","4014":"Colonies of the red harvester ant (Pogonomyrmex barbatus) differ in how they regulate collective foraging activity in response to changes in humidity. We used transcriptomic, physiological, and pharmacological experiments to investigate the molecular basis of this ecologically important variation in collective behavior among colonies. RNA sequencing of forager brain tissue showed an association between colony foraging activity and differential expression of transcripts related to biogenic amine and neurohormonal metabolism and signaling. In field experiments, pharmacological increases in forager brain dopamine titer caused significant increases in foraging activity. Colonies that were naturally most sensitive to humidity were significantly more responsive to the stimulatory effect of exogenous dopamine. In addition, forager brain tissue significantly varied among colonies in biogenic amine content. Neurophysiological variation among colonies associated with individual forager sensitivity to humidity may reflect the heritable molecular variation on which natural selection acts to shape the collective regulation of foraging.","4015":null,"4016":"The development of optical methods to activate neurons with single-cell resolution has enabled systematic mapping of inhibitory connections. In contrast, optical mapping of excitatory connections between pyramidal neurons (PCs) has been a major challenge due to their high densities in cortical tissue and their weak and stochastic connectivity. Here we present an optogenetic two-photon mapping method in mouse neocortical slices by activating PCs with the red-shifted opsin C1V1 while recording postsynaptic responses in whole-cell configuration. Comparison of delays from triggered action potentials (APs) with those from synaptic inputs allowed us to predict connected PCs in three dimensions. We confirmed these predictions with paired recordings, and used this method to map strong connections among large populations of layer 2\/3 PCs. Our method can be used for fast, systematic mapping of synaptic connectivity and weights.","4017":"Single-cell-level experimentation can elucidate key biological insights about cellular aging that are masked in population-level studies. However, the extensive time requirement of tracking single cells has historically prevented their long-term longitudinal observation. Using a microfluidic device that automates microscopic monitoring of diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells throughout their replicative lifespan, here we report the fundamental characteristics of single-cell aging for diploid yeast. We find that proteins with short versus long half-lives exhibit distinct dynamics as cells age and that the intercellular gene expression noise increases during aging, whereas the intracellular noise stays unchanged. A stochastic model provides quantitative mechanistic insights into the observed noise dynamics and sheds light on the age-dependent intracellular noise differences between diploid and haploid yeast. Our work elucidates how a set of canonical phenotypes dynamically change while the host cells are aging in real time, providing essential insights for a comprehensive understanding on and control of lifespan at the single-cell level.","4018":null,"4019":null,"4020":null,"4021":"Biological systems often respond to a specific environmental or genetic perturbation without pervasive gene expression changes.

The new metric directly emphasizes the genes exhibiting the greatest changes in expression in response to a perturbation. Using the new framework to systematically compare 3,332 chemical and 3,934 genetic perturbations across 10 cell types representing diverse cellular signatures, we identified thousands of recurrent and cell type-specific connections. We also experimentally validated two drugs identified by the analysis as potential topoisomerase inhibitors.

Analysis of transcriptome of single cells revealed similar expression of core pluripotency genes, as well as genes associated with naive and primed states of pluripotency. Analysis of individual cells from four samples consisting of two different iPSC lines each grown in the two culture media revealed a shared subpopulation structure with three main subpopulations different in pluripotency states. By implementing a machine learning approach, we estimated that most cells within each subpopulation are very similar between all four samples.

The k-spectrum model can capture DNA motif patterns from protein sequences at the resolution in which local sequence context and nucleotide dependency can be taken into account completely. Multiple evaluation metrics are adopted and measured on millions of k-mer binding intensities from 92 proteins across 5 DNA-binding families (i.e., bHLH, bZIP, ETS, Forkhead, and Homeodomain), demonstrating its competitive edges. In addition, it not only can contribute to DNA motif recognition modeling but also can help prioritize the observed or even unobserved binding of single nucleotide variants on transcription factor binding sites in a genome-wide manner.","4026":"A key question in vision research concerns how the brain compensates for self-induced eye and head movements to form the world-centered, spatiotopic representations we perceive. Although human V3A and V6 integrate eye movements with vision, it is unclear which areas integrate head motion signals with visual retinotopic representations, as fMRI typically prevents head movement executions. Here we examined whether human early visual cortex V3A and V6 integrate these signals. A previously introduced paradigm allowed participant head movement during trials, but stabilized the head during data acquisition utilizing the delay between blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and neural signals. Visual stimuli simulated either a stable environment or one with arbitrary head-coupled visual motion. Importantly, both conditions were matched in retinal and head motion. Contrasts revealed differential responses in human V6. Given the lack of vestibular responses in primate V6, these results suggest multi-modal integration of visual with neck efference copy signals or proprioception in V6.","4027":"Cell membrane is the first medium from where a cell senses and responds to external stress stimuli. Exploring the tension changes in cell membrane will help us to understand intracellular force transmission. Here, a biosensor (named MSS) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer is developed to visualize cell membrane tension. Validity of the biosensor is first verified for the detection of cell membrane tension. Results show a shear stress-induced heterogeneous distribution of membrane tension with the biosensor, which is strengthened by the disruption of microfilaments or enhancement of membrane fluidity, but weakened by the reduction of membrane fluidity or disruption of microtubules. These findings suggest that the MSS biosensor is a beneficial tool to visualize the changes and distribution of cell membrane tension. Besides, cell membrane tension does not display obvious polar distribution, indicating that cellular polarity changes do not first occur on the cell membrane during mechanical transmission.","4028":"We developed the Rainbow-seq technology to trace cell division history and reveal single-cell transcriptomes. With distinct fluorescent protein genes as lineage markers, Rainbow-seq enables each single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiment to simultaneously decode the lineage marker genes and read single-cell transcriptomes. We triggered lineage tracking in each blastomere at the 2-cell stage, observed microscopically inequivalent contributions of the progeny to the two embryonic poles at the blastocyst stage, and analyzed every single cell at either 4- or 8-cell stage with deep paired-end sequencing of full-length transcripts. Although lineage difference was not marked unequivocally at a single-gene level, it became clear when the transcriptome was analyzed as a whole. Moreover, several groups of novel transcript isoforms with embedded repeat sequences exhibited lineage difference, suggesting a possible link between DNA demethylation and cell fate decision. Rainbow-seq bridged a critical gap between division history and single-cell RNA-seq assays.","4029":"Aging is a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality, but efforts to slow or reverse its effects are hampered by an incomplete understanding of its multi-faceted origins.

To determine the mechanisms coordinating stepwise malignancy, we quantified the changes in messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein abundance. During immortalization, we found dramatic changes in mRNA, consistent with EMT, which correlated with protein abundance. Many of these same proteins also changed following Ras transformation, suggesting that pre-malignant cells were primed for malignant conversion. Unexpectedly, changes in protein abundance did not correlate with changes in mRNA following transformation. Importantly, proteins involved in cellular adhesion and cytoskeletal structure decreased during immortalization and decreased further following Ras transformation, whereas their encoding mRNAs only changed during the immortalization step. Thus, Ras induced EMT-associated invasion via post-transcriptional mechanisms in primed pre-malignant cells.","4038":null,"4039":null,"4040":"Although stable intronic sequence RNAs (sisRNAs) are conserved in plants and animals, their functional significance is still unclear.

We further show this is accompanied by transcriptomic up-regulation. De novo epigenetic regulators (e.g., DNMT3A) are strongly correlated with PD-L1 expression and methylome status. Accordingly, decitabine-mediated inhibition of global methylation in melanoma cells leads to increased PD-L1 expression. Moreover, viral mimicry and immune response genes are highly expressed in lymphocyte-negative plus PD-L1-positive melanomas, versus PD-L1-negative melanomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In summary, using integrated genomic analysis we identified that global DNA methylation influences PD-L1 expression in melanoma, and hence melanoma's ability to evade anti-tumor immune responses. These results have implications for combining epigenetic therapy with immunotherapy.","4045":null,"4046":null,"4047":"Network structures describing regulation between biomolecules have been determined in many biological systems. Dynamics of molecular activities based on such networks are considered to be the origin of many biological functions.

Here, we applied this theory to a gene regulatory network for the cell fate specification of seven tissues in the ascidian embryo and found that this network, which consisted of 92 factors, had five key molecules. By controlling the activities of these key molecules, the specific gene expression of six of seven tissues observed in the embryo was successfully reproduced. Since this method is applicable to all nonlinear dynamic systems, we propose this method as a tool for controlling gene regulatory networks and reprogramming cell fates.","4048":"Although animal vocalizations and human speech are known to communicate physical formidability, no previous study has examined whether human listeners can assess the strength or body size of vocalizers relative to their own, either from speech or from nonverbal vocalizations. Here, although men tended to underestimate women's formidability, and women to overestimate men's, listeners judged relative strength and height from aggressive roars and aggressive speech accurately. For example, when judging roars, male listeners accurately identified vocalizers who were substantially stronger than themselves in 88% of trials, and never as weaker. For male vocalizers only, roars functioned to exaggerate the expression of threat compared to aggressive speech, as men were rated as relatively stronger when producing roars. These results indicate that, like other mammals, the acoustic structure of human aggressive vocal signals (and in particular roars) may have been selected to communicate functional information relevant to listeners' survival.","4049":null,"4050":"In Drosophila, microbial association can promote development or extend life. We tested the impact of microbial association during malnutrition and show that microbial quantity is a predictor of fly longevity.

Microbes, dead or alive, phenocopy dietary protein, and the calculated dependence on microbial protein content is similar to the protein requirements determined from fly feeding studies, suggesting that microbes enhance host protein nutrition by serving as protein-rich food. Microbes that enhance larval growth are also associated with the ability to better thrive on fly culture medium.

We showed that organ-specific ECs have distinct expression patterns of gene clusters, which support their specific organ development and functions. These ECs displayed distinct barrier properties, angiogenic potential, and metabolic rate and support specific organ functions. Our findings showed the link between human EC heterogeneity and organ development and can be exploited therapeutically to contribute in organ regeneration, disease modeling, as well as guiding differentiation of tissue-specific ECs from human pluripotent stem cells.","4054":null,"4055":"Rod-shaped bacteria typically grow first via sporadic and dispersed elongation along their lateral walls and then via a combination of zonal elongation and constriction at the division site to form the poles of daughter cells. Although constriction comprises up to half of the cell cycle, its impact on cell size control and homeostasis has rarely been considered. To reveal the roles of cell elongation and constriction in bacterial size regulation during cell division, we captured the shape dynamics of Caulobacter crescentus with time-lapse structured illumination microscopy and used molecular markers as cell-cycle landmarks. We perturbed the constriction rate using a hyperconstriction mutant or fosfomycin ([(2R,3S)-3-methyloxiran-2-yl]phosphonic acid) inhibition. We report that the constriction rate contributes to both size control and homeostasis, by determining elongation during constriction and by compensating for variation in pre-constriction elongation on a single-cell basis.","4056":null,"4057":null,"4058":null,"4059":"The rigidity of the cell environment can vary tremendously between tissues and in pathological conditions. How this property may affect intracellular membrane dynamics is still largely unknown. Here, using atomic force microscopy, we show that cells deficient in the secretory lysosome v-SNARE VAMP7 are impaired in adaptation to substrate rigidity. Conversely, VAMP7-mediated secretion is stimulated by more rigid substrate and this regulation depends on the Longin domain of VAMP7. We further find that the Longin domain binds the kinase and retrograde trafficking adaptor LRRK1 and that LRRK1 negatively regulates VAMP7-mediated exocytosis. Conversely, VARP, a VAMP7- and kinesin 1-interacting protein, further controls the availability for secretion of peripheral VAMP7 vesicles and response of cells to mechanical constraints. LRRK1 and VARP interact with VAMP7 in a competitive manner. We propose a mechanism whereby biomechanical constraints regulate VAMP7-dependent lysosomal secretion via LRRK1 and VARP tug-of-war control of the peripheral pool of secretory lysosomes.","4060":"The abundance of basal progenitors (BPs), basal radial glia progenitors (bRGs) and basal intermediate progenitors (bIPs), in primate brain has been correlated to the high degree of cortical folding. Here we examined the role of BAF155, a subunit of the chromatin remodeling BAF complex, in generation of cortical progenitor heterogeneity. The conditional deletion of BAF155 led to diminished bIP pool and increased number of bRGs, due to delamination of apical RGs. We found that BAF155 is required for normal activity of neurogenic transcription factor PAX6, thus controlling the expression of genes that are involved in bIP specification, cell-cell interaction, and establishment of adherens junction. In a PAX6-dependent manner, BAF155 regulates the expression of the CDC42 effector protein CEP4, thereby controlling progenitor delamination. Furthermore, BAF155-dependent chromatin remodeling seems to exert a specific role in the genesis of BPs through the regulation of human RG-specific genes (such as Foxn4) that possibly acquired evolutionary significance.","4061":null,"4062":null,"4063":null,"4064":"Genotype-to-phenotype association studies typically use macroscopic physiological measurements or molecular readouts as quantitative traits. There are comparatively few suitable quantitative traits available between cell and tissue length scales, a limitation that hinders our ability to identify variants affecting phenotype at many clinically informative levels. Here we show that quantitative image features, automatically extracted from histopathological imaging data, can be used for image quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) mapping and variant discovery. Using thyroid pathology images, clinical metadata, and genomics data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we establish and validate a quantitative imaging biomarker for immune cell infiltration. A total of 100,215 variants were selected for iQTL profiling and tested for genotype-phenotype associations with our quantitative imaging biomarker. Significant associations were found in HDAC9 and TXNDC5. We validated the TXNDC5 association using GTEx cis-expression QTL data and an independent hypothyroidism dataset from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network.","4065":"The success of deep networks and recent industry involvement in brain-inspired computing is igniting a widespread interest in neuromorphic hardware that emulates the biological processes of the brain on an electronic substrate. This review explores interdisciplinary approaches anchored in machine learning theory that enable the applicability of neuromorphic technologies to real-world, human-centric tasks. We find that (1) recent work in binary deep networks and approximate gradient descent learning are strikingly compatible with a neuromorphic substrate; (2) where real-time adaptability and autonomy are necessary, neuromorphic technologies can achieve significant advantages over main-stream ones; and (3) challenges in memory technologies, compounded by a tradition of bottom-up approaches in the field, block the road to major breakthroughs. We suggest that a neuromorphic learning framework, tuned specifically for the spatial and temporal constraints of the neuromorphic substrate, will help guiding hardware algorithm co-design and deploying neuromorphic hardware for proactive learning of real-world data.","4066":null,"4067":"Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have been intensively studied for applications such as gas storage, gas separation, catalysis, drug delivery, and more. Typically, the development of MOFs involves a post-synthetic solvent exchange process, which usually requires a significant investment of time, energy, labor, and resources. Herein, we propose a novel post-synthetic processing methodology for commercial and laboratory-scale MOFs called \"Suspension Processing.\" Suspension processing is a non-destructive, agitation-based technique that provides efficient solvent exchange, pore cleaning, and surface defect removal in MOFs. Suspension processing has shown the capability to significantly improve the surface area and gas uptake properties of microporous MOFs, including PCN-250, UiO-66, and HKUST-1. Suspension processing displays improved time, energy, and labor efficiency, as well as considerably enhanced product quality. These findings confirm suspension processing as a straightforward methodology with applicability as a universal technique for the production of high-quality microporous materials.","4068":"Circular RNAs constitute a unique class of RNAs whose precise functions remain to be elucidated. In particular, cancer-associated chromosomal translocations can give rise to fusion circular RNAs that play a role in leukemia progression. However, how and when fusion circular RNAs are formed and whether they are being selected in cancer cells remains unknown. Here, we used CRISPR\/Cas9 to generate physiological translocation models of NPM1-ALK fusion gene. We showed that, in addition to generating fusion proteins and activating specific oncogenic pathways, chromosomal translocation induced by CRISPR\/Cas9 led to the formation of de novo fusion circular RNAs. Specifically, we could recover different classes of circular RNAs composed of different circularization junctions, mainly back-spliced species. In addition, we identified fusion circular RNAs identical to those found in related patient tumor cells providing evidence that fusion circular RNAs arise early after chromosomal formation and are not just a consequence of the oncogenesis process.","4069":"Chronic jet lag, a model of shiftwork, increases mortality in aged mice. One potential reason for this association is that the chronic desynchronization between the internal clock phase and the environmental light\/dark (LD) cycle might increase the mortality rate. However, this hypothesis has not been examined because of the lack of an appropriate animal model to prove this speculation. Here, we found that rapidly entrainable vasopressin receptor V1a-\/-V1b-\/- mice showed lower mortality under a chronic jet lag condition. Moreover, we found that pharmacological inactivation of V1a and V1b signaling decreased mortality even in aged wild-type mice, thus providing a potential pharmaceutical intervention for shiftwork-related health problems.","4070":null,"4071":null,"4072":null,"4073":"Mitochondrial diseases produce profound neurological dysfunction via mutations affecting mitochondrial energy production, including the relatively common Leigh syndrome (LS). We recently described an LS case caused by a pathogenic mutation in USMG5, encoding a small supernumerary subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase. This protein is integral for ATP synthase dimerization, and patient fibroblasts revealed an almost total loss of ATP synthase dimers. Here, we utilize in situ cryoelectron tomography (cryo-ET) in a clinical case-control study of mitochondrial disease to directly study mitochondria within cultured fibroblasts from a patient with LS and a healthy human control subject. Through tomographic analysis of patient and control mitochondria, we find that loss of ATP synthase dimerization due to the pathogenic mutation causes profound disturbances of mitochondrial crista ultrastructure. Overall, this work supports the crucial role of ATP synthase in regulating crista architecture in the context of human disease.","4074":"Type I interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) expression requires interaction between a transcription factor complex, ISGF3, and target gene promoters to initiate transcription and protection against infection. To uncover chromatin regulatory features of this antiviral immune response, IFN-induced nucleosome and histone dynamics of human ISG loci were examined. ISGF3 recruitment after IFN stimulation was accompanied by nucleosome reorganization at promoters and gene bodies. IFN stimulation induced loss of core histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as H2A.Z at ISG promoters. A strong correlation was found between H2A.Z occupancy and ISGF3 target sites, and IFN-stimulated H2A.Z removal requires STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9. Neither INO80 nor SWI\/SNF participate in IFN-driven H2A.Z eviction, but GCN5 and BRD2 are required. Interference with H2A.Z expression enhanced ISGF3 recruitment to ISG promoters, ISG mRNA expression, and IFN-stimulated antiviral immunity. This indicates that H2A.Z nucleosomes at ISG promoters restrict optimal ISGF3 engagement and modulate the biological response to IFN.","4075":null,"4076":null,"4077":null,"4078":"Many works have highlighted enhanced auditory processing in blind individuals, suggesting that they compensate for lack of vision with greater sensitivity of the other senses. Few years ago, we demonstrated severely impaired auditory precision in congenitally blind individuals performing an auditory spatial metric task: their thresholds for bisecting three consecutive spatially distributed sounds were seriously compromised, ranging from three times typical thresholds to total randomness. Here, we show that the deficit disappears if blind individuals are presented with coherent temporal and spatial cues. More interestingly, when the audio information is presented in conflict for space and time, sighted individuals are unaffected by the perturbation, whereas blind individuals are strongly attracted by the temporal cue. These results highlight that temporal cues influence space estimations in blind participants, suggesting for the first time that blind individuals use temporal information to infer spatial environmental coordinates.","4079":null,"4080":"The master circadian pacemaker in mammals resides in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and is synchronized to ambient light\/dark cycles (i.e., photoentrainment). Melanopsin (Opn4) and classical rod-cone photoreceptors are believed to provide all the photic input necessary for circadian photoentrainment. Although the UVA-sensitive photopigment Opn5 is known to be expressed in retinal ganglion cells, its physiological role remains unclear and a potential role for Opn5 in the photoentrainment of the master clock has not been addressed. Here we report impaired photoentrainment and phase shifting to UVA light in Opn5-null mice. However, triple-knockout mice lacking all known functional circadian photoreceptors (i.e., rods, cones, and melanopsin) failed to entrain to UVA-light\/dark cycles, despite the presence of Opn5, demonstrating that Opn5 alone is not sufficient for photoentrainment of the SCN clock. Since Opn5 is involved in the regulation of the retinal circadian clock, disrupted retinal function may cause impaired circadian photoentrainment in Opn5-null mice.","4081":null,"4082":null,"4083":"Inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have attracted great attention recently due to their potential for greater thermal stability compared with hybrid organic perovskites. However, the high processing temperature to convert from the non-perovskite phase to the cubic perovskite phase in many of these systems has limited their application in flexible optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a room temperature processed inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) based on CsPbI2Br as the light harvesting layer. By combining this composition with key precursor solvents, we show that inorganic perovskite films can be prepared by the vacuum-assist method under room temperature conditions in air. Unencapsulated devices achieved power conversion efficiency up to 8.67% when measured under 1-sun irradiation. Exploiting this room temperature process, flexible inorganic PSCs based on an inorganic metal halide perovskite material are demonstrated.","4084":"Redox-active metals are thought to be implicated in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To address this point, we measured the concentrations of 12 elements and, for the first time, the stable isotope compositions of copper (redox-active) and zinc (redox-inactive) in human cerebrospinal fluids of 31 patients with ALS, 11 age-matched controls (CTRL), and 14 patients with Alzheimer disease. We first show that metal concentrations weakly discriminate patients with ALS from the two other groups. We then report that zinc isotopic compositions are similar in the three groups, but that patients with ALS have significantly 65copper-enriched isotopic compositions relative to CTRL and patients with AD. This result unambiguously demonstrates that copper is implicated in ALS. We suggest that this copper isotopic signature may result from abnormal protein aggregation in the brain parenchyma, and propose that isotopic analysis is a potential tool that may help unraveling the molecular mechanisms at work in ALS.","4085":null,"4086":"Genome architecture has emerged as a critical element of transcriptional regulation, although its role in the control of cell identity is not well understood. Here we use transcription factor (TF)-mediated reprogramming to examine the interplay between genome architecture and transcriptional programs that transition cells into the myogenic identity. We recently developed new methods for evaluating the topological features of genome architecture based on network centrality. Through integrated analysis of these features of genome architecture and transcriptome dynamics during myogenic reprogramming of human fibroblasts we find that significant architectural reorganization precedes activation of a myogenic transcriptional program. This interplay sets the stage for a critical transition observed at several genomic scales reflecting definitive adoption of the myogenic phenotype. Subsequently, TFs within the myogenic transcriptional program participate in entrainment of biological rhythms. These findings reveal a role for topological features of genome architecture in the initiation of transcriptional programs during TF-mediated human cellular reprogramming.","4087":null,"4088":null,"4089":null,"4090":null,"4091":"Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) represent a promising energy storage technology, and they show potential for next-generation high-energy systems due to their high specific capacity, abundant constitutive resources, non-toxicity, low cost, and environment friendliness. Unlike their ubiquitous lithium-ion battery counterparts, the application of LSBs is challenged by several obstacles, including short cycling life, limited sulfur loading, and severe shuttling effect of polysulfides. To make LSBs a viable technology, it is very important to design and synthesize outstanding cathode materials with novel structures and properties. In this review, we summarize recent progress in designs, preparations, structures, and properties of cathode materials for LSBs, emphasizing binary, ternary, and quaternary sulfur-based composite materials. We especially highlight the utilization of carbons to construct sulfur-based composite materials in this exciting field. An extensive discussion of the emerging challenges and possible future research directions for cathode materials for LSBs is provided.","4092":null,"4093":null,"4094":null,"4095":"Neurons are highly dependent on mitochondria, but little is known about how they react to a local mitochondrial oxidative insult. We therefore developed a protocol in primary hippocampal cultures that combines the photosensitizer mito-KillerRed with fluorescent biosensors and photoactivatable GFP. We found in both the soma and dendrites that neurons restrict the local increase in mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species and the decrease in ATP production to the damaged compartment, by quarantining mitochondria. Although the cytosol of both the soma and dendrites became oxidized after mito-KillerRed activation, dendrites were more sensitive to the oxidative insult. Importantly, the impaired mitochondria exhibited decreased motility and fusion, thereby avoiding the spread of oxidation throughout the neuron. These results establish how neurons manage oxidative damage and increase our understanding about the somatodendritic regulation of mitochondrial functions after a local oxidative insult.","4096":null,"4097":"Cellular decision-making arises from the expression of genes along a regulatory cascade, which leads to a choice between distinct phenotypic states. DNA dosage variations, often introduced by replication, can significantly affect gene expression to ultimately bias decision outcomes. The bacteriophage lambda system has long served as a paradigm for cell-fate determination, yet the effect of DNA replication remains largely unknown. Here, through single-cell studies and mathematical modeling we show that DNA replication drastically boosts cI expression to allow lysogenic commitment by providing more templates. Conversely, expression of CII, the upstream regulator of cI, is surprisingly robust to DNA replication due to the negative autoregulation of the Cro repressor. Our study exemplifies how living organisms can not only utilize DNA replication for gene expression control but also implement mechanisms such as negative feedback to allow the expression of certain genes to be robust to dosage changes resulting from DNA replication.","4098":null,"4099":null,"4100":null,"4101":"Electrodeposition (ED) technology is a low-cost industrial candidate for solar cell fabrication. However, the practical aspects of controlling deposit morphology and composition have not been significantly addressed because of the complex co-plating variables that still need to be understood for multinary alloy ED. This work addresses these practical aspects on how to control composition and deposit morphology using co-electrodeposited kesterite alloy precursors as a case study. The alloy precursors co-plated under the optimized conditions from a mixed thiosulfate-sulfite electrolyte bath show uniform, smooth, and compact film morphology as well as uniform distribution of composition, well suited for efficient kesterite absorbers, finally delivering a Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin-film solar cell with 7.4% efficiency based on a configuration Mo\/CZTS\/CdS\/ZnO\/aluminum-doped ZnO.

Cuttlefish and octopuses also have a unique muscular hydrostat system in their skin. When this system is expressed, dermal bumps called papillae disrupt body shape and imitate the fine texture of surrounding objects, yet the control system is unknown. Here we report for papillae: (1) the motoneurons and the neurotransmitters that control activation and relaxation, (2) a physiologically fast expression and retraction system, and (3) a complex of smooth and striated muscles that enables long-term expression of papillae through sustained tension in the absence of neural input. The neural circuits controlling acute shape-shifting skin papillae in cuttlefish show homology to the iridescence circuits in squids. The sustained tension in papillary muscles for long-term camouflage utilizes muscle heterogeneity and points toward the existence of a \"catch-like\" mechanism that would reduce the necessary energy expenditure.","4107":"The spatiotemporal organization of chromatin plays central roles in cellular function. The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) chromatin undergoes dynamic structural changes during mitosis and stress. Here, we developed a CRISPR-based imaging system and tracked the condensation dynamics of rDNA chromatin in live yeast cells under glucose starvation. We found that acute glucose starvation triggers rapid condensation of rDNA. Time-lapse microscopy revealed two stages for rDNA condensation: a \"primary stage,\" when relaxed rDNA chromatin forms higher order loops or rings, and a \"secondary stage,\" wehen the rDNA rings further condense into compact clusters. Twisting of rDNA rings accompanies the secondary stage. The condensin complex, but not the cohesin complex, is required for efficient rDNA condensation in response to glucose starvation. Furthermore, we found that the DNA helicase Sgs1 is essential for the survival of cells expressing rDNA-bound dCas9, suggesting a role for helicases in facilitating DNA replication at dCas9-binding sites.","4108":"Sperm counts have rapidly declined in Western males over the past four decades. This rapid decline remains largely unexplained, but exposure to environmental toxicants provides one potential explanation for this decline. Flame retardants are highly prevalent and persistent in the environment, but many have not been assessed for their effects on human spermatogenesis. Using a human stem cell-based model of spermatogenesis, we evaluated two major flame retardants, hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), under acute conditions simulating occupational-level exposures. Here we show that HBCDD and TBBPA are human male reproductive toxicants in vitro. Although these toxicants do not specifically affect the survival of haploid spermatids, they affect spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes through mitochondrial membrane potential perturbation and reactive oxygen species generation, ultimately causing apoptosis. Taken together, these results show that HBCDD and TBBPA affect human spermatogenesis in vitro and potentially implicate this highly prevalent class of toxicants in the decline of Western males' sperm counts.","4109":null,"4110":"The symmetric tissue and body plans of animals are paradoxically constructed with asymmetric cells. To understand how the yin-yang duality of symmetry and asymmetry are reconciled, we asked whether apical polarity proteins orchestrate the development of the mirror-symmetric zebrafish neural tube by hierarchically modulating apical cell-cell adhesions. We found that apical polarity proteins localize by a pioneer-intermediate-terminal order. Pioneer proteins establish the mirror symmetry of the neural rod by initiating two distinct types of apical adhesions: the parallel apical adhesions (PAAs) cohere cells of parallel orientation and the novel opposing apical adhesions (OAAs) cohere cells of opposing orientation. Subsequently, the intermediate proteins selectively augment the PAAs when the OAAs dissolve by endocytosis. Finally, terminal proteins are required to inflate the neural tube by generating osmotic pressure. Our findings suggest a general mechanism to construct mirror-symmetric tissues: tissue symmetry can be established by organizing asymmetric cells opposingly via adhesions.","4111":"Succinylation is a post-translational protein acylation modification that converts the cationic lysine side chain to an anion with large potential impacts on protein structure and function. Here we characterize the epigenome-wide distribution of succinyllysine marks in chromatin using chromatin immuno-precipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). We estimate that more than one-third of all nucleosomes contain lysine succinylation marks and demonstrate a potential role of chromatin succinylation in modulating gene expression. We further demonstrate that defective tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolism perturbs the succinyllysine distribution in chromatin, correlating with transcriptional responses. This is consistent with previous observations linking nucleosome succinylation with enhanced in vitro transcription. We additionally demonstrate that defective TCA cycle metabolism results in a DNA repair defect and sensitivity to genotoxic agents, consistent with previously reported chromatin hypersuccinylation effects observed in the context of SIRT7 depletion. Chromatin succinylation may thus represent a mechanism by which metabolism modulates both genome-wide transcription and DNA repair activities.","4112":"CNS cortical histogenesis depends on polarity signaling pathways that regulate cell adhesion and motility. Here we report that conditional deletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 in cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) results in abnormalities in cerebellar foliation revealed by iDISCO clearing methodology, a loss of columnar organization of proliferating GCPs in the external germinal layer (EGL), disordered parallel fiber organization in the molecular layer (ML), and a failure to extend a leading process and form a neuron-glial junction during migration along Bergmann glia (BG). Notably, GCPs lacking Cdc42 had a multi-polar morphology and slowed migration rate. In addition, secondary defects occurred in BG development and organization, especially in the lateral cerebellar hemispheres. By phosphoproteomic analysis, affected Cdc42 targets included regulators of the cytoskeleton, cell adhesion and polarity. Thus, Cdc42 signaling pathways are critical regulators of GCP polarity and the formation of neuron-glial junctions during cerebellar development.","4113":null,"4114":"The chromatin remodeling factor SMARCAD1, an SWI\/SNF ATPase family member, has a role in 5' end resection at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to produce single-strand DNA (ssDNA), a critical step for subsequent checkpoint and repair factor loading to remove DNA damage. However, the mechanistic details of SMARCAD1 coupling to the DNA damage response and repair pathways remains unknown. Here we report that SMARCAD1 is recruited to DNA DSBs through an ATM-dependent process. Depletion of SMARCAD1 reduces ionizing radiation (IR)-induced repairosome foci formation and DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). IR induces SMARCAD1 phosphorylation at a conserved T906 by ATM kinase, a modification essential for SMARCAD1 recruitment to DSBs. Interestingly, T906 phosphorylation is also important for SMARCAD1 ubiquitination by RING1 at K905. Both these post-translational modifications are critical for regulating the role of SMARCAD1 in DNA end resection, HR-mediated repair, and cell survival after DNA damage.","4115":"Ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons play roles in reward and aversion. The VTA has, in addition to dopamine neurons, glutamatergic neurons expressing VGluT2. Here, by determining the firing patterns of VTA-VGluT2 neurons expressing channelrhodopsin 2, we identified a major subpopulation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons whose firing rates decreased or were unchanged during sucrose consumption and increased during facial airpuff presentation. We identified a small subpopulation of VTA-VGluT2 neurons whose firing rates increased in response to both rewarding and aversive stimuli. We also found that the changes in firing rate of some VTA-VGluT2 neurons were greater following reward delivery compared with reward omission, whereas others did not differ. We conclude that VTA-VGluT2 neurons are responsive to aversive stimuli, but subpopulations of VTA-VGluT2 neurons are differentially affected by sucrose reward. Reward-responsive subpopulations of VTA-VGluT2 neurons are also divided into those affected by reward expectation alone or the real-time delivery of reward.","4116":"In the clinical setting, analgesic tolerance is a primary driver of diminished pain control and opioid dose escalations. Integral to this process are primary afferent sensory neurons, the first-order components of nociceptive sensation. Here, we characterize the factors modulating morphine action and tolerance in mouse small diameter dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons. We demonstrate that acute morphine inactivates tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na+ channels in these cells. Chronic exposure resulted in tolerance to this effect, which was prevented by treatment with oral vancomycin. Using colonic supernatants, we further show that mediators in the gut microenvironment of mice with chronic morphine exposure can induce tolerance and hyperexcitability in naive DRG neurons. Tolerance (but not hyperexcitability) in this paradigm was mitigated by oral vancomycin treatment. These findings collectively suggest that gastrointestinal microbiota modulate the development of morphine tolerance (but not hyperexcitability) in nociceptive primary afferent neurons, through a mechanism involving TTX-R Na+ channels.","4117":null,"4118":null,"4119":"TUC338 is an ultraconserved long non-coding RNA that contributes to transformed cell growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genomic regions of TUC338 occupancy were enriched in unique or known binding motifs homologous to the tumor suppressors Pax6 and p53. Genes involved in cell proliferation were enriched within a 9-kb range of TUC338-binding sites. TUC338 RNA-based purification was used to isolate chromatin for mass spectrometry, and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 RNA-binding protein (PAI-RBP1) was identified as a TUC338 RNA-binding partner. The PAI-RBP1 target gene plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) itself could also be post-transcriptionally regulated by TUC338. Thus modulation of transformed cell growth by TUC338 may involve binding to PAI-RBP1 as well as to sequence-defined cis-binding sites to modulate gene expression. These findings suggest that ultraconserved RNAs such as TUC338 can function in a manner analogous to transcription factors to modulate cell proliferation and transformed cell growth in HCC.","4120":"Neurons store information and participate in memory engrams as a result of experience-dependent changes in synaptic weights and in membrane excitability. Here, we examine excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude and neuronal excitability in relation to these two mechanisms of plasticity. We analyze somato-dendritic double-patch recordings from cerebellar Purkinje cells while inducing intrinsic, SK2 channel-dependent plasticity or blocking SK channels with bath application of apamin. Both manipulations increase the build-up of EPSP amplitudes during an EPSP train and enhance the number of EPSP-evoked spikes, yielding insights into the mechanistic contribution of EPSP amplitude to single spikes and spike bursts. EPSP amplitude has an impact on whether spikes are fired or not, but direct measures of excitability (spike threshold\/AHP) are better predictors of whether individual spikes or spike bursts are fired. Our findings show that Purkinje cell spiking is synaptically driven but that burst firing is gated by SK2 channel modulation and plasticity."},"articletitle":{"0":"BAG6 prevents the aggregation of
