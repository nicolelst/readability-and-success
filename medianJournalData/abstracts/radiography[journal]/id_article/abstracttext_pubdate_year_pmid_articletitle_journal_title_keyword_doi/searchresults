paper gives a small sample of patients suffering from a rare disease which makes statistically significant conclusions impossible to draw. However, there are some observations that can be made. 1. The natural history of this disease appears to include early metastatic spread. However, regional lymph node metastases seem to be uncommon. 2. Surgery plays an essential role in treatment but used alone is possibly insufficient for the control of local disease as local recurrence is a major problem. 3. Post-operative radiotherapy improved local control and the time to recurrence was delayed. This meant an improved quality of life for some of our patients. 4. Metastatic bone disease treated for symptomatic relief showed radiotherapy and DTIC to be of value for pain relief and tumour regression. 5. As with other malignant melanomas, prognosis and treatment choice may be more accurately determined if the depth of invasion is known. This factor may well account for the varied disease-free survival intervals. 6. Mucosal malignant melanomas behave differently from cutaneous malignant melanomas.","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"At the Royal Marsden Hospital in Sutton a specialised unit has been designed for patients requiring total body irradiation (TBI).

After a few initial problems (mainly concerning the transfer of data between the two computers), all the plans seem to fit well and set up on the treatment machines satisfactorily. Everything is verified using the simulator. In general, it takes only a little extra time on the CT scanner, and time is saved on the simulator. The benefits are:--1. More accurate dose distribution in the planning--tissue densities previously measured, for instance lung correction factors etc. 2. Bladder and prostate tumours--a cystogram can be avoided and also the possibilities of infection inherent in this invasive procedure. 3. Bladder tumours--a more realistic picture of the bladder as it will be when treated, that is, not fully drained (Figures 7a and 7b). 4. More accurate outline information over the whole length of the area to be treated. 5. More accurate information regarding the position of critical organs in relation to the tumour volume and the treatment volume.","40":"","41":"","42":"","43":"","44":"","45":"","46":"","47":"","48":"","49":"","50":"","51":"","52":"","53":"","54":"","55":"","56":"","57":"","58":"This article compares the performance of role-play and non-role-play students at an interview resembling a viva voce examination.

Voce questions showed that students who had experienced role-play during training were more likely to cope with the patient's difficulties.

During the examination the candidate requires to read carefully the questions and ensure that he or she understands them. Careful planning of an answer particularly so as to ensure that salient points appear in the relevant sections would be time well spent. Finally, contrary to widespread opinion, few candidates fail on the basis of poor answers to what have been described as more esoteric questions. The most disappointing aspect of the Diploma of Medical Ultrasound Examination is the consistently poor answers to questions about obstetric subjects. Candidates need to know what measurements are used in obstetrics, why they are used, what they are used for and what their limitations are. The candidate who understands fetal growth and development, fetal measurement, who has a good knowledge of sectional anatomy, and who demonstrates a knowledge of technique that will allow the proper demonstration of normal anatomy and pathology, is unlikely to complain 'I can't believe I failed the Practical Applications paper'.","100":"","101":"","102":"","103":"","104":"","105":"","106":"","107":"","108":"","109":"","110":"","111":"","112":"","113":"The various injuries of the cervical spine have been defined and their appearances described, together with treatments in some instances.","114":"","115":"","116":"","117":"","118":"","119":"The ultrasound diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy can be extremely difficult to achieve even for an experienced operator.

Behavioural studies of screening observe a negative correlation with lower social class, income, education and with higher age. Education and persuasion programmes have increasingly been designed with these factors in mind. More recent studies, however, indicate that the way in which the screening service is made available to women affects their perceptions of it and, therefore, their participation at least as much as social factors; and properly designed presentation may even cancel out the effect of age and social class. This paper describes and discusses the studies which have led to the development of a consumer-oriented, service initiated (COSI) approach.","125":"The diagnosis and demonstration of an Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM), in particular the Type I ACM, presents a challenge to the clinician and diagnostic imaging specialist. Various imaging techniques have been used to demonstrate this condition in the past; as with other pathologies, the value of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI) will naturally be compared with current techniques in the diagnosis of this abnormality. In this paper the authors give a brief history of the condition, an indication of current imaging techniques, and suggest an important role for NMRI in the demonstration of Arnold-Chiari malformations.","126":"","127":"Atherosclerosis is a disease of the arteries which is characterised by the formation of yellowish plaques of atheroma in the inner lining of the arteries.

However, their usefulness depends very much on minimised distortion of bone and tooth tissue images in an area of the body where the dental radiographer's knowledge, both of the local anatomy and the needs of the clinician, make a tremendous difference. In conclusion, radiographic bite-wings are the most accurate projections to demonstrate periodontal disease of the bone margins relative to the necks of the teeth.

The purpose of this paper is to outline tomographic positioning principles, and to integrate them in a simple positioning system for common usage. This has given rise to the need for a completely new set of technical terms which pertain to positioning for skull tomography. It is hoped to establish an understanding which will enable the radiographer to devise methods of demonstrating structures for which there are no text book references to act as a guide, and to assist the radiologist in the recognition of pseudo-shadows.","630":"","631":"","632":"","633":"","634":"","635":"","636":"","637":"","638":"","639":"The article describes a method of manufacture for homemade radiographic phantoms.

The model first required a projection of radiographic procedures, based on historical data. Secondly, the projected total by patient classification was subdivided into procedure categories. Finally, the projected categorised radiographic procedures are introduced into the formula (Equation 1) and is shown below: (formula: see text). The formula is applied to each procedure category. The grand total for each of the four separately calculated categories will measure the total number of rooms and type of facility needed in the future.

Methods available include morphometry and densitometry. Of these morphometry of the third metacarpal is most accurate in our hands and cortical width is the most reliable of such morphometric data. Densitometry produces more variable results and shows no advantage over straight measurement of cortical width. The only acceptable alternative method of obtaining information about bone status is photon absorptiometry. Results of these methods are shown in a trial of oestrogen therapy for the prevention of post-menopausal osteoporosis. The data suggest that oestrogens prevent post menopausal bone loss when this is estimated by measurement of cortical width or photonabsorptiometry.","694":"","695":"","696":"","697":"","698":"","699":"","700":"","701":"","702":"","703":"","704":"","705":"","706":"","707":"","708":"","709":"Some investigation has been made in recent years of radiation dose to the eye during radiological procedures. A comparative survey has been made of eye dose during petrous bone tomography in different departments on different tomographic units and during different types of examination. Doses of up to 4 rad per exposure have been recorded and various methods of reducing the dose have been investigated, the most successful being the use of 1 mm lead eyeshields or examining the patient in the posteroanterior position.","710":"","711":"A patient's gown for use in the X-ray Department has been designed. It is of such a style that one size suits all patients and adequate access to the patient is afforded while modesty is preserved. It is of a distinctive colour to ensure its retention solely for use in the X-ray Department.","712":"The great majority of renal injuries are minor, are treated conservatively and are adequately assessed by clinical examination and high dose intravenous urography. When severe renal injury is suspected and surgery is being considered, angiography is of great value in accurately defining the extent of injury and rationalising management. During the past four years we have carried out angiography for the assessment of renal trauma in 21 patients admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Four of these cases have been described.","713":"","714":"","715":"","716":"","717":"","718":"","719":"","720":"","721":"","722":"","723":"","724":"","725":"","726":"","727":"","728":"An unusual case of rotary dislocation of atlas upon axis is presented.

Radiation-induced parenchymal changes were demonstrated in 73 per cent of the patients and pleural effusions in about 10 percent. Total regression of the parenchymal changes were extremely rare, but a slight decrease in the volume of the affected lung was normal. The radiation-induced pleural effusion had no special characteristics, but, with one exception, it occurred simultaneously with radiation-induced parenchymal infiltrates, and it did not increase in quantity in any case.","756":"A perfusion technique is described which enables differentiation in a dilated upper urinary tract between one which is obstructed and one which is not.
