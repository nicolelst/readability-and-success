{"articleID":{"0":0},"abstracttext":{"0":"Preparation of degradable materials using reversible deactivation radical polymerizations (RDRP) is of particular interest for biomedical applications. In this paper we report preparation of degradable copolymers of 2-methylene-4-phenyl-1, 3-dioxolane (MPDL), monomer which undergoes ring-opening reaction and forms ester bond upon radical polymerization, with hydrophobic and hydrophilic methacrylate monomers using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Copolymers composition and degradation were evaluated upon varied temperature and monomer type."},"articletitle":{"0":"Degradable copolymers with incorporated ester groups by radical ring-opening polymerization using atom transfer radical polymerization."},"doi":{"0":""},"journal_title":{"0":"Polimery"},"keyword":{"0":"3-dioxolaneatom transfer radical polymerizationcopolymers of 2-methylene-4-phenyl-1degradable materialsreversible deactivation radical polymerizations"},"language":{"0":"eng"},"pmid":{"0":30270942},"pubdate_year":{"0":2017}}
