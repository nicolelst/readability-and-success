disease 2019, putatively caused by infection with severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2, often involves injury to multiple organs and there are limited data regarding the mid- to long-term consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 after discharge from the hospital. The study aimed to describe the mid- to long-term consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 in hospitalized patients after discharge. This single-center, prospective study enrolled coronavirus disease 2019 patients who were discharged uneventfully from our center. All participants underwent face-toface interviews by trained physicians and were asked to complete a series of questionnaires on third and sixth months' follow-up visits. A total of 406 consecutive discharged coronavirus disease 2019 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to World Health Organization classification as follows: World Health Organization-3 (n=83); World Health Organization-4 (n=291); and World Health Organization-5,6 (n=32). Length of hospital stay was highly, significantly increased in the higher World Health Organization groups (World Health Organization-3 vs. World Health Organization-4, P &lt; .0001; World Health Organization-3 vs. World Health Organization-5,6, P &lt; .0001; World Health Organization-4 vs. World Health Organization-5,6, P &lt; .0001), whereas the length of intensive care unit stay was highly, significantly increased only in World Health Organization-5,6 group compared to other groups (World Health Organization-3 vs. World Health Organization-5,6, P &lt; .0001; World Health Organization-4 vs. World Health Organization-5,6, P &lt; .0001). The most frequent complaints were chest pain (39%), and the frequency of complaints decreased during the 3-6 months follow-up period. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age, coronary artery disease, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, troponin I, D-dimer, use of steroid and\/or low molecular weight heparin, and World Health Organization class were found to be independent predictors of ongoing cardiovascular symptoms. The current data demonstrated that persistent symptoms were common after coronavirus disease 2019 among hospitalized patients. This should raise awareness among healthcare professionals regarding coronavirus disease 2019 aftercare. ","10":null,"11":null,"12":"Transcatheter closure of perimembraneous ventricular septal defect still poses a challenge due to the adjacent structures of the tricuspid and aortic valves and the risk of atrioventricular block. We report our experience at 2 centers using the KONAR-MF (multifunctional occluder) ventricular septal defect device, which gained its CE mark in May 2018. A retrospective study was carried out on all patients who underwent transcatheter ventricular septal defect closure with the KONAR-MF (multifunctional occluder) ventricular septal defect device at 2 centers. A total of 47 patients were identified. The median age and weight of the patients were 25.8 months and 11 kg. The ventricular septal defects that were closed in 5 cases were post-operative hemodynamically significant residual ventricular septal defects. Forty-eight devices were used in the 47 cases. As for the location of the ventricular septal defect, 40\/48 (83.33%) ventricular septal defects were perimembranous and 8\/48 (16.66%) were muscular. The percutaneous device closure was successful in 46 procedures (95.8%). Device embolization was observed in 2 patients, and a significant residual shunt was observed in 2 cases. In the follow-up, there was no enhancement in the residual shunt in the remaining cases. Temporary atrioventricular block occurred in 2 cases during the procedure and improved after long sheath withdrawal. Soft, flexible, and low-profile KONAR-MF (multifunctional occluder) occluders ensure easy and safe implantation, and small sheath sizes allow for their use in small infants. Although near and mid-term follow-ups did not indicate any permanent atrioventricular block, a larger sample of patients and a longer follow-up period is necessary to understand long-term outcomes. ","13":null,"14":null,"15":"","16":"Thrombotic coronary artery occlusions usually manifest as acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock, acute pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, fatal arrhythmias, or sudden cardiac death. Although it usually occurs based on atherosclerosis, it can also occur without atherosclerosis. There is no predictor of coronary artery thrombosis clinically and no consensus regarding the optimal treatment. In the current literature, treatment options include emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, entrapment of thrombus in vessel wall with stent implantation, intracoronary thrombolysis, glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors, anticoagulation with heparin, and thrombus aspiration as reperfusion strategies. Here, we reviewed a new treatment strategy based on the literature, and a case series with successful results in hemodynamically stable patients with low-dose slow infusion tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for thrombotic coronary artery occlusions that allow coronary flow was reported.

In addition, hypoxia represents the central feature of myocardial infarction. Recently, it has been reported that circular RNAs can exert critical functions in the biological processes of diseases. However, the functions of most circular RNAs remain unclear in cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. In this study, we focused on exploring the role of circ_SMAD7 (namely hsa_circ_0000848 in this study) in cardiomyocyte cells cultured under hypoxic conditions to provide a novel insight for future myocardial infarction studies. Firstly, a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay was adopted to analyze hsa_circ_0000848 expression. Functional assays were performed to detect the functions of hsa_circ_0000848 in cardiomyocyte cells cultured under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, mechanism assays were implemented to explore the regulatory mechanism of hsa_circ_0000848. Hsa_circ_0000848 was notably downregulated in hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes. The silencing of hsa_circ_0000848 hindered the proliferation while accelerating the apoptosis of hypoxia-induced cardiomyocytes cells. Moreover, hsa_circ_0000848 interacted with ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1 protein to stabilize SMAD family member 7 mRNA. Moreover, SMAD family member 7 overexpression could reverse the suppressive effect of hsa_circ_0000848 knockdown on myocardial infarction progression. Our research was the first in the field to confirm that the hsa_circ_0000848\/ ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1\/SMAD family member 7 axis could affect the development of cardiomyocyte cells cultured under hypoxia, indicating that hsa_circ_0000848 might function as a novel biomarker in cells under hypoxia thus laying the groundwork for future study on myocardial infarction.

In this study, we aimed at analyzing retrospectively the characteristics and outcome of patients with aortic stenosis treated either with surgical aortic valve replacement or transcatheter aortic valve implantation between 2006 and 2016 in the Silesian Province, Poland in a representative real-world cohort. In the Silesian Cardiovascular Database we retrospectively identified 5186 patients who received either transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement in 1 of 3 tertiary cardiovascular centers. Baseline characteristics, including relevant clinical history, and outcomes were compared before and after propensity-score matching of both groups, with 348 pairs of patients constituting the propensity-matched study cohort. The primary end-point was 24-month all-cause mortality. Preoperative characteristics of propensity-matched groups were similar. There was no difference between transcatheter aortic valve implantation and surgical aortic valve replacement groups with respect to the death rate at 2 years (19.9% vs. 15.6%; P =.479). In the transcatheter aortic valve implantation group, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices were more frequently implanted after the procedure (3.7% vs. 0.0, P &lt;.001). The groups had similar rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and re-hospitalization. Hospital stay in the matched groups was shorter after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: 14.1 versus 15.7 days (P &lt;.001). At 24 months, transcatheter aortic valve implantation patients had similar outcomes as surgical aortic valve replacement except for a higher rate of cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation and shorter hospital stay.

However, the effectiveness of this combined treatment compared with catheter ablation alone is still controversial. We searched studies in databases, including The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, that compared catheter ablation combined with left atrial appendage closure and catheter ablation alone in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. These studies reported at least one of the following outcomes: the freedom from atrial arrhythmia rate, the procedure time, the fluoroscopy time, perioperative complications, thromboembolic events, and bleeding events during follow-up. The risk ratio and standard mean difference with 95% CI were analyzed by the random-effects model. Five studies involving 699 people were included in our meta-analysis. We found no significant difference in the freedom from atrial arrhythmia rate (risk ratio=0.93, 95% CI=0.83-1.04, I 2=0%, P=.21) between the 2 groups. Catheter ablation combined with left atrial appendage closure showed significantly longer procedure and fluoroscopy times than catheter ablation alone (standard mean difference=1.26, 95% CI=0.85-1.67, P &lt;.00001 and standard mean difference=1.19, 95% CI=0.53-1.85, P=.0004, respectively).

Hypothetically, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) may be beneficial in reducing CPA and pulsatile stress in patients with CTEPH. In total, 26 patients with available pre- and post-BPA right heart catheterization results were included in the study. BPA was performed in a series of staged procedures by 2 experienced interventional cardiologists. The median CPA showed a 59.2% increase (1.03 to 1.64 mL\/mm Hg, p=0.005). The median pre-BPA pulsatile stress product decreased by 20.7% (4,266 to 3,380 mm Hg\/min, p=0.003). A linear regression model established that the percent change in CPA after BPA accounted for 21.8% of the explained variability in the change in 6-minute walk test (p=0.009).

Although small trials abound, data from a large cohort are lacking. This meta-analysis compares all the existing studies comparing these two approaches to evaluate perceived advantages of one over the other. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases identified studies comparing HPSD to LPLD ablation. All the analyses used the random-effects model. Ablation settings varied widely across 20 studies comprising 2,136 patients who underwent HPSD and 1,753 patients who underwent LPLD. The pooled incidence of atrial arrhythmia recurrence after HPSD ablation was 20% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.16-0.25; I2=88%]. Atrial arrhythmia recurrences were significantly less frequent with HPSD ablation (incidence risk ratio=0.66; 95% CI: 0.49-0.88; I2=72%; p=0.004). Procedural, fluoroscopy, and ablation times were significantly shorter with HPSD ablation. First-pass pulmonary vein isolations (PVIs) were significantly more [odds ratio (OR)=2.94; 95% CI: 1.50-5.77; I2=89%; p=0.002), and acute pulmonary vein reconnections (PVRs) were significantly lesser (OR=0.41; 95% CI: 0.28-0.62; I2=62%; p&lt;0.001) in the HPSD group. Although radiofrequency energy was significantly higher, esophageal thermal injuries (ETI) were lower with HPSD ablation. Acute complications, including steam-pops, were rare and statistically similar in both the groups. HPSD ablation enables faster first-pass PVI with fewer PVRs, similar ETI rates, rare collateral damage, and lower recurrence of atrial arrhythmia in the long term than LPLD.

The follow-up period was six years. New-onset AF occurred in 215 (6.9%) patients, 75 (34.9%) patients presented with AF, and 140 (65.1%) patients developed AF after pPCI. The median time of AF occurrence in patients who did not present with AF was 4.5 (interquartile range 1-25) hours after pPCI. New-onset AF was associated with a higher short- and long-term mortality. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, all stages of reduced kidney function were independent predictors for the occurrence of new-onset AF, and negative prognostic impact increased with the deterioration of kidney function: eGFR &lt;90 mL\/min\/m2, hazard ratio (HR) 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-2.89, p=0.011; eGFR 60-89 mL\/min\/m2, HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.13-2.57, p=0.045; eGFR 45-59 mL\/min\/m2-, HR 2.09, 95% CI 1.24-2.85, p=0.023; eGFR 30-44 mL\/min\/m2-, HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.64-5.29, p&lt;0.001; eGFR 15-29 mL\/min\/m2-, HR 5.51, 95% CI 2.67-11.39, p&lt;0.001. Decreased kidney function was significantly associated with the occurrence of new-onset AF, and its impact increased with the deterioration in kidney function, starting with an eGFR value of 90 mL\/min\/m2. New-onset AF was an independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality in the analyzed patients.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the functional determinants of gait speed in patients with HFrEF. Fifty-nine patients with HFrEF participated in this cross-sectional study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded. The gait speed was determined with a 4-meter walking test. Dyspnea perception was assessed with the modified medical research council (mMRC) scale. Functional capacity was evaluated with a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The five times sit-to-stand (5-STS) test and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) were used to measure functional mobility and balance. Physical activity was evaluated with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Short-Form. Gait speed was correlated with age (r=-0.368, p=0.004), NYHA functional class (r=-0.438, p=0.001), mMRC score (r=-0.422, p=0.001), 6MWT (r=0.650, p&lt;0.001), 5STS (r=-0.506, p&lt;0.001), BBS (r=0.586, p&lt;0.001), IPAQ (r=0.305, p=0.019) and IPAQ-Sitting time (r=-0.327, p=0.011). On multiple linear regression analysis, the 6MWT distance and BBS were independent determinants of the usual gait speed in patients with HFrEF, accounting for 44.4% of the variance. This study indicates that functional capacity and balance are independent functional determinants of gait speed in patients with HFrEF. ","135":"The incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) varies between 7% and 21%, and most of these studies were in the thrombolytic era. However, the frequency of new-onset AF during the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) period is still unclear. We aimed to investigate the frequency of new-onset AF and its effects on long-term clinical events in patients undergoing primary PCI. A total of 1,603 patients who were diagnosed with STEMI and underwent primary PCI were included in the study. All the patients were monitored for at least 48 hours after the procedure. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as new-onset AF during hospitalization. The median follow-up period of our study was 44 months. New-onset AF developed in 85 (6.1%) patients. CHADs-VASc &gt; 2, KILLIP &gt; 2, and left atrial diameter were found to be independent predictors for the development of new-onset AF. In the AF (+) group, the all-cause and in-hospital mortality rates were found to be significantly higher. New-onset AF development in patients with STEMI was detected as an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. In the era of primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, new-onset AF rates were found to be lower than the literature data. In addition, new-onset AF was found to be a predictor of in-hospital mortality, and deaths occurred mostly in the early period. Therefore, close follow-up of these patients in the early period and re-evaluation in terms of AF burden when the patient becomes stable are important.

Once we have all the pieces of the puzzle, we will be able to successfully treat this disease with its multiple challenges. COVID-19 has a high thrombogenic potential. In this study, we aimed to review published data about COVID-19 associated thrombosis from pathophysiology to treatment and the role in patient evolution. We searched for articles and studies published online through MEDLINE\/PubMed database, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Wiley Online Library, and Nature Public Health Emergency Collection. We found numerous articles regarding COVID-19 infection but selected only those focused on thrombosis. D-dimers have a predictive value in identifying thrombosis and a high level correlates with the severity of the infection and death. Most patients who were on chronic anticoagulant therapy before contracting the virus had a better prognosis. Heparin has other favorable effects such as a direct antiviral and anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its anticoagulant effect. COVID-19 infections are frequently complicated by thrombotic pathology. High plasma level of D-dimers is a predictive factor for severe prognosis, and the recommended anticoagulant, associated with low mortality, is heparin followed by a direct oral anticoagulant. Randomized studies in large groups of patients and therapeutic guidelines are still needed on this subject.","137":"","138":"Air traffic has been a main vector for the global spread of COVID-19.

This situation is known as the economy class syndrome and can affect both the cabin crew and passengers. The term \"economy class syndrome\" refers to the occurrence of thrombotic events that mainly occur in passengers in the economy class of the aircraft during long-haul flights. This syndrome results from several factors related to the aircraft cabin and the passenger, acting together to predispose to excessive blood coagulation, which can result in venous thromboembolism.

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether increased interleukin (IL)-6 levels can predict right ventricular (RV) systolic impairment in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This prospective, observational study included 100 consecutive patients hospitalized with mild and moderate COVID-19. All the patients underwent chest computerized tomography, detailed laboratory tests including IL-6, and two dimensional (2D) transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with assessment of 2D conventional and Doppler echocardiography parameters and RV systolic functions. After the elimination of six patients with exclusion criteria, the remaining patients were classified into two groups, namely normal RV systolic functions (n=60) and impaired RV systolic functions (n=34). IL-6 levels were significantly higher in patients with impaired RV systolic functions than in those with normal RV systolic functions (20.3, 4.6, p&lt;0.001, respectively). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion and RV derived tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) S' measurements were similar between the two groups. RV fractional area change was significantly lower, and RV TDI derived index of myocardial performance was significantly higher in patients with impaired RV systolic functions. In multivariate analysis, IL-6 levels independently predicted deterioration in RV systolic function at a significant level (odds ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.20, p=0.003).

Adult patients diagnosed with acute PE between January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2013, were retrospectively included. Data on baseline characteristics and mortality during a five-year follow-up were collected. The study included 414 patients (Male\/Female=192\/222). The median age at diagnosis was 61.5 (minimum-maximum, 18-93) years. Mortality rates were 13.3% at 30 days, 21.8% at 90 days, 32.6% at one year, and 51.0% at five years. Both stratification into risk classes according to the original PESI and low vs. high-risk classification of original and simplified PESI were significantly correlated with the 30-day, 31-90-day, 91-day-one-year, and one-five-year mortality. Significant PESI predictors for mortality were history of cancer [hazard ratio (HR): 3.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.64-6.68; p=0.001] and heart failure (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.04-5.32, p=0.041) at 31-90-day, history of cancer (HR: 5.45, 95% CI: 2.86-10.40, p&lt;0.001) at 91-day-one-year, advancing age (HR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.02-1.06, p&lt;0.001) and history of cancer (HR: 5.53, 95% CI: 3.41-8.98, p&lt;0.001) at one-five-year after acute PE diagnosis. All-cause long-term mortality in high-risk patients with acute PE according to original or simplified PESI significantly increased up to five years of follow-up.

Blood pressure measurements [(systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] and the evidence of end-organ damage at the first admission were recorded. Patients with HC were classified as patients with HE or HU according to the presence or absence of acute end-organ damage. Serum corin levels were compared between the 2 groups. The mean serum corin level was significantly lower in the HC group than in the control group; it was also lower in the HE group than in the HU group (p&lt;0.001 for all).

Patients with primary HTN included in this study were newly diagnosed, untreated, and were followed-up for a minimum of 6 months. HTN was confirmed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). All patients underwent the following assessments: anthropometrical measurements of body mass index (BMI), carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), left ventricular mass index (LVMI), plasma creatinine, urea, electrolytes, uric acid, fasting plasma glucose, blood lipids, urinalysis, urine culture, and first morning urine albumin tocreatinine ratio. The ABPM device performed measurements such as central blood pressure (cBP) and pulse wave velocity (PWV). Thirty-two of 104 patients were enrolled. Seventeen patients were male, and 53% were obese. Compared with pretreatment, creatinine, urea, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), systolic load, diastolic load, central SBP (cSBP), cSBP z score, cDBP, and PWV z score decreased, whereas LVMI and BMI z scores were unchanged. After BP improvement, while LVMI did not regress, the cSBP, cSBP z, and PWV z score values, which are markers of arterial stiffness, regressed.

Pacemaker implantation can relieve the symptoms of arrhythmia caused by bradycardia, but it is not easy for patients to accept a pacemaker implantation as a form of treatment. Therefore, more and more attention has been paid to cardiac vagus nerve ablation. In this study, 20 patients who met the inclusion criteria of GP ablation in the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from November 2019 to June 2020 were enrolled. Biochemical and other related examinations along with electrophysiological examinations were conducted before ablation, and then cardiac GP ablation was performed.

All consecutive patients (n=1930) with AMI admitted to coronary care units within 48 hours of symptom onset were prospectively enrolled during a predefined 2-week period between November 1, 2018, and November 16, 2018. All the patients were examined in detail with regard to the time elapsed at each step from symptom onset to initiation of treatment, including door-to-balloon time (D2B) and total ischemic time (TIT). After excluding patients who suffered an AMI within the hospital (2.6%), the analysis was conducted for 1879 patients. Most of the patients (49.5%) arrived by self-transport, 11.8% by emergency medical service (EMS) ambulance, and 38.6% were transferred from another EMS without PCI capability. The median time delay from symptom-onset to EMS call was 52.5 (15-180) min and from EMS call to EMS arrival 15 (10-20) min. In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the median D2B time was 36.5 (25-63) min, and median TIT was 195 (115-330) min. TIT was significantly prolonged from 151 (90-285) min to 250 (165-372) min in patients transferred from non-PCI centers. The major significant factors associated with time delay were patient-related delay and the mode of hospital arrival, both in STEMI and non-STEMI. The baseline evaluation of the TURKMI study revealed that an important proportion of patients presenting with AMI within 48 hours of symptom onset reach the PCI treatment center later than the time proposed in the guidelines, and the use of EMS for admission to hospital is extremely low in Turkey. Patient-related factors and the mode of hospital admission were the major factors associated with the time delay to treatment.

The ACS sample was divided into two groups: patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The frequency of DNA damage [expressed as genetic damage index (GDI)] was analyzed using the comet assay pre- and post-CAG. Chromosomal aberrations were measured as micronuclei (MNs) frequency using the cytokinesis-block MN (CBMN) assay. Additionally, detailed anamnestic data were taken from the each patient. Increased levels of DNA and chromosomal damage have been revealed in ACS patients compared to the healthy controls. GDI values were also significantly higher in AMI patients than in UAP patients. A highly significant increase of DNA damage was also observed in all patients post-CAG. There was significantly higher MN frequency and significantly lower nuclear division index (NDI) in AMI patients than in UAP patients' pre-CAG. After CAG, there was no significant difference in MN frequencies and NDI values between UAP and AMI patients.

Focusing on early recognition and management of HF comorbidities may have an important role in reducing the economic burden and public health impact of HF. The close interconnection between HF, heart rhythm disturbances, and sleep apnea is supported by the mutual risk factors such as age, smoking, obesity, and male sex. Central sleep apnea (CSA) may be considered a marker of advanced HF, often being associated with elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and noradrenaline levels and with low left ventricular ejection fraction. In the same way, there is an important correlation between CSA and different types of arrhythmias. The large intraindividual rhythm variability reported in patients with SDB who underwent continuous monitoring by implantable loop recorder (ILR) demonstrated the incapacity of 24-hour and 48-hour Holter monitoring to accurately determine the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. In patients with HF and CSA, the extended cardiac monitoring by ILR becomes compulsory because in-time interventions could be life saving, but with the absolute lack of solid evidence in this field, there is an acute need for extensive randomized trials to further highlight the potential beneficial effect of ILR monitoring in patients with CSA and HF.","237":"","238":"","239":"","240":"","241":"","242":"","243":"","244":null,"245":"Although patients with prosthetic heart valves have an increased risk of clinically overt cerebrovascular events, evidence for the risk of silent cerebral infarction (SCI) is scarce.

Forest maps were studied and a comprehensive evaluation of the diagnostic value of the expression levels of mRNAs in CAD was conducted using statistical indicators such as the summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Overall, 14 studies were included, with 38 data sets, involving 29 miRNAs with 846 cases and 898 controls. The meta-analysis revealed that the average sensitivity and specificity of miRNAs for CAD diagnosis were 0.80 (0.75-0.84) and 0.78 (0.75-0.81), respectively. The positive likelihood, negative likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratios were 3.7 (3.1-4.4), 0.26 (0.21-0.33), and 14 (10-21), respectively, and the area under the curve was 0.85 (0.82-0.88).

The paired angiograms [ST in ACS during and after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)] of the patients were analyzed by two independent observers, with focus on lesion characteristics and procedure techniques. Clinical and laboratory data were collected. Stent thrombosis was found in 29 (1.6%) ACS patients, with a combination of at least one clinical\/laboratory risk factor and one lesion\/operator risk factor identified in 28 (96%) out of the 29 ACS patients with ST. The following risk factors for ST were found: Renal insufficiency (OR=4.14, p&lt;0.001, 95% CI=1.73-9.88), type 2 diabetes (OR=2.21, p=0.034, 95% CI=1.06-4.61), excessive alcohol consumption (OR=3.12, p=0.023, 95% CI=1.17-8.33), stent implantation for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (OR=2.28, p=0.029, 95% CI=1.08-4.81), left main (LM) or left anterior descending artery (LAD) as culprit lesion (OR=2.80, p=0.010, CI 95%=1.27-5.95), and absence of antiplatelet therapy prior to ST (OR=3.58, p=0.002, 95% CI=1.60-7.96). The following lesion\/operator possible risk factors were identified: Bifurcation lesion (n=7; 24%), heavy coronary calcifications (n=13; 44%), in-stent restenosis with secondary plate rupture (n=6, 20%), inappropriate stent size selection (n=6, 20%), and errors in periprocedural drug administration (n=4, 14%). ST occurred in 1\/62 ACS patients after PCI. A combination of clinical\/laboratory and lesion\/operator risk factors were present in almost all ACS patients with ST. This finding may support the search for strictly individualized strategies for the treatment of ACS patients with ST after PCI.

The virus enters the respiratory tract cells and other tissues via ACE2 receptors. Approximately 20% of infected subjects develop severe or critical disease. A cytokine storm leads to over inflammation and thrombotic events. The most common clinical presentation in COVID-19 is pneumonia, typically characterized by bilateral, peripheral, and patchy infiltrations in the lungs. However multi-systemic involvement including peripheral thromboembolic skin lesions, central nervous, gastrointestinal, circulatory, and urinary systems are reported. The disease has a higher mortality compared to other viral agents causing pneumonia and unfortunately, no approved specific therapy, nor vaccine has yet been discovered. Several clinical trials are ongoing with hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, favipiravir, and low molecular weight heparins. This comprehensive review aimed to summarize coagulation abnormalities reported in COVID-19, discuss the thrombosis, and inflammation-driven background of the disease, emphasize the impact of thrombotic and inflammatory processes on the progression and prognosis of COVID-19, and to provide evidence-based therapeutic guidance, especially from antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory perspectives.","323":"Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is used for the main diagnosis in acute pulmonary embolism (APE).

The study included patients with APE diagnosed by CTPA who were admitted to the hospital between January 28, 2016, and July 1, 2019. Data collected were markers of severity in APE, including patient demographics, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) score, modified PESI score, Wells score, risk stratification according to the American Heart Association, systolic blood pressure (SBP), right ventricle diameter to left ventricle diameter ratio, pulmonary arterial pressure, brain natriuretic peptide, troponin, D-dimer, and plasma lactate levels, and vessel location of the thrombus, clot burden score, ratio of the pulmonary artery trunk diameter\/aortic diameter, superior vena cava diameter (SVC) by CTPA, and survival. All parameters were analyzed in correlation with clot load and vessel location. Thrombus vascular location was found to be correlated with risk stratification and negatively correlated with SBP. Simplified Mastora score was correlated with risk stratification, SVC diameter, and D-dimer and negatively correlated with SBP. Occlusion of both the pulmonary artery trunk and any pulmonary artery with thrombus was associated with massive APE. The level of the occluded vessel on CTPA may provide the ability to risk-stratify, and the clot burden score may be used for assessing both risk stratification and cardiac strain.

The patients' 0th, 1st, and 2nd hour blood gas results; 0th, 1st, and 2nd hour vital signs; requirement of endotracheal intubation, length of hospitalization, and the prognosis were recorded on the study form. A total of 112 patients were included in this study, of whom 50 underwent SOT and 62 received HFOT. The initial blood gas analysis revealed significantly lower levels of pH, PaO2, and SpO2 and significantly higher levels of PaCO2 in the HFOT group. Patients in the HFOT group had significantly higher respiratory rate and pulse rate and significantly lower SpO2 values. The recovery of vital signs was significantly better in the HFOT group (p&lt;0.05). Similarly, follow-up results of arterial blood gas analysis were better in the HFOT group (p&lt;0.05). Both length of stay in the emergency department (p&lt;0.05) and length of intensive care unit hospitalization s significantly shorter in the HFOT group (p&lt;0.05). HFOT can be much more effective in patients with hypertensive pulmonary edema than SOT as it shortens the length of stay both in the emergency service and in the intensive care unit.

Left ventricular function, circumferential end-systolic stress (cESS), and myocardial energy expenditure (MEE) were measured by transthoracic echocardiography preoperatively and 3 months after surgery. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to absolute difference of postoperative differentiation of EF. Nine patients underwent mitral valve repair and 40 underwent prosthetic valve replacement. Patients with reduced EF had higher MEE demonstrated with cESS and MEE. Negative correlation between preoperative EF and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), cESS, MEEs, and MEEm and positive correlation between preoperative EF and effective regurgitant orifice area were found. Complications occurred in 12 patients during hospitalization. Basal NT-proBNP, left atrium (LA), and cESS were significantly higher in postoperatively decreased EF group. Taking into consideration the covariates of multiple logistic regression analysis, LA and cESS were found to be independent predictors of EF reduction postoperatively. Higher LA and cESS are independent predictors of postoperative EF reduction. Preoperative high end-systolic stress could predict postoperative EF reduction and hence could be helpful for determining the timing of mitral valve surgery.

Thereafter, several computational approaches were taken to determine functional roles and regulatory networks of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Finally, the expression of dysregulated two hub genes-suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and haptoglobin (HP)-were validated in a case-control study. A total of 119 DEGs were identified in the discovery phase, consisting of 71 downregulated genes and 48 upregulated genes; two hub modules consisting of two hub genes-SOCS3 and HP-were identified.

Detection of potentially viable segments is a predictor of hibernating myocardium. ICM patients with hibernation have a better prognosis after revascularization. We used a novel infusion technique to determine better viability detection preoperatively in challenging situations. Like thallium, does prolonged availability of sestamibi in circulation with additional low dose dobutamine steady infusion (DS Inf) facilitate improved myocardial viability? A total of 58 ICM patients with infarct and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;45% underwent 99mTc sestamibi bolus injection followed by slow intravenous infusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using a 2 day protocol.

Only 24 patients demonstrated viable segments by standard bolus imaging protocol. The slow MIBI infusion study demonstrated 158 viable segments (12 ICM patients), while combined infusion (99mTc sestamibi+DS Inf) exhibited an additional 6 patients with improved myocardial viability. Thus, 18 high risk patients benefited by this novel infusion technique to demonstrate viable myocardium on SPECT. There was a significantly higher sensitivity (p=0.05) and positive predictive value (p=0.01) in viability identification with the combined DS Inf technique. In dysfunctional segments, the rate of concordance for detecting viability between infusion and bolus techniques was 65%. Paired t test showed statistically significant improvement in viability detection with combined infusion compared to the bolus study (p=0.001). This novel infusion technique was shown to be feasible and incremental in viability detection in ICM patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.

FH is mainly an autosomal codominant pattern-based disorder and is primarily determined by point mutations within the low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B, and proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 genes, causing increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the serum of untreated individuals. The accumulation will eventually lead to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Although clinical criteria comprising several prognosis scores, such as the Simon Broome, Dutch Lipid Clinic Network, Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent Early Death, and the recently proposed Montreal-FH-SCORE, are the conventional basis of diagnosing FH, the genetic diagnosis made by single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis, and sequencing (both Sanger and Next-Generation sequencing) offers unequivocal diagnosis. Given the heterogeneity of known mutations, the genetic diagnosis of FH is often difficult to establish, despite the growing evidence of the causative mutations, as well as the polygenic aspect of this pathology and the importance of cascade screening of the FH patient&amp;lsquor;s healthy family members. This review article details different genetic techniques that can be used in FH identification when there is a clinical FH suspicion based on criteria comprised in prognosis scores, knowing that none of these are exhaustive in the diagnosis, yet they efficaciously overlap and complement each other for confirming the disease at the molecular level.","431":null,"432":"","433":"","434":"","435":"","436":"To the best of our knowledge, there is no up-to-date information regarding the presentation, management, and clinical course of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) in Turkey. The TURKMI registry is designed to provide an insight into the characteristics, management from the symptoms onset to the hospital discharge, and outcome of patients with acute MI in Turkey. The TURKMI study, as a nationwide registry, will be conducted in 50 percutaneous coronary intervention-capable centers, selected from each EuroStat NUTS region in Turkey according to their population sampling weight, prioritizing the hospital volume in each region. All consecutive patients with acute MI admitted to the coronary care units within the 48 hours of the symptoms onset will be prospectively enrolled during a predefined 2-week period. The first step of the study has a cross-sectional design in which baseline information such as symptoms, risk factors, time periods at each step from the symptoms onset to revascularization, way of arrival to hospital, biochemical analysis, and in-hospital management and outcome will be assessed. The second step has a cohort characteristic in which the enrolled patients will be followed-up up to 2 years. Follow-up visits will be conducted at the 1st, 6th, 12th, and 24th month, and predictors and risk of cardiovascular events and implementation of guidelines will be assessed as secondary outcomes.

Given its considerable prevalence in Mediterranean and Eastern European countries according to the Euro Heart Survey, new imaging modalities are warranted to improve the management of patients with this condition. A wide spectrum of abnormalities occurs involving all parts of this complex structure and causing different grades of MS and\/or regurgitation as a consequence of rheumatic affection. Novel imaging modalities significantly improved the assessment of several aspects of this rheumatic destructive process including the morphological alterations of the mitral valve apparatus, left atrial (LA) function, LA appendage, right and left ventricular function, and complications, namely, atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic events. Furthermore, new imaging modalities improved the prediction of outcome of patients who underwent percutaneous balloon mitral comissurotomy and changed the paradigm of patient selection for intervention and risk stratification. The present review aimed to summarize the role of new multimodality, multiparametric imaging approaches to assess the morphological characteristics of the rheumatic MS and its associated complications, and to guide patient management.","443":"","444":"","445":"","446":null,"447":"The need for aspirin therapy as part of primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease is currently being highly debated, especially after 3 studies in different settings reported that a reduction in ischemic events is largely counterbalanced by an increase in bleeding events. One possible explanation for these results is the progressive reduction in the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as a result of primary prevention, which has accompanied global education programs that have led to patients smoking less, exercising more, and increasingly undertaking lipid-lowering therapies. Based on a meta-regression of the benefits and harmful effects of aspirin therapy in primary prevention as a function of the 10-year risk of MACE, we favor a differentiated and personalized approach that acknowledged differences between patients and emphasized an individualized assessment of benefits and risks. Following general preventive measures (physical exercise, cessation of smoking, treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, etc.), an individualized approach to prescribing aspirin is still warranted. When patients are less than 70 years of age, clinicians should assess the 10-year CV risk.

Currently, a strong international consensus is still lacking regarding the single value which would be commonly used to define hyperlipoproteinemia (a). Its prevalence in the general population is estimated to be in the range of 10%-35% in accordance with the most commonly used threshold levels (&gt;30 or &gt;50 mg\/dL). Since elevated Lp(a) can be of special importance in patients with some genetic disorders, as well as in individuals with otherwise controlled major risk factors, the identification and establishment of the proper therapeutic interventions that would lower Lp(a) levels and lead to CVD risk reduction could be very important. The majority of the classical lipid-lowering agents (statins, ezetimibe, and fibrates), as well as nutraceuticals (CoQ10 and garlic), appear to have no significant effect on its plasma levels, whereas for the drugs with the demonstrated Lp(a)-lowering effects (aspirin, niacin, and estrogens), their clinical efficacy in reducing cardiovascular (CV) events has not been unequivocally proven yet. Both Lp(a) apheresis and proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 inhibitors can reduce the plasma Lp(a) by approximately 20%-30% on average, in parallel with much larger reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (up to 70%), what puts us in a difficulty to conclude about the true contribution of lowered Lp(a) to the reduction of CV events. The most recent advancement in the field is the introduction of the novel apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)] antisense oligonucleotide therapy targeting apo(a), which has already proven itself as being very effective in decreasing plasma Lp(a) (by even &gt;90%), but should be further tested in clinical trials.

Therefore, its detection early in pregnancy is of great importance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the rate and spectrum of CVD among healthy women in the first trimester of pregnancy. A total of 900 women in the first trimester of pregnancy, who attended the antenatal outpatient clinic of a tertiary care center in Ankara, Turkey, for a routine pregnancy examination, were recruited into this prospective study. Patients with a history of chronic systemic diseases, CVD, and\/or a family history of an early onset CVD, and multiple pregnancies were excluded. Patients who were included in the study underwent electrocardiography and transthoracic echocardiography by the same cardiologist. The rate of newly diagnosed CVD cases among asymptomatic pregnant women without any cardiac or clinical risk factors was 5.2% (n=47). The following CVDs were detected: rheumatic heart disease (n=26; 55.3%), congenital heart disease (n=13; 27.6%), and isolated valve disease (moderate and severe) (n=8; 17%). The mitral valve prolapse was detected in 32 women (3.5%) and atrial septal aneurysm in 51 women (5.67%). Thirty women (3.3%) had arrhythmia. The CVD rate of 5.2% among healthy women in the first trimester of pregnancy shows that the clinicians must keep in mind that during pregnancy, physiological changes in the cardiovascular system may aggravate an undiagnosed disease, and they should be alert even in case of mild cardiac symptoms that may interfere with pregnancy complaints.

Our conventional echocardiographic parameters included transmitral peak early and late diastolic velocity (E and A), septal and lateral early (e') mitral annular diastolic tissue velocities, and left atrial maximum volume index (LAVImax). LV end-diastolic and -systolic volume, LV mass index (LVMI), and LV ejection fraction were measured using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography. The 3D-STE parameters included LV global radial strain (GRS), global longitudinal strain (GLS), global area strain (GAS), and global circumferential strain (GCS). Our results showed that in group C, GCS, GRS, GLS, GAS, and septal and lateral e' velocity decreased, whereas average E\/e' and LAVImax increased compared to groups B and A (p&lt;0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that NAFLD is independently associated with 3D-STE parameters, and glycosylated hemoglobin also has negative impacts on all LV 3D strains. When combined with conventional echocardiography, 3D-STE can assess LV function effectively in T2DM patients with NAFLD.

Left ventricular pacing has long been considered an alternative to standard biventricular pacing and can be achieved as easily as inserting a single pacing electrode in the coronary sinus. Although monoventricular left ventricular pacing has been proven to yield comparable results with the standard biventricular modality, it is the advent of preferential left ventricular pacing, combining both the powerful resynchronization potential of multipolar coronary sinus and right-sided electrodes acting in concert and the ability to preserve intrinsic, physiological right ventricular activation.

Among original 6504 participants, 2450 subjects who had no cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and HTN at baseline were revisited, and 542 (22.1%) new cases of HTN were detected. There were minimal differences between most indices in the adjusted models; however, the best HTN predictors were BMI (OR per SD 1.32; 95% CI 1.12-1.56) and almost equally WC (1.35; 1.13-1.60) in men and WC (1.20; 1.04-1.39) in women. As a binary predictor, BMI with a cut-off point of 24.9 kg\/m2 in men (1.91; 1.40-2.62) and WC with a cut-off point of 98 cm in women (1.57; 1.17-2.10) were the best in adjusted models. WC, WHpR, and WHtR were significantly associated with an increased risk of HTN only in participants whose weight was normal (BMI, 18.5-24.9 kg\/m2). Therefore, BMI in men and WC in women were the best predictors of HTN, both as continuous and binary factors at their appropriate cut-off points.

This question was investigated in this study by comparison of dose-area product (DAP), reference air kerma (RAK), and fluoroscopy time (FT) among radial and femoral approaches. All coronary procedures between November 2015 and November 2017 were assessed; and 4215 coronary procedures were enrolled in the study. Patients with bifurcation, chronic total occlusion, cardiogenic shock, or prior coronary artery bypass surgery were excluded. These 4215 procedures were evaluated for three different categories: diagnostic CA (Group I), PCI in patients with stable angina (Group II), and PCI in patients with ACS (Group III). Age was significantly higher in the femoral arm of all groups. Among patients in the radial arm of Groups I and II, males were over-represented. Therefore, a multiple linear regression analysis with stepwise method was performed. After adjusting these clinical confounders, there was no significant difference with regard to DAP, RAK, and FT between femoral and radial access in Group I. In contrast, PCI via radial access was significantly associated with increased DAP, RAK, and FT in Groups II and III. In spite of an increased experience with trans-radial approach, PCI of coronary lesions via radial route was associated with a relatively small but significant radiation exposure in our study. Compared to femoral access, diagnostic CA via radial access was not related to an increased radiation exposure.

Data from the baseline and subsequent follow-ups within 1 year of diagnosis were included. An abbreviated risk assessment strategy was applied using the following variables: functional class (FC), 6-minute walk distance (6 MWD), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or BNP, right atrial (RA) area, pericardial effusion, the mean RA pressure, cardiac index, and mixed venous oxygen saturation. Three different methods were applied to categorize patients. A total of 189 subjects (46+-17 years, 23% male) were included. Sixty-one patients had died. The survival differed significantly between the risk groups both at diagnosis and during the follow-up. Patients with a low-risk profile had a better survival rate. An abbreviated risk assessment tool predicted mortality at early follow-up in the entire group and CHD, CTD subsets, and CTEPH, separately. An overall mortality among risk categories was significantly different according to each categorization method. The most reliable model comprised FC, 6 MWD, NT pro-BNP\/BNP, and the RA area at the follow-up. The abbreviated risk assessment tool may be valid for the PAH subsets and CTEPH.

In all other features, 2D and 3D echocardiography showed similar accuracy. A significant reason for inaccuracy by both echo modalities was that the technique itself could not visualize the feature, although the image quality was considered to be adequate. In most cases, where it was not possible to visualize the atrioventricular feature by 2D, it was possible by 3D, and vice versa.

After 3 days, the relative number of ischemic intramyocardial arteries in the left ventricle was lower in AVO treated with Mo than in without [0.04 (0.02-0.07) vs. 0.09 (0.07-0.14), point score unit]. After 1 day, ANP was lower in AVO treated with Mo than in without [0.95 (0.37-1.84) vs. 2.40 (1.33-3.09), fold changes from the baseline (FC), p=0.044], whereas after 1 and 3 days, YKL-40 was higher in AVO treated with Mo than in without [22.66 (14.05-28.83) vs. 10.06 (6.23-15.02), FC, p=0.006 and 6.03 (4.72-7.18) vs. 3.70 (2.62-5.35), FC, p=0.025]. Mo decreases intramyocardial arterial ischemia of the left ventricle after AVO while increases YKL-40, reflecting cellular protection during early cardiac remodeling.

Common variants of CDKN2B-AS1 (including rs4977574 A&gt;G and rs1333040 C&gt;T) are determined to be directly associated with CADs in many populations worldwide and suggested biomarkers for the early detection of CAD. There is a lack of investigation for the association between CDKN2B-AS1 rs4977574 A&gt;G and rs1333040 C&gt;T genetic modifiers and CAD in a Turkish Cypriot population. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effects of these variants on susceptibility to developing CAD in a Turkish Cypriot population and their contribution to lipid metabolism. Seventy-one patients with angiography-confirmed CAD were recruited to the CAD group, whereas 153 voluntary subjects without CAD symptoms were enrolled to the control group. Genotyping for the CDKN2B-AS1 gene polymorphisms was performed by polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. There is no statistical significant association observed between rs4977574 and rs1333040 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and two studied groups [odds ratio (OR): 0.763, p=0.185, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.511-1.139 and OR: 1.060, p=0.802, 95% CI: 0.672-1.671, respectively]. However, rs2977574 G and rs1333040 T alleles-the risk alleles-were found to be associated with higher level of serum total cholesterol and lower level of high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the CAD group (p=0.019, p=0.006 and p=0.022, p=0.031, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first study that establishes the effect of rs1333040 on lipid metabolism. The presence of rs4977574 G and rs1333040 T alleles and interaction may exist as environmental factors associated with lipid metabolism and might be responsible for the development of CAD in a Turkish Cypriot population.

SBP coefficient of variation (SCV) was calculated by dividing SSD with mean SBP. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the influence of PTB on long-time SSD and SCV in women. SSD and SCV of the PTB group (10.95 mm Hg and 9.05%, respectively) were higher than those of the NPTB group (9.81 mm Hg and 8.23%, respectively), but there were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05).

A total of 549 patients with HCM were enrolled consecutively. Left ventricular outflow tract gradients at rest (LOVTG-R) were measured by echocardiography. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, interventricular septum, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV), and left ventricular mass (LVM) were assessed using cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. Compared with the non-B antigen group, patients with B antigen had significantly higher LOVTG-R and LVEF values, worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, lower left ventricular volume index values, as well as no difference in LVM index values. After adjustments for sex, male patients with B antigen still had higher LOVTG-R values and frequency of NYHA classification III\/IV as well as lower LVEDV and LVESV index values. These differences were not present in female patients. Additionally, patients with NYHA classification III\/IV had lower LVEDV index values. In males, not females, patients with HCM with blood type B antigens exhibited worse cardiac functional capacity, higher LOVTG-R values, and lower left ventricular volume index values.

The use of FFR for revascularization decision-making demonstrated clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness compared with that of angiographic indices. Discrepancies between anatomical metrics and physiological assessment of CAD are frequent, which lead to change in revascularization decision from angiography compared to functional evaluation of CAD. Despite several clinical studies and guidelines recommending with high level of evidence demonstrating that FFR should be adopted in stable CAD, revascularization decision-making is still based on coronary angiogram in current practice. Because of the unique coronary anatomy, coronary stenosis characteristics, risk factors profile, and microcirculation quality, the unique evaluation based on epicardial coronary stenosis threshold failed to be a landmark of ischemia compared with FFR. Furthermore, coronary angiogram can detect only epicardial vessels, which represent only 10% of the entire coronary vasculature; therefore, microcirculation is not seen and is poorly assessed in clinical practice. Thus, the role of microcirculation is of importance in myocardial ischemia and might impact these discrepancies between angiography and FFR evaluation of CAD.

A tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia computer model was used to study three different modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (mBTS) anastomosis angle configurations with three different PA diameter configurations. Velocity and WSS were analyzed, and the flow rates at the right PA (RPA) and left PA (LPA) were calculated. A 4-mm and 8-mm diameter of RPA and LPA, respectively with vertical shunt angle produces the highest total flow. In the RPA larger diameter than the LPA configutations, the left-leaning shunt produces the lowest total PA flow whereas in the LPA larger diameter than the RPA configuratios, the right-leaning shunt produces the lowest total PA flow. Therefore, the shunt anastomosis should not be leaned through the narrow side of PA to reach best flow. As the flow inside the shunt increased, WSS also increased due to enhanced velocity gradients. The anastomosis angle between the conduit and PA affects the flow to PA. Vertical anastomosis configurations increase the total PA flow; thus, these configurations are preferable than the leaned configurations.

Therefore, a vicious circle is present in the relationship of heart failure and anemia. The consequence is reflected upon the patients' survival, quality of life, and hospital readmissions. Anemia and iron deficiency should be correctly diagnosed and treated in patients with heart failure. The etiology is multifactorial but certainly not fully understood. There is data suggesting that the following factors can cause anemia alone or in combination: iron deficiency, inflammation, erythropoietin levels, prescribed medication, hemodilution, and medullar dysfunction. There is data suggesting the association among iron deficiency, inflammation, erythropoietin levels, prescribed medication, hemodilution, and medullar dysfunction. The main pathophysiologic mechanisms, with the strongest evidence-based medicine data, are iron deficiency and inflammation. In clinical practice, the etiology of anemia needs thorough evaluation for determining the best possible therapeutic course. In this context, we must correctly treat the patients' diseases; according with the current guidelines we have now only one intravenous iron drug.

Recent studies among patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) have shown the importance of recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) in a significant number of patients. Recurrent CNVs that span several genes may affect other important organs, besides the heart. Because CHD may be the first presenting symptom in such patients, the analysis of recurrent CNVs in the genomic regions containing genes associated with CHD in patients referring to cardiology clinics may lead to an early diagnosis and the treatment of extracardiac symptoms in these patients. In this study, we aimed to screen CNVs of genomic regions including GATA4, NKX2-5, TBX5, BMP4, and CRELD1 genes and to analyse the 22q11.2 chromosomal region in apparently nonsyndromic patients with cardiac septal defects. Genomic regions including GATA4, NKX2-5, TBX5, BMP4, and CRELD1 genes and the 22q11.2 chromosomal region were analyzed in apparently nonsyndromic 45 patients with cardiac septal defects using the MLPA P-311 A2 Congenital Heart Disease kit. Multiplex ligationdependent probe amplification (MLPA) is an established technique for the detection of known CNVs. MLPA is substantially less expensive than array CGH and is relatively simple to use for clinicians without specific expertise in genomic technology; thus, MLPA could be used as a first-tier screening assay. We screened 45 patients with cardiac septal defects for CNVs using the MLPA P-311 A2 kit. We identified three CNVs (n=3\/45, 6.66%) and three 22q11 deletions. The CNVs were confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization.

Primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital events, all-cause mortality, new-onset myocardial infarction, acute heart failure, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were each of these considered separately. Predictive effects of AGV on the in-hospital outcomes in patients were analyzed. Patients with high MAGE levels had significantly higher incidence of total outcomes (9.9% vs. 4.8%, p=0.009) and all-cause mortality (2.3% vs. 0.4%, p=0.023) than those with low MAGE levels during hospitalization.

In 505 consecutive patients without any medical history of AF at baseline, the relationship between hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) variability and future AF incidence was evaluated, with adjustments for other possible confounding factors. HbA1c variability was determined by standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV). Over a median of 6.9-year follow-up period, 48 patients (9.5%) developed incident AF.

Mice were randomly divided into a sham-operation group (sham), an AMI operation group (AMI), and a nitrite pretreatment+AMI operation group (N+AMI). Seven days before the AMI operation, mice in the N+AMI group were pretreated with sodium nitrite in drinking water. One week after the AMI operation, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) activities in both AMI and N+AMI group were significantly higher than those in the sham group, but there were no significant differences between AMI and N+AMI mice. Contents of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the noninfarct area of the left ventricle in the N+AMI mice were significantly higher than those in the AMI mice, with no difference in the infarct area. Coagulation necrosis in the cardiomyocytes was observed in both AMI and N+AMI mice; however, it was less severe in the N+AMI mice. Western blot analyses showed that nitrite pretreatment resulted in up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2 and p21waf1\/cip1 signal proteins, but down-regulation of the proapoptotic factor Bax signal protein. Furthermore, nitrite pretreatment also showed significant alleviation of AMI-induced signal protein expressions of inflammatory factors of NF-K B and oxidative factors of Hsp 70 and HO-1. These results suggest that nitrite show certain protective effects against the ischemic effects induced by AMI in mice, which might be attributed to the synthesis of NO induced by iNOS through up-regulation of antiapoptotic factors and down-regulation of proapoptotic and inflammatory factors.

In total, 97 consecutive healthy subjects were recruited in this observational study. APV was measured using color M-mode echocardiography from the suprasternal window in the descending aorta. AS and AD were calculated using clinical blood pressure and the M-mode echocardiography-derived aortic diameters. Correlation analyses were performed between cardiovascular risk factors related to increased aortic stiffness (age, obesity, and blood pressure) and measured stiffness parameters (APV, AS, and AD). Correlation analyses were also performed among the measured stiffness parameters. Good correlation of age, blood pressure, and BMI with AS and AD was observed.

HDL particles are heterogeneous; they differ in proportion of proteins and lipids, size, shape, and charge. HDL heterogeneity is the result of the activity of several factors that assemble and remodel HDL particles in plasma: ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (HL), phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), endothelial lipase (EL), and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI).

Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (GLS), global area strain (GAS), global radial strain (GRS), and global circumferential strain (GCS) were obtained by 3DSTE. LVMI, LVEDV and LVESV of group C increased and GCS, GRS, GLS, and GAS of group C decreased compared with those of groups A and B (all p&lt;0.05). GAS and GLS decreased significantly compared with other parameters (both p&lt;0.01). LV remodeling and LV systolic dysfunction occurred in patients when the hemoglobin level was in the range of 6-9 g\/dL. 3DSTE can evaluate LV systolic function in patients with IDA, and GAS and GLS are more sensitive than other parameters.

A total of 140 children, including 75 mechanically ventilated (MV) and 65 spontaneously breathing (SB) children, who were admitted consecutively from March to August 2013 were evaluated prospectively. Data regarding the indication for echocardiography and therapeutic approaches used were documented. For evaluating disease severity, the Pediatric Risk of Mortality Score III (PRISM) was ascertained. The correlation between PRISM score and the requirement of echocardiographic evaluations were analyzed. Patients ages were between 45 days to 18 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.33. In 35.4% patients who underwent echocardiographic evaluation, no definitive alteration occurred in treatment approach, whereas in the remaining 64.6% patients, decisive or supplemental information was gathered. Echocardiography was indicated in 88% MV children and 46.2% SB children. Echocardiographic evaluation was necessary in MV children and there was a positive correlation between the PRISM score and the requirement of echocardiographic assessment (p&lt;0.001). Echocardiographic evaluation is an invaluable tool especially in MV children and the requirement of echocardiographic assessment increases according to clinical severity.

Serum globulin levels are a commonly used clinical index that represents inflammation and autoimmune response. This study aimed to determine the relationship between baseline serum globulin levels and the risk of recurrence after ablation in lone AF patients. We enrolled 348 lone AF patients undergoing radiofrequency catheter ablation for the first time for whom complete follow-up data were available. Pre-ablation peripheral venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of serum globulin levels. During the follow-up period of 22 months (range, 6-62), AF recurred in 129 patients (37.1%). Recurrence was associated with a low level of pre-ablation serum globulins. Multiple Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that persistent AF, AF duration, left atrial diameter, no amiodarone after ablation, and the serum globulin level in particular were independent predictors of AF recurrence. According to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the best diagnostic cut-off serum globulin level was 25.4 g\/L, which showed 74.4% sensitivity, 71.3% specificity, and 73.3% accuracy. The baseline low serum globulin level is associated with AF recurrence after first-time ablation in lone AF patients. Therefore, it may be used as a predictor of AF recurrence in these patients.

However, no study has shown an association with the absolute risk score of sudden cardiac death. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between QRS and the predicted risk score of sudden cardiac death at 5 years (HCM Risk-SCD) in HCM patients. In total, 115 consecutive HCM patients were included in this prospective observational study. The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence [fQRS(+) group (n=65)] or absence [fQRS(-) group (n=50)] of fQRS on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The HCM Risk-SCD (%) HCM Risk-SCD (&gt;6%) values and some echocardiographic parameters, including ventricular extrasystole, ventricular tachycardia, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, appropriate shock, and heart failure at the time of admission, were significantly higher in the fQRS(+) group than in the fQRS(-) group (all p&lt;0.05). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed fQRS and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class as independent predictors of HCM Risk-SCD. In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, an HCM Risk-SCD value of &gt;4 was identified as an effective cut-off point in fQRS for HCM. An HCM Risk-SCD value of &gt;4 yielded a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 76%. fQRS is determined to be an independent high-risk indicator of HCM Risk-SCD.

The entire core of chr9p21 is covered by \"ANRIL\" (Antisense noncoding RNA in INK4 Locus) and lies in a region that is free from any coding proteins; therefore, it is called the desert gene. The major objectives of this study were to examine the association of rs10757278 and rs2383206 SNPs on Chr9p21 with the incidence of CAD in the presence and absence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Egyptians and to correlate these genetic variants with several disease biomarkers (TC, CRP, and HbA1c). The study subjects consisted of 150 subjects; 50 healthy controls and 100 patients that were divided into two groups; CAD patients and CAD T2D patients. The genotyping of SNPs was performed using qPCR. Genotype distribution for both SNPs were found to be significantly different (p=0.0009 for rs10757278 and p=0.001 for rs2383206) between patients and controls. The allele frequency was also different for rs10757278. The current study showed that rs10757278\/rs2383206-G allele increases the risk for CAD in Egyptians.

On top of standard echocardiography we assessed: LA longitudinal systolic strain (LS), systolic (LSSR) and early diastolic strain rate (LESR) in four-chamber and twochamber apical views. All patients underwent transesophageal echocardiography disclosing LAAT in 36 (41%) patients. Subgroups with and without thrombi did not differ with regard to clinical characteristics. Univariate factors associated with LAAT were as follows: CH2ADS2-VASc Score, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV mass, and STE measurements. In a multivariate model only LVEF (p=0.002), LS (p=0.02), LESR (p=0.008), and LSSR (p=0.045) were independently associated with LAAT presence. Moreover, LVEF and LA STE measurements provided incremental value over the CH2ADS2-VASc Score.

In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial, patients with CAD were randomly divided into two groups: those receiving garlic powder or placebo tablets twice daily for 3 months. Brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed using ultrasound. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after period and PBMC and plasma were isolated. Human THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages, labeled with 3H-cholesterol, and incubated with plasma samples, and CE was assessed.

Stimulation of the sympathetic nerve is involved in AF occurrence. The gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) plays a key role in electrical conduction velocity in cardiac tissues, and under expression of Cx43 was linked with AF. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Cx43 was involved in sympathetic AF. Fifteen dogs were randomly divided into 3 groups (5 in each group). Sympathetic AF was induced in dogs and isolated canine atrial myocytes by isoproterenol (ISO) perfusion and rapid atrium pacing (RAP). The expression levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the atrial tissues were detected using immunohistochemical staining. The transcription and protein expression of Cx43 in the AF cell model was measured. Subsequently, Cx43 was blocked by short interfering (si) RNA in atrial myocytes and the gap junctional intercellular communication was detected using the scrape-loading and dye transfer assay. Sympathetic AF was successfully induced by a combination of ISO perfusion and RAP. The expression levels of NGF and TH were increased in the RAP group, and further increased in the RAP + ISO group. Tissue samples from the AF dogs had a lower Cx43 level than those of the control group (p&lt;0.05). The expressions of mRNA and protein of Cx43 in sympathetic AF cell model decreased by 26% and 28%, respectively, when compared with the control group, with p&lt;0.05. Silencing Cx43 in cells by siRNA could also efficiently reduce Cx43 expression. The relative levels of Cx45 mRNA were decreased by 73% compared with unaffected cells. The scrape-loading and dye transfer assay showed that gap junctional intercellular communication was hampered in the sympathetic AF cell model and silencing Cx43 could impede channel conduction. The results suggested that low expression of Cx43 was involved in sympathetic AF by influencing intercellular channel conduction. Intervention of Cx43 expression might be an appealing therapy to sympathetic AF.

The purpose of this study was to analyze some of the known HT risk factors contributing to the variations between urban and rural areas of Turkey in HT development. We used data from the 2011 Chronic Diseases and Risk Factors Survey that was conducted by the Turkish Ministry of Health on a representative sample of the Turkish adult population aged 20 years or more (n=16.227). HT was defined as having at least one of the following: a mean systolic\/diastolic blood pressure of at least 140\/90 mm Hg, a previously diagnosed disease, or use of antihypertensive medication. Stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate HT risk factors in urban and rural settings. Although the HT prevalence was higher in rural areas (28.4%) than in urban areas (23.9%), in this study, urbanization was found to be a contributing factor in multivariate regression analysis. Furthermore, separate regressions for urban and rural settings revealed that age, obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking were independently and positively associated (p&lt;0.05) with HT in both settings, while marital status, employment type, mental health, and lifestyle patterns; nutritional habits; and amount of physical activity and sedentary time (p&lt;0.05) were risk indicators in urban areas only.

Moreover, 30 (25.6%) of 117 patients with ICDs had a programming error. Furthermore, 6 (15%) of 40 patients with CRT-Ds had a programming error. To conclude, when all patients with CIEDs were assessed together, it was ascertained that 153 (38%) of 403 patients had programming errors. The prevalence of inappropriate programming of CIEDs by industry representatives was quite higher than expected.

Major bleeding events were defined according to the CRUSADE classification and their incidence was evaluated from hospital admission to one year of follow up. The CRUSADE bleeding risk score was calculated for each patient during the index admission. Incidence of major bleeding events was evaluated in each of the bleeding score quintiles. JoPCR1 is a prospective, observational, multicenter registry of consecutive patients who underwent PCI at 12 tertiary care centers in Jordan. A case report form was used to record data prospectively at hospital admission, at discharge, and at 1 and 12 months of follow-up. The study included 2426 consecutive patients who underwent PCI. During the index hospitalization, major and minor bleeding events occurred in 0.95% and 2.6% of patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only two variables were significantly associated with major bleeding: female gender (OR=3.7; 95% CI 1.6, 8.5; p=0.002) and past history of cardiovascular disease (OR=2.6; 95% CI 1.1, 5.9; p=0.026).

Thirty-two non-syndromic ASDII patients were screened for NKX2-5 variants using direct sequencing of polymerase chain reactionamplified coding regions. Risk factor rates were compared to general population and assessed using Fisher's exact and chi-square tests. In this retrospective study, criteria of exclusion were suggestive or confirmed syndrome association. Three heterozygous variants were detected in 4 patients.

Patients receiving drugs that interact with warfarin, having chronic liver or renal disease, obesity, or thyroid dysfunctions were excluded. Polymerase chain reaction (real time and restriction fragment length polymorphism) was used to analyze the CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1 polymorphisms. The ideal warfarin dose was calculated according to the patient's age, height, and the presence of CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and VKORC1 genetic polymorphisms. The mean daily administered doses and ideal doses were compared. Analysis of variance, Student's t-test, logistic regression analysis, and Pearson's correlation analysis were used for statistical analyses. The frequency of the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic polymorphisms was determined as CYP2C9*1\/*1 (54.6%), *1\/*2 (16.4%), *1\/*3 (24.2%), *2\/*3 (2.9%), *3\/*3 (1.9%), wild-type VKORC1 (26.6%), heterozygote alleles (52.7%), and mutant alleles (20.8%). Patients with allelic variants were found to require lower warfarin doses, and a 64.5% correlation was found between the calculated ideal doses and the administered warfarin doses. Considering CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic polymorphisms prior to commencing warfarin treatment will make it easier to reach target INRs and reduce the rate of complications.

Therefore, the aim of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate the main cardiological and hematological characteristics for better understanding myocardial complications in ET\/PV. A retrospective analysis was carried out involving 263 patients diagnosed with ET or PV (155\/108) between 1998 and 2014. Fourteen patients suffered MI during the hematological follow-up. Their clinical characteristics were compared to 162 patients (97 ET and 65 PV patients) who did not exhibit any major thrombotic complications (MI, stroke\/transient ischemic attack, and venous events) before or after hematological diagnosis of ET\/PV. Fourteen MI events occurred among the 263 patients (5.3%). Vascular risk factors were found in 92.9% (13\/14) of analyzed cases. In all, 71.4% of the MI complications developed within 12 months after the diagnosis of ET\/PV. The coronary angiography findings revealed ST-elevation MI in four cases and non-ST-elevation MI in 10. Significant stenosis of coronary arteries requiring percutaneous coronary intervention with a stent implantation was present in seven cases, while three had complex stenoses or previous grafts\/stents. All of them had undergone coronary artery bypass graft operations. The results of the present study suggest that early detection and consideration of individual management of vascular risk factors in ET\/PV patients are also important. Furthermore, a better theoretic understanding of platelet activation and role of leukocytes in myeloproliferative neoplasm-related thrombosis could open new perspectives in thrombosis prediction and prevention.

We aimed to investigate the effect of a high-fructose diet (HFD) on GLUT5 and AQP7 levels in the rat heart subjected to exercise. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to control (C; n=11), exercise (E; n=10), HFD (n=12), and HFD plus exercise (HFD-E; n=12) groups. HFD was started 28 days before euthanasia. From day 24 to 27, rats were subjected to moderate exercise, followed by vigorous exercise on day 28 (groups E and HFD-E). Cardiac GLUT5 and AQP7 mRNA levels were determined using RT-PCR. The protein contents of GLUT5 and AQP7 were immunohistochemically assessed. Paired-t, ANOVA with Bonferroni, Kruskal-Wallis, and Bonferroni-corrected Mann-Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis. GLUT5 mRNA expression and protein content did not differ between the groups. AQP7 mRNA levels significantly increased (4.8-fold) in group E compared with in group C (p&lt;0.001). Compared with group C, no significant change was observed in AQP7 mRNA levels in groups HFD and HFD-E. The AQP7 staining score in group E was significantly higher than that in groups C (p&lt;0.001), E (p&lt;0.001), and HFD-E (p&lt;0.001). Our study indicates that exercise enhances cardiac AQP7 mRNA expression and protein content. However, HFD prevents the exercise-induced increase in cardiac AQP7 expression. This inhibitory effect may be related to the competition between fructose and glycerol as energy substrates in the rat heart subjected to 5 days of physical exercise.

In particular, the inter-relationships between PH and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were investigated. The pulmonary artery responses of male Sprague Dawley rats were recorded using myography, and the quantities and activities of MMPs were analyzed in homogenates of the pulmonary arteries and lungs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, activity assays, and gelatin zymography techniques. Our results indicated that the therapeutic effects of sildenafil were accompanied by its suppressor effects on MMP activity. It was also shown that everolimus or alagebrium in combination with sildenafil showed additional regulatory effects on MMPs as well as functional responses on pulmonary artery pressure. Therefore, the enzymes in the MMP superfamily are likely to be target molecules for the treatment of PH. In conclusion, MMPs were involved in the pathogenesis of PH, and our results suggested that the addition of everolimus or alagebrium to sildenafil therapy may be beneficial in PH.

After stimulation with the mitogen platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB, 10 ng\/mL) in the presence or absence of RAD001 (10 nM), the promoter activity, mRNA expression, and protein expression of p27\/kip1 were examined by CAT assay, RT-PCR, and immunoblotting, respectively. Cell cycle-related changes were detected by flow cytometry. DNA synthesis was determined using 3H-TdR incorporation. Compared with the non-stimulation group, PDGF-BB stimulation induced a significant proliferative response in the VSMCs as indicated by decreased p27\/kip1 gene promoter activity, decreased p27\/kip1 mRNA and protein expression, increased S-phase and G2\/M-phase cells, and increased DNA synthesis. RAD001 intervention increased p27\/kip1 gene promoter activity 3.5-fold, promoted p27\/kip1 mRNA and protein expression, increased G0-phase cells, reduced DNA synthesis, and, overall, inhibited PDGF-BB-stimulated cell proliferation.

COPD patients admitted to our clinic during January-December 2014 and healthy controls were included in this prospective case control study. Patients with comorbidities, COPD exacerbation, and malignancies were excluded. Patients and controls were compared in terms of anthropometric measurements, MS-related examination and laboratory findings, pulmonary function tests, and EFT thickness. The correlations between EFT thickness and markers of MS in COPD were evaluated using the Student's t-test and logistic regression analysis. COPD patients and controls were composed of 82 and 84 individuals, respectively. MS was diagnosed in 31 (37.8%) COPD patients. The EFT thickness was significantly higher in COPD patients than in the controls and was also higher in COPD patients with MS than in those without MS (all p&lt;0.001). Each 1-mm increment of EFT raised the risk of MS two-fold (p=0.011, OR=2.08, 95% CI: 1.18-3.68).

In this study, we evaluated early and long-term results and quality of life (QOL) after simultaneous surgical radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of AF, left atrial reduction and mitral valve repair or replacement. Overall, 147 patients with mitral valve diseases who underwent mitral valve surgery were included in this prospective cohort study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the type of operation: the study group-patients after mitral valve surgery with concomitant radiofrequency surgical ablation and left atrial reduction procedure (54 patients), and the control group-patients undergoing only mitral valve surgery (93 cases). We assessed AF recurrence and sinus rhythm restoration rates and mortality rates, QOL measures, postoperative complications rates, and left atrial size during follow-up. In the study group, sinus rhythm restoration rate in the early postoperative period was 63%, but at the time of discharge it reduced to 29%; after 6 months, it significantly increased to 72% and after 3 years, to 81% (p=0.02). In the control group, the sinus rhythm restored only in 14% after 1 year, and at 3 years, it was 22%, although in the early postoperative period it, was 43%. Analysis of left atrial size before and after surgery showed that dimension significantly reduced in both groups (study group, p=0.013; control group, p=0.024). In addition, in patients undergoing surgical RFA procedure, there was a significant association between shorter heart disease history (p=0.02) and shorter AF history (p=0.074) with maintenance of sinus rhythm. The mortality rate in the study group was 4% (two patients) and in the control group 5% (five patients). Comparison of QOL measures between study and control groups after 1 year showed that patients undergoing concomitant atrial reduction surgery and RFA had significant improvement of QOL physical (p=0.03) and role (p=0.03) functioning, heartbeat (p=0.01), general (p=0.03) and mental health (p=0.01), vitality (p=0.007), and social role (p=0.02) functioning measures as compared to preoperative state, being higher than in patients who underwent only mitral valve surgery. Application of surgical RFA using irrigated cooling electrode and atrial reduction during mitral valve surgery is associated with higher restoration and maintenance of SR as compared to patients undergoing only mitral valve surgery. We did not observe complications related to AF surgery that required permanent pacemaker implantation. Performing concomitant surgery as surgical RFA, atrial reduction along with mitral valve surgery, improves QOL in the short- and long-term and reduces the feeling of heartbeat and discomfort.

The use of transvenous defibrillator lead systems is limited in pediatric patients because of a small body size and\/or limited vascular access. Subcutaneous array leads combined with an abdominally placed generator can enable implantation. This is a retrospective study of 13 patients who underwent subcutaneous defibrillator implantation between September 2010 and March 2015. The subcutaneous system was preferred because patients were not amenable to transvenous lead placement. The median patient age was 4.1 years, and the median patient weight was 12.1 kg. Diagnoses of patients were long-QT syndrome in 6, aborted cardiac arrest with left ventricular non-compaction in 3, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with sustained ventricular tachycardia in 3, and arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy in 1. Revision of the subcutaneous lead was required in 5 patients 2-26 months after the implantation. Appropriate shocks were observed in three patients. Inappropriate shock and lead fractures were observed in one patient during the follow-up period. The failure of therapy was observed in one patient. There were no perioperative complications and no early or late deaths.

The present study investigated the cardioprotective effect of metformin in rats with doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Wistar albino rats were used in the study. Forty male, 10-week-old Wistar albino rats were randomly divided four groups. The control group rats were intraperitoneally administered saline solution twice a week, four doses in total. The doxorubicin group rats received doxorubicin (4 mg\/kg, twice a week, cumulative dose: 16 mg\/kg) intraperitoneally. The metformin group rats received metformin (250 mg\/kg\/day, every day for 14 days) via gavage. The doxorubicin + metformin group rats received doxorubicin and metformin at the same dose. Left ventricular functions were evaluated by using M-mode echocardiography one day after the last dose of doxorubicin. Heart tissue samples were histopathologically examined. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected using in situ terminal deoxynucleotide transferase assay (TUNEL). Serum brain natriuretic peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide levels were measured.

The Sleep Heart Health Study demonstrated that OSA is a risk factor for stroke and that an increase of 1 unit in the apnea-hypopnea index increases stroke risk by 6% in men. Patients with OSA frequently have atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients with OSA and AF have an increased incidence of stroke compared with patients with only OSA. The treatment of OSA with CPAP reduces the incidence of stroke and decreases the recurrence rate of AF in patients undergoing pulmonary vein ablation procedures. Undertreated OSA has the potential to complicate the postoperative course of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and increase the frequency of arrhythmias and ischemic events. However, one prospective study demonstrated that OSA did not increase complications during the first 30 days following surgery but increased complications during the long-term follow-up. OSA is associated with increased atherosclerotic coronary disease and the development of coronary events and congestive heart failure. In summary, patients with OSA have an increased frequency of stroke and AF.

This is a prospective experimental study. Fifteen diabetic and 15 non-diabetic patients were included to the study. A total number of 96 graft samples were collected; 16 graft samples for each graft type from both diabetic and non-diabetic patients. Arterial grafts were harvested with pedicles and SV grafts were harvested by 'no touch' technique. Vasodilatation response of vascular rings to carbachol, which induces nitric oxide (NO) mediated vasodilatation, was designated as the measure of endothelial function. The IMA grafts had the most prominent NO mediated vasodilatation in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, concluding a better preserved endothelial function than SV and RA. The 'no- touch' SV and RA grafts had similar vasodilatation responses in non-diabetic patients.

Deteriorated function of RA grafts in diabetic patients, even worse than SV grafts made evident by this study, encourages the use of 'no touch' technique as the method of SV harvesting and more meticulous imaging of RA before its use as a graft in diabetic patients.

This prospective and randomized study consisted of 60 consecutive patients who underwent elective isolated CABG. Patients were divided into two groups to examine the influence of statins: those with postoperative statin therapy (statin group, n=30) and those without it (non-statin group, n=30). Patient data were collected and analyzed prospectively. In the statin group, each extubated patient was given 40 mg of atorvastatin per day, starting from an average of 6 hours after the operation. The overall incidence of postoperative AF was 30%. Postoperative AF occurred in 5 patients (16.7%) in the statin group. This was significantly lower compared with 13 patients (43.3%) in the non-statin group (p=0.049). According to the multivariate analysis, postoperative atorvastatin reduced the risk of postoperative AF by 49% [odds ratio (OR) 0.512, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.005 to 0.517, p=0.012].

The direct toxic effect of contrast media; ischemic damage caused by reactive oxygen species; increased perivascular hydrostatic pressure; high viscosity and changes in the activity of vasoactive substances play important roles in the pathogenesis. Tadalafil inhibits the phosphodiesterase enzyme which destroys nitric oxide. Nitric oxide causes renal vasodilatation, increases renal medullar blood flow and mediates the removal of free oxygen radicals. Drugs that increase levels of nitric oxide are expected to reduce the development of contrast nephropathy due to contrast media. We aimed to test the hypothesis that tadalafil reduces the development of contrast nephropathy due to contrast toxicity.

However, the relationship between oxidative stress and complexity and intensity of coronary artery disease is less clear. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between oxidative stress markers and the complexity and intensity of coronary artery disease in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Sixty-seven consecutive patients with an early phase of ACS (&lt;3 h) were included in this single-centre, cross-sectional, prospective study. Syntax and Gensini scores were calculated based on angiographic findings. Patients were divided into two CAD complexity groups according to their Syntax scores: low SYNTAX score (&lt;22) and moderate to high SYNTAX score (&gt;=22). Likewise patients were divided into two CAD severity groups according to the median Gensini score of 64: less intensive CAD with Gensini score (&lt;64) and intensive CAD with Gensini score &gt;=64. Blood samples were taken in 1 hour within administration in order to measure total oxidative status (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels determined by Erel method. Oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated by TOS \/TAC. There was no significant difference between the two SYNTAX groups for oxidative stress markers. Median TOS and OSI values were significantly high in the intensive CAD group (p=0.005, p=0.04, respectively). The Gensini score was positively correlated with TOS and OSI (p=0.003, p=0.02, respectively).

Patients with CAD were categorized as mild and severe atherosclerosis, according to their Gensini score. Eighty patients with normal coronary arteries formed the control group. Mean PLR values of the three study groups were compared. Also, PLR value was tested for whether it showed a positive correlation with Gensini score. The mean PLR of the severe atherosclerosis group was significantly higher than that of the mild atherosclerosis and controls groups (p&lt;0.001). Also, PLR was positively correlated with Gensini score in CAD patients. A cut-off value of 111 for PLR predicted severe atherosclerosis with 61% sensitivity and 59% specificity.
