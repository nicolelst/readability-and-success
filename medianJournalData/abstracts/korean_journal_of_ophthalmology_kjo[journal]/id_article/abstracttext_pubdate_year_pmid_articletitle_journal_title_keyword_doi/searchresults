investigate the characteristics and distribution of ocular dominance in primary open-angle glaucoma (OAG) eyes. In addition, we tried to catch any trend of ocular dominance according to the stage of disease. Two hundred participants with bilateral OAG underwent ocular dominant testing by 'the hole-in-a-card' test. Using optical coherence tomography, macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), as well as circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) were measured and compared according to ocular dominance. Of the two eyes of one subject, the eye with less glaucomatous damage based on mean deviation (MD) was considered to be the 'better eye' in our study. Ocular dominance was in the right eye in 66% of the population and ocular dominance was positioned in the better eye in 70% of the population (p= 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). In conditional logistic regression analyses, right eye and better MD were significantly associated with ocular dominance (p= 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Ocular dominance tends to be present in the better eye and this trend was more apparent as the severity of glaucoma increased. Inter-eye comparison of visual field indices and RNFLT between dominant vs non-dominant eye become apparent in moderate and advanced glaucoma whereas it was not as apparent in early glaucoma. In glaucomatous eyes, laterality and severity of glaucoma determined ocular dominance. Inter-eye difference between non-dominant and dominant eyes increased with the severity of glaucoma. Our findings suggest the existence of potential reciprocal interactions between ocular dominance and glaucoma.

Patients with third nerve palsy who underwent the frontalis sling operation using a silicone rod between 2008 and 2019 were included in this study. The medical records of all patients were reviewed, and their clinical characteristics and postoperative outcomes were analyzed. In this retrospective, interventional case series, the main outcome measures were eyelid contour, eyelid height by margin reflex distance, and corneal status. Twenty-four eyes of 18 patients (12 male and six female patients) were included. The mean age at the time of surgery was 35.1 years (range, 5-64 years). Twelve patients underwent a unilateral ptosis operation, and six patients received a bilateral ptosis operation. The mean follow-up period was 32.1 months (range, 2-87 months). Most patients (21 of 24 eyes, 88%) showed poor Bell's phenomenon on preoperative examination. Satisfactory eyelid height and eyelid contour were achieved in almost all patients (mean postoperative margin reflex distance, +1.2 mm) postoperatively. Although corneal erosions were detected for several months in eight of 24 eyes after surgery, these findings were well controlled medically with artificial tear eye drops and ointments. Frontalis sling surgery using a silicone rod can safely and effectively correct ptosis without severe corneal complications in patients with third nerve palsy. Our study outlines a new method to define the postoperative safety outcome by specifically focusing on categorized corneal status.

There is limited data on vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) among children with severe type of ROP in developing countries. This study evaluated the influence of threshold and pre-threshold ROP on VRQoL in Malaysian children. Multicenter prospective cross-sectional study conducted in three tertiary hospitals in 2018 to 2019. Children less than seven years old with previous ROP diagnosis were recruited and divided into threshold, high-risk and low-risk pre-threshold subgroups. Patients with systemic comorbidities that affected vision or daily activities were excluded. A parent\/guardian completed the Children's Visual Function Questionnaire (CVFQ) for the assessment of child's general health, general vision, competence, personality, family impact and treatment difficulty. Eight were categorized with threshold ROP, 16 with high-risk pre-threshold ROP, and 26 with low-risk pre-threshold ROP. 50 age-matched controls were also included. Mean visual acuity in logMAR was 0.46 in the threshold, 0.08 in high risk pre-threshold and 0.01 in low-risk pre-threshold subgroups. Threshold ROP was associated with myopia and strabismus, and associated with poor visual acuity compared to pre-threshold ROP. Mean total CVFQ score was significantly lower in the ROP group (p&lt;0.001) compared to the control group. Mean score and all mean subscale scores were significantly lower in the threshold subgroup compared to high-risk and low-risk pre-threshold subgroups, with lowest subscale scores on general vision and general health. There was significant association between gestational age, visual acuity of the better eye and family income and VRQoL (p&lt;0.05). ROP was associated with lower VRQoL in children born prematurely in Malaysia. The threshold ROP group is the most affected. General vision and health domains are their main difficulties encountered. Gestational age, visual acuity of the better eye and family income affects the VRQoL.

A retrospective chart review of 51 patients who were diagnosed as paralytic strabismus and underwent BTXA chemodenervation was performed. The patients were divided into four groups according to the cause of paralytic strabismus of vasculopathy, neoplasm, trauma, and idiopathic. They were also divided into two groups of early and late treatment according to the initiation time of BTXA chemodenervation after the onset of strabismus (3 months), and of the initial strabismus type of exotropia and esotropia. We investigated the changes of angle of deviation and diplopia after BTXA chemodenervation. The average deviation of angles decreased by 25.2 prism diopter (PD) (35.1 to 9.9 PD) in total patients, and the overall success rate was 64.7% (33 by 51), and the there was no statistically significant difference in success rate between each group divided by the cause of paralytic strabismus. According to the treatment timing, the deviation of the angle decreased by 28.0 PD (36.8 to 8.8 PD) in the early treatment group, and 21.3 PD (33.5 to 12.2 PD) in late treatment group at the time of the last postinjective follow-up. According to the initial strabismus type, the average angle of deviation decreased by 20.3 PD (35.6 to 15.3 PD) in exotropia group by cranial nerve 3 palsy, and 24.4 PD (32.5 to 8.1 PD) in esotropia by cranial nerve 6 palsy. BTXA chemodenervation reduced the angle of deviation and the number of patients with diplopia regardless of the cause of paralytic strabismus. Early BTXA chemodenervation can be considered as the first treatment of choice in paralytic strabismus, especially in esotropia patients.

Medical records of 16 patients diagnosed with OIS between November 2017 and August 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. In every nine areas of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid, we compared the differences in choroidal thickness between the eyes with OIS and unaffected eyes, and its change in the OIS eyes during the follow-up period using swept-source optical coherence tomography. We analyzed the best-corrected visual acuity, intraocular pressure, fluorescein angiography (FAG) parameters, systemic diseases, and the duration of symptoms. Correlation between FAG parameters and the choroidal thickness value ratio in the OIS eyes and the unaffected eyes, and changes in the choroidal thickness in the OIS eyes during follow-up were investigated. Median age of the subjects was 67.5 years. In the OIS eyes, all FAG parameters were delayed at the initial examination. Best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were significantly different between the OIS and unaffected eyes. While the choroidal thickness in every nine areas of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study in the OIS eyes was lesser than the unaffected eyes, the choroidal thickness of inner temporal, outer nasal, and outer temporal area showed statistically significant difference. During follow-up, changes in choroidal thickness of OIS eyes as well as correlation between the FAG parameters and the choroidal thickness value ratio between the OIS eyes and the unaffected eyes were not found to be statistically significant. The choroidal thickness of the eyes with OIS was significantly less compared with the unaffected eyes. We inferred that choroidal thinning takes place in the early phase of the disease as the changes in choroidal thickness during the follow-up period were not significant.

Light transmission spectra of seven IOL models were assessed with a spectrophotometer. The transmittance properties were analyzed in 1 nm units from 350 nm wavelength to 800 nm. Three ultraviolet filtering IOL models (ZCB00, XC1-SP, and AT LISA 809M) showed nearly full transmittance of the light from 400 to 500 nm, while steeply attenuating light with shorter wavelengths in various degrees. Three blue-light filtering IOLs (yellow-tinted IOLs; XY1, SN60WF, and TNFT00) showed a slow-sloped increase of light transmission between 400 to 500nm. Among the three, XY1 showed different degree of inclination, showing a steeper slope than SN60WF and TNFT00. The violet-light filtering IOL (ZFR00V) showed a rapid increase of the transmission at around 435 nm wavelength, which is similar to ultraviolet filtering IOLs. The seven different IOLs measured showed different characteristics of light transmission depending on the properties of each material and color. Blue-light filtering IOLs tend to blocked a wide range of wavelength up to 500 nm, but rather were not effective at the range of 400 to 430 nm. Violet-light filtering IOL showed advantages in filtering the high-energy wavelength, around 430 nm, having a potential risk to retina and allowing the transmission of useful blue and green wavelength which is necessary for a better scotopic contrast sensitivity.

Systematic PubMed, Embase and Cochrane database searches for Northeast Asian population-based studies published up to 30 November 2020 and reporting on myopia and OAG diagnosis. By random-effect models, pooled OAG prevalence in a myopic population and pooled myopic OAG prevalence in a general population were generated, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The meta-analysis encompassed five population-based studies in four countries (12,830 individuals, including 7,723 patients with myopia and 1,112 patients with OAG). In a myopic population, OAG prevalence was 4.10% (95% CI, 3.00-5.70; I2 = 93%); in a general population, myopic OAG prevalence was 1.10% (95% CI, 0.60-1.70; I2 = 94%). A visual examination of funnel plot symmetry raised a suspicion of publication bias. Notwithstanding, Begg and Mazumbar's adjusted rank correlation test showed no such evidence (p = 0.6242). Our systematic review and meta-analysis returned an estimate of OAG prevalence in a myopic Northeast Asian population. Our findings will inform future glaucoma studies as well as public health guidelines for Northeast Asian populations.

Many different treatment modalities are suggested but controversy remains regarding effectiveness of these treatments. The purpose of this study is to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis in addition to analyzing retrospective data at our own tertiary care center regarding effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) in treatment of CRAO. The PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library are searched from the date of database inception to September 2021 to conduct a review based on the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis), evaluating the role of HBOT in visual recovery of CRAO patients. In addition, a retrospective chart review of patients clinically diagnosed with CRAO at our university-based hospital (University of Texas Health, San Antonio, TX, USA) from year 2011 to 2021 was conducted. After a review of 376 articles, three articles met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, where a total of 207 patients received HBOT versus 89 patients that did not receive any form of oxygen therapy. Analysis of these results demonstrate that HBOT in CRAO patients does not enhance the final visual outcome (p = 0.83). Similar conclusion was also drawn from retrospective analysis of 48 patients (15 HBOT versus 33 controls) at our tertiary care center, where no visual benefit was observed in the HBOT group. HBOT does not appear to improve final visual outcome and concerns remain regarding adverse reactions such as barotrauma and generalized seizures.

Quantitative parameters, including vessel area, vessel diameter, vessel length, fractal dimension, and lacunarity were analyzed from en face images of CNV and Haller vessels. Clinical information, including logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity and injection number of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor were acquired after 12 months from OCTA date. Using logistic regression analyses, parameters associated with logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA loss of 0.2 or more (VA loss group) and a number of injections of four or more (unstable group) after 12 months were analyzed. In typical nAMD, the VA loss group was associated with a smaller number of intersections of Haller vessels. The unstable group was associated with an increased lacunarity of CNV in typical nAMD. In PCV, both VA loss and unstable groups were associated with a higher maximal diameter of Haller vessels. VA loss and injection number of nAMD and PCV 12 months after OCTA imaging were associated with different morphological parameters of CNV and Haller vessels. Therefore, quantitative analyses of both CNV and Haller vessels from OCTA and en face optical coherence tomography might provide prognostic information about visual outcome and injection frequency within 12 months after OCTA imaging.

This study included 47 glaucomatous eyes with PICC, as identified by color fundus photography and optical coherence tomography scanning of the optic nerve head area. Peripapillary choroidal microvasculature was evaluated on en-face OCTA images. Choroidal MvD was defined as a focal sectoral capillary dropout with no visible microvascular network. PICC was visible as a well-demarcated area with homogeneously reduced vessel density in en-face OCTA images of the choroidal layer. MvD was detected in 42 eyes (89.4%). Although located in the juxtapapillary area adjacent to the PICC, MvD was confined to the area of parapapillary atrophy. MvD observed in OCTA en-face images was distinguished from the area of PICC by the absence of vascular signal. Of the 50 PICCs, 49 (98.0%) had hemifield visual field defects at the location corresponding to the hemispheric location of PICC. PICC was found to have a characteristic microvascular feature in choroidal en-face OCTA images, and to be topographically associated with glaucomatous visual field defect. PICC was frequently accompanied by MvD and was located adjacent to the area of MvD, suggesting that PICC and MvD have similar pathogenesis.

Greater improvement in uncorrected visual acuity was observed in the ICRS + CXL group than in the ICRS or CXL alone groups at both 6 (p = 0.008) and 12 months (p = 0.028). Refractive errors of sphere and spherical equivalent were significantly reduced in both the ICRS (p = 0.002 at 6 months, p = 0.004 at 12 months) and ICRS + CXL groups (p &lt; 0.001 at both 6 and 12 months). Keratometric values including the maximum, minimum, and average were significantly reduced in all 3 groups at postoperative 6 and 12 months; however, the greatest reductions were observed in the ICRS + CXL group (all p &lt; 0.001). ICRS implantation followed by CXL within 1 month seems to be effective, and may be superior to ICRS or CXL alone in improving visual acuity and reducing refractive errors and keratometric values.

This was a retrospective review of patients presenting to uveitis management services in Auckland and Hamilton, New Zealand between 2003 to 2018 with uveitis and positive toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin M serology. We identified 16 patients with primary acquired toxoplasmosis infection and ocular involvement. The mean age was 53 years. Systemic symptoms were reported in 56% (9 \/ 16). Visual acuity was reduced to 20 \/ 30 or less in 50% of patients (8 \/ 16). A single focus of retinitis without a pigmented scar was the salient clinical feature in 69% (11 \/ 16). Optic nerve inflammation was the sole clinical finding in 19% (3 \/ 16). Bilateral arterial vasculitis was the sole clinical finding in 13% (2 \/ 16). A delay in the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis of more than two weeks occurred in 38% (6 \/ 16) due to an initial alternative diagnosis. Antibiotic therapy was prescribed in all cases.

All patients underwent incision and curettage through the lacrimal ductule, and granules or concretions were removed. After the procedure, oral and topical antibiotics, oral anti-inflammatory agent were used for a week. Clinical presentations of the patients were analyzed. The resolution of symptoms and inflammatory signs and recurrence were evaluated more than 12 months after the procedure including telephone follow-up by a specialist nurse. Common symptoms were a painful, swelling mass with mucous discharge (17 eyes) and conjunctival injection (7 eyes) at the lateral canthal area. During the procedure, 22 patients (91.7%) had typical sulfur granule of Actinomyces, and 10 patients (41.7%) had many cilia in the expressed debris from the ductule. Twenty-three of 24 patients had resolution of symptoms after the procedure and all but one patient (95.8%) showed no recurrence. Incision and curettage is a simple and less invasive procedure that may be considered as a first treatment option for lacrimal gland ductulitis.

Subjects were divided into two groups-a muscle-dominant group composed of patients who had extraocular muscle enlargement on preoperative orbital computed tomography scan and a fat-dominant group composed of patients who did not show extraocular muscle enlargement on preoperative orbital computed tomography scan-and subgroup analysis was performed. Preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure, exophthalmos, LCD, and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness were evaluated. At baseline, LCD was remarkably shallower in the muscle-dominant group than in the fat-dominant group (95% confidence interval, p = 0.007).

All 24 patients randomly received Botox or Neuronox in the periorbital region in a masked, randomized split-face manner, keeping the injection sites and doses uniform. The toxin preparation, injection, and clinical evaluations were done by three independent observers. Objective outcome measures included improvement in the severity of spasm, grading of the functional visual status, changes in palpebral fissure height, lagophthalmos, superficial punctate keratitis and Schirmer's test at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and upon conclusion of the effect of the toxin. Subjective outcome measures included duration of the effect and a forced choice stating which half of the face was better.

In OCT, glaucoma was defined as when the color of the superior or inferior quadrant of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness map was yellow (borderline, &lt;5%) or red (outside normal limits, &lt;1%). In OCTA, glaucoma was determined using the cut-off value of the superior or inferior peripapillary vessel density, calculated after receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

The subjects were classified into three respective groups: group A (71 eyes, Guardix-Sol 1.5 g), group B (89 eyes, HyFence 1.5 mL), and group C (38 eyes, Mediclore 1 cc). The three groups were evaluated by asking patients about subjective symptoms and by performing lacrimal irrigation tests and endoscopic examinations. There were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, timing of tube removal, or follow-up period among the three groups. There were no statistically significant differences in success rates among the three groups (p = 0.990, 91.5% [65 \/ 71], 92.1% [82 \/ 89], and 92.1% [35 \/ 38], respectively). HyFence and Mediclore are safe and effective adjunctive modalities following endonasal DCR compared to Guardix-Sol. Therefore, these agents can be considered good alternatives to Guardix-Sol to increase the success rate of endonasal DCR in treating patients with poor prognosis.

Of the 101 patients enrolled, 78 (77.2%) were women. The mean age was 64.9 years old. Hypertension was the most common medical disorder (42.6%), followed by diabetes mellitus. The majority of the patients were non-smokers (83.2%) and drank less than a cup of a caffeinated beverage a day (30.7%). Fifty-seven percent of patients reported no stressful events immediately prior to symptom development. Fatigue and stress were aggravating factors in more than 55% of patients; rest was the most common relieving factor (35.6%). Here, we report the clinical features of benign essential blepharospasm in Korean patients for the first time. The results were consistent with previous reports showing that the majority of benign essential blepharospasm patients are women and non-smokers. In contrast to previous reports though, fatigue and stress were aggravating factors, and the most common relieving factor was rest.

We used optical coherence tomography (OCT) to determine the effectiveness of the above quantities for early diagnosis of MCI or AD. Ninety eyes were considered in this study, split between 30 normal eyes, 30 eyes from patients with MCI, and 30eyes from patients with AD. All subjects underwent ophthalmologic and cognitive examinations, and measurements of the RNFL thickness as well as macular volume and thickness were taken for all patients using OCT. The mean RNFL thickness upon OCT was significantly thinner in the AD group than in the MCI group (p = 0.01). The RNFL was thinner in the superior quadrant in patients with AD when compared to the healthy controls (p = 0.03). The RNFL thicknesses in the inferior, nasal, and temporal quadrants did not differ significantly between the groups. Measurements in the 12 clock-hour zones revealed that zone 11 had a significantly thinner RNFL in the AD group as compared with the healthy control group (p = 0.02). In zone 2, the MCI group had a significantly thinner RNFL than the AD group (p = 0.03). Our OCT findings revealed a neuroanatomic difference in the RNFL thickness among the three groups, i.e., the AD, MCI, and healthy control groups. This suggests that a change in average RNFL thickness could be a meaningful index for diagnosing early AD.

The presence of ERM was determined by using fundus photographs. The prevalence of ERM was estimated and possible risk factors including systemic factors, nutritional status, and blood tests were analyzed via multiple logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of ERM was 2.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6% to 3.3%). On multiple logistic regression analysis, the prevalence of ERM was affected by age. The odds ratios (ORs) against the forties were 2.70, 5.48, and 5.69 in the fifties, sixties, and seventies, respectively. ERM was also significantly affected by cataract surgery (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.08 to 3.81) and by the increase in intake of 100-mg calcium (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.11).

This study enrolled 25 keratoconus and 25 myopic patients with corrected vision over 0.8 according to the Snellen chart due to treatment with contact lenses. Patients were surveyed prior to the wearing of contact lenses, and again after three months of contact lens usage with a questionnaire about quality of vision and life. The changes in visual function, visual symptoms, and psycho-social well-being before and after contact lens usage were analyzed. The keratoconus patients' overall degree of satisfaction was higher than the overall degree of satisfaction of myopic patients, and the motivation for contact lens usage and purpose of contact lens treatment were different in the two groups. Keratoconus patients experienced greater changes in satisfaction, particularly in satisfaction during night activities, short-distance work, and the reading of fine print. Furthermore, they experienced fewer dry eye symptoms but greater foreign body sensations than patients with myopia following treatment with contact lenses. No statistically significant differences in social role functions existed between the two groups. Keratoconus patients had a lower expectation of visual acuity recovery before treatment with contact lenses (Mann-Whitney U-test, p = 0.049) compared to myopic patients, and more anxiety about vision loss following treatment (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.018) compared to their level of anxiety about vision loss before treatment with contact lenses. Although the same treatment was applied, keratoconus and myopic patients experienced different types of discomfort and areas of improvement in contact lens corrected vision. Therefore, not only corrected vision, but also subsequent improvement and discomfort outcomes should be considered by patients when choosing contact lens treatment.

Tear meniscus height, 2% fluorescein dye disappearance test and lacrimal pathway irrigation were measured or performed. For treatment, a punctal snip operation and silicone tube placement were performed, and the peripunctal histopathological findings were evaluated. Punctal stenosis was classified into four types: membranous type (17 eyes, 21.5%), slit type (11 eyes, 13.9%), horseshoe type (25 eyes, 31.6%), and pinpoint type (26 eyes, 32.9%). The tear meniscus was significantly higher, and the 2% fluorescein dye disappeared significantly more slowly in the punctal stenosis group. However, correlation of the tear meniscus height and 2% fluorescein dye disappearance test with the punctum shape was not statistically significant. A history of previous chemotherapy was significantly associated with the occurrence of punctal stenosis, especially the membranous type (p &lt; 0.05). Histopathologic evaluation of the punctum showed differences between the punctum types. Pinpoint puncta exhibited a high density of muscle fibers, while they were faintly visible in the membranous type. Acquired punctal stenosis has various shapes, and the major types of stenotic puncta exhibited unique histopathologic features.

This study involved 36 eyes of 36 consecutive patients who underwent successful surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. A complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including clinical fundus examination, optical coherence tomography, and indocyanine green angiography, was conducted before and after surgery. Delayed absorption was defined as the presence of residual concave SRF or an SRF bleb at 6 months after surgery. Clinical factors and choroidal features on indocyanine green angiography were compared according to the presence and absence of delayed absorption. Eighteen of 36 eyes (50%) showed delayed absorption. Macular involvement and worse preoperative visual acuity were significantly related to the presence of delayed absorption (p = 0.001 and p = 0.034, respectively). On indocyanine green angiography, preoperative choroidal vascular hyperpermeability was noted in 70% of eyes with delayed absorption and in 14% of eyes without it (p = 0.010). Delayed absorption of SRF after retinal reattachment surgery was not rare, with a 50% of incidence in this study. Macula-off status was significantly related to the incidence of delayed SRF absorption, and choroidal features such as choroidal vascular hyperpermeability might be responsible in part, possibly through the resultant exudative property of choroid.

The diagnosis of endophthalmitis depends mostly on the clinical findings on ophthalmological examination. Delayed diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis can lead to not only visual loss, but also increased risk of mortality. Since ocular and systemic symptoms of endophthalmitis are usually non-specific, early diagnosis relies on the alertness of clinicians. Early diagnosis and proper treatment are keys to saving the eye.

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 121 patients with monocanalicular or common canalicular obstruction who had undergone endonasal DCR with random bicanalicular insertion of either double silicone tubes (insertion of two tubes into each canaliculus) or a single wide-diameter (0.94 mm) silicone tube. The tubes were removed at around 3 months after surgery. This study included 79 eyes of 61 patients in the double-tube intubation group and 68 eyes of 60 patients in the single wide-diameter tube intubation group. Anatomical success, evaluated by syringing, was achieved in 72 of the 79 eyes (91.1%) in the double-tube intubation group and 60 of the 68 eyes (88.2%) in the single wide-diameter tube intubation group. Functional success was achieved in 65 of the 79 eyes (82.3%) in the double-tube intubation group and 61 of the 68 (89.7%) eyes in the single wide-diameter tube intubation group. There were no significant differences in the success rates of surgery between the two groups. One patient in the double-tube intubation group underwent conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy (CDCR) and two in the wide-diameter tube intubation group underwent CDCR or reintubation to treat recurrence. Intubation using a single wide-diameter tube during endonasal DCR is as effective as double-tube intubation for the treatment of canalicular obstruction, with a lower rate of complications such as inflammation or patient discomfort.

The ophthalmologists determined if an eye was glaucomatous based on the criteria set forth by the International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology and by the appearance of the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic disc. If the subjects previously underwent an ophthalmologic examination, they were enrolled based on the documented history. In addition to fundus photographs, each participant underwent a systemic examination including blood sampling and sociodemographic and behavioral questionnaires. The subjects were divided into five groups according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level.

Of the 212 patients included for clinical analysis, 33, 23, 11, 7, and 190 exhibited LH, FT-MH, impending MH, macular pseudohole, and epiretinal membrane, respectively. We reviewed visual acuity, macular morphology, and clinical course. Surgical specimens were analyzed histologically. EPMH presented as an amorphous proliferation starting from the defective inner\/outer segment (IS\/OS) junction covering the inner macula surface. Among the 16 patients with EPMH, 11 underwent vitrectomy, and all exhibited the intraoperative perifoveal crown phenomenon. EPMH tissue was sampled in three patients, one of whom had more tissue removed than intended and showed delayed recovery in visual acuity. Despite hole closure, IS\/OS junction integrity was not successfully restored in four of 11 patients. Five patients were followed-up without surgical intervention. Visual acuity slightly decreased in three patients and did not change in one patient, while the remaining patient was lost during follow-up.

In total, 110 patients were eligible for this study after excluding patients with arteritic CRAO, a lack of follow-up, iatrogenic CRAO secondary to cosmetic filler injection, or NVI detected before CRAO attack. Fluorescein angiography (FA) was applied until retinal arterial reperfusion was achieved, typically within 1 to 3 months. The incidence of NVI was 10.9% (12 out of 110 patients). Neovascular glaucoma was found in seven patients (6.4%). The mean time to NVI diagnosis after CRAO events was 3.0 months (range, 1 week to 15 months). The cumulative incidence was 5.5% at 3 months, 7.3% at 6 months, and 10.9% at 15 months. Severely narrowed ipsilateral carotid arteries were observed in only three patients (27.3%).

We randomly selected 33 eyes (33 patients) and treated them with artificial tears four times a day for three months, 29 eyes (29 patients) were treated with topical 0.02% mitomycin C four times a day for five days, 34 eyes (34 patients) were treated with topical 0.05% cyclosporine four times a day for three months, and 36 eyes (36 patients) were treated with topical 2.5% bevacizumab four times a day for three months after surgery. We prospectively determined the recurrence rates of pterygium and complications at the six-month follow-up examination. At six months after surgery, the recurrence rates in each group were as follows: 45.5% (15 eyes) in the control group, 10.3% (three eyes) in the mitomycin C group, 20.6% (seven eyes) in the cyclosporine group, and 41.7% (15 eyes) in the bevacizumab group (p = 0.004). No serious complications, except subconjunctival hemorrhages, were observed in any group.

It also identified the factors affecting surgical success rates associated with this technique. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 57 patients (59 eyes) in whom a canalicular obstruction was encountered during endoscopic DCR. All patients were treated with endoscopic DCR, followed by canalicular trephination and silicone tube placement. The surgical outcome was categorized as a functional success according to the patient's subjective assessment of symptoms, including epiphora, and as an anatomical success according to a postoperative nasolacrimal duct irrigation test. Surgical success rates were compared based on age, sex, location of the obstruction, number of silicone tubes, and experience of the surgeon. Functional success was achieved in 55 of 59 eyes (93%) at one month, 50 eyes (84%) at three months, and 46 eyes (78%) at six months. Anatomical success was achieved in 58 of 59 eyes (98%) at one month, 52 eyes (88%) at three months, and 50 eyes (84%) at six months. There was a statistically significant difference in surgical outcome according to the experience of the surgeon. The anatomical success rate at the six-month follow-up exam was 95.4% in the &gt;5 years of experience group, and 53.3% in the &lt;5 years of experience group (p = 0.008, Pearson chi-square test). The success rate of canalicular trephination combined with endoscopic DCR in patients with a distal or common canalicular obstruction decreased gradually during the six-month follow-up period.

This study was performed with 22 eyes of New Zealand white rabbits. Dorzolamide\/timolol eyedrops with preservative (Cosopt group) or without preservative (Cosopt-S group) were diluted with a balanced salt solution at a 1 : 1 ratio. We injected 0.1 mL of diluted Cosopt into the anterior chamber of left eyes and an equal volume of diluted Cosopt-S into the anterior chamber of right eyes. Corneal thickness, corneal haze, and conjunctival injection were measured before and 24 hours after treatment. Endothelial damage was compared between both eyes by vital staining (alizarin red\/trypan blue staining), live\/dead cell assay, TUNEL assay, and scanning electron microscopy. Corneal endothelial damage was severe in the Cosopt group. Cosopt-treated eyes exhibited remarkable corneal edema and prominent apoptosis of endothelial cells. In addition, the live\/dead cell assay revealed many dead cells in the endothelium, and scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that corneal endothelial cells exhibited a partial loss of microvilli on the surface as well as extensive destruction of intercellular junctions. However, in the Cosopt-S group, corneal edema was mild and the damage to the corneal endothelium was minimal. The main cause of corneal endothelial toxicity was due to the preservative in the dorzolamide\/timolol fixed combination eyedrops, and not the active ingredient. Thus, it appears to be safer to use preservative-free eyedrops during the early postoperative period.

Eight rabbits were divided into experimental and control groups of four rabbits each. Phacoemulsification and irrigation and aspiration were performed in all rabbits. This was followed by an LAS and IOL insertion in the four experimental rabbits. In the four control rabbits, only an IOL insertion was performed. Six months after the surgery, the location of the IOL, the conditions of the lens capsule and ciliary body were evaluated using a slitl-amp examination and Miyake-Apple view. For the experimental group, the ultrasound biomicroscope results showed normal LAS and IOL positioning in all four cases. According to the slitlamp examination and Miyake-Apple view, the IOL was positioned at the center, with less after-cataract and damage to the ciliary body. For the control group, ultrasound biomicroscope results indicated a higher IOL position than normal, as well as a single case of IOL decentering. According to the slit-lamp examination and Miyake-Apple view, the IOL was decentered with more severe after-cataract and ciliary body damage. The LAS has the potential to maintain a stable IOL position while producing less after-cataract when used in lens-angle reconstruction for correction of presbyopia.

The relationships between the RNFL thickness or area of the defect and visual field (VF) indices were assessed using the Lowess function, regression analysis and partial Spearman correlation. The differences between these associations depending on the stage of VF damage were further analyzed. Age, optic disc size, refraction, central corneal thickness and the presence of systemic disease were corrected for in order to exclude confounding factors. A logarithmic scale of RNFL thickness showed a negative linear relationship with VF indices.

Examination revealed fresh keratic precipitates, cells, and flare in the anterior chamber (AC), posterior synechiae, sluggish and ill-sustained pupillary reaction, and hyperemic, edematous disc with blurred margins in OU. He was started on topical steroids, cycloplegics and intravenous methylprednisolone. Following treatment, the patient showed improvement and was continued on topical medications and oral prednisolone tapered over 3 weeks, after which VA OU improved, the AC showed no cells and flare and disc edema resolved. Uveitis and optic disc edema in snake bite can either be due to the direct toxic effects of the venom or the effect of ASV. Steroids have a beneficial role in the management of these symptoms.","683":null,"684":"Vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor is an emerging therapeutic modality for various ocular diseases with neovascularization (NV).

Dry eye patients (n = 1,612) were enrolled in this multicenter cross-sectional, observational study. The severity level of dry eye patients was classified based on the Korean guidelines for dry eye treatment. The medical records of the enrolled dry eye patients were evaluated, and the practice styles and the preferences were analyzed according to the ages and clinic types of physicians. Of all patients, dry eye level 1 was most common (47.5%), followed by level 2 (33.5%), level 3 (9.1%), and level 4 (1.1%). Topical anti-inflammatory agents were used in 70.7% of patients with dry eye level 2 and in 80.6% of patients at levels 3 and 4. Topical anti-inflammatory agents were also used in 48.7% of patients with dry eye level 1. Preservative-free artificial tears were preferred at all dry eye levels. The use of topical anti-inflammatory agents did not differ with investigator ages, but older physicians preferred preserved artificial tears more than younger ones. Physicians at referral hospitals also tended to use topical anti-inflammatory agents and preservative-free artificial tears earlier, beginning at dry eye level 1, than those who worked at private eye clinics. Topical anti-inflammatory agents were commonly prescribed for the treatment of dry eye patients in South Korea, even from dry eye level 1. Preservative-free artificial tears were preferred at all dry eye levels. Practice styles differed somewhat depending on the ages and clinic types of physicians.

Several analysis protocols have been tested to identify early visual field losses in glaucoma patients using the mfVEP technique, some were successful in detection of field defects, which were comparable to the standard automated perimetry (SAP) visual field assessment, and others were not very informative and needed more adjustment and research work. In this study we implemented a novel analysis approach and evaluated its validity and whether it could be used effectively for early detection of visual field defects in glaucoma. Three groups were tested in this study; normal controls (38 eyes), glaucoma patients (36 eyes) and glaucoma suspect patients (38 eyes). All subjects had a two standard Humphrey field analyzer (HFA) test 24-2 and a single mfVEP test undertaken in one session. Analysis of the mfVEP results was done using the new analysis protocol; the hemifield sector analysis (HSA) protocol. Analysis of the HFA was done using the standard grading system. Analysis of mfVEP results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the three groups in the mean signal to noise ratio (ANOVA test, p &lt; 0.001 with a 95% confidence interval). The difference between superior and inferior hemispheres in all subjects were statistically significant in the glaucoma patient group in all 11 sectors (t-test, p &lt; 0.001), partially significant in 5 \/ 11 (t-test, p &lt; 0.01), and no statistical difference in most sectors of the normal group (1 \/ 11 sectors was significant, t-test, p &lt; 0.9). Sensitivity and specificity of the HSA protocol in detecting glaucoma was 97% and 86%, respectively, and for glaucoma suspect patients the values were 89% and 79%, respectively. The new HSA protocol used in the mfVEP testing can be applied to detect glaucomatous visual field defects in both glaucoma and glaucoma suspect patients. Using this protocol can provide information about focal visual field differences across the horizontal midline, which can be utilized to differentiate between glaucoma and normal subjects. Sensitivity and specificity of the mfVEP test showed very promising results and correlated with other anatomical changes in glaucoma field loss.

During the first cycle of chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone), the patient complained of right ocular pain and inflammation. Cytologic examination using aqueous humor revealed atypical lymphocytes, suggesting intraocular ALCL involvement. Acute angle closure developed in the anterior chamber due to rapid progression of ALCL, causing pupillary block. Laser and surgical interventions were attempted but failed to relieve the pupillary block. Finally, radiation therapy resolved the pupillary block to restore the anterior chamber and normalize intraocular pressure. This is the first case in the English literature of ALCL involving the iris to cause acute secondary angle closure. ","698":"A 53-year-old Asian woman was treated with hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for lupus erythematosus. Within a few years, she noticed circle-shaped shadows in her central vision. Upon examination, the patient's visual acuity was 20 \/ 25 in both eyes. Humphrey visual field (HVF) testing revealed a central visual defect, and fundoscopy showed a ring-shaped area of parafoveal retinal pigment epithelium depigmentation. Fundus autofluorescence imaging showed a hypofluorescent lesion consistent with bull's eye retinopathy. Adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AO-SLO) revealed patch cone mosaic lesions, in which cones were missing or lost. In addition, the remaining cones consisted of asymmetrical shapes and sizes that varied in brightness. Unlike previous studies employing deformable mirrors for wavefront aberration correction, our AO-SLO approach utilized dual liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators. Thus, by using AO-SLO, we were able to create a photographic montage consisting of high quality images. Disrupted cone AO-SLO images were matched with visual field test results and functional deficits were associated with a precise location on the montage, which allowed correlation of histological findings with functional changes determined by HVF. We also investigated whether adaptive optics imaging was more sensitive to anatomical changes compared with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.","699":"Dengue fever is a viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes and affects humans. In rare cases, dengue fever can cause visual impairment, which usually occurs within 1 month after contracting dengue fever and ranges from mild blurring of vision to severe blindness. Visual impairment due to dengue fever can be detected through angiography, retinography, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, electroretinography, event electroencephalography (visually evoked potentials), and visual field analysis. The purpose of this study is to report changes in the eye captured using fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green, and OCT in 3 cases of dengue fever visual impairment associated with consistent visual symptoms and similar retinochoroidopathic changes. The OCT results of the three patients with dengue fever showed thinning of the outer retinal layer and disruption of the inner segment\/outer segment (IS\/OS) junction. While thinning of the retina outer layer is an irreversible process, disruption of IS\/OS junction is reported to be reversible. Follow-up examination of individuals with dengue fever and associated visual impairment should involve the use of OCT to evaluate visual acuity and visual field changes in patients with acute choroidal ischemia.","700":"We report a case of complete surgical resolution of Valsalva retinopathy that manifested as a premacular hemorrhage involving a membrane followed by a macular hole (MH) resulting from the first vitrectomy. A 20-year-old female patient was referred to our hospital due to sudden vision loss in the left eye. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the left eye was hand motion. Fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed a premacular hemorrhage. Nine weeks later, the BCVA in the left eye had returned to 20 \/ 100 and the premacular hemorrhage had completely resolved, but residual sub-internal limiting membrane deposits and a preretinal membrane were present. The preretinal membrane was removed by core vitrectomy and preretinal membrane peeling, but the foveal deposits could not be excised. Two weeks after the first vitrectomy, the deposits resolved spontaneously, but a full-thickness MH was present. Six months after a second vitrectomy with fluid-gas exchange, the BCVA in the left eye had improved to 20 \/ 25 and OCT showed that the MH had closed.

Several cases of corneal decompensation after argon laser iridotomy have been reported. In the present study, we evaluated the harmful effects of argon laser iridotomy on the corneal endothelium. Argon laser iridotomy was performed on the right eyes of pigmented rabbits. Changes in corneal thickness and endothelial cell density after laser iridotomy were evaluated. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed for assessment of corneal endothelial cell apoptosis. Combined staining with alizarin red and trypan blue, as well as a live\/dead cell assay, were performed for evaluation of damage to the corneal endothelium induced by laser iridotomy. Corneal thickness did not change immediately after laser iridotomy; however, a significant increase was observed 24 hours after iridotomy (p = 0.001). The endothelial cell density of laser-treated eyes four days after laser iridotomy was significantly decreased compared with control eyes (p &lt; 0.001). TUNEL staining showed many TUNEL-positive cells in the corneal endothelium and corneal stroma. No endothelial trypan blue-stained cell nuclei were observed after laser iridotomy; however, several large endothelial cells with damaged membrane integrity were observed.

The medical records of hyperopic amblyopia patients with both spherical anisometropia of 1.00 diopter (D) or more and astigmatic anisometropia of less than 1.00 D were reviewed retrospectively. Based on the results of the amblyopia treatment, patients were divided into two groups: treatment successes and failures. Using the degree of spherical anisometropia, subjects were categorized into mild, moderate, or severe groups. Ocular, corneal, and internal HOAs were measured using a KR-1W aberrometer at the initial visit, and at 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups. The results of the 45 (21 males and 24 females) hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia patients who completed the 12-month follow-up examinations were analyzed. The mean patient age at the initial visit was 70.3 months. In total, 28 patients (62.2%) had successful amblyopia treatments and 17 patients (37.8%) failed treatment after 12 months. Among the patient population, 24 (53.3%) had mild hyperopic anisometropia and 21 (46.7%) had moderate hyperopic anisometropia. When comparing the two groups (i.e., the success and failure groups), ocular spherical aberrations and internal spherical aberrations in the amblyopic eyes were significantly higher in the failure group at every follow-up point. There were no significant differences in any of the HOAs between mild and moderate cases of hyperopic anisometropia at any follow-up. When the amblyopic and fellow eyes were compared between the groups there were no significant differences in any of the HOAs.

IOP was measured every 2 hours except from 01:00 and 05:00. Axial length, corneal curvature, and anterior chamber depth were obtained using the IOL master at baseline and 24 hours later. Adverse events were assessed by patient interview and by slit lamp examination. The largest difference in IOP between treated and untreated eyes 8 hours after instillation was 1.67 mmHg in the BTFC group (p &lt; 0.001).

One of the most commonly prescribed classes of hypotensive agents are prostaglandin analogs (PGs) used as both first-line monotherapy; as well as in combination therapy with other hypotensive agents. Several side effects of eye drops can be caused by preservatives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of PGs with varying concentrations of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), alternative preservatives, or no preservatives on human conjunctival fibroblast cells. Primary human conjunctival fibroblast cells were used in these experiments. Cells were exposed to the following drugs: BAC at different concentrations, bimatoprost 0.01% (with BAC 0.02%), latanoprost 0.005% (with BAC 0.02%), tafluprost 0.0015% with\/without 0.001% BAC and travoprost 0.004% (with 0.001% Polyquad) for 15 and 30 minutes. Cell cytotoxicity was evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy to monitor morphological changes of cells, Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay to cell viability, and fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis to measure apoptosis. BAC caused cell shrinkage and detachment from the plate in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological changes were observed in cells treated with bimatoprost 0.01% and latanoprost 0.005%. However, mild cell shrinkage was noted in cells treated with tafluprost 0.0015%, while a non-toxic effect was noted with travoprost 0.004% and preservative-free tafluprost 0.0015%. CCK-8 assay and FACS analysis showed all groups had a significantly decreased cell viability and higher apoptosis rate compared with the control group. However, travoprost 0.004% and preservative-free tafluprost 0.0015% showed lower cytotoxicity and apoptosis rate than other drugs. This in vitro study revealed that BAC-induced cytotoxicity is dose-dependent, although it is important to emphasize that the clinical significance of toxicity differences observed among the different PGs formulations has not yet been firmly established.

Sixteen patients who had been followed up for more than 1 year were selected and classified into 3 groups: group A, patients with no ocular surgery; group B, patients who had undergone phacoemulsification only; and group C, patients who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery. Endothelial cell density, polymegethism, pleomorphism, and pachymetry were measured and the exponential rates of endothelial cell and pachymetry change were analyzed. A non-linear mixed model of non-operated FCD patients showed that only pachymetric data tended to increase with statistical significance (p = 0.001) with a mean follow-up period of 4.15 years. Using an exponential regression analysis fitting curve, the mean rates of annual endothelial cell loss were 0.82%\/yr, 20.39%\/yr, and 29.27%\/yr in groups A, B, and C respectively, and statistical significance was seen only in group C (p &lt; 0.05). Retrospective long-term follow-up data showed that changes in endothelial density did not significantly decrease over at least 4 years in middle-aged FCD patients.

The average time of recurrence was 4.8 months in the Wies group. Recurrence occurred at 2 months postoperatively in the patient in the combined procedure group. Six of the 9 recurrences in the Wies group were managed by the combined procedure. None of these patients had further recurrence after correction. Three patients complained about a visible incision line after the Wies procedure. The combined procedure seems to be more effective than the Wies procedure in the management of involutional entropion.

We report a case of acute central retinal artery occlusion in a 32-year-old woman who had LV. She showed no discernible laboratory abnormalities such as antiphospholipid antibodies and no history of cerebrovascular accidents. Attempted intra-arterial thrombolysis showed no effect in restoring retinal arterial perfusion or vision. The central retinal artery occlusion accompanied by LV in this case could be regarded as a variant form of Sneddon's syndrome, which is characterized by livedo reticularis and cerebrovascular accidents.

When he sat up from the prolonged supine position, he showed clinical signs of orthostatic hypotension and reported decreased vision in both eyes. He also had underlying anemia. Ophthalmologic findings suggested bilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) as the cause of the visual loss. Although there are numerous reports of ION in the setting of hemodynamic compromise, such as systemic hypotension, cases of ION-associated orthostatic hypotension are very rare. ","732":"Recent reports suggest the association of human papilloma virus (HPV) with retinoblastoma. This study was performed to elucidate whether HPV infection is related to retinoblastoma among Koreans. A total of 54 cases diagnosed with retinoblastoma were enrolled from Seoul National University Children's Hospital and Seoul Metropolitan Government-Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center. Presence of human papilloma viral DNA was detected by in situ hybridization in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded retinoblastoma tissues using both probes against high- and low risk HPV types. The mean age at diagnosis was 22.0 months (range, 1.1 to 98.0 months), and the mean age at enucleation was 27.8 months (range, 1.5 to 112.7 months) among the 54 patients with retinoblastoma. HPV was not detected in any of the retinoblastoma samples using either high risk or low risk HPV probes. Our study, being the first study in the Korean population, proposes that HPV infection may have no causal relationship with retinoblastoma in Koreans.

This study is a retrospective review of the records from 132 adult patients (134 eyes) that underwent silicone AGV implant surgery. Among them, the outcomes of 24 eyes from 24 patients with refractory glaucoma who underwent FP8 AGV implantation were compared with 76 eyes from 76 patients who underwent FP7 AGV implantation. Preoperative and postoperative data, including intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, number of medications, and complications were compared between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 groups (p &gt; 0.05). The postoperative visual acuity of the patients in the FP8 group was better than that of the patients in the FP7 group in some early postoperative periods (p &lt; 0.05); however, after 10 postoperative months, visual acuity was not significantly different through the 3-year follow-up period (p &gt; 0.05).

All patients referred to the emergency department of Valiaser hospital during the year 2011 with external ophthalmomyiasis were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of external ophthalmomyiasis was made according to clinical findings and the presence of Oestrus ovis larvae. There were 18 cases of external ophthalmomyiasis in the emergency department of Valiaser hospital in 2011. Most cases had the common signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, except for three males who were referred with respective complaints of red eye, foreign body sensation, and swelling around the eyelids after contact injury the previous day; corneal infiltration was present in three cases. The visual acuity among the three cases that had peripheral corneal involvement was 20 \/ 30 in both eyes. The bulbar conjunctiva showed chemosis in all cases and a ropy pattern discharge that was clinically compatible with external ophthalmomyiasis. However, in one case, microscopic slit lamp examination did not show Oestrus ovis larvae. The frequency of external ophthalmomyiasis was high in this region.

This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of 115 patients who were clinically diagnosed with herpes keratitis, and their tear samples were collected for HSV detection. PCR positive rates were analyzed for their dependence on the PCR primers used (conventional PCR primer vs. nested PCR primer), the tear collecting method used (micropipetting vs. collection with schirmer strip), the disease manifestation and the patient's previous medication history. HSV DNA was detected in 23 out of 115 (20%) tear samples. The PCR positive rate in tear samples did not differ depending on the PCR primer or tear collection method used. Typical epithelial lesions showed a higher positive rate (31.4%) than atypical epithelial lesions (10.9%). The previous history of the antiviral agent seemed to affect the PCR positive rate. Although the PCR positive rate was not dependent on the tear collection method or primers, HSV detection in tears using PCR was shown to be a supplementary diagnostic test in typical and atypical herpes epithelitis.

Forty-seven congenital ptosis patients (60 eyes) who underwent a frontalis sling operation using preserved fascia lata with modified direct tarsal fixation method between March 2001 and December 2008 with a mean follow-up time of 52 months (range, 26 to 122 months) were included in this study. The medical records were reviewed retrospectively. A retrospective chart review was conducted in patients who were diagnosed with congenital ptosis and underwent frontalis suspension surgery using preserved fascia lata with modified direct tarsal fixation from 2001 through 2008 at Dong-A University Hospital. The patients were 34 males and 14 females. The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 18 years with an average age of 4.51 years. At a mean follow-up of 60 months, good final results were achieved in 46 eyes (76.6%), fair in 8 eyes (13.3%), and poor in 6 eyes (10%). The poor results consisted of undercorrection of 1 eye and recurrence in 5 eyes. The accumulative survival rate was 87.2%, with all recurrences occurring within 12 months postoperatively.

One month after injection, a further orbital MRI was performed. Subsequently, recession of both medial rectus (6 mm) and resection of the left LR (9 mm) were performed. After one month, bupivacaine had no hypertrophic effects. There was little change in angle of deviation. The orbital MRI scan showed a 1.91% increase in volume compared to the muscle prior to the injection. Histological findings showed no muscle fibers of the left LR muscle, only the fiber nucleus and the collagen that replaced the fibers.

Three consecutive NVG patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was not controlled with maximal medication were offered an off-label subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab (2.5-3.75 mg\/0.1-0.15 mL, Avastin). Bevacizumab was injected into the subconjunctival space close to the corneal limbus in two or three quadrants using a 26-gauge needle. Serial anterior segment photographs were taken before and after the injection. Following subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab, iris or angle neovascularization regressed rapidly within several days. Such regression was accompanied by lowering of IOP in all three cases. The patients underwent subsequent PRP and\/or filtering surgery, and the IOP was further stabilized.

Forty patients with horizontal strabismus (20 esotropia and 20 exotropia) were included in this study. Patients with a variable angle of deviation, vertical angle over 5 prism diopters, impaired binocular vision, or poor cooperation were excluded. We instructed the patient to look a target 6 meters away, and applied a prism over the patient's dominant eye while flashing a light source 33 centimeters from the middle of both eyebrows. When the corneal light reflexes were located on the center of each cornea, we measured the angle of deviation. We defined this method as 'distance Krimsky test,' and the angle measured by this method was compared with the conventional Krimsky test and APCT at distance. We analyzed the accuracy and intra- and inter-observer reliability. The angle of strabismus measured by the distance Krimsky test showed a significant agreement and correlation with the deviation angle measured by the APCT. We elicited the correlation gradient between the angle measured by the distance Krimsky test and the APCT. In addition, the distance Krimsky test showed significant intra- and inter-observer reliabilities. The distance Krimsky test is expected to be more useful than the Krimsky test in measuring the distance angle of deviation for patients with strabismus in whom it is difficult to measure the angle of deviation using the APCT.

An initial mfERG was simultaneously recorded from both eyes with two recording electrodes under binocular stimulation. A second mfERG was subsequently recorded with conventional monocular stimulation. Amplitudes and implicit times of each ring response of the binocular and monocular recordings were compared. Ring ratios of the binocular and monocular recording were also compared. In the macular disease group, there were no statistical differences in amplitude or implicit time for each of the five concentric rings between the monocular and binocular recordings. However, with binocular simulation, the ring ratios (ring 1 \/ ring 4, ring 1 \/ ring 5) were significantly reduced in the affected eye. In the normal control group, there were no statistical differences in any parameters between the monocular and binocular recordings. Binocular mfERG could be a good alternative to the conventional monocular test.

The medical records of 43 patients with an idiopathic ERM that underwent vitrectomy and ERM removal between July 2007 and April 2010 were reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups: triamcinolone-assisted simple ERM peeling only (group A, n = 23) and triamcinolone-assisted ERM peeling followed by ICG staining and peeling of the remaining internal ILM (group B, n = 20). No difference was found between the two groups in terms of visual acuity, macular thickness, P1 amplitude or implicit time on multifocal-electroretinogram (mfERG) at six and 12 months postoperatively. In group B, ICG staining after ERM peeling demonstrated that the ILM had been removed together with the ERM in 12 eyes (60%), and all 12 eyes showed punctate retinal hemorrhages during ERM peeling. There was no recurrence of an ERM in either group.

This study measured the visual acuity, manifest refraction and optical quality before and one day, one week, one month, and three months after laser vision correction. Optical quality parameters including the modulation transfer function, Strehl ratio and intraocular scattering were evaluated with a double-pass system. This study included 51 eyes that underwent LASIK and 57 that underwent PRK. The optical quality three months post-surgery did not differ significantly between these laser vision correction techniques. Furthermore, the preoperative and postoperative optical quality did not differ significantly in either group. Optical quality recovered within one week after LASIK but took between one and three months to recover after PRK. The optical quality of patients in the PRK group seemed to recover slightly more slowly than their uncorrected distance visual acuity. Optical quality recovers to the preoperative level after laser vision correction, so laser vision correction is efficacious for correcting myopia.

Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, which accompanies GCA, has not yet been reported in Koreans. Diagnosis of GCA is difficult if typical symptoms other than visual loss are absent. Here, we report a case of an 83-year-old Korean woman presenting with sudden visual loss in both eyes (oculus uterque, OU). Her visual acuities included perception of light in the right eye (oculus dexter, OD) and perception of hand motion in the left eye (oculus sinister, OS). The results of the Hardy-Rand-Rittler test and Ishihara test showed total dyschromatopsia OU. The Goldmann perimetry test revealed a total field defect OD and paracentral island OS. Fundus examination revealed chalky-white disc swelling OU. Other systemic symptoms and signs were unremarkable. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and platelet count were highly elevated. Temporal artery biopsy revealed multiple lymphocytes and multinucleated giant cells in the arterial media layer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of GCA in a Korean that has been confirmed with temporal artery biopsy. In conclusion, silent GCA can occur in Koreans, and hence, elderly patients presenting with chalky-white disc swelling, and corresponding laboratory findings must be evaluated for GCA.","757":"Lemierre's syndrome is characterized by anaerobic septicemia, internal jugular vein thrombosis, and septic emboli associated with infections of the head and neck. We describe an unusual and clinically confusing case of a young woman with an acute paresis of the abducens nerve and partial paresis of the right oculomotor nerve. After an extensive imaging diagnostic procedure, we also documented a peritonsillar abscess and various types of thromboses in intracranial and extracranial veins. Furthermore, we found brain and lung abscesses, which led us to establish the diagnosis of Lemierre's syndrome. Despite intensive anti-coagulation and antibiotic therapy, the patient developed a mycotic aneurysm in the right internal carotid artery directly adjacent to the previously thrombosed cavernous sinus. In summary, we were able to confirm that Lemierre's syndrome may occur in conjunction with uncharacteristic symptoms. Due to the sometimes confusing clinical symptoms as well as clinical and radiological specialties, we had to work on an interdisciplinary basis to minimize the delay prior to establishing the diagnosis and therapy.","758":"Here, we present the case of a patient with bilateral choroidal metastases with extraocular extension in one eye. Metastasis of papillary thyroid carcinoma to the uvea is extremely rare, with only 6 patients reported in the literature. A 62-year-old man with a prior history of papillary thyroid carcinoma suffered the rapid loss of vision in his right eye. He had neovascular glaucoma, total retinal detachment, and a solitary choroidal mass. A month later, his left visual acuity also decreased because of a small macular choroidal mass. The right eye was enucleated and a nodular lesion over the sclera representing extraocular extension was observed. This tumor and the intraocular lesion were composed of papillary excrescences and cystic spaces and stained positively for thyroid transcription factor 1 and thyroglobulin, all confirming the diagnosis of metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma. The tumor in the left eye was successfully treated with diode laser transpupillary thermotherapy. The patient expired within a month as a result of widespread pulmonary metastases. Papillary thyroid carcinoma may metastasize to the uvea bilaterally, cause rapid visual function loss, erode the sclera, and may extend outside the globe similar to choroidal melanoma.

Medical records of 211 eyes of 128 patients who had been followed up for more than 2 years on three or more occasions were retrospectively reviewed. Topographic parameters, including simulated K, corneal astigmatism, irregular astigmatism at 3 and 5 mm, thinnest-point pachymetry, anterior and posterior elevation, and inferior minus superior index, were used to determine topographic progression. Topographic progression was determined by the greatest kappa value associated with progression to corneal graft surgery. Eyes were separated into progressed and non-progressed groups on the basis of topographic progression. The association of clinical factors with topographic progression, including demographic factors, contact lens use, corneal erosion, and atopic history at the time of diagnosis, was assessed by logistic regression. When topographic progression was defined as five or more progressed topographic parameters, the greatest kappa value (0.354) was obtained. Ninety-four of the 211 keratoconic eyes (44.5%) were identified as topographically progressed. Age at diagnosis was significantly different between the progressed and non-progressed groups (22.2 vs. 24.7 years, p = 0.014). Logistic regression revealed that younger age at diagnosis was a risk factor for topographic progression (odds ratio, 0.948; 95% confidence interval, 0.907 to 0.991; p = 0.010).

The superior and inferior conjunctival and episcleral vessels were severely engorged and the nasal and temporal bulbar conjunctival areas were covered with an avascular epithelium. Gonioscopic examination revealed an open angle with Schlemm's canal filled with blood to 360 degrees in the right eye. Brain and orbital magnetic resonance imaging and angiography results were normal. With the maximum tolerable anti-glaucoma medications, the IOP gradually decreased to 25 mmHg over 4 months of treatment. Extensive removal of conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule, leaving bare sclera, may lead to an elevation of the episcleral venous pressure because intrascleral and episcleral veins may no longer drain properly due to a lack of connection to Tenon's capsule and the conjunctival vasculature.

A 24-year-old male patient visited our hospital with ocular pain. This patient had a history of wearing soft contact lenses for 6 months, about 10 hours per day. At initial presentation, slit lamp examination showed corneal stromal infiltrations and small epithelial defect. Microbiological examinations were performed from corneal scrapings, contact lenses, and the contact lens case and solution. The culture results from contact lenses, contact lens case and solution were all positive for Elizabethkingia meningoseptica. Thus, we could confirm that the direct cause of keratitis was contamination of the contact lenses. The patient was treated with 0.3% gatifloxacin. After treatment, the corneal epithelial defect was completely healed, and a slight residual subepithelial corneal opacity was observed.

We conclude that Elizabethkingia meningoseptica should be considered as a rare but potential pathogen for lens-related keratitis in a healthy host.","780":"We report a case of CMV corneal endotheliitis that was treated with intravitreal ganciclovir injection. A 56-year-old man who has suffered from uveitis was referred to our clinic due to corneal endothelial abnormality. Slit lamp examination showed a localized sectoral corneal edema and linear keratic precipitates along the boundary of edema. In spite of treatment with oral steroid and acyclovir, the disease progressed and two new coin-like lesions were developed. After topical ganciclovir and intavitreal injection of ganciclovir, the corneal lesions disappeared.","781":"Here, we report an extremely rare case of acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction caused by oncocytic carcinoma. A 64-year-old man presented to the hospital complaining of epiphora and left-side nasal obstruction. Ophthalmic and otolaryngology examination revealed a left lacrimal duct obstruction caused by a mass in the left nasal cavity and lacrimal drainage system. The mass was removed and confirmed as an oncocytic carcinoma. Nine months after surgery, without adjuvant radiotherapy, a left orbital mass was observed and the patient underwent reoperation. The mass proved to be recurrent oncocytic carcinoma. The patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy to eradicate any residual tumor and the patient remains tumor-free one year post-radiotherapy.","782":null,"783":"To define the long-term results of accommodation insufficiency and to investigate the correlation between accommodation insufficiency and other factors including near point of convergence (NPC), age, and refractive errors. From January 2008 to December 2009, 11 patients with acute near vision disturbance and remote near point of accommodation (NPA) were evaluated. Full ophthalmologic examinations, including best corrected visual acuity, manifest refraction and prism cover tests were performed. Accommodation ability was measured by NPA using the push-up method. We compared accommodation insufficiency and factors including age, refractive errors and NPC. We also investigated the recovery from loss of accommodation in patients. Mean age of patients was 20 years (range, 9 to 34 years). Five of the 11 patients were female. Mean refractive error was -0.6 diopters (range, -3.5 to +0.25 diopters) and 8 of 11 patients (73%) had emmetropia (+0.50 to -0.50 diopters). No abnormalities were found in brain imaging tests. Refractive errors were not correlated with NPA or NPC (rho = 0.148, p = 0.511; rho = 0.319, p = 0.339; respectively). The correlation between age and NPA was not significant (rho = -395, p = 0.069). However, the correlation between age and NPC was negative (rho = -0.508, p = 0.016). Three of 11 patients were lost to follow-up, and 6 of 8 patients had permanent insufficiency of accommodation. Accommodation insufficiency is most common in emmetropia, however, refractive errors and age are not correlated with accommodation insufficiency. Dysfunction of accommodation can be permanent in the isolated accommodation insufficiency.

Six patients (12 eyes) with APROP and capillary-free zones in vascularized retina were retrospectively reviewed. Twelve eyes of six infants were included and were treated with laser photocoagulation for avascular retina and for capillary-free zones in vascularized retina, except for the posterior pole, and fundus findings were photographically-documented in sequence. In addition, anatomic and visual outcomes were evaluated with complications of APROP. Among all of the consecutive infants with APROP, capillary-free zones in vascularized retina were demonstrated in 24% of the infants. All of the infants were &gt;27 weeks of gestation age and had birth weights &gt;1,000 g. After laser treatment, 7 eyes (58.3%) had favorable outcomes, and late capillary filling in capillary-free zones of vascularized retina were noted, however 4 eyes (33.3%) progressed to retinal detachment and 1 eye (8.3%) was complicated by a retinal fold-distorting posterior pole. The visual outcomes were associated with anatomic outcomes. The anatomic outcomes in infants with APROP who had capillary-free zones were comparable to previously reported infants with APROP. The late capillary filling of capillary-free zones in vascularized retina was noted, and angiogenesis was considered to be involved. This process toward normal capillary formation or neovascularization in APROP, might determine its outcome.

A 58-year-old woman with hypertension and type 2 diabetic mellitus complained of progressive visual loss in her right eye for the previous 3 months. At initial examination, visual acuity was 20 \/ 63 in the right eye. Angle neovascularization was observed and the intraocular pressure (IOP) was 30 mmHg in her right eye. Fundus examination and fluorescein angiography showed BRAO combined with BRVO. We immediately injected intravitreal and intracameral bevacizumab in her right eye. The next day, we performed scatter photocoagulation in the nonperfusion area. One month later, visual acuity was 20 \/ 20 in her right eye and the IOP was 17 mmHg with one topical antiglaucoma agent.

We report a case of unilateral NVG which was caused by BRAO with concomitant BRVO and advise close ophthalmic examination of the iris and angle in BRVO with BRAO.","788":"We report a case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis after intravitreal bevacizumab injection. A 61-year-old woman with diabetic macular edema developed dense vitritis and necrotizing retinitis 3 weeks after intravitreal bevacizumab injection. A diagnostic vitrectomy was performed. The undiluted vitreous sample acquired by vitrectomy was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and culture. Polymerase chain reaction of the vitreous was positive for CMV DNA. Other laboratory results did not show evidence of other infectious retinitis and systemic immune dysfunction. Human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were also negative. After systemic administration of ganciclovir, retinitis has resolved and there has been no recurrence of retinitis during the follow-up period of 12 months. Ophthalmologists should be aware of potential risk for CMV retinitis after intravitreal bevacizumab injection.","789":"A 32-year-old male who had infective endocarditis complained of photophobia and blurred vision in both eyes.

The patient was born at 27 weeks gestation. He had received cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity. One month after cryotherapy, he developed a conjunctival scar with symblepharon in both eyes and underwent symblepharon lysis at another hospital 5 years prior. Ocular examination revealed an extensive conjunctival hypertrophic scar with symblepharon and limitation of extraocular movements. An excisional biopsy, lateral canthoplasty, and symblepharon lysis with conjunctival autograft from the contralateral eye were performed in the left eye. Histopathologic examination revealed diffuse proliferation and infiltration of collagenous tissue.","791":"The author reports a case of orbital Sarcoidosis in a 70-year-old female that initially presented as diffuse swelling of the lower eyelid. The patient complained of painless swelling of the left lower lid without palpable mass, and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the orbit was unremarkable. A serum angiotensin converting enzyme level was elevated, and hilar lymphadenopathy was noted on the chest CT. The patient underwent surgical debulking for histologic confirmation, which led to a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis involving the orbital fat. Unexplained chronic eyelid swelling without a mass should be considered a possible ophthalmic manifestation of orbital sarcoidosis.","792":"To assess whether the expression of heat shock protein 72 (Hsp72) protects rat retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) from apoptotic cell death. Hsp72 expression in RGC-5 cells transduced with replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus was analyzed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence. The effect of Hsp72 expression on etoposide-induced apoptotic cell death was examined by microscopic analysis and confirmed by cell proliferation assay. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence clearly showed adenovirus-mediated Hsp72 expression in RGC-5 cells. Treatment with etoposide resulted in the death of a proportion of the cells by apoptosis. However, this apoptotic cell death was significantly reduced in cells expressing Hsp72, with the reduction in cell death correlating to the level of Hsp72 expression. Over-expression of Hsp72 alone is sufficient to rescue neuronal cells from apoptotic cell death, suggesting that fine-tuning its expression may be an effective neuroprotective approach in retinal degenerative disease.

This nonrandomized comparative study included 27 patients (27 eyes) who underwent pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade for treatment of PDR with tractional or combined tractional-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and who received subtenon injection of TA (40 mg) at the end of surgery. The study group was compared with the control group (29 eyes), which was matched with the study group for preoperative and intraoperative parameters, but underwent pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade without a subtenon injection of TA. Retinal reattachments without reoperation were achieved in 25 eyes (92.6%) and 26 eyes (89.7%) at 6 months (p = 1.000) in the study and control groups, respectively. The study group and the control group did not differ significantly in the frequency of postoperative proliferative vitreoretinopathy, retinal redetachment rate, reoperation rate, macular pucker formation, postoperative vitreous hemorrhage, gain in visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and intraocular inflammation (p &gt; 0.05).

","797":"To investigate the morphologic changes in the outer retina of patients with cone dystrophy, using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The medical records of 15 cone dystrophy patients examined from January 2007 to January 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. All patients underwent ophthalmic evaluation including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision testing, fundus examination, full-field standard electroretinography (ERG), multifocal (mf) ERG, and SD-OCT. Qualitative and quantitative SD-OCT data and ERG responses were analyzed and compared among the patient categories and the normal control group. There were 4 major categories of SD-OCT findings, based on the status of the ellipsoid portion of the photoreceptor inner segment (ISe), outer segment (OS) contact cylinder, and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer. Category 0 showed no structural abnormalities. Category 1 showed foveal ISe loss and obscurity of the border between the ISe band and the external limiting membrane (ELM). Category 2 showed foveal thinning and focal foveal ISe disruption with an intact ELM. Category 3 showed foveal thickening and perifoveal disruption of the ISe layer. Category 1 to 3 showed OS contact cylinder layer absence and RPE thickening. The patients in category 0 tended to be younger (mean, 10.0 years) than those in categories 1 to 3 (mean, 17.6 years), although this difference was not statistically significant. Category 1 to 3 patients exhibited statistically significant thinning of the central retina and outer nuclear layer and thickening of the RPE layer relative to the category 0 and normal control group. There was a significant correlation between the central foveal thickness and BCVA in the patients with cone dystrophy. ERG and mfERG responses did not differ significantly among the different cone dystrophy categories. The morphologic features of cone dystrophy as revealed by SD-OCT, could be categorized as either normal or 1 of 3 different types of outer retinal changes. The presence of normal retinal structures in young cone dystrophy patients with functional impairment (category 0) indicates that electrophysiologic studies are superior to current imaging modalities for the early diagnosis of cone dystrophy. The characteristic SD-OCT findings in cone dystrophy patients may aid in differential diagnosis and be useful for future research on the pathology of cone dystrophy.

Previous experiences have shown that drainage procedures are often required to control associated glaucoma. The conventional surgical approach in trabeculectomy carries a significant risk of intraoperative expulsive hemorrhage. Here, we describe a modified approach of the conventional trabeculectomy technique, which may lower the risk of expulsive hemorrhage. A viscoelastic device was employed to maintain a steady intraocular pressure throughout the procedure. Details of the surgical technique and material used are described. One patient with congenital glaucoma associated with SWS underwent a successful trabeculectomy using the modified technique. Postoperative intraocular pressure was successfully reduced and no intraoperative complications occurred.

The lesions are white-to-cream or orange in color, are located in the peripapillary and macular areas, and are unilateral in most patients. The symptoms of choroidal osteoma include decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia or scotoma corresponding to the location of the osteoma, but some patients have no symptoms. Prognosis of vision varies according to tumor location, retinal pigment epithelial and sensory retinal degeneration, subretinal fluid and hemorrhage, and development of a subretinal neovascular membrane.","803":"A 32-year-old man with blurred vision in the right eye and headache presented with anterior uveitis, an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 60 mmHg, an open angle, no visual field defects, and normal optic nerve. He had a history of five previous similar attacks. In each of the previous instances, his anterior uveitis and high IOP were controlled with antiglaucoma medications and topical steroids. However, at the fifth attack, his optic disc was pale and a superior paracentral visual field defect was shown. Brain magnetic resonance image studies were normal. This case represents that a recurrent Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PSS)-induced optic disc atrophy likely due to ocular ischemia caused by a recurrent, high IOP. Although PSS is a self-limiting syndrome, we should manage high IOP and prevent ischemia of the optic nerve head by treating with ocular antihypertensive medications.","804":"We describe a patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome who developed unilateral anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. A 54-year-old man with a history of bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, and sinusitis presented with sudden decreased visual acuity in his right eye that had begun 2 weeks previously. The visual acuity of his right eye was 20 \/ 50. Ophthalmoscopic examination revealed a diffusely swollen right optic disc and splinter hemorrhages at its margin. Goldmann perimetry showed central scotomas in the right eye and fluorescein angiography showed remarkable hyperfluorescence of the right optic nerve head. Marked peripheral eosinphilia, extravascular eosinophils in a bronchial biopsy specimen, and an increased sedimentation rate supported the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome. Therapy with methylprednisolone corrected the laboratory abnormalities, improved clinical features, and preserved vision, except for the right central visual field defect. Early recognition of this systemic disease by ophthalmologists may help in preventing severe ocular complications.","805":"Phialemonium keratitis is a very rare case and we encountered a case of keratitis caused by Phialemonium obovatum (P. obovatum) after penetrating injury to the cornea. This is the first case report in the existing literature. A 54-year-old male was referred to us after a penetration injury, and prompt primary closure was performed. Two weeks after surgery, an epithelial defect and stromal melting were observed near the laceration site. P. obovatum was identified, and then identified again on repeated cultures. Subsequently, Natacin was administered every two hours. Amniotic membrane transplantation was performed due to a persistent epithelial defect and impending corneal perforation. Three weeks after amniotic membrane transplantation, the epithelial defect had completely healed, but the cornea had turned opaque. Six months after amniotic membrane transplantation, visual acuity was light perception only, and corneal thinning and diffuse corneal opacification remained opaque.

A systemically healthy 1-year-old girl came to the outpatient clinic with a complaint of tearing on the temporal side of the right lateral canthus since birth. On examination, a small orifice was found in the skin on the temporal side of the lateral canthus. There was no evidence of inflammation or swelling within the opening. Surgeons carried out an operation under general anesthesia. They passed a probe through the lacrimal orifice and advanced it toward the lacrimal sac. Next, they introduced saline to the inferior punctum and found that it drained to the lateral fistula. The lower lid stretched as the dissected fistula was pulled. After the operation, the patient was free of the symptom.

In addition, we evaluated whether treatment of rats with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) prevents this response. To promote OIR, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hyperoxia from postnatal day 2 (P2) to P14. They were then returned to normoxia after P15. TA was injected into the right vitreous of P15 rats, while saline was injected into the left vitreous. At P18 the expression of nNOS and iNOS was determined using Western blotting and immunostaining techniques in retinas obtained from control rats. In P18 OIR rats, the abundance of nNOS and iNOS protein was significantly increased compared with controls. These increases were not observed in the retinas of rats treated with TA. The change in expression of nNOS and iNOS were specific to parvalbumin and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive cells. Treatment with TA prevented the increased expression of nNOS and iNOS in all samples. Hypoxia upregulates expression of nNOS and iNOS in OIR rat retinas, which is can be prevented by treatment with TA.

Non-cycloplegic refractions were measured until 6 months postoperatively. Spherical equivalent (SE), J0 and J45 using power vectors were calculated to determine and compare the changes of refractive astigmatism and axis in both groups. SE significantly decreased after surgery for the first week and did not changed thereafter in both groups (p = 0.000 and p = 0.018, respectively). In BLR group, J0 showed significant changes at the first week and 1 month after surgery (p = 0.005 and p = 0.016, respectively), but in R&amp;R group, J0 changed significantly between 1 week and 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.023 and p = 0.016, respectively).

The presence of peripheral abnormal lesions beyond the standard seven fields was examined. Ultrawide-field FA images demonstrated peripheral microaneurysms in six (54.5%) of 11 eyes with no DR and all eyes with moderate to severe NPDR and PDR. Peripheral retinal neovascularizations were detected in three (4.2%) of 71 eyes with NPDR and in 13 (36.1%) of 36 eyes with PDR.

The present case-control study consisted of 111 patients with exudative ARMD and 112 sex frequency-matched healthy controls that were randomly selected from unrelated volunteers in the same clinic. Genotypes were determined by the Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) based method. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for ARMD risk associated with polymorphism of XRCC7. In all analysis the GG genotype was considered to be the reference genotype. There was no significant association between genotypes of XRCC7 and susceptibility to ARMD. Considering the significant difference in age distribution between cases and controls, age was used as a covariate in further analysis. After ORs were adjusted for age, the same result was observed. In the next step we stratified our subjects into outdoor and indoor groups according to their job titles. The outdoor and indoor patients were occupationally exposed to sunlight and not exposed to sunlight, respectively. Our present study showed that among indoor subjects there was no association between XRCC7 polymorphism and susceptibility to ARMD. However, among outdoor subjects, the GT + TT genotypes compared to the GG genotype increased the risk of ARMD (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.04-9.39; p = 0.042).

Seventy-five patients diagnosed with exudative AMD were treated with intravitreal bevacizumab (2.5 mg) monotherapy. All patients received three initial intravitreal bevacizumab injections every four weeks and were then treated \"as needed\" based on clinical findings, optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography during the 12 month follow-up period after the third injection. The difference in visual acuity improvement among the three genotypes of LOC387715 were statistically significant at six months post-treatment (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; TT, 0.346; GT, 0.264; GG, 0.188; p = 0.037). Among the LOC387715 genotypes, the number of additional injections was lower in patients who had the risk T allele (GG, 2.143; GT, 2.000; TT, 1.575; p = 0.064). There was no significant difference between visual acuity and central macular thickness change in the CFH Y402H polymorphism group during the 12 month follow-up period. However, the TC group of CFH Y402H required more additional bevacizumab injections than the TT group (TT, 1.517; TC, 3.363; p = 0.020). This study demonstrated that different LOC387715\/HTRA1 genotypes resulted in different bevacizumab treatment responses on exudative AMD. Patients with the risk allele had an improved treatment response and less need for additional injections. However, patients with the CFH Y402H risk allele needed more additional injections of bevacizumab in order to improve visual acuity. This study illustrates how pharmacogenetic factors may help determine treatment modality and dosing. This could ultimately provide basic data for 'personalized medicine' in AMD.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 52 eyes from 46 patients who underwent pterygium excision and conjunctival autografting and were followed up for more than 3 months. The operation duration, postoperative inflammation, complications, and recurrence rates were compared between groups of 20 patients (22 eyes) for whom fibrin glue was used (fibrin glue group) and 26 patients (30 eyes) for whom suturing was performed with 10-0 nylon (suture group) in pterygium excision and conjunctival autografting. The operation duration was 27.71 (5.22) minutes in the fibrin glue group and 43.30 (8.18) minutes in the suture group (p = 0.000). Seven days after the operation, the fibrin glue group showed milder conjunctival inflammation than the suture group (p = 0.000). Postoperative complications and corneal recurrence rates were not statistically different between the two groups. The use of fibrin glue in pterygium excision with conjunctival autografting is likely to be a more effective, safer procedure than suturing.

Among 5 unilateral pseudophakic pseudoexfoliation cases, 3 showed a more advanced state of glaucoma in the affected eye. The other 2 cases showed progression of glaucoma in the affected eye after the development of pseudophakic pseudoexfoliation, while the unaffected eyes remained stable. In the latter 2 cases, control of intraocular pressure was difficult, and more glaucoma medication was needed in the affected eye. Pseudophakic pseudoexfoliation in glaucoma patients with no history of pseudoexfoliation syndrome or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma has not been reported. In our cases, the eyes which developed pseudophakic pseudoexfoliation showed a more advanced state of glaucoma, more difficulty controlling intraocular pressure, and faster progression of glaucoma.

Following a kidney biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. An ophthalmology examination initially performed for floater symptoms, revealed anterior uveitis in both eyes. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis and anterior uveitis in both eyes responded to treatment with oral prednisolone, furosemide, carvedilol, and a topical steroid. TINU syndrome can occur in the elderly and should be part of the differential diagnosis when seeing a patient who has uveitis in association with renal disease; any therapy should be managed by both an internist and an ophthalmologist.","818":"A 54-year-old female patient who had been undergoing anti-cancer chemotherapy and radiotherapy for seven years after surgery for left breast cancer visited our clinic for visual disturbance in the right eye at nine months after paclitaxel administration. The best-corrected visual acuity was 0.5 in the right eye and 1.0 in the left eye. The patient was diagnosed with maculopathy due to paclitaxel administration based on the finding of cystoid macular edema in the right eye on fundus examination and optical coherence tomography; however, no leakage was detected on fluorescein angiography. Thus, drug replacement was planned. On the other hand, no abnormal finding was observed in the left eye. However, as the anti-cancer effect of paclitaxel is significant, replacing paclitaxel with another agent was not warranted; therefore, maintenance therapy with methazolamide was performed before and after administering the anti-cancer agent. Aggravation of cystoid macular edema was prevented, and vision improvement was achieved by oral maintenance therapy with methazolamide. In addition, the same fundus findings as shown in the right eye were detected in the left eye at 16 months after paclitaxel administration. After administering methazolamide, macular thickness was reduced, and vision was improved in the left eye. Paclitaxel administration was discontinued due to cutaneous metastasis from the breast cancer, and another anti-cancer agent was then administered.

Eyes assigned to the combination group (n = 48) were subjected to macular laser photocoagulation three weeks after IVTA. Eyes in the IVTA group (n = 38) underwent IVTA alone. Central macular thickness was measured by optical coherence tomography, and the number of additional treatments and mean time to recurrence were assessed. Thirty-seven eyes in the combination group and 26 eyes in the IVTA group completed the three-year follow-up. Recurrence of DME after initial treatment was not observed for nine of the 37 (24.3%) eyes in the combination group or for one of the 26 (3.9$) eyes in the IVTA group (p = 0.028). DME was absent for 19.9 months after treatment in the combination group compared to 10.3 months in the IVTA group (p = 0.027). The mean number of additional treatments was 0.92 in the combination group and 1.88 in the IVTA group (p = 0.001). Results in the subset of subjects who completed the three-year follow-up demonstrated that laser photocoagulation following IVTA is more effective than IVTA monotherapy for diffuse DME. Combination therapy required fewer additional treatments and resulted in a lower recurrence rate than IVTA monotherapy. ","825":"To investigate the incidence and predisposing factors of macular pucker formation after pars plana vitrectomy in patients who developed primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. We retrospectively reviewed a consecutive series of 284 eyes in 284 patients who underwent primary retinal detachment repair by pars plana vitrectomy alone between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2010. Patients with a history of retinal surgery or another visually significant ocular problem were excluded. Postoperatively, of the 264 eyes that completed at least six months of follow-up, 16 (6.1%) eyes developed obvious macular pucker at clinical examination. Of these 16 eyes, ten (70.0%) underwent repeat vitrectomy with membrane peeling for macular pucker removal during the follow-up period. The mean time from primary vitrectomy for the retinal reattachment to the secondary vitrectomy with membrane peeling for macular pucker was 7.9 months. The mean improvement in vision after membrane peeling surgery was 0.37 (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). Using an independent t-test, chi-square test, and Mann-Whitney U-test, we found that the number or size of retinal break and vitreous hemorrhage could be significant risk factors of macular pucker. In our study, 6.1% of eyes which underwent pars plana vitrectomy alone for primary retinal detachment developed a postoperative macular epiretinal membrane. Multiple or large retinal breaks and postoperative vitreous hemorrhage were related to macular pucker formation. Overall, the 70.0% of eyes which underwent secondary vitrectomy with membrane peeling for removal of macular pucker showed a favorable visual outcome. ","826":"To investigate morphologic changes of acute central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. This retrospective study included 63 eyes of 63 patients with unilateral acute CSC. All patients underwent simultaneous SD-OCT and fluorescein angiography examination using Spectralis HRA+OCT. The external limiting membrane could be seen on SD-OCT, although the junction between photoreceptor inner and outer segments (IS\/OS) was not detected in all eyes with retinal detachment (RD). However, IS\/OS became visible after resolution of serous RD in 51 eyes (81.0%). SD-OCT images at the leakage sites showed a bump of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in in 47 cases (68.1%) and pigment epithelial detachment (PED) in 22 of 69 leakage sites (31.9%). In 14 of 69 leakage sites (20.3%), highly reflective areas suggesting fibrinous exudate were observed in the subretinal space. In nine leakage sites (13.0%), sagging or dipping of the posterior retinal layer was seen. Abnormal RPE changes such as RPE bump and PED were observed in 12 of 22 fellow eyes (54.5%). A variety of morphologic changes could be identified on SD-OCT, and those findings may contribute more information to our understanding of the pathophysiology of CSC. ","827":"To compare the efficacy and safety of 23-gauge transconjunctival vitrectomy with the conventional 20-gauge method in idiopathic epiretinal membrane and macular hole surgery. Sixty-one consecutive patients undergoing vitrectomy for idiopathic epiretinal membrane and macular hole were recruited to either 20- or 23-gauge vitrectomy groups and prospectively evaluated. Surgical success rates, operating time, surgery-related complications, long-term visual outcomes, and postoperative ocular surface problems are compared in the two groups. There were 31 eyes in the 20-gauge group and 33 eyes in the 23-gauge group. The macular hole closure rate after the first surgery was 83% and 90.9% in the 20-gauge and 23-gauge groups, respectively, with no significant difference between groups (p = 0.59). The success rate for idiopathic epiretinal membranes cases was 100% in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference between overall surgical times (p = 0.90). None of the patients in either group experienced postoperative complications of severe postoperative hypotony, vitreous hemorrhage or endophthalmitis, except one eye in the 20-gauge group, which was found to have retinal detachment. In both groups, statistically significant improvement in visual acuity was achieved 1-month postoperatively (p = 0.002) and thereafter at all postoperative visits (p &lt; 0.05). The mean ocular surface scores were significantly lower in the 23-gauge group at all postoperative visits compared with the 20-gauge group scores (p = 0.001). Transconjunctival 23-gauge vitrectomy appears to be as effective and safe as conventional 20-gauge vitrectomy in idiopathic epiretinal membrane and macular hole surgeries. ","828":"To evaluate the levels of satisfaction among physicians who have undergone corneal refractive surgery. This study included 212 eyes of 107 consecutive patients who underwent laser in situ keratomileusis or laser sub-epithelial keratomileusis surgery. Patients were divided into two groups: one group of physicians and one group of other healthcare workers (HCWs). The physicians' group was also subdivided into two different groups: surgeons or doctors using microscopes and medical physicians. The main outcome measures were scale scores obtained by using the Visual Function Index-14 questionnaires; uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), residual spherical equivalent (SE), optical zone diameter, and residual corneal thickness were also compared between the groups. No significant differences in preoperative parameters, with the exception of the ratio of types of refractive surgery, were noted between the physicians and the HCWs group. Additionally, no differences between the groups were noted in the postoperative UDVA, residual SE, optical zone diameter, residual corneal thickness, and level of satisfaction. When comparing the two subgroups of physicians, the differences in satisfaction rates were not statistically significant, even in terms of the performance of delicate manual work. No statistically significant differences in the clinical outcomes and satisfaction scores were detected after surgery between the physicians and HCWs groups, nor were any significant differences detected between the surgeons and medical physicians groups. Corneal refractive surgery can conceivably be recommended even for physicians who perform intensive near vision-dependent activities and delicate operations. ","829":"We evaluated ocular optical components and their interrelationships in myopic Korean patients. In this prospective observational study, 1,011 consecutive patients were recruited from a refractive surgery clinic. The best-corrected visual acuity was &gt;20 \/ 20 in all patients. The refractive error, axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), and vitreous chamber depth (VCD) were measured by an autorefractor and partial coherence laser interferometry (IOL Master). Central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured by ORBscan II topography. The refractive errors had a positive correlation with LT but negative correlations with AL, ACD, VCD, and CCT. As the axial length increased, the ACD, VCD, and CCT increased but the LT decreased. The CCT had a positive correlation with gender, refractive errors, ACD, VCD, and AL but no correlation with age. The mean CCT was increased in proportion to the increase in AL. In myopic Korean patients, as axial elongation progressed, the VCD and ACD deepened and the CCT thickened but the LT decreased. The CCT had a positive correlation with the degree of myopia and the AL. ","830":null,"831":"Trisomy 14 mosaicism is a rare chromosomal abnormality with distinct and recognizable clinical features. We report a patient with presumed retinal dystrophy having diffuse retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities, which has not been previously reported in association with trisomy 14.

The first case presented here was a 78-year-old male patient with visual disturbance of the left eye. He had been taking an oral agent for diabetes and had chronic renal failure for 7 years. From 10 days prior to the visit, he had visual disturbance of the left eye accompanied by systemic edema. There were no specific findings in the anterior segment, but sub-retinal fluid was observed in the left fundus. Macular edema was observed on fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography; therefore, the oral administration of furosemide was initiated. After seven days, the sub-retinal fluid disappeared. The second case was a 43-year-old female patient with visual disturbance of the left eye who had been taking hypoglycemic agents for diabetes for 13 years. There were no specific findings in the anterior segment, but flame-shaped retinal hemorrhages were scattered over both posterior poles, neovascularization was observed in the left eye, and, of particular note, sub-retinal fluid was detected in the macula of the left eye. Macular edema was also observed on fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography, and oral administration of furosemide was initiated. After 3 weeks, the macular edema had significantly decreased.","833":"We report a case of post-streptococcal uveitis mainly presenting with bilateral recurrent retinal vasculitis in Korea. A 14-year-old Asian female presented with decreased visual acuity of 20 \/ 30 in the right eye and 20 \/ 25 in the left eye. The patient had a history of glomerulonephritis nine months before onset of uveitis. The manifestation of uveitis was predominantly retinal vasculitis. We presumed post-streptococcal uveitis because probable streptococcal infection was confirmed by anti-streptolysin O titer elevation. With topical and oral steroid treatments, the patient experienced complete vision recovery. Post-streptococcal uveitis occurs rarely and mostly involves young patients in the form of non-granulomatous anterior uveitis. However, as this case shows, it may primarily involve the posterior uvea without anterior inflammation and may recur.","834":"A 75-year-old female was transferred to our clinic three days after uneventful phacoemulsification with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in the right eye that had been carried out at a local clinic. Under the diagnosis of postoperative endophthalmitis, the patient underwent pars plans vitrectomy, IOL explantation, silicone oil tamponade, and intravitreal antibiotic injection. Even after the procedure, the patient's condition was further aggravated, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli were identified on bacterial identification test. Although meropenem was applied locally and systemically, the patient had no-light perception visual acuity.","835":"A 43-year-old man developed decreased vision in the right eye that had persisted for seven years. Under slit lamp examination, corneal clouding was noted with normal endothelium and ocular structure. From the clinical evidence, we suspected that the patient had congenital hereditary stromal dystrophy (CHSD). He and his family underwent a genetic analysis. Penetrating keratoplasty was conducted, and the corneal button was investigated for histopathologic confirmation via both light and electron microscopy. The histopathologic results revealed mildly loosened stromal structures, which exhibited an almost normal arrangement and differed slightly from the previous findings of CHSD cases. With regard to the genetic aspects, the patient and his mother harbored a novel point mutation of the decorin gene. This genetic mutation is also distinct from previously described deletion mutations of the decorin gene. This case involved delayed penetration of mild clinical symptoms with the histological feature of a loosened fiber arrangement in the corneal stroma. We concluded that this condition was a mild form of CHSD. However, from another perspective, this case could be considered as \"decorin gene-associated corneal dystrophy,\" which is distinct from CHSD. Further evaluation will be required for appropriate clinical, histopathologic and genetic approaches for such cases.","836":"Lacrimal sac diverticulum is a rare condition, and its various symptoms complicate differential diagnosis. We present cases of a peculiar type of lacrimal diverticulum. A 5-year-old girl and a 50-year-old woman presented with a protruding mass inferior to the medial canthus. Each lacrimal system was patent to irrigation. The masses compressed and distorted the lacrimal passage and had no apparent connection with the lacrimal sac in dacryocystography or computed tomography. Surgical exploration and complete excision of the masses were completed. Each patient had an inverted Y- and an inverted V-shaped multilobular cystic mass that was pathologically confirmed as a lacrimal sac diverticulum. Lacrimal sac diverticula may rarely take the form of a multilobular cyst and can present as a lower lid mass. We speculate that an abnormality in lacrimal embryogenesis resulted in multiple blind pouches, a peculiar type of lacrimal sac diverticulum.","837":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the myotoxicity of bevacizumab on extraocular muscles in a rabbit model. Thirty New Zealand white rabbits were used for this study. The animals were evenly divided into two groups. In the first group, 15 rabbits were treated with intramuscular injections of bevacizumab (1.25 mg\/0.05 mL) in the right superior rectus muscle and normal saline solution (0.05 mL) in the left superior rectus muscle. In the second group, 15 rabbits were treated with subconjunctival injections of bevacizumab (2.5 mg\/0.1 mL) in the right superior subconjunctival area and normal saline solution (0.1 mL) in the left superior subconjunctival area. Five rabbits in each group were sacrificed at one day, two weeks and four weeks after the injections. Extraocular muscle samples were prepared for light microscopic (LM) and electron microscopic (EM) examination. Degrees of acute inflammation were evaluated via CD-11b immunohistochemistry, and global muscle change was investigated using hematoxylin and eosin stains. Intensity of fibrosis was evaluated using Masson trichrome stains, and ultrastructural changes were observed on EM. We observed no significant inflammatory cell infiltration, muscle necrosis or fibrotic change in treated and control eyes. EM findings revealed no significant damage to muscle or vascular tissue after bevacizumab injection. We found no signs of extraocular muscle toxicity after LM and EM intramuscular and subconjunctival bevacizumab injections in a rabbit model. ","838":"Residual head tilt has been reported in patients with superior oblique muscle palsy (SOP) after surgery to weaken the inferior oblique (IO) muscle. The treatments for these patients have not received appropriate attention. In this study, we evaluated the superior rectus (SR) muscle recession as a surgical treatment. The medical records of 12 patients with SOP were retrospectively reviewed. Each of these patients had unilateral SR muscle recession for residual head tilt after IO muscle weakening due to SOP. The residual torticollis was classified into three groups on the basis of severity: mild, moderate, or severe. Both IO muscle overaction and vertical deviation, features of SOP, were evaluated in all patients. The severity of the preoperative and postoperative torticollis and vertical deviation were compared using a paired t-test and Fisher's exact test. The torticollis improved in nine of 12 (75%) patients after SR muscle recession. The difference between the preoperative and postoperative severity of torticollis was statistically significant (p = 0.0008). After surgery, the mean vertical deviation was significantly reduced from 12.4 prism diopters to 1.3 prism diopters (p = 0.0003). Unilateral SR muscle recession is an effective method to correct residual head tilt after IO muscle weakening in patients with SOP. This surgical procedure is believed to decrease head tilt by reducing the vertical deviation and thereby the compensatory head tilt. ","839":"To assess the long-term anatomic and visual outcomes and associated complications of lens-sparing vitrectomy (LSV) in infants with progressive posterior-type tractional retinal detachment (TRD) associated with stage 4A retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). In a retrospective case series, the medical records of consecutive patients who presented with progressive posterior-type stage 4A ROP and underwent LSV between 1999 and 2007 were reviewed. Retinal attachment status, visual acuity, and development of postoperative complications were assessed. Eleven eyes of 9 patients were included. The mean follow-up period was 4.6 years. In 8 eyes (73%), plus disease was present at the time of LSV. In 3 eyes (27%), 2 (66%) without plus disease and 1 (13%) with plus disease, the retina remained reattached in the end, while 8 eyes (73%) had TRD on final examination. Two eyes with reattached retinas showed favorable visual acuity. In those eyes with detached retinas, 5 (68%) showed no light perception. When surgery for ROP was unsuccessful, development of cataract, corneal opacity, or glaucoma was common. The long-term anatomic success rate of LSV for progressive posterior-type stage 4A ROP was low, especially in the presence of plus disease at the time of LSV. Anatomical reattachment is very important for preventing complications and gaining better visual outcomes. ","840":"To evaluate the effect of axial length on the variability of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements using the Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT) in normal and glaucomatous eyes. We measured the RNFL thickness in 474 subjects using the Stratus OCT twice during the same day. Axial length was measured with the IOLMaster, and refractive error was the absolute value of the spherical equivalent measured with an auto ref-keratometer. Standard deviation in overall mean RNFL thickness was used as the dependent variable to identify significant correlations. Long axial length affected the variability in the RNFL thickness value by stratus OCT at the temporal quadrant (p = 0.006) and clock-hour sector 9 (p = 0.001). Refractive error also affected the variability of the RNFL thickness value by stratus OCT at the temporal quadrant (p = 0.025) and clock-hour sector 9 (p = 0.024). It is clinically significant that longer axial length demonstrates greater variability in temporal area as detected by OCT, a measurement which correlates with the preferably damaged position in the myopic glaucoma eye.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 113 Korean patients who were diagnosed with CSC and who underwent history taking with a specialized questionnaire for CSC. They were matched for age and gender at a ratio of 1 : 3 to 339 normal controls. Normal controls were consecutively selected from a database at the Health Promotion Center. General characteristics and medical histories were compared between the two groups. The statistical analyses used included independent t-test, Mann-Whitney test, Fisher's exact test, and multivariate logistic regression analysis. There were 90 men and 23 women in the CSC group, and the male-female ratio for both groups was 3.9 : 1. The mean age of the patients was 45.6 years. In multivariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 2.327; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.349-4.013), use of medicinal plants (OR, 2.198; 95% CI, 1.193-4.049), sleep disturbances (OR, 1.732; 95% CI, 1.096-2.739), and snoring (OR, 1.727; 95% CI, 1.058-2.820) were strongly associated with CSC. Hypertension, sleep disturbance, snoring, and medicinal plant use were identified as factors associated with CSC. Expanded history taking, including systemic factors and culture-specific behavior related to stress or fatigue such as use of medicinal plants, will be helpful in identifying Korean patients at an increased risk for CSC.

Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients with anterior segment inflammation refractory to steroid treatment were treated with 0.03% tacrolimus ointment at the Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea from March 2008 through August 2009. Seven patients had ocular GVHD and seven had VKC. We evaluated the conjunctival and corneal inflammatory change at one, two, four, and eight weeks after treatment with a scoring system. Time to initial response of treatment and therapeutic effect between GVHD and VKC was also analyzed. After the eight-week treatment period, patients were divided into two groups (maintenance group and discontinuance group). Eight patients maintained the treatment for an additional four months, and six patients discontinued the treatments. Therapeutic effect was also compared between the groups at eight weeks and six months after treatment. The mean conjunctival and corneal inflammation score was reduced significantly at eight weeks after treatment (p &lt; 0.0001). The therapeutic effect in conjunctival inflammation was first noted at week two after the initial treatment (p = 0.002); reduction in corneal inflammation was first noted at one week (p = 0.0009). When compared according to diagnosis, no therapeutic difference was detected between the groups (p &gt; 0.05).

A 54-year-old male presented with an acute onset visual field defect of the right eye after udenafil use. Examination revealed a relative afferent pupillary defect and a swollen disc. Automated visual fields revealed an enlarged blind spot and a narrowed visual field. Fluorescein angiography revealed both an inferior choroidal filling delay and an inferior sector filling delay of the optic disc in the arteriovenous phase as well as diffuse leakage of the optic disc in the late phase. Optical coherent tomography revealed increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, especially in the area of the inferior disc. The patient was counseled to discontinue the use of udenafil and to monitor his blood pressure regularly. The disc swelling was resolved with residual optic atrophy one month after discontinuing the use of udenafil.","848":"We report two cases of choroidal neurofibromatosis, detected with the aid of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in patients with neurofibromatosis (NF)-1, otherwise having obscure findings based on ophthalmoscopy and fluoresceine angiography (FA). In case 1, the ophthalmoscopic exam showed diffuse bright or yellowish patched areas with irregular and blunt borders at the posterior pole. The FA showed multiple hyperfluorescent areas at the posterior pole in the early phase, which then showed more hyperfluorescence without leakage or extent in the late phase. The ICGA showed diffuse hypofluorescent areas in both the early and late phases, and the deep choroidal vessels were also visible. In case 2, the fundus showed no abnormal findings, and the FA showed weakly hypofluorescent areas with indefinite borders in both eyes. With the ICGA, these areas were more hypofluorescent and had clear borders. Choroidal involvement in NF-1 seems to occur more than expected. In selected cases, ICGA is a useful tool to be utilized when an ocular examination is conducted in a patient that has no definite findings based on the ophthalmoscope, B-scan, or FA tests.","849":null,"850":"A 38-year-old woman developed diffusely distributed opacities with crystalline materials in the laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) interface of her eye after she was scratched by a sprig during mountain climbing. No sign of flap displacement was noted. Despite two days of topical and systemic antibiotics therapy, the corneal infiltration with interface opacities persisted. The following day, the distribution of the crystalline materials had rotated in a counterclockwise direction. Flap lifting and foreign body removal using sufficient irrigation were performed. One month after surgery, the patient's postoperative uncorrected visual acuity was 0.8 with cleared interface. No signs of epithelial ingrowth or flap striae were noted. Mild traumatic corneal scratching without flap displacement may threaten the integrity of the LASIK interface. If foreign bodies are suspected to be the cause of inflammation, early flap lifting with irrigation is imperative for successful treatment.","851":"Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, also known as Kuttner tumor, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the salivary glands that is reported in a few cases in medical literature. Recent reports suggest that certain aspects of sclerosing diseases, including chronic sclerosing sialadenitis or dacryoadenitis, should be classified under immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related sclerosing disease based on immunohistochemical studies. This study reports an unusual case of IgG4-related sclerosing disease appearing simultaneously in the lacrimal glands, submandibular glands, and extraocular muscles. A 56-year-old male presented with complaints of bilateral eyelid swelling and proptosis that began two years ago. Computed tomography confirmed that bilateral submandibular enlargements also existed five years ago in the subject. Orbital computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement and thickening of extraocular muscles. Typical findings of chronic sclerosing dacryoadenitis were revealed upon pathologic exam of the right lacrimal gland. Immunostaining revealed numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells. Through these clinical features, we make a diagnosis of IgG4-relataed sclerosing disease in the subject.","852":"In this case report we describe a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive enophthalmos for 5 months without any other associated ocular symptoms such as pain, diplopia, or visual disturbance. Computed tomography showed that his progressive enophthalmos originated from a frontoethmoidal mucocele and this caused destruction of the lamina papyracea and shrinkage of the ethmoidal air cell. Finally the enlarged orbital space caused an inward deviation of the eyeball. Endoscopic marsupialization was successfully performed by an otolaryngologist and did not result in any ophthalmologic sequelae. Although frontoethmoidal sinus mucoceles mostly frequently originates from orbital mucoceles, enophthalmic manifestations are very rare.

The medical charts of 53 patients who had been diagnosed with sensory strabismus between 2000 and 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The underlying ocular disease, time of onset and the duration of vision impairment, refractive error and axial length of the fixing eye, and the direction and angle of deviation were analyzed to determine the distribution of underlying diseases and any factors relevant to determining the direction of the horizontal deviation. Congenital cataracts were the most common underlying disease, found in 33 patients, followed by acquired cataracts, optic nerve disorders, retinal detachment, glaucoma and lens subluxation. Among the 50 patients with horizontal strabismus, 11 had esotropia and 39 had exotropia. The incidence of esotropia was significantly higher when the fixing eye had hyperopia or emmetropia, than when the eye was myopic. Age of onset of vision deterioration and at diagnosis of sensory strabismus, and the axial length of the fixing eye had no relationship to the direction of horizontal deviation. In addition, the duration of visual impairment had no significant relationship with the direction or extent of horizontal deviation. The most common cause of sensory strabismus was congenital cataracts and the most frequent type of strabismus was exotropia. With respect to the direction of horizontal strabismus, esotropia occurred significantly more often when the refractive error of the fixing eye was hyperopia or emmetropia than when the fixing eye was myopic.

The patient presented with visual loss in both eyes three-months postoperatively. The fundoscopic examination revealed white-yellow, necrotic peripheral lesions in the superotemporal quadrant of both eyes. Although bilateral acute retinal necrosis was suspected, azotemia resulting from diabetic nephropathy limited the use of acyclovir. Antiviral treatment was not started. A sample of the aqueous humor for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was obtained. One week later, the PCR results indicated the presence of cytomegalovirus (CMV). Since the retinal lesions did not progress and did not threaten the macula, the patient was followed without treatment for CMV. The retinal lesions progressively regressed and completely resolved in both eyes by six months of follow-up. Patients with IVTA-induced CMV retinitis may not require systemic treatment with ganciclovir.","863":"This paper reports a case of pegylated interferon-associated retinopathy in a patient with chronic hepatitis C. A 32-year-old female with chronic hepatitis C undergoing pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy complained of visual blurring. Features of interferon-associated retinopathy, including ocular complications such as cotton wool spots, retinal hemorrhages, macular edema, and branch retinal vein occlusion, were found in the fundus of both of her eyes. Pegylated interferon combination therapy was stopped, and the retinopathy of the patient was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab injections and panretinal photocoagulations. This case shows that pharmacokinetically improved pegylated interferon has ocular complications for patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Orbital Doppler and gray-scale sonography was performed in 46 eyes of 23 patients aged 19- to 47-years with acute unilateral ON. ON was diagnosed by an ophthalmologist on the basis of clinical presentation, presence of decreased visual acuity and assessment of visual evoked potentials. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end-diastolic velocity (EDV), as well as the resistance index (RI) and pulsatile index (PI) of the ophthalmic artery (OA), central retinal artery (CRA), posterior ciliary arteries (PCAs) and optic nerve diameter were measured in both eyes. We compared results from affected and unaffected eyes using the paired t-test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to assess the diagnosis of ON based on measured blood flow parameters of the OA, CRA and PCAs and optic nerve diameter. The mean (standard deviation) optic nerve diameter in eyes with ON was 4.1 (0.8) mm, which was significantly larger than the 3.0 (0.4) mm diameter measured in unaffected control eyes (p &lt; 0.001). There were no differences in average PSV, EDV, RI, or PI of the OA and CRA between affected and unaffected eyes (p &gt; 0.05). The mean RI in the PCAs was slightly lower in the eyes with ON than in the contralateral eyes (0.60 vs. 0.64, p &lt; 0.05). The area under the ROC curves indicated that optic nerve diameter was the best parameter for the diagnosis of ON. Optic nerve diameter was related to ON, but orbital blood flow parameters were not. ","870":"To report clinical characteristics of optic neuritis (ON) in Koreans &gt;50 years of age. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients with ON between January 2000 and December 2009. We obtained the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), Goldmann perimetry, relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), and color function tests as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients who were in the acute stage of the disorder. Nine eyes in eight patients were included. The mean age of patients at presentation was 60.5 years (range, 53 to 71 years). Six patients were female, and two were male. There was one patient with bilateral ON. The mean BCVA at presentation was 20 \/ 400 (no light perception-20 \/ 70). Eight eyes (89%) complained of pain with eye movement. Six eyes (66%) had disc edema. Central scotoma was the most common field defect. All eyes had color abnormalities. Five eyes in four patients showed abnormalities of the involved optic nerves on MRI. The patients were followed for a mean of 11.3 months (range, 2 to 34 months). All of the patients recovered to a BCVA of 20 \/ 40 or better within 2 months. On the last follow-up, the mean BCVA was 20 \/ 20 (20 \/ 40 to 20 \/ 16). Four eyes showed remnant central scotoma. One eye had remnant RAPD, and two eyes had mild color abnormalities. Although ON is uncommon in elderly patients, it can develop in patients &gt;50 years of age, and clinical features of optic neuritis in elderly patients are similar to those of younger patients. ","871":"To evaluate the effects of various factors on the variability of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness measurements using the Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT) in normal and glaucomatous eyes. Four hundred seventy-four subjects (103 normal eyes and 371 glaucomatous eyes) were scanned to determine the RNFL thickness measurements using the Stratus OCT. Measurements were obtained twice during the same day. The standard deviation (SD) was used to compare the variability in RNFL thickness measurements of the normal subjects to that of the glaucomatous patients. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate which covariates were independent predictors of SD in overall mean RNFL thickness. The mean SD of all RNFL thickness measurements was larger in the glaucoma group except in one sector. In the multivariate regression analysis, the average signal strength (SS) and the relative SS change (difference in SS between initial and repeat scans, divided by initial SS) were independent predictors of the SD in the RNFL thickness measurements (partial R(2) = 0.018, 0.013; p = 0.016, 0.040, respectively). Glaucomatous eyes tend to be more variable than normal eyes in RNFL thickness measurement using the Straus OCT. The average SS and the relative SS changes appear to correlate with the variability in RNFL thickness measurement. Therefore, the results of the RNFL analysis should not be interpreted independently of these factors.

Eleven eyes of 11 patients with angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) and 12 eyes of 12 patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG) underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. Using AS-OCT, ACD and angle parameters were measured before and 2 days after surgery. Change in intraocular pressure (IOP) and number of ocular hypotensive drugs were evaluated. After surgery, central ACD and angle parameters increased significantly in eyes with glaucoma (p &lt; 0.05). Prior to surgery, mean central ACD in the ACG group was approximately 1.0 mm smaller than that in the OAG group (p &lt; 0.001). Post surgery, mean ACD of the ACG group was still significantly smaller than that of the OAG group. No significant differences were found in angle parameters between the ACG and OAG groups. In the ACG group, postoperative IOP at the final visit was significantly lower than preoperative IOP (p = 0.018) and there was no significant change in the number of ocular hypotensive medications used, although clinically, patients required fewer medications. In the OAG group, the IOP and number of ocular hypotensive drugs were almost unchanged after surgery. The ACD and angle width in eyes with glaucoma increased significantly after phacoemulsification and IOL implantation. Postoperative ACD significantly differed between the ACG and OAG groups, whereas angle parameters did not differ.

On presentation, visual acuity was 40 \/ 50 in the right eye and fundus examination showed a whitish-yellow inflammatory lesion near an atrophic, pigmented retinochoroidal scar located in the superotemporal quadrant. Serologic assessment was negative for IgM, but serum IgG to toxoplasma was elevated. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) revealed increased reflectivity from the inner retinal layer, retinal thickening, and choroidal shadowing while focal posterior hyaloid thickening and detachment were observed in the new lesion. He was treated with trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin, and prednisone. SD-OCT is helpful for definitively differentiating ocular toxoplasmosis from other retinal diseases.","881":"Herein, we report a case of nasal natural killer T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) with intraocular involvement. A 57-year-old woman was referred due to a three-day history of photophobia and diplopia in the left eye. One-month previously, she was diagnosed with nasal NKTL of the right nasal cavity. Ophthalmic examination revealed conjunctival injection and ptosis. The left pupil was fully dilated and non-reactive to light. Ocular motion was restricted on left-upper gaze. Five days later, anterior uveitis developed and persisted despite topical steroid treatment. An orbital magnetic resonance imaging was without specific findings, however, ophthalmoplegia, vitreous opacity, and an iris mass were observed. A diagnostic anterior chamber aspiration was performed. Aqueous humor aspiration revealed 35% morphologically atypical lymphocytes. After an intravitreal triamcinolone injection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were administered; this resolved the uveitis and iris mass. When refractory uveitis or orbital pseudotumor occurs in patients with nasal NKTL, ocular and orbital involvement of the NKTL should be considered.","882":"To report on Achromobacter xylosoxidans keratitis in two healthy patients who had worn contact lenses foran extended period of time. A 36-year-old female and a 21-year-old female visited our hospital with ocular pain and blurred vision. Both patients had a history of wearing soft contact lenses for over fve years with occasional overnight wear. At the initial presentation, a slit lamp examination revealed corneal stromal infiltrations and epithelial defects with peripheral neovascularization in both patients. Microbiological examinations were performed from samples of corneal scrapings, contact lenses, contact lens cases, and solution. The culture resulting from the samples taken from the contact lenses, contact lens cases, and solution were all positive for Achromobacter xylosoxidans. Confrming that the direct cause of the keratitis was the contact lenses, the frst patient was prescribed ceftazidime and amikacin drops sensitive to Achromobacter xylosoxidans. The second patient was treated with 0.3% gatifoxacin and fortifed tobramycin drops. After treatment, the corneal epithelial defects were completely healed, and subepithelial corneal opacity was observed. Two cases of Achromobacter xylosoxidans keratitis were reported in healthy young females who wore soft contact lenses.

Sixteen patients treated with bifocal glasses for at least 5 years were evaluated retrospectively. Angle of deviation at near and distance, refractive error, and AC\/A ratio by the lens gradient method were analyzed. The changes of AC\/A ratios were also compared after dividing the patients according to continuation or cessation of bifocal therapy. Six patients (38%; bifocal stop group, BSG) were able to stop using bifocal glasses at an average age of 10.8 years (range, 6.5 to 15.4 years) during their follow-up. However, the other ten patients (62%; bifocal continue group, BCG) had to continue using bifocal glasses until the final visit, which was 13.8 years on average (range, 11.3 to 18.5 years). The AC\/A ratio decreased from time of bifocal prescription to the last visit in both groups, from 4.4 to 2.7 in the BSG and from 5.9 to 4.5 in the BCG. AC\/A ratios were significantly higher (p = 0.03) in the BCG than that of the BSG from the beginning of bifocal treatment and this difference was persistent until the final visit (p = 0.03). The AC\/A ratio decreased with age in both groups but was significantly higher throughout the entire follow-up period in the BCG. AC\/A ratio at bifocal prescription could be an important factor in predicting response to bifocal treatment.

Seventy five healthy eyes were scanned 3 times per day (intra-session variability) by both the SLO guided re-test mode and the independent mode of SD-SLO\/OCT. Subjects were scanned 3 times by both modes at visits within a 2-week interval (inter-session variability). For testing longitudinal variability, 3 separate exams were performed over 6 months by both modes. The coefficient of variation (CV), reproducibility coefficient (RC) and intraclass correlation coefficient of RNFL thickness were compared between the two modes. The intra-session RC and CV ranged from 5.4 to 12.9 microns and 1.76% to 5.72% when measured by independent mode and 5.4 to 12.5 microns and 1.75% to 5.58% by re-test mode, respectively. The inter-session RC and CV ranged from 5.8 to 13.3 microns and 1.89% to 5.78% by independent mode and 5.8 to 12.7 microns and 1.90% to 5.54% by re-test mode, respectively.

The visual acuity and intraocular pressure were normal in both eyes. However, red-free fundus photography in the left eye showed a superotemporal wedge-shaped retinal nerve fiber layer defect, and visual field testing showed a corresponding partial arcuate scotoma. In an optical coherence tomography examination, the macula was flat, but an arcuate-shaped peripapillary retinoschisis was found. Further, the retinoschisis seemed to be connected with a superotemporal optic pit shown in a disc photograph. After 3 months of a topical prostaglandin analogue medication, the intraocular pressure in the retinoschisis eye was lowered from 14 to 10 mmHg and the peripapillary retinoschisis was almost resolved.

Viral retinitis may occur as an opportunistic infection following IVTA due to the local immune modulatory effect of the steroid; hence, close observation following IVTA is necessary.","896":"A healthy 27-year-old woman with a corneal ulcer underwent fibrin gluing with a bandage contact lens twice, due to an impending perforation. The ulcer lesion slowly progressed, unresponsive to topical antibiotics and amphotericin B. We removed the gluing patch and performed a corneal or scraping or biopsy with multiple amniotic membrane grafts to seal the thinned or perforated cornea. Three days after the surgery, the corneal cultures grew Fusarium, as well as Enterococcus faecalis. Three weeks after surgery, the outermost layer of amniotic membranes, serving as a temporary patch, was removed. The anterior chamber was clear without cells. The signs of infection clinically and symptomatically cleared up four weeks later. Two months after surgery, the lesion became enhanced by amniotic membranes. The use of fibrin glue in infectious keratitis should be avoided, because it not only masks the underlying lesion, but it also interferes with drug penetration into the underlying lesion.","897":"This research focuses on four cases of patients having undergone eximer laser photorefractive surgery who were diagnosed with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis during the postoperative period and who later developed epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC)-like keratitis. Two of the patients had undergone laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK), one had undergone laser in situ keratomileusis and one had photorefractive keratectomy. After the surgery adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis and recurrent late-developing EKC-like keratitis were observed in the patients. Recurrent late-developing EKC-like keratitis occurred in one of the patients, who had received LASEK as many as three times. The others had only one or two episodes.The corneal infiltrates of keratitis mainly occurred in the central cornea. Successful resolution of recurrent late-developing EKC-like keratitis was achieved through the use of topical steroids without sequelae and the final best-corrected visual acuity was as good as the base line. These keratitis infiltrates have been presumed to represent an immune response to the suspected adenoviral antigens deposited in corneal stroma during the primary adenoviral infection. Previous reports argued that patients with a history of adenoviral ketatoconjunctivitis were succeptible to adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis becoming reactivated; however, in our research, our patients had their first adenoviral infections after the eximer laser photorefractive surgery and reactivation was confirmed. We recommend that attention be paid to adenoviral infection after laser refractive operations, because these patients seem to have more frequent recurrences.","898":"Calcinosis cutis involves the inappropriate deposition of calcium within the dermis layer of the skin, and is often associated with rheumatoid disease.

The lesion was partially excised posteriorly under local anesthesia, and pathologists identified the mass as calcinosis cutis. The patient had no systemic or trauma history, and the serum levels of calcium and phosphorous were normal. Idiopathic calcinosis cutis should be included in the differential diagnosis for a protruding papillomatous mass of the tarsal plate, and surgical debulking could be a viable option for large protruding lesions, although more follow-up is necessary to monitor regrowth.","899":"To investigate the effect of dark rearing immediately after birth on the maturation of the visual relay neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Fifty neonatal rats were used. Neonates of the control groups were raised under a normal light\/dark cycle. Neonates of the experiment groups were dark reared and isolated from light during the entire experimental period, then exposed to the sun light for 1 hour before sacrifice. In the control groups, the neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus developed normally at each age tested. In the experiment groups, the cytoplasm of the large neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of 2-week-old rats contained small vesicles, and the cytoplasm of the large neurons of 4-week-old rats was converted into a vacuole-like space. Moreover, c-Fos immunoreactivity of the large neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in the experiment groups was significantly increased compared to that of the control groups. We suppose that the maturation of the neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus might be influenced by light stimulation during the critical period.

A total of 78 out of 130 ophthalmologists returned the survey. On a scale of 1 to 5, the mean rates of whether the ophthalmologists think O-K lenses arrest myopia progression, and whether they recommend their patients to wear O-K lenses if indicative, were 3.06 and 2.75, respectively. Moreover, the mean rates of whether they consider that wearing glasses which are undercorrected would slow down the progression of the myopia, or if they think topical atropine helps in arresting myopia progression in children, were 2.34 and 1.27, respectively. In response to the case studies, the majority of practitioners preferred to prescribe the full amount found in cycloplegic refraction to pediatric patients with myopia. Ophthalmologists in clinical practice encouraged children to wear O-K lenses more than undercorrected glasses as a way to retard myopia progression.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the clinical effect of EV training for low vision rehabilitation in patients with central scotomas. The direction of EV was monitored in 30 low vision patients with central scotomas by moving the patient's view. The PRL was found by using a direct ophthalmoscope and retinal camera; the preserved visual field was identified using a kinetic visual field analyzer. The relationships between EV, PRL, and visual field were evaluated. The patients and their guardians were educated regarding EV. After 2 weeks of self-training, maintenance of EV was checked and changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), reading speed, and satisfaction questionnaire were evaluated.

The MAEs from the ACG group were larger than that from the control group in the Haigis formula. The mean absolute error from the Haigis formula was the largest and the mean absolute error from the Hoffer Q formula was the smallest. IOL power prediction may be inaccurate in ACG patients.

A 36-year-old man, with a history of long-standing retinal detachment in his right eye after the irrigation and aspiration of a congenital cataract, presented with a clinical picture of elevated intraocular pressure and ocular pain. Upon slit-lamp examination, we found a ciliary injection and a pseudohypopyon of polychromatic crystals. Gonioscopic examination revealed a large amount of crystals deposited on the trabecular meshwork and mild rubeosis iridis, but the neovascularization of the angle could not be clearly confirmed due to the presence of so many crystals. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed to remove clusters of crystals and bevacizumab was injected intravitreally to treat iris neovascularization. Aqueous aspirate was examined by light microscopy and the typical highly refringent cholesterol crystals were identified. Intraocular pressure returned to a normal level after the bevacizumab injection, although severe cholesterosis was still evident in the anterior chamber.

Her best corrected visual acuity for the concerned eye was no light perception. Also, a relative afferent pupillary defect was detected in this eye. The left fundus exhibited widespread retinal whitening with visible emboli in several retinal arterioles. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a hyperintense lesion at the left insular cortex.

Vandetanib is believed to have caused vortex keratopathy in this patient. Anti-EGFR properties affecting normal corneal epithelial cell migration and wound healing or drug associated metabolite deposition, which is the case in numerous drug-associated vortex keratopathies, may be possible underlying mechanisms in the formation of this corneal complication.","913":"An 18-year-old man presented with poor vision in both eyes that had been present since birth. Central corneal opacity and inferior peripheral sclerocornea with iridocorneal adhesion were observed upon anterior segment examination of the left eye. A coloboma of the iris was observed in the patient's right eye, which manifested as a small notch in the inferior pupillary margin and cataract. Fundus examination of the right eye showed a large inferior chorioretinal coloboma involving the optic disc and macula. It is essential to examine the fundus in detail, if possible, in cases of Peters' anomaly, because these patients may have congenital anomalies such as chorioretinal coloboma.","914":null,"915":null,"916":"The purpose of this paper is to investigate how much correction is obtained per millimeter of medial rectus (MR) resection for recurrent exotropia after bilateral lateral rectus (BLR) recession, and to determine the difference in the effects between unilateral and bilateral resection, and the influence of previous lateral rectus (LR) recession on the effects of MR resection. A total of 59 patients who had undergone MR resection after BLR recession were included in this study. The unilateral group consisted of 38 patients and bilateral group, 21 patients. Thirty patients in the unilateral group were divided into two groups: patients who had undergone previous LR recession of 7 mm or greater (21 patients) and less than 7 mm (9 patients). Main outcome measures were average deviation corrected per millimeter of MR resection at 1 month postoperative. The average effect of MR resection was 4.2 prism diopters (PD, 2.0 to 6.7 PD)\/mm. The average effect in the unilateral group was 4.2 PD\/mm and 4.1 PD\/mm in the bilateral group. There was no significant difference between groups (P = 0.60). The average effect in the recession 7 mm or greater group was 4.0 PD\/mm, and the average effect in the recession less than 7 mm group was 4.2 PD\/mm (P = 0.698). The effect of MR resection per millimeter was variable. The laterality and previous amount of LR recession did not influence the effect of MR resection. These variable outcomes dictate that caution be exercised when MR resection is performed for recurrent exotropia.

The GBE-treated group received 80 mg GBE orally, twice a day for four weeks, and the control group received a placebo twice a day for four weeks. Complete ocular examinations including visual field, Heidelberg retina flowmeter, and systemic examinations were performed on the first study day and on the day treatment was completed. After GBE treatment, the mean blood flow, volume, and velocity increased at almost all points, and there was a statistically significant increase in blood flow at almost all points, in comparison to the placebo. Blood volume significantly increased only in the superior nasal and superior temporal neuroretinal rim areas. GBE also significantly increased blood velocity in areas of the inferior temporal neuroretinal rim and superior temporal peripapillary area.

A retrospective chart review of 289 neonates with a medical history of perinatal distress was conducted. Among these 289 patients (578 eyes), 29 eyes of 17 neonates were found to have had retinal hemorrhages or vitreous hemorrhages (VH). A comprehensive chart review, including details of fundoscopic findings and perinatal history, was conducted. Intraocular hemorrhage was present in 5.5% of the patients. Most hemorrhages (82.7%) were intraretinal. In our population, 17% (n = 5) of hemorrhages resolved within two weeks, but 31% (n = 9) did not resolve even after four weeks. Most hemorrhages spontaneously resolved without any specific sequelae; however, one infant's dense unilateral VH persisted up to three months after birth. When the patient was seen again at 3.5 years of age, she had developed axial myopia and severe amblyopia of the involved eye. In asphyxiated newborns, the possibility of intraocular hemorrhages should be considered. Long-standing, dense hemorrhages obscuring the macula may lead to severe vision deprivation amblyopia. Therefore, ophthalmic examination should be considered in neonates with perinatal distress, and close observation is necessary for hemorrhages that do not resolve in this amblyogenic age group.

We performed a retrospective review of medical records and data analyses of consecutive patients who presented with stages 4B and 5 ROP and underwent LSV from 1999 to 2007. Retinal reattachment status, visual acuity and postoperative complications were evaluated. Twenty-one eyes of 20 patients, including 13 eyes with stage 4B ROP and 8 eyes with stage 5 ROP, were examined. The mean follow-up period was 5.6 years. In 9 (43%) out of 21 eyes, retinas were eventually reattached. The anatomic success rates were 62% in stage 4B and 13% in stage 5 ROP. In eyes with reattached retinas, visual acuity better than form vision was shown in 7 eyes (78%), whereas no light perception was present in 10 eyes (83%) among eyes with TRD on final examination. Postoperative intraocular hemorrhage occurred in nine eyes (43%). Long-term complications of cataract, corneal opacity, glaucoma and strabismus developed in 4 (19%), 6 (29%), 7 (33%) and 8 (38%) eyes, respectively, and were more common in eyes with TRD. After following-up for a mean of 5.6 years, the anatomical success rate of LSV was encouraging for the correction of TRD associated with stage 4B ROP but not for stage 5 ROP. Retinal reattachment is important for obtaining better visual outcomes and preventing the development of late complications.

Under the presumption that he was suffering from retrobulbar optic neuritis or ischemic optic neuropathy, visual field tests were performed, revealing the presence of a junctional scotoma. Imaging studies revealed tumorous lesions extending from the sphenoid sinus at the right superior orbital fissure, with erosion of the right medial orbital wall and optic canal. Right optic nerve decompression was performed via an endoscopic sphenoidectomy, and histopathologic examination confirmed the presence of aspergillosis. The patient did not receive any postoperative antifungal treatment; however, his vision improved to 20 \/ 40, and his visual field developed a left congruous superior quadrantanopsia 18 months postoperatively. A junctional scotoma can be caused by aspergillosis, demonstrating the importance of examining the asymptomatic eye when a patient is experiencing a loss of vision in one eye. Furthermore, damage to the distal optic nerve adjacent to the proximal optic chiasm can induce unusual congruous superior quadrantanopsia.","925":"An 11-year-old female presenting diplopia only at distance was found to have comitant esotropia of 20 prism diopters (PD) at distance and normal alignment at nearer proximity. Other ocular movement, including abduction, was normal and a thorough neurologic examination was also normal. The deviation angle of esotropia was increased to 35 PD in 6 months, and a brain magnetic resonance imaging with venogram at that time demonstrated no intracranial lesion. A lumbar puncture showed increased opening pressure but the cerebrospinal fluid composition was normal. The patient was diagnosed as having idiopathic intracranial hypertension and treated with oral acetazolamide. Three months after treatment, the deviation angle decreased to 10 PD. This is a case report of divergence insufficiency in pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension, with an increasing deviation angle of esotropia. Although sixth cranial nerve palsy is a common neurologic manifestation in intracranial hypertension, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of divergence insufficiency. Also, ophthalmoparesis may not be apparent and typical at first presentation, as seen in this case, and therefore ophthalmologists should be aware of this fact, while conducting careful and proper evaluation, follow-up, and intervention.","926":"A 54-year-old male patient was seen in clinic for ocular pain and decreased vision in the right eye with duration of two days. He underwent a cataract operation for his right eye 12 years ago, then a sclera-fixated secondary intraocular implantation and pars plana vitrectomy three years ago due to intraocular lens dislocation. At the initial visit, his visual acuity was restricted to the perception of hand motion. An edematous cornea, cells, flare with hypopyon, and exposed suture material at were observed at the six o'clock direction by slit lamp. Vitreous opacity was noted from B-scan ultrasonography. The patient was diagnosed with late-onset endophthalmitis and an intravitreal cocktail injection was done. On the next day, the hypopyon was aggravated, and therefore a pars plana vitrectomy was performed. A vitreous culture tested positive for Citrobacter koseri. After 12 weeks, the best corrected visual acuity of the right eye improved to 0.7 and a fundus examination revealed a relatively normal optic disc and retinal vasculature. We herein report the first case of endophthalmitis caused by Citrobacter koseri in Korea. Exposed suture material was suspected as the source of infection in this case and prompt surgical intervention resulted in a relatively good visual outcome.","927":"We report a case of posterior scleritis effectively managed with intravitreal bevacizumab. A 71-year-old woman was diagnosed with posterior scleritis. Although she was initially treated with systemic steroids, her clinical presentation deteriorated.

SD-OCT demonstrated characteristic defects at the level of the inner and outer segment junction of the photoreceptors in all the affected eyes and decreased reflectiveness of the retinal pigment epithelium layer. TD-OCT images showed unremarkable findings in two eyes with deteriorated visual acuity. SD-OCT improves diagnosis and assessment of the degree and nature of foveal damage in patients with solar retinopathy and may be an important tool for use in identifying foveal damage not detected by TD-OCT.

In 12 eyes of 6 patients, Humphrey visual field (HVF) and multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) were performed. Re-examinations were periodically performed for a mean of 26 days. Data from 9 injured eyes were collected and compared to data collected from the 9 non-affected eyes of the same patients. SD-OCT revealed no significant differences in the foveal thickness and total macular volume between traumatized and intact eyes in all 9 patients. Only 3 out of the 9 injured eyes showed abnormal findings in SD-OCT images such as discontinuity of the inner\/outer segment (IS\/OS) junction or abnormal hyper-reflectivity from the IS\/OS and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) lines in the macula. HVF and mfERG results did not show any functional deterioration in the injured eyes compared with intact eyes. During follow-up, the commotio retinae resolved in all 9 eyes. The changes to the outer retinal region detected in 3 patients by SD-OCT were also resolved. Acute retinal changes in commotio retinae, not associated with other retinal pathologies, were resolved without histological and functional sequelae.

This was a retrospective study analyzing the medical records of seven patients, treated in our clinic, who were followed for more than five years. Four patients in our clinic underwent a corneal ulcer treatment following suspected EKC. Each developed a monocular corneal opacity. Three patients with a chief complaint of corneal opacity were transferred to our clinic from other clinics. These patients had documented histories of treatment for EKC in infancy. All patients were treated with early occlusion therapy, but amblyopia persisted in four patients. Furthermore, all patients had strabismus and showed a significant reduction of stereoscopic vision. Although infants with EKC are not always cooperative, slit lamp examination should be performed as early as possible, and appropriate medical treatment should be performed, thus reducing the development of corneal opacity. Careful follow up should be regularly performed, and the occurrence of amblyopia or strabismus should be verified at an early stage using visual acuity or ocular alignment examination.

Forty-eight eyes of 24 subjects with bilateral PACS were recruited consecutively. Each eye was randomly allocated to treatment with conventional LPI, argon LPI only, or LPI plus iridoplasty, which consisted of simultaneous argon LPI and peripheral iridoplasty. Anterior chamber measurements were performed on each eye using a Pentacam, both before and after treatment. Mean anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV), and anterior chamber angle were measured, and topographic ACD analysis was performed. Results were compared between the two treatment groups. After treatment with either conventional LPI or LPI plus iridoplasty, the mean ACD and ACV increased significantly. Topographic ACD analysis revealed that the mid-to-peripheral ACD increase was significantly greater in the LPI plus iridoplasty group than in eyes treated with conventional LPI. Intraocular pressure changes and post-LPI complications did not differ between the groups. Compared with conventional LPI, our study showed that LPI plus iridoplasty improved the mid-to-peripheral ACD increase.

Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) demonstrated a disruption in the photoreceptor inner and outer segment (IS\/OS) junction and undulation of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with backscattering. We re-examined the patient after two weeks and after three months without any treatment. Visual acuity and visual field results were gradually normalized, and OCT demonstrated the recovery of continuity in the photoreceptor IS\/OS junction, as well as decreased RPE irregularity with minimal backscattering. We used spectral domain OCT instead of time domain OCT (OCT3) so that we could provide better image resolution of the acute retinal pigment epitheliitis (ARPE).

A complete ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral myopic shift, intraocular pressure elevation, shallowing of the anterior chambers, choroidal effusions, radiating retinal folds, and conjunctival chemosis. Approximately one week after HCTZ discontinuance, all ocular changes disappeared completely. Physicians should be aware of the adverse ocular effects of HCTZ and should manage patients accordingly.","942":"A 60-year-old man with bilateral corneal opacity underwent cataract extraction surgery involving the use of a limbal relaxing incision in his left eye. He had lower lid ectropion and lagophthalmos in both eyes. Eleven days after the surgery, a slit-lamp examination revealed a neurotrophic corneal ulcer with a punch-out epithelial defect and rolled edges at the center of the pre-existing corneal opacity. The patient was treated with sodium hyaluronate, autologous serum, and oral doxycycline. Six weeks after the surgery an improvement in corneal sensation was observed and the neurotrophic corneal ulcer subsequently healed over the course of one year. In this report, we present a case of neurotrophic keratitis that occurred after performing cataract surgery concurrent with a limbal relaxing incision. As such, we suggest that limbal relaxing incisions should be performed cautiously in patients with causative risk factors for corneal hypesthesia.","943":"We report the outcome of conventional epipolis laser in situ keratomileusis (Epi-LASIK, flap-on) and lamellar epithelial debridement (LED; Epi-LASIK, flap-off) in myopic patients with dermatologic keloids. Three patients, who were all noted to be susceptible to keloid scarring, received conventional Epi-LASIK in their right eyes and LED in their left eyes. The patients were followed-up for 6 to 21 months after their surgeries, and the outcomes were then evaluated. In case 1, the preoperative spherical equivalent (SE) was -6.5 diopters (D) in the right eye (OD) and -6.25 D in the left eye (OS). At 21 months postoperatively, the uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 20 \/ 12.5 in both eyes. In case 2, the preoperative SE was -5.25 (OD) \/ -6.00 (OS). After six months, the postoperative UCVA was 20 \/ 12.5 in both eyes. In case 3, the preoperative SE was -4.5 (OD) \/ -2.0 (OS). The UCVA at the six-month follow-up was 20 \/ 12.5 in both eyes. No adverse events, including corneal haze, occurred in any of the patients. All three of our patients reported excellent visual outcomes following both conventional Epi-LASIK and LED, despite their histories of keloid formation. The present cases suggest that both Epi-LASIK and LED may be safe and effective techniques for myopic patients with dermatologic keloids.","944":"A 62-year-old female visited our clinic with progressively decreased vision in both eyes beginning 12 years prior. Idiopathic corneal opacity in all layers of the cornea was found in both eyes. One year later, we performed penetrating keratoplasty on the undiagnosed right eye. During post-surgical follow-up, corneal edema and stromal opacity recurred, and penetrating keratoplasty was performed two more times. The patient's total serum protein level, which had previously been normal, was elevated prior to the final surgery. She was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. We made a final diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy-associated crystalline keratopathy after corneal biopsy. Monoclonal gammopathy-associated crystalline keratopathy is difficult to diagnose and may lead to severe visual loss.

We intended to confirm the presence of cellular toxicity and apoptosis and to reveal the roles of p53, caspase 3 and NOXA in these processes. Cells were irradiated with an ultraviolet lamp. Cellular toxicity was measured by a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Hoechst staining and fluorescent anti-caspase 3 antibodies were used for apoptosis investigation. The quantities of p53, caspase 3, and NOXA were measured by Western blotting for to investigate the apoptosis pathway. Cellular toxicity on the human lens epithelium markedly increased with time after UV exposure. On Hoechst staining, we found that apoptosis also remarkably increased after exposure to ultraviolet light, compared with a control group. In the immunochemical study using anti-caspase 3 antibodies, active caspase 3 significantly increased after exposure to ultraviolet light. On Western blotting, p53 decreased, while caspase 3 and NOXA increased. Exposure of cultured human lens epithelial cell lines to ultraviolet light induces apoptosis, which promotes the expression of NOXA and caspase 3 increases without increasing p53. This may suggest that UV induced apoptosis is caused by a p53-independent pathway in human lens epithelial cells. ","946":"Cancer-associated retinopathy is a paraneoplastic retinal degeneration which may primarily result from auto-immune mediated apoptosis. It has been hypothesized that high titer of auto-antibodies are able to cross the blood-retinal barrier (BRB) and to enter retinal cells to activate apoptotic pathway which has been already well-established. However, it still remains to be elucidated whether auto-antibodies could cross BRB in the retina. Herein, we demonstrated that intravenously administrated anti-recoverin antibodies could not pass through BRB and not lead to retinal cell death. Anti-recoverin antibody was intravenously injected to C57BL\/6 mice, which were sacrificed 1 and 7 days to obtain eye. Vascular endothelial growth factor was intravitreally injected to induce BRB breakdown, which was confirmed by fluorescein angiography and western blotting for zonula occludens (ZO)-1, ZO-2 and occludin. To investigate the location of anti-recoverin antibody in the retina, immunofluorescein was performed. The retinal toxicity of intravenous anti-recoverin antibody was evaluated by histological examination and transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling. Immunofluorescein staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein was done to address glial activation as well. Intravenously administrated anti-recoverin antibodies were exclusively distributed on retinal vessels which were co-localized with CD31, and led to neither increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein expression, as an indicator of retinal stress, nor apoptotic retinal cell death. Moreover, even in the condition of vascular endothelial growth factor-induced BRB breakdown, anti-recoverin antibodies could not migrate across BRB and still remained on retinal vessels without retinal cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that high titer of intravascular anti-recoverin antibodies could not penetrate into the retina by themselves, and BRB breakdown mediated by dysregulation of tight junction might not be sufficient to allow anti-recoverin antibodies to pass through BRB.

The duration of symptoms, refractive error, distant and near deviation angles, and near point of convergence (NPC) prior to and after 12 weeks of HBPP therapy were measured in all patients. The mean age of the patients was 19.3 years. The mean deviation angle of exophoria was 3 prism diopters (PD) at distant and 11.2 PD at near. The mean value of NPC prior to HBPP therapy was 36.3 cm; however, the near point of accommodation was within the normal range. After 12 weeks of HBPP therapy, the mean deviation angle of exophoria decreased to orthophoric at distant and 4 PD at near. The mean value of NPC decreased to 14.4 cm.

Three different observers calculated the gray scales three separate times. Reproducibility was assessed using the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The mean age of the participants was 50.6 years old (range, 11 to 82 years). The mean gray scales of the nasal rim were 91.81, 94.91, and 93.24; those of the brightest cupping center were 174.84, 179.94, and 177.76; and those of the largest inferior retinal vein were 61.85, 53.48, and 56.73 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Inter-observer reproducibility for NR, BCC and IRV was considered good based upon ICC values of 0.944, 0.860, and 0.789 for observers 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Significant age-related differences between the values of the brightest cupping center were noted, and the gray scale score was decreased in the older participants (p &lt; 0.001).

The RNFL thickness as measured by the Stratus and Spectral OCT was compared (paired t-test). The relationship and agreement of RNFL thickness between the two OCT modalities were evaluated by Pearson correlation, Bland-Altman plot, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Two-hundred seventeen eyes of 217 patients, including twenty-four normal eyes, ninety-one glaucoma suspects, seventy-six normal tension glaucoma cases, and twenty-six primary open angle glaucoma cases (POAG) were analyzed. The peripapillary RNFL thicknesses as measured by Stratus OCT were significantly greater than those measured by Spectralis OCT. However, in quadrant comparisons, the temporal RNFL thickness obtained using Stratus OCT were significantly less than those obtained using Spectralis OCT. Correlations between RNFL parameters were strong (Pearson correlation coefficient for mean RNFL thickness = 0.88); a high degree of correlation was found in the POAG group. Bland-Altman plotting demonstrated that agreement in the temporal quadrant was greater than any other quadrant. Both OCT systems were highly correlated and demonstrated strong agreement. However, absolute measurements of peripapillary RNFL thickness differed between Stratus OCT and Spectralis OCT. Thus, measurements with these instruments should not be considered interchangeable. The temporal quadrant was the only sector where RNFL thickness as measured by Spectralis OCT was greater than by Stratus OCT; this demonstrated greater agreement than other sectors.

In large-angle sensory exotropia, instead of additive surgery on the seeing eye, supermaximal medial rectus resection and lateral rectus recession only on the visually poor eye is a clinically feasible surgical option.","957":"Kabuki syndrome is characterized by long palpebral fissures, large ears, a depressed nasal tip, and skeletal anomalies associated with postnatal dwarfism and mental retardation. There have been few prior detailed descriptions of strabismus or stereopsis in these patients. We report a patient with Kabuki syndrome who showed small-angle strabismus and poor stereopsis. This case illustrates the need for patients with a diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome to have an ophthalmologic evaluation. Strabismus associated with Kabuki syndrome may have a small angle that can be easily overlooked.","958":null,"959":"We report a case of a retained graphite anterior chamber foreign body that was masquerading as stromal keratitis. A 28-year-old male visited with complaints of visual disturbance and hyperemia in his right eye for four weeks. On initial examination, he presented with a stromal edema involving the inferior half of the cornea, epithelial microcysts, and moderate chamber inflammation. Suspecting herpetic stromal keratitis, he was treated with anti-viral and anti-inflammatory agents. One month after the initial visit, anterior chamber inflammation was improved and his visual acuity recovered to 20\/20, but subtle corneal edema still remained. On tapering the medication, after three months, a foreign body was incidentally identified in the inferior chamber angle and was surgically removed resulting in complete resolution of corneal edema. The removed foreign body was a fragment of graphite and he subsequently disclosed a trauma with mechanical pencil 12 years earlier. This case showed that the presence of an anterior chamber foreign body should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of idiopathic localized corneal edema.","960":"To evaluate the clinical efficacy and histopathological tolerance of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate versus conventional suture materials for eyelid wound closure in rabbits. We performed an experimental study on 16 eyes of eight New Zealand albino rabbits. Eyelid incisions of 15 mm were done 4mm from the upper eyelid margin in both eyes. The eyes of the rabbits were divided into two groups: eyelid incisions of the right eye were closed by a 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive (group A) and eyelid incisions of the left eye were closed by 7-0 nylon sutures (group B). At 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery, the rabbits were macroscopically examined and then sacrificed. The specimens of their eyelid tissues were stained by a hematoxylin and eosin stain and Masson-trichrome stain, and were observed under microscope. Both eyelid surgical closure methods were found to be equally efficacious in fixing the eyelids of groups A and B, and their clinical efficacy was similar. Histopathological findings of the hematoxylin and eosin stain of group A showed less inflammatory infiltration than group B at 2 weeks. There were no significant histopathological differences between the two groups at 1, 4, and 8 weeks. The degree of fibrosis of the Masson-trichrome stain was similar between the two groups at 8 weeks. The 2-octyl cyanoacrylate adhesive proved to be an effective eyelid closure method and was very well tolerated by the skin surface. 2-Octyl cyanoacrylate could be used as an alternative tissue adhesive for eyelid wound closure along with conventional suture materials.

Residents of Sangju aged greater than 50 years old were included in this study. Participants completed an interview examining their medical and ophthalmic history Information was collected on the participants' uncorrected and best corrected vision scores, slit lamp examination results, angle width measurements using the Van Herick technique, gonioscopy if the angle width was less than 1 \/ 4 angle, intraocular pressure (IOP) assessed with the Goldmann applanation tonometry, optic disc examination results, and a visual field test results using frequency-doubling perimetry in cases in which glaucoma was suspected. Glaucoma was diagnosed according to the criteria described by the International Society for Geographic and Epidemiological Ophthalmology. 1,118 residents aged greater than 50 years were examined initially from a population of 2,984 people. Of these, 671 subjects (60%) participated in this study. The prevalence of glaucoma was determined to be 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1-4.8). Open-angle glaucoma with low IOP was determined to be the most common form with a prevalence rate as high as 2.5% (95% CI, 1.8-3.7). Additionally, primary angle closure glaucoma was determined to have a prevalence rate of 0.3% (95% CI, 0.1-0.9). Open-angle glaucoma with low IOP accounted for 94.4% of the open-angle glaucoma cases. The prevalence of glaucoma among the population of rural Sangju was 3.4%, and open-angle glaucoma with low IOP was the most common form accounting for 94.4% of the total number of cases.

The study included 12 patients with naive PCV. Photodynamic therapy and 3 consecutive intravitreal bevacizumab injections at 6-week intervals were given. Best corrected visual acuity, subretinal fluid (SRF), pigment epithelium detachment (PED), central macular thickness (CMT), and total macular volume (TMV) were measured before and after treatment as assessed by Stratus OCT3. After treatment, the SRF height decreased earlier than the PED height. The SRF diameter decreased with statistical significance. However, the PED diameter did not show a statistically significant improvement, persisting at pre-treatment levels. Both CMT and TMV decreased significantly after treatment. After PCV treatment, SRF and PED stabilized, as shown by OCT. However, the PED treatment response was both delayed and refractory compared to the SRF response. The small change in post-treatment PED diameter may suggest the possibility of PCV recurrence. ","965":"To investigate correlated factors on final visual acuity in conjunction with fluorescein angiography (FA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). Twenty-four patients (36 eyes) with typical findings of chronic CSCR based on medical records, FA and OCT results were enrolled in this study. We investigated demographic findings, initial and final visual acuity (VA), and some typical findings of FA including the type of leakage pattern, the existence of a gravitational tract and an abnormal hyperfluorescent area centered on the fovea. We also investigated OCT findings to examine serous retinal detachment, outer photoreceptor layer (OPRL) preservation, continuity of the inner segment (IS) and the outer segment (OS) of the photoreceptor layer in case of macular attachment, and other typical findings. The converted logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution VA was used to investigate the statistical correlation with these FA and OCT findings. An abnormal hyperfluorescent area within 1 macular photocoagulation study disc area on FA and cystoid degeneration on OCT were correlated with poor final VA of less than 20 \/ 40. However, the preserved OPRL and the continuity of IS \/ OS junction were correlated with a good final VA of 0.5 or more. These specific findings could be associated with recurrent or persistent subretinal fluid and could be important parameters of decision for treatment.

Subjects included patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and no systemic disease. Corneal\/conjunctival fluorescein staining was scored and the correlation between the score and the IL-17 level was evaluated. A strong correlation existed between IL-17 level and the type of systemic disease. IL-17 was significantly elevated in patients with chronic GVHD compared to those with RA and SS. IL-17 was not detectable in patients with SLE or in those without systemic disease. IL-23 was not detected in any of the subjects. IL-17 was significantly increased in patients with high fluorescein staining scores. Our data suggest that IL-17 is involved in the pathogenesis of DE in patients with systemic immune-mediated diseases.

He had been receiving tacrolimus (FK 506) for 30 months (6 mg\/day for 2 years and 3 mg\/day for 6 months); he reported that the visual disturbance began while taking tacrolimus. A full ophthalmologic examination and electrophysiologic and imaging studies were performed. The best corrected visual acuity was 0.1 in both eyes. There were no abnormal finding in the anterior segment, pupillary reflexes were normal and, there was no swelling in either optic disc. Although the foveal reflex was slightly decreased, fluorescein angiography revealed non-specific signs, with the exception of a window defect. A multifocal electro-retinogram revealed decreased amplitude of the central ring. A Swedish interactive threshold algorithm-standard 10-2 visual field test revealed a central scotoma. These findings suggest that tacrolimus may result in maculopathy. Therefore, careful ophthalmologic examination is necessary in the patients taking tacrolimus.","970":"We report a case of early resolution of convergence spasms following the addition of antipsychotic medications and present it as a possible alternative to the conventional treatment for convergence spasms.

A 36-year-old woman presented complaining of decreased visual acuity (VA) in her left eye. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20\/200 and iris coloboma was observed. Funduscopy and fluorescein angiography (FA) showed CNV in the superior extrafoveal region with chorioretinal coloboma reaching just inferior to the optic disc. No other cause for CNV was observed except for the chorioretinal coloboma. BCVA improved to 20\/30 after laser photocoagulation. She revisited our clinic for deteriorating VA (20\/400) in the same eye 3 years after treatment. Funduscopy and FA demonstrated recurrent CNV with subfoveal hemorrhage. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was followed by three consecutive intravitreal bevacizumab injections (IVB) for the subfoveally-located CNV. However, the CNV persisted with the appearance of a fresh subretinal hemorrhage. Additional PDT was combined with IVB on the same day 6 months after the initial PDT. The CNV regressed 3 months after treatment and has not recurred as of 8 months after the last treatment. The patient's BCVA improved to 20\/60. This case suggests that PDT combined with IVB can be an alternative treatment for the management of recurrent CNV after laser photocoagulation in eyes with chorioretinal coloboma.","972":"A 60-year-old male was referred to the ophthalmologic clinic with aggravated anterior uveitis and corneal edema despite the use of topical and systemic steroids. He had undergone cataract surgery in both eyes 15 years previous. Slit lamp examinations revealed a retained lens fragment in the inferior angle of the anterior chamber, with severe corneal edema and mild anterior uveitis. The corneal edema and uveitis subsided following surgical extraction of the lens fragment. That a retained lens fragment caused symptomatic anterior uveitis with corneal edema 15 years after an uneventful cataract surgery is unique. A retained lens fragment should be considered as one of the causes of anterior uveitis in a pseudophakic patient.","973":"We report the first case of ocular benign lymphoid hyperplasia (BLH) treated with subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab (Avastin).

The patient was subsequently given a subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg \/ 0.1 mL). The patient did not experience recurrence or malignant metaplasia during the one-year follow-up period. In patients with conjunctival BLH, subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab can be a useful treatment option in patients unable to undergo a surgical procedure due to limbal neovascularization.","974":"A 79-year-old male presented with left ocular pain.

Neuronal responses were recorded from ninety-four neurons in cortical areas 17 and 18 in two adult cats. A multi-channel microelectrode was implanted in cortical areas 17 and 18 of two paralyzed and anaesthetized cats. Various drifting sinusoidal grating contrast displays were presented to one of the cats' eyes in the visual field. Contour plots based on the neuronal responses to the drifting sinusoidal grating displays using various contrasts (i.e., 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0) and velocities (i.e., 4.6, 13.9, 23.1, 32.3, 41.5, 50.8, and 60.0 deg\/sec) were plotted as a function of the spatial frequency and the direction associated with each velocity and contrast used. Five parameters were extracted from these contour plots: 1) optimum response, 2) preferred direction, 3) optimum spatial frequency, 4) directional tuning width, and 5) spatial frequency bandwidth. To determine the optimal velocity, each parameter was plotted against each of the specific display contrasts used, and a 'best fit' line was established. Response amplitudes were dependent on the type of contrast utilized; however, the spatial frequency and directional tuning properties were stable for the cortical neurons assessed. The results of the presentation of different contrasts on neuronal directional and spatial frequency tuning are consistent with behavioral results when medium and high contrast displays are used.

The tumor volume was assessed radiologically via brain magnetic resonance images and was calculated using Cavalieri's principle. We used the mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) of the Humphrey parameter to measure VF defect severity, and then analyzed the correlation of tumor volume with VF defects. Twenty nine patients (74%) showed abnormal VF and bitemporal field changes, which were the most common field defects on presentation. Seven patients (18%) had unilateral VF defects, 22 patients (56%) had bilateral VF defects. The tumor volume of the patients with VF defects was significantly larger than that of patients with normal VF (p = 0.006). The tumor volume exhibited significant negative correlation with MD (r = -0.693; p &lt; 0.001) and significant positive correlation with PSD (r = 0.589; p &lt; 0.001).

Nine months later, the subretinal exudates extended to the fovea despite treatment with laser photocoagulation. Cryotherapy was not possible at the time because of the posterior location of the retinal telangiectatic vessels. She was treated with a combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal bevacizumab injection: three injections were given at 2-month intervals. After this combined therapy, her right fundus revealed a significant regression of abnormal retinal vessels and subretinal exudates. A fluorescein angiography showed no leakage from the abnormal retinal vessels. At 9 months after the combined therapy, she was able to maintain a stable visual acuity and visual field. This is the first case report that demonstrates the efficacy of the combined treatment of PDT and intravitreal bevacizumab injection in Coats's disease.

Preoperative examinations (slit lamp examination, mean central corneal thickness, and central endothelial cell counts) were performed for each patient. Cataracts were subdivided into moderate and hard, according to the Lens Opacities Classification System III grading of nucleus opalescence (NO). Eyes in each cataract group were randomly assigned to conventional and torsional phaco-mode. Intraoperative parameters, including ultrasound time (UST), cumulative dissipated energy (CDE), and the balanced salt solution plus (BSSP) volume utilized were evaluated.

Four months later, extraocular movement was normalized, and visual acuity improved to 20\/25 in the right eye.","999":"A previously healthy 50-year-old man was transferred to our hospital for evaluation of acute inflammation in his right eye after ocular trauma while using a grass mower. Slit lamp examination showed 1 mm-length full thickness corneal laceration without leakage, 4+ cells and inflammatory membrane in the anterior chamber, 10% hypopyon, posterior synechiae formation, and cataract change. Upon orbital computerized tomography, a metallic intraocular foreign body in the lens was identified. Vitrectomy, phacoemulsification, foreign body removal, anterior chamber irrigation, and intravitreal antibiotics injections of vancomycin and ceftazidime were performed. In a culture of humor from the anterior chamber grew Pantoea species. More procedures were performed, including intravitreal antibiotics injection of ceftazidime. Upon administering a course of intravenous ceftazidime, fortified ceftazidime and moxifloxacin eye drops, and oral prednisolone, the patient improved.","1000":null,"1001":"A 53-year-old woman visited the Department of Rheumatology with a chief complaint of a 3-day history of fever and chills and also presented with pain occurring in both knees at the time of outpatient visit. Based on rheumatologic and hematological lab studies, ultrasonography, and a needle aspiration biopsy of the articular cavity, the patient was diagnosed with reactive arthritis. On hospitalization day 3, consultation with the Department of Ophthalmology was requested regarding decreased visual acuity lasting for 3 days. Upon ophthalmologic examination, the corrected visual acuity was 0.1 in the right eye and 0.05 in the left eye. Upon slit lamp microscopy, there were no abnormal findings in the anterior segment. Upon fundus examination, however, there were yellow-white lesions in the macular area of both eyes. Fluorescein angiography was performed to assess the macular lesions, and the findings were suggestive of macular infarction in both eyes. Due to a lack of other underlying disease, a past surgical history, and a past history of drug administration, the patient was diagnosed with macular infarction in both eyes associated with reactive arthritis. To date, there have been no other such cases reported. In a patient with reactive arthritis, we experienced a case of macular infarction in both eyes, which occurred without association with a past history of specific drug use or underlying disease. Herein, we report our case, with a review of the literature.","1002":"To describe the clinical and optical coherence tomography (OCT) features of a macular hole (MH) or its precursor lesion in patients treated with systemic antiestrogen agents. We reviewed the medical history of the patient, ophthalmic examination, and both fundus and OCT findings. Three female patients receiving antiestrogen therapy sought treatment for visual disturbance. All of the patients showed foveal cystic changes with outer retinal defect upon OCT. Visual improvement was achieved through surgery for the treatment of MH in two patients. Antiestrogen therapy may result in MH or its precursor lesion, in addition to perifoveal refractile deposits. OCT examination would be helpful for early detection in such cases.","1003":null,"1004":null,"1005":null,"1006":null,"1007":"To assess the results and long-term prognosis of evisceration with primary porous implant placement in patients with endophthalmitis. A retrospective study was conducted to review the files of 27 patients (29 eyes) with endophthalmitis who underwent evisceration with primary porous implant placement from January 1997 to December 2007 at St. Mary's Hospital and Kangnam St. Mary's Hospital. The mean follow-up period was 12.24 months (range, 3 to 89 months) and the mean age of the patients was 63.6 years (range, 33 to 89 years). During the surgical procedure, primary implant placement was successfully completed, and any postoperative infection or inflammation rapidly resolved in all 27 patients (29 eyes). One of two porous implant materials was used. Hydroxyapatite was inserted in 14 eyes and Medpor was inserted in 15 eyes. Delayed implant exposure was noted in 1 eye, which was treated by inserting a hydroxyapatite implant 18 months after the first surgery. This was well treated by a preserved scleral graft. Implant infection was noted in 1 other eye at 20 days after the first surgery. All other minor complications healed without sequelae. Evisceration with primary porous implant placement as the treatment for recalcitrant endophthalmitis resulted in rapid resolution of any infection and inflammation. Implant exposure and infection occurred in only 2 eyes, and these problems were well treated without long-term sequelae. Therefore, evisceration with primary porous implant placement is a treatment option for patients with endophthalmitis. ","1008":null,"1009":"The purpose of this study is to identify risk factors for severe thyroid-associated orbitopathy (TAO) and compressive optic neuropathy in Korean patients. This study was a retrospective comparative case series. All TAO patients who were first seen at our institution between 2005 and 2009 and who had follow-up periods of at least 6 months were included. Patients were divided into mild or moderate and severe TAO groups. Cases were also segregated based on the presence or absence of optic neuropathy. Demographics, smoking status, comorbidities, thyroid hormonal status, thyroid autoantibody levels, and clinical presentations were assessed. A total of 99 patients (83 with mild to moderate courses and 16 with severe courses; 90 without optic neuropathy and 9 with optic neuropathy) were included in this study. On multiple logistic regression analysis, smoking status was a predictive risk factor for a severe course of TAO and the development of optic neuropathy (odds ratios = 6.57 and 10.00, respectively). Other factors such as age, gender, free T4 level, thyroid binding-inhibiting immunoglobulin, and a history of diabetes were not predictive of severe TAO or optic neuropathy. Although various factors may influence the severity of TAO and the development of optic neuropathy, this study showed that smoking was a risk factor for severe TAO and the development of optic neuropathy. Therefore, it is important for patients with Graves' disease to refrain from smoking. Frequent and careful observation should also be performed in current smokers, as TAO patients who smoke are susceptible to a severe course and\/or optic neuropathy. ","1010":null,"1011":"A 44-year-old woman with Castleman disease presented with acute visual loss in the left eye. A full ophthalmologic examination and imaging were performed. Visual acuity was 20\/20 in the right eye and 20\/100 in the left eye. Total dyschromatopsia, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and a cecocentral scotoma were observed in the left eye. Mild disc edema, without leaking during fluorescein angiography, was also observed. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a small cystic epidermoid-like lesion in the right prepontine and suprasellar cistern. Her visual acuity did not improve and deteriorated to 20\/200 in the left eye at 22 months after the initial visual loss. Optic neuropathy may rarely be associated with Castleman disease and suggests a poor prognosis.","1012":"A 13-year-old girl with a right intraorbital optic nerve glioma (ONG) was referred to our glaucoma clinic because of uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) in her right eye. The IOP reached as high as 80 mmHg. Several months earlier, she had undergone stereotactic image-guided robotic radiosurgery using the CyberKnife for her ONG; the mass had become smaller after treatment. Her visual acuity was no light perception. Slit lamp examination revealed rubeosis iridis, a swollen pale optic disc, and vitreous hemorrhage. After medical treatment, the IOP decreased to 34 mmHg, and no pain was reported. Although the mass effect of an ONG can cause neovascular glaucoma (NVG), this case shows that stereotactic radiosurgery may also cause NVG, even after reducing the mass of the tumor. Patients who undergo radiosurgery targeting the periocular area should be followed carefully for complications.","1013":"We here in report a case of bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis caused by Pantoea agglomerans (P. agglomerans) in a patient who had interstitial lung disease and was treated with oral corticosteroids. A 72-year-old man presented with decreased visual acuity in both eyes nine days after he received oral corticosteroids. He had marked uveitis, cataracts, and vitreous opacities. Cultures were taken of blood, aqueous humor, and vitreous. We initially suspected a fungal etiology and treated him with antifungal drugs; however, the intraocular disease progressed without improvement. Vitreous culture was positive for P. agglomerans. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with cataract surgery bilaterally, followed by a 2-week course of antibiotics. The final visual acuity was 20\/25 in the right eye and 20\/200 in the left eye. This is the first report of bilateral endogenous endophthalmitis caused by P. agglomerans in Korea; it is also the first case reported outside of the United States.","1014":"We present a case of bilateral serous retinal detachment (SRD) as a presenting sign of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL). A 45-year-old woman presented with decreased vision and was found to have bilateral serous retinal detachment. Peripheral blood smears revealed leukocytosis of 53.9x10(3)\/microL with 64.6% lymphoblasts. A bone marrow aspirate revealed the presence of lymphoblasts. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic analysis detected a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22, t(9;22) (q34;q11). A diagnosis of Ph(+) ALL was made. Following systemic chemotherapy, the bilateral SRD resolved completely with full recovery of vision. The sudden appearance of SRD should raise suspicion for leukemia. Prompt recognition of this disease is important for early systemic treatment and restoration of visual function.","1015":"Considering the popular use of antibiotic-containing eyedrops in Korea, it is important to know the emerging antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria before treating infectious eye diseases. This is especially important in high-risk groups because of the high incidence of resistant infections and the subsequent treatment requirements. We report two cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) corneal ulcers in high-risk groups. The first case involved a patient who had keratitis after using antibiotic- and steroid-containing eyedrops to treat a corneal opacity that developed after repeated penetrating keratoplasty. The second case involved a patient who used antibiotic-containing eyedrops and a topical lubricant on a regular basis for &gt;1 month to treat exposure keratitis due to lagophthalmos. The second patient's problems, which included a persistent superficial infiltration, developed after brain tumor surgery. Both cases showed MRSA on corneal culture, and the corneal ulcers improved in both patients after the application of vancomycin-containing eyedrops. In conclusion, MRSA infection should be considered in corneal ulcers that have a round shape, mild superficial infiltration, and slow progression, especially in high-risk groups. This report includes descriptions of the characteristic features, antibiotic sensitivities, prevention, and successful treatment with vancomycin-containing eyedrops for MRSA corneal ulcers.","1016":"A 39-year-old man with poliosis of his lower eyelid lashes visited our clinic. He reported that his symptoms began with a few central lashes and then spread along the adjacent lashes during the ensuing 2 weeks. A pigmented nevus, approximately 4 mm in diameter, was identified just above the white lashes without surrounding skin depigmentation. No specific findings were identified with regard to the patient's general health or serologic and radiologic testing. Excisional biopsy of the pigmented nevus was performed. On histopathologic examination, infiltration of the dermis by numerous lymphocytes and melanophages was observed. The poliosis was ultimately diagnosed as a presenting sign of the halo phenomenon in the regressive stage of a melanocytic nevus.","1017":"To determine the efficacy of topical application and subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab in the treatment of corneal neovascularization. Corneal neovascularization was induced with a silk suture of the corneal stroma in 12 rabbits (24 eyes). One week after suturing, four rabbits were treated with topical bevacizumab at 5 mg\/mL (group A) and another four rabbits were treated with topical bevacizumab 10 mg\/mL (group B) in the right eyes twice a day for two weeks. A subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab 1.25 mg\/mL was done in the right eyes of four rabbits (group C). All of the left eyes (12 eyes) were used as controls. The area of corneal neovascularization was measured after one and two weeks, and the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in corneal tissue was measured after two weeks. The neovascularized area was smaller in all treated groups than in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Upon analysis of the neovascularized area, there was no significant difference between groups A and B. However, the mean neovascularized area of group B was significantly smaller than that of group C after two weeks of treatment (p=0.043). The histologic examination revealed fewer new corneal vessels in all treated groups than the control group. The concentration of VEGF was significantly lower in all treated groups compared to the control group (p&lt;0.01), but no difference was shown between treated groups. Topical and subconjunctival bevacizumab application may be useful in the treatment of corneal neovascularization and further study is necessary. ","1018":"To evaluate factors that can influence the prevalence of amblyopia in children with anisometropia. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 63 children 2 to 13 years of age who had anisometropic amblyopia with a difference in the refractive errors between the eyes of at least two diopters (D). The type of anisometropia (myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism), degree of anisometropia (&lt;2-3 D, &lt;3-4 D, or &gt;4 D), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the amblyopic eye at the time of initial examination, BCVA differences between sound and amblyopic eyes, whether or not occlusion therapy was performed, compliance with occlusion therapy, and the patient's age when eyeglasses were first worn were investigated. There was an increase in the risk of amblyopia with increased magnitude of anisometropia (p=0.021). The prevalence of amblyopia was higher in the BCVA &lt;20\/40 group and in patients with BCVA differences &gt;4 lines between sound and amblyopic eyes (p=0.008 and p=0.045, respectively). There was no statistical relationship between the prevalence of amblyopia and the type of anisometropia or the age when eyeglasses were first worn. Poor compliance with occlusion therapy was less likely to achieve successful outcome (p=0.015). Eyes with poor initial visual acuities of &lt;20\/40, a high magnitude of anisometropia, and a &gt;4 line difference in the BCVA between sound and amblyopic eyes at the initial visit may require active treatment. ","1019":"To evaluate the efficacy of primary chemotherapy combined with local therapy in the treatment of retinoblastomas not treatable with a single therapeutic method. We performed a retrospective chart review of 227 patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma. Sixty-five eyes in 52 patients had tumors not treatable with a single therapeutic method and received primary chemotherapy combined with local therapy as needed. Tumor control and eye salvage was achieved in 34 of the 65 eyes; the probability of ocular survival was 46.56% using the Kaplan-Meier method. Forty-three of the 65 eyes were group D or E tumors, in which tumor control and eye salvage was achieved in 16 eyes. Twenty eyes were treated with chemotherapy only, while 28 eyes received one additional modality of local therapy, and 17 eyes received two modalities of local therapy. Of the eyes treated with chemotherapy only, tumor control was achieved in 5 eyes. Primary chemotherapy combined with local therapy can be effective and safe in the treatment of retinoblastomas otherwise untreatable with other therapeutic methods, such as group D and E retinoblastomas. More vigorous treatment with more local therapeutic methods combined may yield even better results. ","1020":"To identify the correlation between preoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) features and postoperative visual outcomes in eyes with idiopathic macular holes (MHs). Data from 55 eyes with idiopathic MHs which had been sealed by vitrectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Correlation analysis was conducted between postoperative visual acuity (V(postop), logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) and preoperative factors, including four OCT parameters: the anticipated length (A) devoid of photoreceptors after hole closure, MH height (B), MH size (C), and the grading (D) of the viability of detached photoreceptors. Additionally, the formula for the prediction of visual outcome was deduced. V(postop) was determined to be significantly correlated with the preoperative visual acuity (V(preop)) and OCT parameters A, C, and D (p&lt;0.001). Based on the correlation, the formula for the prediction of V(postop) was derived from the most accurate regression analysis: V(postop)=0.248xV(preop)+1.1x10(-6)xA(2)-0.121xD+0.19. The length and viability of detached photoreceptors are significant preoperative OCT features for predicting visual prognosis. This suggests that, regardless of the MH size and symptom duration, active surgical intervention should be encouraged, particularly if the MH exhibits good viability in the detached photoreceptor layer. ","1021":"To evaluate the long-term efficacy and rotational stability of the AcrySof toric intraocular lens (IOL) in correcting preoperative astigmatism in cataract patients. This prospective observational study included 30 eyes from 24 consecutive patients who underwent implantation of an AcrySof toric IOL with micro-coaxial cataract surgery between May 2008 and September 2008. Outcomes of visual acuity, refractive and keratometric astigmatism, and IOL rotation after 1 day, 1 month, 3 months, and long-term (mean, 13.3+\/-5.0 months) follow-up were evaluated. At final follow-up, 73.3% of eyes showed an uncorrected visual acuity of 20\/25 or better. The postoperative keratometric value was not different from the preoperative value; mean refractive astigmatism was reduced to -0.28+\/-0.38 diopter (D) from -1.28+\/-0.48 D. The mean rotation of the toric IOL was 3.45+\/-3.39 degrees at final follow-up. One eye (3.3%) exhibited IOL rotation of 10.3 degrees, the remaining eyes (96.7%) had IOL rotation of less than 10 degrees. Early postoperative and long-term follow-up showed that implantation of the AcrySof toric IOL is an effective, safe, and predictable method for managing corneal astigmatism in cataract patients. ","1022":"To evaluate the effects of wearing rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lenses on the topographic changes in keratoconus. Seventy-seven keratoconic eyes that wore multicurve RGP contact lenses and 30 keratoconic eyes that wore no contact lenses were retrospectively analyzed. The mean follow-ups were 22.6 and 20.5 months in the lens-wearing and control groups, respectively. Visual acuity, comfort, daily wearing time, and corneal staining were evaluated for both groups. The changes in topographic indices were compared between the lens-wearing and control groups. Multicurve RGP lens corrected logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity of the lens-wearing group significantly improved from -0.016+\/-0.065 to -0.032+\/-0.10 at follow-up (p=0.05). In the lens-wearing group with advanced keratoconus, the Sim Kmax, Sim Kmin, apical power, astigmatic index, and anterior elevation significantly decreased from 57.68+\/-4.26 diopter (D), 50.50+\/-2.32 D, 62.79+\/-5.11 D, 7.20+\/-0.55 D and 67.36+\/-16.30 microm to 55.51+\/-4.28 D, 49.62+\/-3.26 D, 60.31+\/-5.41 D, 5.90+\/-0.51 D and 60.61+\/-16.09 microm, respectively (paired t-test, p&lt;0.05). The irregularity index of 3 mm did not significantly change. Meanwhile, in the control group, the apical power and irregularity index increased from 55.56+\/-7.25 D and 3.06+\/-1.68 D to 57.11+\/-7.75 D and 3.25+\/-1.71 D, respectively (paired t-test, p=0.008, p=0.01).

","1023":"To compare clinical outcomes after deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty (DLEK) with Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) performed as initial cases by a single surgeon. Sixteen patients with corneal endothelial were enrolled. Eight patients (8 eyes) underwent DLEK and 8 patients (8 eyes) DSEK. We measured uncorrected visual acuity, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), manifest refraction, corneal endothelial count, interface opacity via Schiempflug imaging, and contrast sensitivity, as well as tracked postoperative complications over the first postoperative year. Primary graft failure occurred in two DLEK cases and one DSEK case, all of which were excluded for further analysis. The average 12-month postoperative BCVA was 20\/70 in the DLEK group and 20\/50 in the DSEK group, with the difference not statistically significant. No significant differences were identified between the 2 groups in terms of mean spherical equivalent and refractive astigmatism, although individuals in the DSEK group tended toward hyperopia. The average endothelial cell count at postoperative month 12 was 1849+\/-494 in the DLEK group and 1643+\/-417 cells\/mm(2) in the DSEK group, representing cell losses of 26.2% and 31.9%, respectively. No significant differences in endothelial cell count or endothelial cell loss were observed between groups. Early postoperative donor disc dislocation occurred in two eyes after DLEK and one eye after DSEK. Interface opacities and contrast sensitivities were similarly not significantly different between groups. No significant differences in any assessed clinical outcome were observed between individuals undergoing DLEK and DSEK, when performed as initial cases by a single surgeon.

A 63-year-old male presented with decreased visual acuity in both eyes. Both eyes had serous elevations of the retinas with shifting subretinal fluid and annular choroidal detachment. No retinal breaks were found. Laboratory tests revealed pancytopenia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Chest and abdominal computed tomographies showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the mediastinum, abdomen, and in both inguinal areas. Histological examination of the inguinal lymph node biopsy was consistent with Castleman's disease. After combination chemotherapy, the serous elevations of both retinas and the annular choroidal detachments of both eyes disappeared. Ophthalmic involvement in Castleman's disease is very rare, and to the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of ophthalmic involvement of Castleman's disease in Korea.","1028":"A 60-year-old woman who had experienced two episodes of amaurosis fugax in her right eye presented with vision loss. Two weeks earlier, at a private clinic, she was diagnosed with impending central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) of the right eye and received an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. Two weeks after this injection she was diagnosed with ischemic CRVO. At 11-weeks post-presentation, extremely ischemic features were observed with fluorescein angiographic findings of severe vascular attenuation and extensive retinal capillary obliteration. At 22-weeks post-presentation she was diagnosed with neovascular glaucoma; she experienced no visual improvement over the following several months.","1029":"A 68-year-old woman presented with pain in her left eye. Necrosis with calcium plaques was observed on the medial part of the sclera. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from the culture of the necrotic area. On systemic work-up including serum and urine electrophoresis studies, the serum monoclonal protein of immunoglobulin G was detected. The patient was diagnosed with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and fungal scleritis. Despite intensive treatment with topical and oral antifungal agents, scleral inflammation and ulceration progressed, and scleral perforation and endophthalmitis developed. Debridement, antifungal irrigation, and tectonic scleral grafting were performed. The patient underwent a combined pars plana vitrectomy with an intravitreal injection of an antifungal agent. However, scleral and intraocular inflammation progressed, and the eye was enucleated. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from the cultures of the eviscerated materials. Giemsa staining of the excised sclera showed numerous fungal hyphae.","1030":"An 83-year-old woman had undergone an external dacryocystorhinostomy with silicone intubation. Before the surgery, no skin lesions were observed on the incision site. Three months after surgery, the patient complained of a brown-to-black pigmented elevation at her previous skin incision site. A punch biopsy of the pigmented mass was performed. The histopathologic findings confirmed the clinical diagnosis of irritated seborrheic keratosis (SK). SK can occur several months postoperatively and can suddenly increase in size, so surgeons need to carefully check patients' skin prior to surgery. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of irritated SK discovered on a previous skin incision site.","1031":"To investigate the effects of brimonidine, an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist, on barrier function in ARPE-19 cells by measuring transepithelial resistance (TER). ARPE-19 cells were cultured into a confluent monolayer on a microporous filter. Brimonidine was added to the apical medium, and the barrier function of the cells was evaluated by measuring TER. A subset of cells was treated under hypoxic conditions, and the TER changes observed upon administration of brimonidine were compared to those observed in cells in normoxic conditions. The ARPE cell membrane reached a peak resistance of 29.1+\/-7.97 Omegacm(2) after four weeks of culture. The TER of the cells treated under normoxic conditions increased with brimonidine treatment; however, the TER of the cells treated under hypoxic conditions did not change following the administration of brimonidine. Barrier function in ARPE-19 cells increased with brimonidine treatment. Understanding the exact mechanism of this barrier function change requires further investigation. ","1032":"To evaluate the inhibitory effect of chlorogenic acid on laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in a rat model. Intraperitoneal injection of chlorogenic acid (10 mg\/kg) was initiated one day prior to laser photocoagulation and continued for eight days. Eyes were removed 14 days after laser photocoagulation. Fluorescein angiography was employed at seven and 14 days to assess the CNV lesions, and histological examination was performed. Quantification of CNV size and leakage were performed both in histological sections and fluorescein angiography in order to compare the inhibitory effects of chlorogenic acid on CNV with the results of the control. Histological analysis showed no significant difference in CNV size between the treated and control groups. However, CNV leakage on fluorescein angiography had significantly decreased in the chlorogenic acid-treated group at 14 days after laser photocoagulation compared with that of the control group. In addition, CNV size on fluorescein angiography had significantly decreased in the treated group at seven and 14 days. These results suggest that chlorogenic acid has anti-angiogenic effects on CNV and may be useful as an inhibitor in the treatment or prevention of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.

Discrete wavelengths of the tube in the customized booth were measured using a spectrometer using the normal incident method and were compared with the spectral distribution of sunlight. Forty-eight subjects were recruited for the study and were divided into 3 groups: Group 1, Normal Trichromats (30 eyes); Group 2, Congenital Colour Vision Defects (16 eyes); and Group 3, Diabetes Mellitus (20 eyes). The FM 100 hue test performance was compared using two illumination conditions, booth illumination and room illumination. Total error scores of the classical method in Group 2 as mean+\/-SD for room and booth illumination was 243.05+\/-85.96 and 149.85+\/-54.50 respectively (p=0.0001). Group 2 demonstrated lesser correlation (r=0.50, 0.55), lesser reliability (Cronbach's alpha, 0.625, 0.662) and greater variability (Bland &amp; Altman value, 10.5) in total error scores for the classical method and the moment of inertia method between the two illumination conditions when compared to the other two groups. The customized booth demonstrated illumination meeting CIE standards.

Patients with acute CSC received IVBI (1.25 mg\/0.05 mL) or observation by randomization. Twelve eyes in each group completed 6 months of regular follow-up and were ultimately included in this study. Each patient was assessed using best corrected visual acuity measurements, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography at baseline and had regular follow-ups after treatment. All patients showed improvements in visual acuity and fluorescein angiographic leakage and had resolution of their neurosensory detachment following treatment. There were no significant differences in visual acuity, central retinal thickness, or remission duration between the IVBI group and the control group at baseline or after treatment (p&gt;0.05).

The medical records of 401 patients who presented for cosmetic improvement in corneal opacities between May 2004 and July 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The following parameters were analyzed: age, gender, cause of corneal opacity, time course of the corneal disease, associated diseases, prior and current cosmetic treatments, visual acuity, location and depth of the corneal opacity, and the presence of either corneal neovascularization or band keratopathy. A single practitioner examined all patients. The most common causes of corneal opacity were ocular trauma (203 eyes, 50.6%), retinal disease (62 eyes, 15.5%), measles (38 eyes, 9.5%), and congenital etiologies (22 eyes, 5.5%). Prior treatments included iris colored contact lenses (125 eyes, 31.1%) and corneal tattooing (34 eyes, 8.46%). A total of 321 of 401 eyes underwent cosmetic treatment for corneal opacities. The most common treatment performed after the primary visit was corneal tattooing (261 eyes, 64.92%). This is the first study to investigate the causes and clinical characteristics of patients presenting for cosmetic treatment of corneal opacities rather than for functional improvement. Various cosmetic interventions are available for patients with corneal opacities, and these should be individualized for the needs of each patient.

A retrospective chart review was designed and included 49 eyes in 30 patients who underwent epi-LASIK and 54 eyes in 29 patients who underwent PRK. During the early postoperative period (days 1 to 5), pain, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), and time to epithelial healing were recorded. Visual outcomes were followed for up to six months. Mean preoperative spherical equivalent refraction for the epi-LASIK group was -3.99+\/-1.39 diopters (D) and that of the PRK group was -3.54+\/-1.27 D. The pain scores on the fourth postoperative day were significantly higher in the epi-LASIK group than in the PRK group (p=0.017). Duration of pain in the epi-LASIK group was longer than in the PRK group (p=0.010). Mean healing time was significantly longer in the epi-LASIK group than in the PRK group (p&lt;0.000). In addition, UCVA in the epi-LASIK group at postoperative days 1 and 3 were significantly lower than those in the PRK group (p=0.021 and p&lt;0.000, respectively). Uncorrected visual acuity at one week and one month after epi-LASIK were lower than those after PRK (p=0.023 and p=0.004, respectively). In the epi-LASIK patients, pain relief, corneal healing, and visual recovery seemed to be slower during the early postoperative period compared to those of the PRK patients. With longer duration of follow-up, however, there were no significant differences in visual outcome between the two groups. ","1037":"To evaluate corneal biomechanical properties in eyes that had previously undergone penetrating keratoplasty (PK) using the ocular response analyzer (ORA). We recruited 26 patients who had received unilateral PK. Corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg), and cornea-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc) were measured with the ORA and were compared to the measurements from the contralateral eyes that did not undergo PK. The CH was 8.95+\/-2.59 mmHg in eyes that underwent PK and 9.78+\/-1.45 mmHg in the contralateral eyes that did not undergo PK (p=0.077). The CRF was 10.26+\/-2.64 mmHg in post-PK eyes and 9.75+\/-1.45 mmHg in the contralateral eyes (p=0.509), and the CH-CRF was significantly smaller in post-PK eyes (-1.31+\/-2.32 mmHg in post-PK eyes vs. 0.03+\/-0.88 mmHg in fellow eyes, p=0.016). The IOPg and IOPcc were significantly higher in the PK group than they were in the control group. The IOPcc's were 20.81+\/-7.81 mmHg and 16.27+\/-2.49 mmHg in post-PK and control eyes, respectively (p=0.011); and the IOPg's were 19.22+\/-7.34 mmHg and 15.07+\/-3.03 mmHg in post-PK and control eyes, respectively (p=0.019). The IOPcc-g's were 1.59+\/-2.81 mmHg and 1.21+\/-1.30 mmHg in post-PK and control eyes, respectively (p=0.412), and the central corneal thickness (CCT)'s were 489.11+\/-90.60 microm and 556.24+\/-42.84 microm in post-PK and control eyes, respectively (p=0.068). Following PK, CH tended to decrease while CRF tended to increase, significantly decreasing CH-CRF. A significantly higher intraocular pressure and a thinner CCT following PK may have contributed to the observed changes in these corneal biomechanical parameters. ","1038":"We report a case of traumatic optic neuropathy accompanying a grease gun injury to the orbit. A 48-year-old man with a grease gun injury visited our clinic with decreased visual acuity, proptosis and limited extraocular movement (EOM). Orbital CT revealed a crescent mass of fat in the medial intraconal space. The grease was exuded from a lacerated conjunctival wound. The visual evoked potential (VEP) test demonstrated a decreased response in the left eye. Proptosis and EOM were improved after surgical removal of the grease. Systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy was administered for suspected traumatic optic neuropathy, after which VEP nearly recovered, while visual acuity was slightly improved. A second surgery for traumatic cataract did not further improve visual acuity.","1039":"We report a case of bilateral peripheral retinal neovascularization and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis in a 69-year-old man. Ophthalmic examination revealed peripheral retinal nonperfusion with retinal neovascularization in both eyes and vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography of both eyes showed a marked midperipheral and peripheral avascular retina temporally with arteriovenous anastomosis and sea-fan neovascularizations. Blood tests showed pancytopenia and teardrop-shaped red blood cells, and bone marrow examination showed hypocellular marrow with severe fibrosis. The neovascularization was regressed following pars plana vitrectomy in the right eye and scatter laser photocoagulation in the left. The results suggest that peripheral retinal vessel occlusion and neovascularization may be associated with idiopathic myelofibrosis.","1040":"Here we report a case of optic neuritis in the setting of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) in a child. A six-year-old girl presented with HZO in the right eye. During the hospitalization, her visual acuity decreased. Fluorescein angiography (FAG) and optical coherence tomography revealed optic neuritis in the affected eye. Visual acuity improved with one month of treatment with acyclovir and steroids. FAG analysis showed no evidence of leakage at the optic disc. At one year post treatment, the patient's fundus exam and vision were normal. Therapy with antivirals and steroids may be effective in patients with childhood HZO optic neuritis.","1041":"A 61-year-old man with no history of malignancy presented with a rapidly expanding left periorbital mass, first noticed one month prior to presentation. The mass was firm, and a pus-like discharge drained spontaneously from the center of the lesion. A biopsy was performed, and histopathology confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Systemic evaluation revealed that the patient had a primary esophageal squamous cell carcinoma with multiple metastases. The prognosis of orbital metastasis is generally poor, and this patient expired after one month of conservative treatment.","1042":"A 64-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for the treatment of chronic uveitis in her left eye, which had started two weeks after an uncomplicated cataract extraction. She was treated with topical steroids with an initially good response, yet she subsequently developed severe inflammation and plaque-like material around the intraocular lens, despite continuous steroid therapy. She underwent pars plana vitrectomy, smear and culture of the aqueous and vitreous fluids, and intravitreal antibiotic injection under the impression of Propionibacterium acne (P. acne) endophthalmitis. As a result of the smear and culture of the vitreous fluid identified as an Acremonium species, she was treated with intravenous amphotericin B injections for five days, followed by oral voriconazole administration. During the post-operative 18-month follow-up, she was stable without significant relapse of uveitis. In this case, the best correction of visual acuity was an improvement from 20\/40 to 20\/20.","1043":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the leading causes of blindness, with retinal detachment occurring due to oxygen toxicity in preterm infants. Recently, advances in neonatal care have led to improved survival rates for preterm infants, and ROP has increased in incidence. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether or not resveratrol exhibits protective effects in an animal model of ROP and in primary retinal cell cultures of neonatal rat via nitric oxide (NO)-modulating actions using western blotting and real-time PCR with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) antibodies and mRNAs. In an in vivo oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, cyclic hyperoxia was induced with 80% O(2) for one day and 21% O(2) for one day from P1 to P14 in newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Resveratrol was injected intravitreally for seven days and rats were sacrificed at P21. In vitro OIR primary retinal cell culture was performed using P0-2 SD rats. Hyperoxia injuries were induced through 100% O(2) exposure for six hours. Western blotting and real-time PCR using iNOS, eNOS, nNOS antibodies and primers were performed in the rat model of ROP and the dispersed retinal cell culture. In both in vivo and in vitro OIR, the expression of iNOS antibody and mRNA was increased and of eNOS and nNOS were reduced in the resveratrol-treated group. In conclusion, resveratrol appeared to exert retinal protective effects via modulation of NO-mediated mechanism in in vivo and in vitro OIR models. ","1044":"To investigate the effect of catechin on apoptotic cell death in the lens epithelium of rats with cataract. Cataract was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg\/kg N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) to ten day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The neonatal rats were randomly divided into five groups (n=15 in each group): a control group, and four cataract-induction groups, treated with either 0, 50, 100, 200 mg\/kg catechin. We performed slit-lamp biomicroscopic analysis, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay, Western-blot for Bcl-2 and Bax, and immunohistochemistry for caspase-3. Apoptotic cell death in lens epithelial cells that increased following cataract formation in rats was suppressed by cathechin. Catechin inhibited cataract-induced apoptotic cell death in the lens epithelium and may prove useful for the prevention of cataract progression. ","1045":"The purpose of this study was to compare and differentiate the clinical characteristics of intermittent exotropia (X(T)) in children and adults. This study included 398 patients with X(T): 360 children ranging in age from 1 to 14 years and 38 adults over 15 years of age. Patients with neurological abnormalities or developmental delays were excluded. Clinical characteristics of interest included sex, age on first visit, age of onset, type of onset, duration to surgery, family history, chief complaints, type of fixation, refractive errors, sensory tests, angle of deviation, fundus examination, oblique muscle dysfunction, and other associated ocular disorders. In both groups, an insidious onset was more common than a sudden onset (p=0.033). Outward deviation was the most common chief complaint in both groups, followed by photophobia in the childhood group, and diplopia in the adult group. The most common subtype of X(T) was the basic type. The mean near deviation was 23.6+\/-7.9 prism diopters (PD) in the childhood group and 30.7+\/-12.2 PD in the adult group (p=0.01). The mean distance deviation was 23.4+\/-6.1 PD and 28.3+\/-11.2 PD in the childhood and adult groups, respectively (p=0.028). The rate of fusion, measured with the Worth 4-dot test at near and distance was higher in the childhood group, as compared to the adult group (p=0.024 and p=0.048, respectively). Among X(T) patients, the chief complaints, angle of deviation, and Worth 4-dot tests showed significant differences between the childhood and adult groups. Therefore, these are important factors to consider when assessing adults and children with X(T). ","1046":"To determine the clinical utility of using photopic negative response (PhNR) by comparing the parameters for normal, primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Electroretinography (UTAS E-3000) was performed in 12 normal, 12 POAG, and 12 DR subjects. Amplitudes and implicit times for PhNR were compared among the three groups. The mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) were evaluated using standard automated perimetry (SAP). The mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and cup-disc ratio were measured using optical coherence tomography. The a-waves and b-waves were not different among the three groups. However, compared to normal subjects, the PhNR amplitudes were reduced, and the PhNR implicit times were prolonged in the POAG and DR patients (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001). The MD and RNFL thickness were correlated with the amplitudes and implicit times for the PhNR. PhNR may be useful for the detection of inner retinal dysfunction, which is seen in patients who have glaucoma or diabetic retinopathy. ","1047":"Impending central retinal vein occlusion is associated with mild or no loss of vision; however, its progress and vision prognosis have not been clearly defined until now. Therefore, we studied the progress and prognoses in patients with impending central retinal vein occlusion. For this study, we selected ten subjects who had been diagnosed with impending central retinal vein occlusion, and we retrospectively reviewed their progress and prognoses. The average age of the subjects was 31.0 years (18 to 48 years). Eight patients were male and two were female. The average observational period was 5.5 months. Six out of ten subjects were found to have no underlying systemic disease, four subjects had underlying disease. All ten patients were affected unilaterally. When initially tested, the affected eyes showed an average vision of LogMar 0.30. The final vision test revealed an average of LogMar 0.04, which indicates good progress and prognosis. In one patient, retinal hemorrhage and macular edema progressively worsened after the diagnosis, and the patient was treated with radial optic neurotomy. The cases of impending central retinal vein occlusion that we observed seemed to primarily affect young patients with generally good prognoses. However, in some cases, the degrees of obstruction and hemorrhage increased as time progressed. This suggests that impending central retinal vein occlusion could develop into the prodromal phase of an acute attack. ","1048":"To compare the effects of performing a single limbal relaxing incision (LRI) combined with a clear corneal incision on a corneal astigmatism with that of paired LRIs in cataract surgery. Medical records for 25 eyes in 20 patients who had undergone LRIs during cataract operations for with-the-rule astigmatism of 1.5 diopters (D) or more in topography were retrospectively reviewed. Single or paired LRIs were assigned randomly and were performed on the steepest axis; the degrees of arc were determined using the modified Gills nomogram. A clear corneal wound was made on the steepest vertical axis. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), manifest refraction, and corneal astigmatism on topography were evaluated preoperatively and one month postoperatively. Naeser's polar value analysis was used to assess the efficacy of the LRIs. The mean depth of the LRIs and degrees of arc were 620+\/-31 microm (87.1% of corneal thickness) and 56.84+\/-19.68 degrees , respectively. The mean postoperative UCVA and BCVA (log MAR) were significantly improved (0.51+\/-0.37 and 0.09+\/-0.12, respectively) (p&lt;0.05). Average refractive and corneal astigmatisms were significantly reduced by 49.4 percent and 32.4 percent, respectively (p&lt;0.05). The single LRI combined with clear corneal incision showed reduced efficacy in refractive astigmatism by 47 percent, which is similar to that of paired LRIs where a 48 percent reduction in efficacy was seen. The short-term effects of a single LRI combined with clear corneal incision on a corneal astigmatism appears to be as effective as performing paired LRIs when combined with cataract incision. ","1049":"The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) chelation and excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) combined with amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) for the treatment of band keratopathy (BK). Eleven eyes in ten patients with BK received combined PTK (ablation zone of central 7.0-7.5 mm, depth of 50 microm), EDTA chelation (0.05 M, 3 minutes), and amniotic membrane transplantation using fibrin glue. Preand postoperative best corrected visual acuities, symptom changes, reepithelialization time, cosmesis, recurrence, and complications were analyzed. Visual acuity improved in three eyes (27.3%) and did not change in eight eyes (72.7%). Symptoms improved in all patients, and the mean reepithelialization time was 10.6+\/-5.3 days. The cosmetic results were good in eight eyes (72.7%) and were fair in three eyes (27.3%). During the mean follow-up period of 11.4+\/-6.1 months (range, 6 to 23 months), no postoperative complications or recurrences were observed. The combination of EDTA chelation, PTK, and AMT is safe and effective for the treatment of band keratopathy. ","1050":"To assess quality of life and depressive status in Korean patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. A cross-sectional study of 49 patients (mean age, 41 years; sex ratio, M:F=11:38) with Graves' ophthalmopathy (referred to as the Graves' group) and 48 age-matched and sex-matched controls (mean age, 40.2 years; sex ratio, M:F=11:37) was performed using the Korean version of the 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Survey data was compared among patients with mild, moderately severe, and sight-threatening Graves' ophthalmopathy and between patients with low (0 or 1) or high (2 or 3) Gorman scores. Those in the Graves' group scored significantly lower on all categories of the SF-36, as compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). The 4 patients with sight-threatening Graves' had significantly lower scores for physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, and the physical component summary of the SF-36, when compared with the 28 patients with mild Graves' and the 17 patients with moderately severe Graves' (p&lt;0.05). The 17 patients in the high Gorman score group had lower physical component summary scores than the 32 patients in the low Gorman score group (p=0.03). The 16 patients with BDI scores &gt; or = 16 had significantly lower scores on the SF-36 and higher clinical activity scores, as compared to the 33 patients with BDI scores &lt;16 (p&lt;0.05). Patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy had reduced health-related quality of life and were more likely to be depressed, especially those with a sight threatening condition or significant diplopia. It is important to identify these patients to provide the necessary psychological support. ","1051":"We report a case of one sister and brother with mirror image myopic anisometropia. One sister and brother complained visual disturbance. The sister was 10 years 11 months old, and brother was 8 years 4 months old. Full ophthalmic examinations were performed, including slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure, keratometry, anterior chamber depth, axial length, fundus examination and the cycloplegic refraction. The cycloplegic refractive power was -15.50 dpt cyl.+4.50 dpt Ax 85 degrees (right eye), -1.00 dpt cyl.+0.50 dpt Ax 90 degrees (left eye) in the sister; -1.75 dpt cyl.+2.25 dpt Ax 90 degrees (right eye), -9.50 dpt cyl.+4.00 dpt Ax 80 degrees (left eye) in the brother. The co-occurrence of severe myopic anisometropia in a sister and brother is extremely rare. The present case suggests that severe myopic anisometropia may be related by genetic inheritance.","1052":"The purpose of this article is to report a case of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) after uneventful cataract surgery. A 53-year-old Filipina underwent cataract surgery. She had a small optic disc with cup-to-disc ratio of 0.2 in the left eye and 0.3 in the right eye. On the first postoperative day, the uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) was 20\/20, with an intraocular pressure (IOP) of 20 mmHg in the left eye. At one week after operation, the UCVA was 20\/20 and the IOP was 15 mmHg. Three weeks later, she underwent cataract surgery in the right eye. On the first postoperative day, her UCVA was 20\/20 in both eyes, but she complained of a visual field decrease in the left eye. A relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was noted and the optic disc was pallid and swollen diffusely. A red-free photo showed defect surrounding the optic disc. A visual field test showed tunnel vision sparing the central vision. In this report, the authors hypothesize an association between cataract extraction and delayed NAION. Since the risk of NAION in the fellow eye is 30-50%, visual acuity, visual field, fundus exam and RAPD should be routinely checked.","1053":"A case of acquired Brown syndrome caused by surgical repair of medial orbital wall fracture is reported in the present paper. A 23-year-old man presented at the hospital with right periorbital trauma. Although the patient did not complain of any diplopia, the imaging study revealed a blow-out fracture of the medial orbital wall. Surgical repair with a calvarial bone autograft was performed at the department of plastic surgery. The patient was referred to the ophthalmologic department due to diplopia that newly developed after surgery. The prism cover test at distant fixation showed hypotropia of the right eye, which was 4 prism diopters (PD) in primary gaze, 20 PD in left gaze, while orthophoric in right gaze. Eye movement of the right eye was markedly limited on elevation in adduction with normal elevation in abduction with intorsion in the right eye present. Forced duction test of the right eye showed restricted elevation in adduction. Computerized tomography scan of the orbits showed the right superior oblique muscle was entrapped between the autografted bone fragment and posterior margin of the fracture. When repairing medial orbital wall fracture that causes Brown syndrome, surgeons should always be careful of entrapment of the superior oblique muscle if the implant is inserted without identifying the superior and posterior margin of the orbital fracture site.","1054":"This prospective observational case series study included 6 eyes of 6 consecutive glaucomatous patients. Each patient underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C, and received a 1.25 mg of subconjunctival bevacizumab injection at completion of the trabeculectomy. Study eyes included two with neovascular glaucoma, three with uveitic glaucoma, and one with secondary glaucoma following vitrectomy. All eyes had undergone failed glaucoma laser\/surgical treatment or an intraocular surgical procedure. Intraocular pressure (IOP) at the following postoperative visits: preoperative, 1 week, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, and 6 months, was measured. We also evaluated postoperative bleb findings and complications. IOP measured at each visit was 37.5+\/-14.4 mmHg, 6.2+\/-3.4 mmHg, 8.3+\/-7.2 mmHg, 12.0+\/-4.4 mmHg, 10.8+\/-3.1 mmHg, and 12.2+\/-3.3 mmHg, respectively, for each visit.

A 52-year-old healthy man presented with an irregularly-shaped and heavily-pigmented mass at the iris root of his right eye. Visual acuity of the right eye was 20\/20 with normal intraocular pressure. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a 1.5x1.3-mm ciliary-body mass with extension into the iris root. Iridocyclectomy with scleral resection under a lamellar scleral flap was performed, and the histopathologic features of the resected tissue were consistent with melanocytoma of the ciliary body. The patient's visual acuity remained 20\/20 with good postoperative cosmesis. During one year of follow-up, no signs of tumor recurrence were seen, and the patient reported resolution of the intermittent ocular pain in the involved eye.","1056":"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania species and is classified into three forms; cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral. The eyelid is a rare site involved by leishmaniasis and only makes up 2.5% of cases with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). Although CL can affect both upper and lower lids on either their outer or inner aspects, the lateral canthus is most often affected. The most common aspect of lid leishmaniasis is chalazion-like lesions but ulcerous, phagedenic, cancer-like forms, and unilateral chronic granulomatous blepharitis may be observed. When the lid is involved, the disease is usually self-limiting; healing usually takes up to one year, hence early diagnosis and treatment are important. The diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion regarding the endemicity of the disease in the region. Response to treatment in lid CL cases is quite satisfactory. In this article, we report nine cases of lid leishmaniasis with satisfactory responses to intralesional meglumine antimoniate.","1057":"To investigate the relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the cancer stem cell-vascular niche complex in human retinoblastoma tissue. Six human retinoblastoma specimens primarily enucleated for Reese-Ellsworth classification stage 5a were stained to detect cancer stem cell markers, including ABCG2 for the stem cell marker and MCM2 for the neural stem cell marker, as well as to detect VEGF for the angiogenic cytokine. Using immunofluorescence, the expression of these proteins was analyzed, and their relative locations noted. In non-neoplastic retina of tumor-bearing eyes, ABCG2 and MCM2 were sporadically expressed in the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear layer, whereas VEGF was sporadically expressed in inner retina where retinal vessels are abundantly distributed. In the tumor, ABCG2 was strongly expressed out of Wintersteiner rosettes, whereas MCM2 and VEGF were strongly stained in the rosettes. Interestingly, the outer portion of the rosettes was positive for MCM2, and the inner portion of the rosettes was positive for VEGF. Our data demonstrated that MCM2 and VEGF are strongly expressed in the rosettes of the tumor, which were far from the area of ABCG2-positive cells. Although VEGF might not directly contribute to the cancer stem cell-vascular niche complex, it could play some role in the differentiation of tumor cells to build up the rosettes. ","1058":"Our goal was to investigate the effects of inhibition of transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) METHODS: EIU was induced in female Lewis rats by single footpad injections of 200 microg of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TGase 2 inhibitors were administered intraperitoneally 30 minutes before and at the time of LPS administration. Rats were sacrificed 24 hours after injection, and the effects of the TGase 2 inhibitors were evaluated by the number of intraocular inflammatory cells present on histologic sections and by measuring the TGase 2 activity and TGase products in the aqueous humor (AqH). TGase 2 substrates were also assayed in AqH from uveitis patients. Clinical indications of EIU, the number of cells present on histologic sections, and TGase 2 activity in AqH increased in a time-dependent manner, peaking 24 hours after LPS injection. Inflammation in EIU was significantly reversed by treatment with TGase inhibitors. A 23-kDa cross-linked TGase substrate was identified in the AqH from EIU rats and uveitis patients. MALDI-TOF analysis showed that this substrate in uveitis patients was human Ig kappa chain C region. TGase 2 activity and its catalytic product were increased in the AqH of EIU rats. TGase 2 inhibition attenuated the degree of inflammation in EIU. Safe and stable TGase inhibitors may have great potential for the treatment of inflammatory uveitis.

Twenty-four eyes from 24 patients diagnosed with NTG and 22 eyes from 22 control group patients were enrolled. Systolic BP, diastolic BP and IOP were measured every two hours except for the period of time from 1 AM to 7 AM in the NTG group and from 11 PM to 7 AM in the control group over a one-day period. IOP and hemodynamic parameters were then compared between the two groups. NTG patients were subdivided according to the degree of morning BP dip and IOP, and hemodynamic parameters and visual field indices (mean deviation and pattern standard deviation) were also compared among these subgroups. There were no significant differences in mean systolic BP, mean diastolic BP and mean arterial pressure (MAP) between the NTG and the control groups. The NTG group showed a significantly large morning BP dip compared to the control group (7.1+\/-4.2% vs. 3.8+\/-3.4%, p=0.022). However, there were no significant differences in mean or fluctuation of MOPP between the two groups. Morning over-dippers showed significantly large MAP and MOPP fluctuations compared to non-dippers and dippers, while there were no significant differences in visual field indices among the three subgroups. NTG patients showed significant morning BP dips compared to the control group. The marked morning BP dip was associated with significantly large MAP or MOPP fluctuations but was not associated with visual field indices.

In this prospective study, 149 diabetic patients (149 eyes) and 50 non-diabetic control subjects were included. Baseline optical coherence tomography was employed to measure retinal thickness in the macula (horizontal, vertical, and central) and the peripapillary zone (superior, inferior, nasal, and concentric to the optic disc). Seven baseline parameters were correlated with the DR stages identified by fluorescein angiography. Baseline retinal thickness was compared between groups of patients requiring panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) within 6 months (PRP group) and patients not requiring PRP (No-PRP group). Macular and peripapillary retinal thicknesses in diabetic subjects were significantly greater than that in normal controls (p&lt;0.05). All retinal thickness parameters, and particularly peripapillary circular scans, tended to increase with increasing DR severity (p&lt;0.05). The baseline thicknesses of the peripapillary circular scans were greater in the PRP group than in the no-PRP group (p&lt;0.05). Peripapillary retinal thickness may prove to be a useful criterion for DR severity and may also serve as an indicator of disease progression. ","1061":"To assess the risk factors for endothelial cell loss after phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens according to anterior chamber depth (ACD). This prospective study included 94 eyes of 94 patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery. To assess the risk factors for corneal endothelial cell loss, we examined seven variables at 1 day, 1 week, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks postoperatively in each ACD-stratified group. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the only variable influencing the percentage decrease in corneal endothelial cell density throughout the postoperative follow-up period in the long ACD group (ACD III) was nucleosclerosis. The variables influencing the percentage decrease in corneal endothelial cell density in the short ACD group (ACD I) at one day and one week postoperatively were corneal incisional tunnel length and nucleosclerosis. Risk factors for endothelial cell loss after phaoemulsification were different according to ACD. Long corneal tunnel length can be one of the risk factors for endothelial cell loss in short ACD eyes. ","1062":"To describe a series of patients with lower eyelid epiblepharon associated with lower eyelid retraction. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent surgery for lower eyelid retraction, epiblepharon, or thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) between October 1999 and March 2007. Patients with both lower eyelid retraction and epiblepharon on preoperative examination were included in this study. Twenty-seven eyelids of 20 patients with both lower eyelid retraction and epiblepharon were enrolled. The underlying causes of lower eyelid retraction included congenital retraction (seven eyelids), congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles (CFEOM; seven eyelids), TAO (seven eyelids), post-operative cicatricial retraction (five eyelids), and facial nerve palsy (one eyelid). Eight of 27 eyelids were successfully corrected after the repair of retraction without the repair of epiblepharon, regardless of the cause of lower eyelid retraction. Another four eyelids with epiblepharon associated with TAO resolved after only orbital decompression. Cilia-everting sutures were additionally applied for epiblepharon in another 14 eyelids, 12 of which did not require the excision of a skin fold or the orbicularis muscles. Only one eyelid with mild retraction and epiblepharon underwent simple epiblepharon repair. Recurrence of retraction or epiblepharon developed in three eyelids during follow-up. In cases with both lower eyelid retraction and epiblepharon, the retraction should be repaired first, and then the epiblepharon can be corrected selectively according to the severity of the case. ","1063":"To quantify the incidence of asymptomatic incidental trochlear calcifications and to describe their clinical features. We retrospectively reviewed orbital computed tomography (CT) scans of 216 patients to identify the presence of trochlear calcifications. We analyzed the prevalence, age distribution, and gender preponderance of trochlear calcifications. We also examined age-specific prevalence rates for trochlear calcifications, as well as their relationship to systemic disease. The mean age of patients was 26.8 years. Trochlear calcifications were observed in 35 (16%) of the 216 patients, and 18 of the 35 patients had bilateral calcifications. The rate of trochlear calcification was higher in males; 32 (20.9%) of 153 male patients had trochlear calcifications, compared with 3 (4.8%) of 63 female patients. Age, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease were not significantly associated with the incidence of trochlear calcifications. Incidental asymptomatic orbital calcification is more commonly observed on CT images than we expected and occurs predominantly in male patients. Understanding this to be a relatively common, benign finding may help us to rule out foreign bodies and other pathologic conditions. ","1064":"We report a case of pseudo-Duane's retraction syndrome with entrapment of the medial rectus muscle in an old medial orbital wall fracture presenting identical clinical symptoms as Duane's retraction syndrome. A 15-year-old boy presented with persistent limited right eye movement since a young age. Examination showed marked limited abduction, mildly limited adduction, and globe retraction accompanied by narrowing of the palpebral fissure during attempted adduction in the right eye. He showed a right esotropia of 16 prism diopters and his head turned slightly to the right. A slight enophthalmos was noted in his right eye. A computed tomography scan demonstrated entrapment of the medial rectus muscle and surrounding tissues in an old medial orbital wall fracture. A forced duction test revealed a marked restriction of abduction in the right eye. A 5 mm recession of the right medial rectus muscle was performed. Postoperatively, the patient's head turn and esotropia in the primary position were successfully corrected, but there was still some limitations to his ocular movement. The importance of several tests such as the forced duction test and an imaging study should be emphasized in making a diagnosis for limitation of eye movement.","1065":"We describe a case of bilateral exudative retinal detachment associated with prodromal symptoms simulating the presentation of acute Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease that was eventually diagnosed as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A 42-year-old man presented with sudden visual loss in both eyes for two weeks. He complained of intermittent headache, neck stiffness and tinnitus for a month. His best-corrected visual acuities were 20\/200 in both eyes. Fluorescein angiography, optical coherence topography and indocyanine green angiography featured bilateral serous retinal detachments. A clinical diagnosis of incomplete type Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was considered. However, complete blood cell count showed a marked increase in the number of white blood cells and bone marrow examination revealed precursor B cell lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient started on induction chemotherapy. A week later, his best-corrected visual acuities were 20\/25 and the serous retinal detachments were nearly absorbed in both eyes. Bilateral exudative retinal detachment associated with neurologic and auditory abnormalities may be a presenting sign of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of leukemia in such patients.","1066":"To report a case of bilateral endophthalmitis as the initial presentation of bacterial meningitis in a young, immunocompetent Korean patient. A 35-year-old female with a one day history of bilateral swollen eyes, visual disturbance, headache, petechial skin rash, and nausea visited our clinic. She was diagnosed as having endogenous endophthalmitis associated with bacterial meningitis. Intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated with cefotaxime 3 g and ubacillin 3 g, four times daily. Intravitreal antibiotic (vancomycin 1 mg\/0.1 mL and ceftazidime 2 mg\/0.1 mL) injections were performed in both eyes. Two weeks post presentation, the best corrected visual acuity in both eyes improved to 0.7, and inflammation of the anterior chamber and vitreous cavity was decreased. We recommend that when endogenous endophthalmitis is suspected along with meningitis, or if it is known to be present, intravitreal and intravenous antibiotics should be promptly administered to preserve vision.","1067":"A 17-year-old man presented to us with a chief complaint of decreased visual acuity accompanied by central scotoma. There was nothing unusual in his medical history other than a recent oratorical contest. At the time of initial diagnosis, the corrected visual acuity was 20\/20 in the right eye and 20\/100 in the left eye. No significant findings were apparent on ophthalmic evaluation. On fundoscopy, there was a dumbbell-shaped macular bleed with a well-defined margin in the left eye. The clinical course was closely monitored along with drug therapy. Four weeks post presentation, the pre-retinal hemorrhage had nearly resolved. On fluorescein angiography, no significant findings were observed. In the left eye, the corrected visual acuity had improved to 20\/25. Valsalva retinopathy is a pathology that occurs when a sudden increase in intra-thoracic pressure or abdominal pressure occurs in an otherwise healthy person. Here we report a case of Valsalva retinopathy occurring following an oratorical contest along with a review of the relevant literature.","1068":"The purpose of this paper was to report a successful treatment of transluminal Nd:YAG laser embolysis (NYE) for branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) with visible emboli. Two patients with acute, severe vision loss secondary to a branch retinal artery occlusion with visible emboli in one eye underwent NYE. A complete ocular examination was performed which included biomicroscopy of the posterior pole of the retina, intraocular pressure measurement, fundus color photographs, and fluorescein angiography (FA). After the NYE, the two patients showed dramatic improvements in best-corrected visual acuity, as well as, immediate and dramatic restorations in flow past the obstructed arteriole in FA. NYE is a treatment modality to be considered in patients with BRAO who present acutely with severe vision loss and a visible embolus.","1069":"We report a rare case of retinal detachment in colobomatous macrophthalmos with microcornea syndrome. A 25-year-old female who had suffered from poor vision in her left eye since early childhood and high myopia in her right eye (-11 D) visited our clinic because of a sudden deterioration of vision. Examination of the anterior segment showed microcornea with coloboma of the inferior pupil margin in the left iris. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed an inferior choroidal coloboma extending from the optic disc and macula. The patient also had total bullous retinal detachment. Pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil tamponade was performed, and the retina was reattached. In the very rare condition of colobomatous macropthalmos with microcornea, retinal detachment may develop. Pars plana vitrectomy with additional silicone oil tamponade may be performed to treat this condition.","1070":"A 32-year-old female who had undergone the silicone oil removal procedure presented with visual disturbance in her left eye. Several months previous, she had cataract surgery in a private clinic, and a month later she had a Nd:YAG laser procedure for posterior capsulotomy. The slit-lamp examination revealed silicone oil droplets that had adhered to the intraocular lens where the posterior capsulotomy was performed. She had experienced high myopia as a manifestation of the resulting refractive changes. We replaced the previous intraocular lens with a new acrylic intraocular lens with resulting improvement to her vision. Here we report the case of a female patient with a history of silicone oil removal surgery where the resulting silicone bubbles had not been removed thoroughly and remained in the vitreous cavity. These bubbles subsequently adhered to the intraocular lens following YAG laser posterior capsulotomy, resulting in refractive changes. We recommend that implanting a silicone intraocular lens in anyone with a history of the silicone oil removal procedure or who has a possible history of silicone oil use should be avoided.","1071":"Seborrheic keratosis is a benign epithelial neoplasia that occurs mainly in the skin of the eyelids and face. We describe a case of seborrheic keratosis of the conjunctiva confirmed by histopathology. A 72-year-old man presented with a recurrent conjunctival mass involving the nasal side of his right eye. Clinically, a diagnosis of conjunctival papilloma was made, and a mass excision was performed. The histopathological analysis evidenced a conjunctival-covering epithelium with papillomatous changes and irregular acanthosis, at the expense of a proliferation of basaloid cells. In addition, the lesion exhibited multiple pseudohorn cysts containing keratin. With the above findings, a diagnosis of conjunctival seborrheic keratosis was established. The occurrence of seborrheic keratosis on the conjunctiva is rare. In this case, seborrheic keratosis was confirmed by pathologic report despite its similar appearance with papilloma. Seborrheic keratosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of conjunctival lesions.","1072":"We report a very rare case of trichilemmal carcinoma (TLC) involving the upper eyelid. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of trichilemmal carcinoma of the upper eyelid in Korea. A 51-year-old man presented to our hospital complaining of a bloody discharge from his left upper eyelid. He had a soft and lobulated mass on the palpebral conjunctiva. An incisional biopsy revealed trabecular growth of tumor cells with clear cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, frequent mitoses, and foci of trichilemmal keratinization. Immunohistochemically, the lesion was positive for p53 and negative for CD 34. A diagnosis of TLC was made, and total excision of the mass and reconstruction of the eyelid were performed. Trichilemmal carcinoma is a rare malignant tumor, though it appears to be an indolent neoplasm with no metastatic potential. The treatment of choice for trichilemmal carcinoma of the eyelid is complete excision with tumor-free margins due to the locally invasive nature of the lesion.","1073":"This study was performed to examine the vascular network of the human iris using flat preparation. The ciliary body-iris structures were separated from human eyeballs, and a portion of the irises were treated with trypsin to remove the pigment granules. These iris tissues were unfolded and placed onto glass slides using flat preparation, and the vascular network of each iris was examined by fluorescein microscopy. The ciliary body-iris structures separated from the remaining eyes were stained with hematoxylin-eosin without trypsin treatment and were examined by light microscopy. The long posterior ciliary artery formed several branches before entering the iris root, and such branches formed the major arterial circle of the iris with diverse diameters in the vicinity of the iris root and the ciliary process. In the pupillary margin, the iris vasculature network formed a cone shape and then formed an arcade by connecting to adjacent vasculatures. In the vicinity of the collarette, the iris vasculature network formed the minor arterial circle of the iris with diverse diameters perpendicular to the arcade of the iris network located in the pupillary margin. In the pupillary margin, the capillaries were somewhat thick and connected to the irregular traveling iris vein. The above findings explain the human iris vascular network and provide a theoretical basis for the sectoral filling of the iris vasculature seen in fluorescein iris angiography. ","1074":"To screen for diabetic autonomic neuropathy of the pupil using 0.5% apraclonidine and 0.1% pilocarpine and to evaluate the early diagnostic value of this pharmacologic pupillary test by assessing the relationship between pupillary and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathies. A total of 22 diabetic patients were recruited. Baseline pupillary diameter (PD) and the difference in PD between the test eye and the control eye before and after instillation of apraclonidine and pilocarpine were measured. All patients also underwent cardiovascular autonomic function (CAF) testing. Baseline PD in room light correlated with duration of diabetes mellitus (DM, p=0.049) and the presence of DM retinopathy (DMR, p=0.022). Eleven patients (50%) had positive apraclonidine tests, and two patients had positive pilocarpine tests. The patients who had positive pilocarpine tests also had positive apraclonidine tests. Patients who had a positive pupillary test had a significantly higher rate of positive CAF tests (p=0.032). Pupillary autonomic neuropathy was related to the duration of diabetes and the degree of DMR. There was also a significant correlation between pupillary autonomic neuropathy and cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN). Also, sympathetic nerve dysfunction occurred prior to parasympathetic dysfunction in this study. A simple pharmacologic pupillary test can help manage complications in diabetic patients because patients with pupillary autonomic dysfunction have an increased risk of CAN. ","1075":"To identify the prognostic factors for successful laser iridotomy for acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 77 eyes of 77 patients with AACG with initial intraocular pressure (IOP) above 40 mmHg. All of the patients received maximum tolerable medical therapy (MTMT) followed by laser iridotomy. In order to comparatively analyze the factors affecting successful laser iridotomy, an increase in IOP on follow-up was defined as increase in IOP greater than 21 mmHg requiring medical or surgical treatment. Successful laser iridotomy was achieved in 59.7% (46\/77 eyes). Thirty-one eyes (40.3%) exhibited increased IOP on follow-up, and of these, 30 eyes developed an increase in IOP within six months after the first attack. The success rate was higher (92.9%) in 42 patients who had greater than 30% IOP reduction by MTMT at the first attack compared to the 35 patients whose IOP reduction was less than 30%, of which 24 eyes (72.7%) showed more than 30% IOP reduction after intravenous hyperosmotic agent treatment (p=0.012). The success rate was higher in patients treated within seven days after the development of symptoms than in those treated after seven days (Odds ratio, 4.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.38 to 14.75). Our data suggest that we can expect successful IOP control after laser iridotomy in eyes with AACG if the patient can be treated within seven days after the development of symptoms and if the IOP reduction was more than 30% by MTMT. ","1076":"To evaluate the efficacy of excision of avascular bleb and advancement of adjacent conjunctiva (EBAC) for treatment of hypotony after trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC). Fifteen patients (17 eyes) who received EBAC for correction of hypotony between September 1996 and October 2008 were reviewed retrospectively. The main outcomes were intraocular pressure (IOP) and postoperative complications. Hypotony (IOP &lt;6 mmHg) of eight eyes (47.1%, seven patients) was caused by bleb perforation. Of these, two eyes (two patients) had a history of trauma. Hypotony appeared at 33.9+\/-30.8 months, and EBAC was performed at 48.2+\/-35.3 months after trabeculectomy with MMC. The mean follow-up period was 38.3+\/-29.8 months. The qualified success rate of EBAC was 100% at 51 months after EBAC, and the complete success rate of EBAC was 76.5% at six months and 70.6% at 51 months, as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Post-EBAC complications included blepharoptosis in four eyes (23.5%) and bleb perforation in one (5.9%). The blepharoptosis resolved within one month after EBAC in two patients. However, in the other patients, mild blepharoptosis remained at 17 and 22 months postoperatively. EBAC was found to be an effective method for treatment of hypotony after trabeculectomy with MMC, and postoperative blepharoptosis was a major complication. ","1077":"To compare the success rates and stabilities of postoperative alignment between adjustable and the non-adjustable surgeries in the treatment of sensory exotropia. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients with sensory exotropia who had undergone unilateral lateral rectus recession and medial rectus resection (R&amp;R) between January 1998 and August 2005. Thirty-four patients underwent conventional R&amp;R, and 20 patients underwent R&amp;R with adjustable suture of the lateral rectus. The surgical results between the two groups were analyzed with regard to the preoperative and post-operative deviation angles and the postoperative drift. The postoperative deviation angle was measured on postoperative day 1 as well as at two weeks, three months, six months and the final visit after surgery. There were no statistically significant differences in the mean preoperative and postoperative deviation angles between the two groups. In 30 (88%) patients in the non-adjustable group and 15 (75%) patients in the adjustable group, postoperative deviation was less than 15 prism diopters (PD) at the three month follow-up. There was no significant difference in the mean postoperative drift between the two groups. Strabismus surgery with adjustable sutures did not show a significantly better result than surgery without adjustable sutures in the treatment of sensory exotropia. Considering the amount of postoperative exodrift in both groups, we postulate that the immediate ocular alignment after surgery for sensory exotropia should be orthophoric or 5-6 PD of esodeviation. ","1078":"To evaluate the effectiveness of tramadol for the reduction of pain in panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). A double-masked randomized controlled study was performed. Fifty-eight eyes in 29 patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were enrolled. The eyes of the patients were randomized into two groups. Group A received an empty capsule. Group B received an oral intake of 100 mg tramadol. The capsule used in Group A had the same appearance as that used in Group B. Pain during PRP was assessed using a visual analog scale. Vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, were measured. The mean pain scores for groups A and B were 4.80+\/-2.10 and 3.83+\/-1.82 (p=0.09). There were no significant differences in the mean pain scores between the two groups. More patients in group A complained of greater pain than moderate intensity (visual analogue scale=4). Systemic blood pressure increased significantly in group A after laser treatment. However, there were no significant differences in the diastolic blood pressure changes between the two groups. We found no statistical correlation in the heart rate changes. We failed to prove that tramadol is effective for pain relief because of the small sample size. However, tramadol was effective for the relief of more severe pain. It was also found to stabilize vital sign changes, such as systolic blood pressure during PRP. ","1079":"To investigate the short-term effects of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) combined with an intravitreal injection of Avastin(bevacizumab) as an adjuvant to high-risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The data was collected retrospectively from the eyes of high-risk PDR patients, which were divided into two groups. One eye was treated with only PRP (PRP only group) and the fellow eye of same patient was treated with both PRP and intravitreal bevacizumab injection (Adjuvant group). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), IOP (intraocular pressure), and new vessel (NV) size in fluorescein angiography were recorded immediately and at the six-week follow-up visit. Adverse events associated with intravitreal injection were investigated. Of 12 patients with high-risk PDR, five were male and seven were female. There were no statistically significant BCVA or IOP changes after treatment in either group (p=0.916, 0.888). The reduction of NV size was found in both groups, but NV size in the adjuvant group showed a greater decrease than that of the PRP only group (p=0.038). Three patients had adverse events after intravitreal injection. Two patients had mild anterior uveitis and one patient had a serious complication of branched retinal artery obstruction (BRAO). Intravitreal bevacizumab injection with PRP resulted in marked regression of neovascularization compared with PRP alone. One serious side effect, BRAO, was noted in this study. Further studies are needed to determine the effect of repeated intravitreal bevacizumab injections and the proper number of bevacizumab injections as an adjuvant. ","1080":"To compare the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab to those of triamcinolone acetonide injection for the treatment of macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion. This retrospective study included 50 eyes of 50 patients who received a single injection of intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg\/0.05 mL, 22 eyes) or triamcinolone acetonide (4 mg\/0.1 mL, 28 eyes) as the only treatment for macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion; all patients had a post-injection follow-up duration of &gt;24 weeks. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and central macular thickness (CMT) by optical coherence tomography were measured for up to 24 weeks after injection. BCVA was improved at 1, 4, 8,12 weeks post-injection in the bevacizumab group, and at 1, 4, 8 weeks post-injection in the triamcinolone group. No significant difference was found between the two groups except at 12 weeks. CMT decreased significantly within each group, and no significant difference between groups was found. In the bevacizumab group, no elevated IOP was observed, whereas IOP was significantly increased at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after triamcinolone injection; IOP was therefore significantly different between the two groups. Intravitreal bevacizumab is a comparatively simple treatment method that can effectively improve BCVA and reduce CMT without ocular and systemic complications. Consequently, intravitreal bevacizumab injections may be useful as both an alternative and primary treatment for macular edema secondary to branch retinal vein occlusion. ","1081":"This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of fluid-gas exchange for the treatment of postvitrectomy retinal detachment. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 33 consecutive patients (35 eyes) who underwent fluid-gas exchange treatment for postvitrectomy retinal detachment using the two-needle pars plana approach technique. The retinal reattachment rate was 80.0% after complete intravitreal gas disappearance following the fluid-gas exchange; the overall success rate was 65.7%. Visual acuity was improved or stable in 80.0% of cases; a two-line or greater vision improvement or a best-corrected visual acuity of 0.4 or better occurred in 62.9% of cases. The success rates for superior retinal detachments and posterior pole retinal detachments were 76.5% and 85.7%, respectively. Fluid-gas exchange represents a simple and cost-effective alternative outpatient procedure for retinal reattachment without reoperation for the treatment of superior and posterior pole retinal detachments. ","1082":"To evaluate the clinical course of visual acuity and foveal thickness in the idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM) after a vitrectomy with the use of triamcinolone. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 30 patients (30 eyes) with ERM that were treated by vitrectomy from 2004 to 2008. Visual acuity and foveal thickness from optical coherence tomography imaging was obtained preoperatively and at every postoperative follow-up visit. Visual acuity improved by two or more lines of vision in 30%, 50%, 60%, and 70%, and stayed the same within +\/-1 line in 47%, 50%, 40%, and 30% at one month, three months, five months, and seven months after surgery. Twenty-three percent of the subjects deteriorated by two or more lines of vision within one month after surgery. None of the subjects had reduced vision three months after surgery. Foveal thickness decreased significantly after surgery. The mean thickness was 409.7+\/-107.9 microm before surgery and 288.6+\/-66.1 microm seven months after surgery. Parameters which were significantly correlated with the final visual acuity included preoperative visual acuity (0.683), preoperative foveal thickness (0.544), and final foveal thickness (0.643) (p&lt;0.005). Foveal thickness and visual acuity improved until seven months after the vitrectomy in patients with idiopathic ERM. Preoperative visual acuity, foveal thickness, and final foveal thickness had a significant correlation with the final visual acuity. ","1083":"To evaluate the factors that affect postoperative astigmatism and post-suture removal astigmatism, and to evaluate the risk factors associated with astigmatism axis shift. We performed a retrospective chart review of 130 eyes that had undergone uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Preoperative astigmatism was divided into four groups (Groups I, II, III, and IV) according to the differences between the axis of preoperative astigmatism (flattest axis) and the incision axis (105 degrees). We analyzed the magnitude and axis of the induced astigmatism after the operation and after suture removal in each group. We also analyzed the factors which affected the postoperative astigmatism and post-suture removal astigmatism in each sub-group of Groups I, II, III, and IV, excluding postoperative or post-suture removal axis shift (specifically, Group I(WAS), II(WAS), III(WAS), and IV(WAS)). We identified the variables associated with the prevalence of postoperative astigmatism axis shift and those associated with the prevalence of post-suture removal axis shift. An increase in the magnitude of postoperative astigmatism was associated with an increase in the preoperative magnitude of astigmatism in Groups I(WAS), II(WAS), and III(WAS) (p&lt;0.05), and with an increase in the corneal tunnel length in Group I(WAS). A decrease in the magnitude of postoperative astigmatism was associated with an increase in the corneal tunnel length in Groups III(WAS) and IV(WAS) (p&lt;0.05). An increase in the magnitude of post-suture removal astigmatism was associated with an increase in the magnitude of postoperative astigmatism in Groups I(WAS) and IV(WAS) (p&lt;0.05), and with late suture removal in Group IV(WAS) (p&lt;0.05). A decrease in the magnitude of post-suture removal astigmatism was associated with late suture removal in Groups I(WAS) and II(WAS). A logistic regression analysis showed that the prevalence of post-suture removal astigmatism axis shift was associated with increased corneal tunnel length, decreased magnitude of postoperative astigmatism, and early suture removal. In order to reduce postoperative and post-suture removal astigmatism, we recommend a short corneal tunnel length and late suture removal in patients with Group I(WAS) characteristics, late suture removal in Group II(WAS)-like patients, long corneal tunnel length in Group III(WAS)-like patients, and long corneal tunnel length and early suture removal in patients with characteristics of Group IV(WAS). ","1084":"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of fractional photothermolysis (FP) in the treatment of facial wrinkles in Asians. A total of 27 Korean patients (Fitzpatrick type III or IV) received 2-3 FP treatment sessions (Sellas; Dinona Inc., Seoul, Korea) spaced two weeks apart. Treatments were performed at settings of 7 to 9 mJ\/microthermal treatment zone (MTZ) and a density of 1000 MTZ\/cm(2). Standardized digital photographs were obtained before each treatment and three months after the final treatment. The evaluations of clinical photographs were performed by three physicians blinded to the study subjects using a five-point grading scale. In addition, the patients' perceived degree of improvement was assessed three months after the final treatment using a five-point grading scale. Side effects were monitored at each follow-up visit. The physicians' assessed degrees of improvement were excellent in three patients (12%), significant in ten (40%), and moderate in seven (28%). The patients' self-assessed degrees of improvement were excellent in five patients (20%), significant in 11 (44%), and moderate in six (24%). Adverse events were limited to transient pain, erythema and edema, except in one case of transient postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. FP is an effective treatment modality for reducing facial wrinkles with minimal side effects in Asian patients. ","1085":"We report a case of multiple myeloma that presented as a fluctuating sixth cranial nerve palsy in the absence of widespread signs of systemic disease. A 63-year-old woman presented with horizontal diplopia of two weeks duration that subjectively changed over time. Ocular examination showed a fluctuating sixth nerve palsy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed multiple, enhancing, soft tissue, mass-like lesions involving the left cavernous sinus and the apex of both petrous bones. Based on bone marrow biopsy and hematologic findings, she was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma may be included in the differential diagnosis of a fluctuating sixth nerve palsy, and although ophthalmic signs are rare and generally occur late in the course of multiple myeloma, they can still be its first signs.","1086":"We report a case of acute comitant esotropia in a child with a cerebellar tumor. A 3-year-old boy was referred for management of a 9 month history of acute acquired comitant esotropia. On first presentation, the patient's angle of esodeviation was 50 prism-diopters (PD) at distance and near fixation without any lateral incomitance. The cycloplegic refraction revealed +0.75 diopters in both eyes. Very mild bilateral papilledema was found on the fundus examination, but the neurological examination did not reveal any other pathological findings. Brain MRI showed a 5 cm mass located in the midline of the cerebellum as well as hydrocephalus. The mass was completely excised and histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma. Despite neurosurgery, the patient's strabismus remained unresolved. One year after neurosurgery, both medial rectus muscles were surgically recessed by 6 mm, resulting in esotropia of 8PD at distant and near fixation without restoration of bifoveal fusion at follow-up 2 years after the eye muscle surgery. Therefore, acute onset comitant esotropia in a child can be the first sign of a cerebellar tumor, even without any other neurological signs and symptoms.","1087":"A 51-year old man presented with vertical and torsional diplopia after reduction of a blowout fracture at another hospital one year ago. He had no anormalies of head position and 14 prism diopters (PD) right hypertropia (RHT) in the primary position. In upgaze no vertical deviation was found, and hyperdeviation on downgaze was 35PD. Bielschowsky head tilt test showed a negative response. Distinct superior oblique (SO) and inferior rectus (IR) underaction of the right eye was noted but IO overaction was mild on the ocular version test. Double Maddox rod test (DMRT) revealed 10-degree extorsion, but fundus extorsion was minimal in the right eye.Thin-section coronal CT scan showed that there was no fracture line on the anterior orbital floor, but a fracture remained on the posterior orbital floor. Also, the anterior part of the right inferior oblique muscle was vertically reoriented and the medial portion of the inferior oblique muscle was not traced on the coronal CT scan. The patient underwent 14 mm right IO recession and 3 mm right IR resection. One month after the surgery, his vertical and torsional diplopia were eliminated in the primary position.","1088":"Kimura's disease (KD) is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder, which is characterized by tumor-like masses mainly located in the head and neck region. Extraocular muscle involvement in KD is uncommon. We report a case of KD that involved both the extraocular muscles and buccal area. A 13-year-old male presented to our clinic with a two-year history of exophthalmos of the left eye and facial swelling. Facial CT and MRI showed a 1.5 x 1.5 cm(2) soft tissue mass located at the left masticator and buccal area, exophthalmos of the left eye, and diffuse thickening of the left extraocular muscles. We performed a lateral rectus muscle incisional biopsy of the left eye. Oral methylprednisolone therapy was initiated and tapered following the incisional biopsy. Histopathologic findings of the lateral rectus muscle incisional biopsy showed abnormal vascular proliferation with marked eosinophilic infiltration in hypertrophied collagenous tissue. Post-operative histopathologic findings of the facial mass confirmed the diagnosis of KD. Although KD with extraocular muscle involvement is uncommon, an ophthalmologist can diagnose KD by the clinical presentation of exophthalmos, eyelid swelling, and an orbital massas well as by histological examination of a biopsy of the orbital mass.","1089":"We report three cases of neovascular glaucoma secondary to central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) which were effectively managed with intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) followed by panretinal photocoagulation (PRP). Neovascular glaucoma without peripheral anterior synechiae developed between one and five weeks following CRAO onset. All patients received 0.75 mg (0.03 ml) IVB. In all patients, complete regression of the iris and anterior chamber angle neovascularization was confirmed within one week. PRP was applied two weeks after the injection. The follow-up period was four to seven months (average, five months). Intraocular pressure was controlled in all patients using topical antiglaucoma medications alone. However, one patient experienced a recurrence of neovascularization three months after the initial combination treatment. This patient received another IVB injection and additional PRP, and the recurrent neovascularization resolved. There were no local or systemic adverse events in any patients. Therefore, intravitreal bevacizumab may be an effective adjunct in the treatment of neovascular glaucoma associated with CRAO.","1090":"A 40-year-old female visited our clinic for visual disturbance of the right eye, in which a few creamy-yellow retinal lesions and visual field constrictions were noted. She had been treated for primary CNS lymphoma and was in complete remission. After failure to follow-up for three months, she lost vision in the right eye, at which time active panuveitis was seen. Decreased vision and field constriction was observed in the left eye. Her left eye showed a granular pattern and dye leakage from the vessels and disc on fluorescein angiography and small RPE humps were seen in optical coherence tomography (OCT). Diffuse large malignant B-cells with strong immunoreactivities with CD20 immunostaining were seen in the epiretinal membrane biopsy specimen. Intravitreal injections of methotrexate (MTX) (800 microg\/0.1 ml in the right eye, 400 microg\/0.05 ml in the left eye) were performed twice weekly for one month, once weekly for the following month, once every two weeks for the next month, followed by nine monthly injections. Both eyes were free from malignant cells on vitreous biopsy six months later. There was no leakage seen by angiography, but the granular pattern persisted. Visual field constriction was slightly improved, and the small RPE humpsdetachments seen in OCT disappeared. EOG Arden ratio was decreased in both eyes, and b wave amplitude of scotopic ERG was decreased in the left eye. She was free from recurrence until six months later. No ocular complications except minimal opacity of the crystalline lenses were noted in both eyes.","1091":"Here, we report the case of a patient who sustained Nd: YAG laser macular injury with subsequent 6 year follow-up evaluation. A 23-year-old female was accidentally exposed to a Q-switched Nd: YAG laser without protective goggles. Upon initial evaluation, the best-corrected visual acuity of her affected eye was 20\/100 OD. Fundoscopic examination revealed a macular laser burn and vitreous hemorrhage. Corticosteroids, in the form of 60 mg prednisolone, were administered orally with a 10 mg per week taper. Nineteen days following exposure, fundoscopic examination revealed a distinct epiretinal membrane which resolved within six months. The best-corrected visual acuity of the affected eye remained 20\/100 OD. This clinical course is similar to those of previously reported cases including vitreous hemorrhage and subsequent epiretinal membrane formation. However, visual acuity did not recover despite spontaneous regression of the epiretinal membrane and at 6 year follow-up, there was neither choroidal neovascularization nor macular hole formation.","1092":"Dermoid tumors in the medial canthal area are rare, but when present they commonly adhere to the lacrimal canaliculi. Three patients presented with a mass in the medial canthal area. The authors performed excisional biopsies, and the masses were diagnosed as dermoid tumors. In two patients, canalicular lacerations were found after mass excision, which suggested that the masses had been firmly adherent to the lacrimal canaliculi. The lacerated canaliculi were repaired after bicanalicular silicone intubation. In the remaining patient, lacrimal silicone intubation was performed at the beginning of surgery, and the mass was successfully dissected from the canaliculi, leaving them intact. Excision of dermoid tumors in the medial canthal area requires careful dissection to avoid canalicular laceration. Bicanalicular silicone intubation at the beginning of surgery is helpful for the identification of the canaliculi and for the prevention of canalicular laceration during dermoid tumor excision.","1093":"To investigate the degree of reunion in rabbit eyes of the superior oblique tendon after several surgical weakening procedures. A total of 32 rabbits (64 eyes) were used in this study. The rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups, eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the tenotomy group, eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the tenectomy group, eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the disinsertion group and eight rabbits (16 eyes) in the recession group. The degree of reunion or reattachment of the superior oblique tendon on the globe were examined on four eyes in each group at postoperative weeks two, four, six and eight. At eight weeks, the newly created insertion site remained at the same site in all eyes in the recession group, and the distal end of the superior oblique tendon was reattached at the medial border of the superior rectus muscle in all four eyes in the tenotomy and disinsertion groups, and in three of four eyes in the tenectomy group. From this experimental study, it was speculated that superior oblique recession is more effective than other superior oblique weakening procedures. This result could be helpful in the prediction of time of recurrence for superior oblique overaction after superior oblique weakening procedures. ","1094":"To compare high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and lipid profiles between Korean normal tension glaucoma (NTG) patients and healthy controls. This cross-sectional study included 38 Korean patients with NTG and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We excluded the patients with cardiovascular risk factors and other systemic diseases that might affect CRP levels and lipid profiles. Each patient underwent a Humphrey visual field examination and blood sampling for hsCRP and lipid profile analyses. Subsequently, the NTG patients were classified into two groups based on their untreated intraocular pressure (IOP) level: low NTG (LNTG) with IOP &lt; or = 13 mmHg (13 subjects) and high NTG (HNTG) with relatively high IOP (&gt;13 and &lt; or = 21 mmHg, 25 subjects). The hsCRP levels and lipid profiles were compared between NTG patients and healthy controls, and between LNTG, HNTG, and healthy controls. There were no significant differences in hsCRP and lipid profiles between either the NTG patients and healthy controls, or between the LNTG, HNTG, and controls (p&gt;0.05) after exclusion of Korean patients with cardiovascular risk factors. There was no significant association between hsCRP and visual field indices (p&gt;0.05). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein-related vascular inflammatory conditions may not be directly associated with the development of NTG, regardless of the untreated IOP level. ","1095":"To study the concentration of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the aqueous humor before and after intracameral injection of bevacizumab in eyes with neovascular glaucoma, and to detect the duration of an anti-VEGF effect of bevacizumab in the anterior chamber. In this prospective interventional case series, 1.25 mg of bevacizumab was injected into the anterior chamber of five eyes in five neovascular glaucoma patients. Aqueous humor samples were obtained just before intracameral injection of bevacizumab and two weeks after injection. The concentrations of VEGF in the aqueous humor were measured using ELISA. To investigate corneal endothelial damage after intrecameral bevacizumab injection, specular microscopy was performed before injection and two weeks after injection. Slit lamp photo and iris fluorescent angiography was performed to determine the regression of iris neovascularization. After injection, substantial regression of neovascularization or fluorescein leakage was seen in all treated eyes. The VEGF concentrations in the aqueous humor in eyes with NVG were 1181.8 + or - 1248.3 pg\/mL before intracameral injection of bevacizumab. Two weeks after injection, the VEGF concentrations decreased to 33.2 + or - 12.2 pg\/mL (p=0.04, Wilcoxon signed rank test). There were no significant changes in IOP or corneal endothelial cells. Intracameral bevacizumab injection can remarkably reduce iris neovascularization in neovascular glaucoma patients. VEGF levels were significantly decreased two weeks after injection and corneal toxicity was not observed during short term follow-up. ","1096":"To identify the anatomy of the levator aponeurosis (LA) and Whitnall's ligament (WL) in Korean subjects using cadavers. Orbital exenteration was performed in ten cadavers (20 eyeballs) that had no history of trauma near the eyeball. We observed characteristics of WL (tension, density, and shape) and the relationship between the superior rectus muscle (SR) and the levator palpebrae superioris. We measured the distance from both the eyelid margin and the upper border of the tarsal plate to the insertion of the LA medially, centrally, and laterally. The WLs we observed showed several shapes. In 12 eyes, we saw clear, white fibrotic bands, while in four others, we found thin, less taut bands. In four eyes, we were unable to identify the precise shape of the band. The insertions of the LA showed nasal dehiscence in 13 eyes and parallel attachment in seven eyes. The distances from the eyelid margin to the insertion of the LA medially, centrally, and laterally were 8.31 mm, 5.57 mm, and 5.15 mm, respectively. The distances from the upper border of the tarsal plate to the insertion of the LA medially, centrally, and laterally were 2.75 mm, 4.82 mm, and 4.29 mm, respectively. This study examined the anatomy of WL and the LA in Korean subjects and may be helpful as a reference in levator muscle surgery. ","1097":"To evaluate and compare correlations between structural and functional loss in glaucoma as assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT), scanning laser polarimetry (GDx VCC, as this was the model used in this study), standard automated perimetry (SAP), and the Humphrey Matrix (Matrix). Ninety glaucomatous eyes identified with SAP and 112 eyes diagnosed using Matrix were independently classified into six subgroups, either S1\/M1 (MD&gt;-6dB), S2\/M2 (-12&lt;MD&lt;-6dB) or S3\/M3 (MD&lt;-12dB), according to the mean deviation (MD) of each test. Average and sectoral retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and percentage of abnormal classifications using the internal normative databases of OCT and GDx VCC were compared among the six subgroups. In the SAP subgroups, RNFL thickness values obtained by OCT in the nasal and temporal quadrants and the inferior averages of GDx VCC did not differ between the S1 and S2 subgroups (p=0.137, 0.738 and 0.149, respectively). In the Matrix subgroups, no measurement parameters differed between the M1 and M2 groups except for the overall mean and average inferior RNFL thickness given by OCT and the NFI values of GDx VCC (p=0.013, 0.016 and 0.029, respectively). When abnormal classifications were compared, all measurement parameters, without exception, were significantly different in both the SAP and the Matrix subgroups. SAP subgroups showed a good correlation of structural and functional defects when assessed using OCT and GDx VCC. These correlations were weaker in the Matrix subgroups, especially in the early stages of glaucoma. ","1098":"To compare the ability of scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (GDx-VCC) and Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT) to detect photographic retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects. This retrospective cross-sectional study included 45 eyes of 45 consecutive glaucoma patients with RNFL defects in red-free fundus photographs. The superior and inferior temporal quadrants in each eye were included for data analysis separately. The location and presence of RNFL defects seen in red-free fundus photographs were compared with those seen in GDx-VCC deviation maps and OCT RNFL analysis maps for each quadrant. Of the 90 quadrants (45 eyes), 31 (34%) had no apparent RNFL defects, 29 (32%) had focal RNFL defects, and 30 (33%) had diffuse RNFL defects in red-free fundus photographs. The highest agreement between GDx-VCC and red-free photography was 73% when we defined GDx-VCC RNFL defects as a cluster of three or more color-coded squares (p&lt;5%) along the traveling line of the retinal nerve fiber in the GDx-VCC deviation map (kappa value, 0.388; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.195 to 0.582). The highest agreement between OCT and red-free photography was 85% (kappa value, 0.666; 95% CI, 0.506 to 0.825) when a value of 5% outside the normal limit for the OCT analysis map was used as a cut-off value for OCT RNFL defects. According to the kappa values, the agreement between GDx-VCC deviation maps and red-free photography was poor, whereas the agreement between OCT analysis maps and red-free photography was good. ","1099":"To determine the relationship between the American Medical Association's (AMA) functional vision score (FVS) and vision-specific quality of life in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients using the National Eye Institute's Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25). One hundred eight patients with RP participated in the study. We measured best-corrected visual acuity, conducted Goldmann perimetry, and collected the self-reported NEI-VFQ 25. The FVS was calculated using the functional field score (FFS) and the functional acuity score (FAS). The correlations of the VFQ composite scores to the FVS, FFS, and FAS were determined using correlation and regression analyses. FVS was highly correlated to the BCVA (r=0.69, p&lt;0.001), the FFS (r=0.86, p&lt;0.001) and the FAS (r=0.73, p&lt;0.001). Significant correlations of the VFQ composite score to the BCVA (r=0.60, p&lt;0.001), FFS (r=0.44, p&lt;0.001), FAS (r=0.60, p&lt;0.001), FVS (r=0.58, p&lt;0.001) were also found. However, the correlation strengths of BCVA, FVS, FAS, and FFS to NEI-FVQ were not different. In RP patients, the vision-specific quality of life was correlated with the AMA guidelines' FVS, FFS, and FAS. Their correlation degrees to NEI-FVQ were not different. This result suggests that vision-specific quality of life can be explained by both visual acuity and visual field in RP patients. ","1100":"Postoperative endophthalmitis is a dreaded outcome of any intraocular surgery. Fungal endophthalmitis is a particularly severe complication that poses a significant threat of blindness. We experienced seven consecutive cases of postoperative fungal endophthalmitis stemming from a single local clinic in which extensive early intervention resulted in favorable final visual acuity. The present study is retrospective observational case series of fungal endophthalmitis. The initial case, as diagnosed by fungal culture, resulted in blindness. In the ensuing eight months, seven consecutive cases were referred to our institution. All were presumed to be fungal endophthalmitis as the cases possessed similar inflammatory findings to the preceding case and occurred in the same environment. Extensive surgical and antifungal treatment was immediately administered, including complete vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and lens capsule and Amphotericin B injections. Retinal infiltration was identified in three cases and the lesion site was photocoagulated with an endolaser. All cases were confirmed fungal endophthalmitis by culture (4 cases: Candida parapsilosis, one case each: Fusarium, Acremonium, Candida tropicalis) and five cases required secondary intraocular lens implantation. Final corrected visual acuity ranged from 20\/20 to 40\/200 by the Snellen chart. Early extensive surgical intervention and antifungal agent administration may result in favorable visual outcomes in patients with fungal endophthalmitis following cataract surgery. ","1101":"To compare the efficacy between macular laser grid (MLG) photocoagulation and MLG plus intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA; MLG+IVTA) therapy in diabetic macular edema (DME) patients. A prospective, randomized, clinical trial was conducted of DME patients. A total of 60 eyes (54 patients) affected by DME were observed for a minimum of 6 months. Thirty eyes of 28 patients who received MLG treatment and 30 eyes of 26 patients who received the combined MLG+IVTA treatment were included in the study. Main outcome measures were BCVA and central macular thickness (CMT) as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment. Additionally, the authors examined retrospectively 20 eyes of 20 patients who were treated with only IVTA and compared with the 2 groups (MLG group and MLG+IVTA group). Baseline BCVA was 0.53 + or - 0.32 and CMT was 513.9 + or - 55.1 microm in the MLG group. At 1 and 3 months after treatment, the MLG group showed no significant improvement of BCVA and CMT, although there was significant improvement after 6 months. In the MLG+IVTA group, the baseline BCVA was 0.59 + or - 0.29 and CMT was 498.2 + or - 19.8 microm. After treatment, significant improvement of BCVA and CMT was observed at all follow-up time periods. When comparing the MLG group with the MLG+IVTA group, the latter had better results after 1 and 3 months, although at 6 months, there was no significant difference of BCVA and CMT between the 2 groups. Additionally, the IVTA group showed more improvement than the MLG group at 1 and 3 months but showed no significant difference at 6 months. In addition, the IVTA group showed no significant difference with the MLG+IVTA group at all follow-up time periods. For DME patients, the combined MLG+IVTA treatment had a better therapeutic effect than the MLG treatment for improving BCVA and CMT at the early follow-up time periods. IVTA treatment alone could be an additional alternative therapeutic option to combined therapy. ","1102":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the visual outcomes and complications of unilateral scleral fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses (SF-PCIOLs) in pediatric complicated traumatic cataracts without capsular support. This study involved five eyes of five children who underwent unilateral SF-PCIOL. All patients had a unilateral complicated traumatic cataract associated with anterior or posterior segment injury. Visual acuity (VA), IOL position, and postoperative complications were assessed during follow-up. The mean age of patients at the time of SF-PCIOL was 90 months (range, 66-115). The mean duration of follow-up time after surgery was 22 months (range, 5-55). In all patients, the best-corrected VA was either improved or was stable at last follow-up following SF-PCIOL implantation. There were no serious complications. Unilateral scleral fixation of PCIOL can be a safe and effective procedure for pediatric, unilateral, complicated traumatic cataracts without capsular support in selected cases. ","1103":"This purpose of this report was to study trends in cataract and refractive surgeries conducted during the past twelve years and to compare results to previous reports from the ASCRS and New Zealand (NZ) in order to forecast future medical services. We surveyed members of the Korean Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (KSCRS) every year from 1995 to 2006, and studied changes in cataract and refractive surgeries (RS). The duration of hospitalization has been gradually decreasing to the point that a one day hospitalization following surgery has become common. The rate of topical anesthesia use has significantly increased since 1998. Sutureless incision methods are now commonly practiced. The use of acryl IOL as an optic material has been gradually increasing for cataract surgeries. KSCRS members showed an interest in the special intraocular lenses as multifocal IOL. While Excimer laser PRK was the most popular refractive surgery during the first stage, KSCRS members increasingly prefer LASIK to the Excimer laser PRK. Regression of the corrected visual acuity, dry eye, night halo, and flashes were the most common complications following refractive surgeries. Medical disputes related to PRK and LASIK have been gradually increasing throughout the study period. We confirm that the KSCRS practice styles for cataract and RS are similar to those of the ASCRS and NZ. We infer a world-wide trend from the comparison of these three societies. ","1104":"To compare the efficacies and safeties of Meditoxin (Medy-Tox, Korea) and Botox in the treatment of essential blepharospasm. We performed a double-blind, randomized, comparative trial comparing Meditoxin and Botox for treatment of blepharospasm in 60 patients from the intention-to-treat (ITT) population and 52 patients from the per-protocol (PP) population. We analyzed the improvements in severity of spasm (SS) at four weeks post-injection as a primary efficacy outcome. Changes in eyelid closing force (CF) and functional visual status (FVS) after injection were analyzed for secondary efficacy outcomes, and adverse effects were demonstrated for the safety evaluation. Improvement in SS was noted in 90.3% of the Meditoxin group and 86.2% of the Botox group. There were no significant differences between treatment groups in the changes of CF and FVS post-injection (p&gt;0.05). Since the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (-1.76% for ITT, -1.64% for PP) was over the -15% threshold, we determined that Meditoxin was not inferior to Botox in either the ITT or PP populations. Adverse effects developed in 16.1% of the Meditoxin group and 27.6% of the Botox group, but no serious adverse events were found in either group. Meditoxin and Botox were comparable in efficacy and safety in the treatment of essential blepharospasm. ","1105":"","1106":"We report a case of ocular ischemic syndrome accompanied by neovascular glaucoma that was successfully treated with Bevacizumab. A 70-year-old male patient diagnosed with neovascular glaucoma of the left eye 3-4 years prior complained of continuous left eye pain and declining visual acuity despite receiving the latest treatment methods. At the time of admission the patient had no light perception in the left eye and his intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg. Anterior segment and fundus examinations revealed neovascularization of the iris and stenosis of the retinal vessel. Hypofluorescence of the choroid and retinal vessels was observed on fluorescence fundus angiography. Left internal carotid artery stenosis was observed on a brain MRI. Despite being treated with eye solution and oral medication, intraocular pressure was not controlled. After 7 days, we performed an intravitreal Bevacizumab 1.25 mg\/0.05mL injection. One day after the intravitreal Bevacizumab injection, the neovascularization had nearly regressed and intraocular pressure was 30 mmHg. Intravitreal Bevacizumab injection produced regression of neovascularization and proved effective for treatment of neovascular glaucoma in this case of ocular ischemic syndrome.","1107":"We report 3 cases of circumscribed choroidal hemangioma (CCH) effectively managed with intravitreal bevacizumab. One patient (case 1) who had recurrent CCH (1.6 mm in thickness) with prior laser photocoagulation was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab alone. Two patients (case 2 and 3) who had CCH (2.4 mm and 2.2 mm in thickness, respectively) with recent visual impairment were treated with bevacizumab followed by photodynamic therapy (PDT). Ophthalmic evaluations included visual acuity, ophthalmoscopic examination, fluorescein angiography, ultrasonography, and optical coherence tomography. Patients were followed up for 6-9 months. After therapy, all patients showed improved visual acuity due to complete resorption of subretinal fluid and macular edema. Ultrasonography demonstrated a reduction of the thickness of CCH in case 1 and complete regression of the lesions in case 2 and 3. No patient showed tumor recurrence. Intravitreal bevacizumab, alone or in combination therapy with PDT, may be a useful alternative for the treatment of symptomatic CCH with subretinal fluid.","1108":"We report a case of serous retinal detachment following combined photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal bevacizumab injection in subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with subfoveal CNV secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and treated with combined PDT and intravitreal bevacizumab injection. One day after treatment, the patient experienced a sudden decline of vision and optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed serous retinal detachment involving the macula. She was managed conservatively with an oral steroid beginning on the second day of the combined treatment and the subretinal fluid started to decrease one week following the initiation of steroids. This case suggests that combined PDT and intravitreal injection of bevacizumab can be associated with serous retinal detachment. Additional studies are needed to establish the safety and complications following this treatment regimen.","1109":"A 46-year-old man presented with visual disturbances in both eyes. His best corrected visual acuity was 0.7 (both eyes). Ptosis and limitation of ocular movement in every direction were observed. Slit lamp examination showed a bilateral iridescent cataract. Fundus examination showed peripheral depigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium and pigmentary clumping in both eyes that agreed with blocked fluorescence and widow defects on fluorescein angiography. The amplitude of b-wave was decreased on electroretinography. Fourteen months later, the patient's best corrected visual acuity decreased to 0.3 due to increased lens opacity. Phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation were performed on both eyes. At the patient's final visit, retinal findings were stable with a best corrected visual acuity of 0.7 in both eyes. In conclusion, the visual disturbance could have been caused by both cataracts and retinal degeneration, meaning the fundus should be examined carefully in patients with myotonic dystrophy.","1110":"The authors report two cases of X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) manifested as bilateral vitreous hemorrhage as early as in an 1-month-old infant and in a 3-month-old infant. The one-month-old male infant showed massive bilateral vitreous hemorrhage. During vitrectomy, thin membrane representing an inner part of schisis cavity was excised and intraschisis hemorrhage was evacuated. As intraschisis cavities were cleared, the stump of inner layer appeared as the demarcation line between the outer layer of the schisis retina and non-schisis retina. The other three-month-old male infant presenting with esodeviation also showed bilateral vitreous hemorrhage. Typical bilateral retinoschisis involving maculae could be seen through vitreous hemorrhage in both eyes on fundus examination. Spontaneous absorption of hemorrhage was observed on regular follow-up. XLRS could be manifested as massive hemorrhage inside or outside of the schisis cavity early in infancy.","1111":"A 37-year-old female, who had received modified radical mastectomy for cancer of her right breast, presented with decreased visual acuity in the left eye after radiation therapy for the management of the metastasis to her right brain 14 months ago. After ocular examination, we diagnosed her as radiation retinopathy. At the time of the first visit, the corrected best visual acuity was 0.4 in the left eye, and fundus examination revealed cotton wool spots and cystoid macular edema (CME). The findings in the right eye were normal except for cotton wool spots in the superior major arch. Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed marked telangiectasia and microaneurysms in her left eye but tiny microaneurysms in her right eye. Subsequent optical coherent tomography (OCT) showed CME. We injected intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Two weeks after treatment, the visual acuity was improved to 0.6 and the retinal thickness was decreased. Three months later, the visual acuity in the left eye was dropped to 0.3 due to the recurrence of CME, so we injected intravitreal TA again. Five months later, visual acuity was improved to 0.5 and OCT revealed the improvement of CME. The incidence of radiation retinopathy is higher in the side nearer to radiation, but careful radiation blocking is also required on the opposite side of irradiation site considering the possibility of radiation retinopathy and careful observation is required on both sides of the eyes when performing fundus examination.","1112":"A case of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (VKH) that developed in a 36-year-old woman with Graves' disease was described. The patient was treated with Lugol's solution and presented with bilateral serous retinal detachment. She had also suffered from methimazole-induced hypersensitivity and steroid-induced myopathy. Fluorescein angiography showed multiple leakage points and a lumbar puncture revealed pleocytosis, which was compatible with VKH. High dose steroid pulse therapy was successful. Altered immune regulation associated with drug-induced hypersensitivity may contribute to the development of VKH in patients with Graves' disease.","1113":"A 48-year-old man presented with visual dimness in the right eye that had developed 2 weeks previously. Dilated fundus examination showed few vitreous cells and numerous yellow, placoid lesions in both eyes. His right eye had more severe serous retinal detachment involving the macula. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated early irregular hypofluorescence with late staining in the areas of the yellow placoid lesions. He started a regimen of 60 mg of oral prednisone daily. Two weeks later, a serologic fluorescent treponemal antigen absorption test was positive for Ig G and Ig M. He was referred to an infectious disease specialist for antibiotic therapy. A week later, he returned, having stayed on prednisone only and not having taken the internist's antibiotic prescription. Meanwhile, the chorioretinitis in his right eye, which had initially been at a more advanced stage, was resolved with the use of steroids. The chorioretinitis in his left eye, which was aggravated at an earlier stage, ultimately recovered. Our case had atypical courses such that one eye improved and the other worsened during the same steroid treatment period. This result was inconsistent with that of previous reports showing that oral steroid influences the clinical course of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis.","1114":"We report a sebaceous carcinoma confined to the corneoscleral limbus without involvement of the eyelid. A 60-year-old man, who showed multiple masses on the corneaoscleral limbus and limbal ulceration but with normal eyelids, underwent surgical en-bloc excision of the masses. Histopathologic examination revealed a sebaceous carcinoma. Three weeks after excision, multiple pagetoid recurrences were found along the bulbar conjunctiva 2 mm away from the limbus. After the application of topical mitomycin C, the pagetoid spread regressed completely. After a 2 year follow-up, no other local or systemic recurrences were observed. This report shows that the ulcerative mass which is confined to only the corneoscleral limbus may be a sebaceous carcinoma even without eyelid involvement. Topical mitomycin C may be effective for treating pagetoid spread of sebaceous carcinoma of limbal origin.","1115":"A 44-year-old man presented with a history of chronic epiphora, discharge from the right eye, and a palpable mass in the medial canthal area. Irrigation of the lacrimal system revealed bloody discharge. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined heterogeneous enhanced mass filling the lacrimal sac and upper nasolacrimal duct (NLD). A wide excision and surgical biopsy were performed. Histopathology showed the tumor to be an exophytic Schneiderian papilloma with moderate to severe dysplasia. Three months later, the mass was found to be invading the nasal cavity through the NLD. Endoscopic histopathological evaluation confirmed that it was identical to the originally identified papilloma.","1116":"To analyze innervated myotendinous cylinders (IMCs) in the extraocular muscles (EOMs) of normal subjects and strabismic patients. The rectus muscles of 37 subjects were analyzed. Distal myotendinous specimens were obtained from 3 normal subjects, 20 patients with acquired strabismus, 11 with infantile strabismus, and from 3 with congenital nystagmus, and were studied by using light microscopy. Some specimens (6 rectus muscles) were also examined by transmission electron microscopy. IMCs were found in the distal myotendinous regions of EOMs. The IMCs of patients with acquired strabismus showed no significant morphological alterations. However, significant IMCs alterations were observed at the distal myotendinous junction of patients with congenital strabismus and congenital nystagmus. This study supports the notion that IMCs in human EOMs function mainly as proprioceptors, along with effector properties, and a disturbance of ocular proprioceptors plays an important role in the pathogenesis of oculomotor disorder. We suggest that a proprioceptive feedback system should be stimulated and calibrated early in life for the development of binocular vision. ","1117":"To investigate the immediate and long-term outcomes of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) implantation with silicone tube ligation and removable external stents. This retrospective non-comparative study investigated the outcomes of AGV implantation with silicone tube ligation and removable external stents in 95 eyes (90 patients) with at least 12 months of postoperative follow-up. Qualified success was defined as an intraocular pressure (IOP) of &lt;or=21 mmHg and &gt;or=6 mmHg regardless of anti-glaucoma medication. Those who required additional glaucoma surgery, implant removal or who had phthisis bulbi were considered failures. Hypotony was defined as an IOP of &lt;6 mmHg. Mean IOP reduced from 37.1+\/-9.7 mmHg preoperatively to 15.2+\/-5.6 mmHg at 12 months postoperatively (p&lt;0.001). Qualified success was achieved in 84.2% at 1 year. Hypotony with an IOP of &lt;6 mmHg was seen in 8.4% and an IOP of &lt;5 mmHg in 3.2% on the first postoperative day. No case of hypotony required surgical intervention. Suprachoroidal hemorrhage did not occur in this study. When stents were removed on the first postoperative day because of an insufficient IOP decrease, the mean IOP decreased significantly from 42.0 mmHg to 14.1 mmHg (p&lt;0.001) after 1 hour. The most common complication was hyphema, which occurred in 17.9%. Hypotony-related early complications requiring surgical intervention were reduced by ligation and external stents in the tube. In addition, early postoperative high IOPs were managed by removing external stents. The described method can prevent postoperative hypotony after AGV implantation and showed long-term success rates comparable to those reported previously. ","1118":"To evaluate the effect of different doses of intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide on diffuse diabetic macular edema. In a retrospective study, 44 eyes with diffuse diabetic macular edema were treated with an intravitreal injection of 4 mg (n=12 eyes), 8 mg (n=17) or 25 mg (n=15) of triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Optical coherence tomography, best-corrected logMAR visual acuity and Goldmann tonometry were performed at baseline, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment. Mean follow-up was 9.8 months (standard deviation=2.3) with a range of 5-12 months. The duration of intravitreal TA effects on macular thickness and visual acuity increased with increasing dosage. An observed increase in intraocular pressure induced by TA was not significantly associated with dosage. In patients with diffuse diabetic macular edema who receive intravitreal TA, effects may last longer after a dosage of 25 mg, than after lower doses of 8 mg or 4 mg. ","1119":"To evaluate the characteristics of fluid accumulation in the uveitic stage of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease using high resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT3). Twenty-eight eyes in 14 patients with VKH disease were reviewed retrospectively. These 28 eyes were divided into 19 eyes with intraretinal fluid (C group) and 9 eyes without intraretinal fluid (N group). Changes in visual acuity and fluid accumulation observed using OCT were compared between the two groups. Visual acuity at the time of presentation was significantly worse in the C group than in the N group (p=0.005). The photoreceptor layer appeared to be double-layered due to a cystoid space in the C group. Layered structures and strands found in the cystoid space. Expanding sponge-form edema led to the development of a cystoid space in the photoreceptor layer. Intraretinal fluid resolved earlier than subretinal fluid. There were no observed differences in visual acuity between the two groups after four days of treatment. Accumulation of intraretinal fluid was related to poor initial visual acuity, but not to final visual acuity. High resolution OCT findings indicate that edema of the photoreceptor layer participates in the development of a cystoid space. ","1120":"To investigate changes in dry eye symptoms and diagnostic test values after cataract surgery and to address factors that might influence those symptoms and test results. Twenty-eight eyes from 14 patients with preoperative dry eye (dry eye group) and 70 eyes from 35 patients without preoperative dry eye (non-dry eye group) were studied prospectively. In each group, we measured values such as tear break-up time (tBUT), Schirmer I test (ST-I), tear meniscus height (TMH), and subjective dry eye symptoms (Sx), and evaluated the postoperative changes in these values. We also evaluated the influence of corneal incision location and shape on these values. The correlations between these values and microscopic light exposure time and phacoemulsification energy were investigated. In the dry eye group, there were significant aggravations in Sx at 2 months postoperatively and in TMH at 3 days, 10 days, 1 month, and 2 months postoperatively, compared with preoperative values. All dry eye test values were significantly worse after cataract surgery in the non-dry eye group. With regard to incision location, there was no difference in tBUT, Sx, ST-I, or TMH in either the dry eye group or the non-dry eye group at any postoperative time point. Regarding incision shape, there was no difference in tBUT, Sx, ST-I or TMH at any postoperative time point in the dry eye group. In the superior incision sub-group of the non-dry eye group, tBUT and Sx were worse in the grooved incision group at day 1. In the temporal incision sub-group of the non-dry eye group, Sx were worse in the grooved incision group at 1 day, 3 days, and 10 days postoperatively. In both groups, significant correlations were noted between microscopic light exposure time and dry eye test values, but no correlation was noted between phacoemulsification energy and dry eye test values. Cataract surgery may lead to dry eye. A grooved incision can aggravate the symptoms during the early postoperative period in patients without dry eye preoperatively. Long microscopic light exposure times can have an adverse effect on dry eye test values. ","1121":"Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) is associated with ocular and systemic anomalies. PITX2 is known to be a major controlling gene in the pathogenesis of ARS and is associated with differentiation in both the neural crest and mesoderm during eye development. A 4-year-old girl with bilateral ARS had 20 prism diopters (PD) of exotropia with 30PD of A- pattern deviation, more than 20PD of dissociated vertical deviation (DVD), and severe superior oblique overaction (SOOA). During surgery we observed that the SO inserted more posteriorly than normal. We believe this finding is one of the abnormal manifestations of the development of the extraocular muscles in ARS.","1122":"The purpose of this case report is to evaluate the visual outcome of an intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection (IVTA) as a treatment for a patient with acute nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). A 65-year-old male patient with severe visual loss due to acute NAION was treated with 4 mg\/0.1 mL IVTA. Fundus examination and measurements of the patient's best-corrected visual acuity and visual field were performed before and after the injection at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. The best-corrected visual acuity changed from 0.05 before the injection to 0.16 at 2 weeks, 0.3 at 1 month, and 0.4 at 3 months and at the final visit. Optic disc swelling had markedly decreased at 1 week postoperatively and disappeared at 2 weeks after the injection. The clinical course of this patient suggests that an IVTA may be effective in increasing visual acuity following an acute NAION. A large randomized controlled trial is needed to assess the efficacy of IVTA as a treatment for NAION.","1123":"A 44-year-old woman who showed recurrent vitreous hemorrhages with vascular tortuosity received CT angiography which revealed an internal carotid artery aneurysm. A case of internal carotid aneurysm was associated with a pattern of retinal arteriolar tortuosity pathognomic for familial retinal arterial tortuosity (fRAT), suggesting possible involvement of the cerebral circulation. We present a case of internal carotid aneurysm associated with a pattern of retinal arteriolar tortuosity pathognomic for fRAT.","1124":"We describe two cases of branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) after carotid artery (CA) stenting. Case 1: A 57-year-old man diagnosed with left neovascular glaucoma was admitted to our department for trabeculectomy (He had complained of decreased visual acuity (VA) in the left eye for a month). A preoperative neck angio CT scan showed bilateral CA stenosis. After CA stenting, he contracted visual defects on the right superior area of his right eye. Upon examination, VA with correction was found to be 1.0 (OD), but right fundoscopy revealed ischemic retina whitening along the inferior temporal arcade. Case 2: A 64-year-old man received left CA stenting for severe stenosis in the Department of Neurology. The next day, he was referred to us for acute onset of a left naso-inferior visual field defect. Upon initial examination, his VA with correction was 0.8\/0.16 (OD\/OS) and fundoscopy revealed ischemic retina whitening at the superior posterior pole in the left eye.It was not necessary to treat the BRAO in these cases because the foveal capillary network was not invaded at 2 month follow ups, VA was preserved in both cases.In conclusion, ophthalmic evaluation is important after CA stenting because of a possible embolic occlusion of the retinal artery.","1125":"Schwannomas rarely present as intraocular tumors and are often misdiagnosed as malignant melanoma. We describe a choroidal schwannoma confirmed by sclerouvectomy. A 30-year-old woman presented with a large nonpigmented intraocular mass of the choroid in the right eye and underwent surgical excision by sclerouvectomy. Histologically, the tumor was composed of a mixture of cellular solid components (Antoni A) and loose myxoid components (Antoni B). The tumor was eventually diagnosed as a schwannoma. Currently available ancillary studies are still of little value in definitively differentiating schwannomas from other choroidal tumors. In the case of atypical findings for a malignant melanoma, a benign neoplasm should be included in the differential diagnosis. This patient avoided enucleation by first having the mass excised. We are unaware of previous reports in which a choroidal schwannoma was diagnosed by surgical excision.","1126":"We describe two patients with fungal keratitis refractory to standard antifungal therapy whose conditions were managed with voriconazole. The first case is a patient with endophthalmitis and corneal ulcer due to Candida parapsilosis after receiving a corneal transplant. The patient was treated with amphotericin but showed no signs of improvement. Topical voriconazole, oral voriconazole, and intravitreal voriconazole yielded signs of improvement. The second case is a 63-year-old male who underwent a month of empiric treatment with 0.2% topical amphotericin for fungal keratitis but showed no signs of improvement. Treatment was then provided with 1% voriconazole. Both cases showed effective treatment with voriconazole. Voriconazole may be considered as a new method to treat fungal keratitis refractory to standard antifungal therapy.","1127":"A 53-year-old woman complaining of vertical diplopia, presented with a localized swelling in the right lower lid. Magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated a relatively well-defined mass in the inferior rectus with similar signal characteristics to the muscle. Excisional biopsy of the mass revealed granular cell tumor composed of S-100 positive cells with acidophilic granular cytoplasm and a peripheral lymphocytic infiltration. Granular cell tumor, which is very rare in the orbit, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of tumors adjacent to or within the extraocular muscles, particularly in the inferior orbit.","1128":"To maximize effective use of mydriatic drugs through comparing the pupillary dilation effects between 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine. Fifty people requiring pupillary dilation were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 was treated with one drop of 1% tropicamide in the right eye and one drop of 2.5% phenylephrine in the left eye. Group 2 was treated twice during a 5-minute interval with 1% tropicamide in the right eye. Group 3 was treated twice during a 5-minute interval with 2.5% phenylephrine in the right eye. Groups 2 and 3 were treated with 2.5% phenylephrine and 1% tropicamide in the left eye, administered during a 5-minute interval. The pupillary size was measured in all groups for 40 minutes following eye drops administration. The mean patient age was 15.7 years. Group 1 included 10 patients, and groups 2 and 3 included 20 patients each. Eight patients in group 1 and 16 patients in group 2 developed a larger right pupil. Fourteen patients in group 3 developed a larger left pupil. Our study showed that 1% tropicamide, with its parasympathetic antagonistic mechanism of action, was more effective at inducing pupillary dilation than 2.5% phenylephrine, and the combination of 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine was more effective than multiple drops of single eye drops. ","1129":"To investigate the relationship between blood pressure (BP) parameters in the habitual position and glaucomatous damage at initial presentation in patients with untreated normal tension glaucoma (NTG). Fifty-four eyes from 54 subjects diagnosed with NTG were consecutively enrolled. BP was measured with an automated ambulatory monitoring device in the habitual position during 24-hour in-hospitalization. Patients were classified into three groups: non-dippers, dippers, and over-dippers. corresponded to the degree of reduction in their nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared with their diurnal MAP. Regression models were used to evaluate potential risk factors, including: age, pre-admission office intraocular pressure (IOP), central corneal thickness (CCT), and BP parameters. Functional outcome variables for glaucomatous damage included mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) on a Humphrey field analyzer (HFA). Anatomic outcome variables were TSNIT score (temporal, superior, nasal, inferior, and temporal) average, superior average, inferior average, and nerve fiber indicator (NFI) score on scanning laser polarimetry with variable corneal compensation (SLP-VCC; GDx-VCC). Marked systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and MAP fluctuation were noted in the over-dipper group (p&lt;0.05). A linear regression analysis model revealed that nocturnal trough DBP and MAP, average nocturnal SBP, and MAP were all significantly associated with a decreased average TSNIT score and an increased NFI score. Nocturnal BP reduction estimated in the habitual position was associated with structural damage in eyes with NTG. This finding may suggest systemic vascular etiology of NTG development associated with nocturnal BP reduction. ","1130":"To compare the intraocular pressures (IOPs) measured by dynamic contour tonometry (DCT) and Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT), and to investigate the association of IOPs on eyes of varying central corneal thickness (CCT). In this prospective study, 451 eyes of 233 subjects were enrolled. IOPs were measured by GAT and DCT. CCT was measured three times and the average was calculated. Each eye was classified into one of three groups according to CCT: low CCT (group A, CCT&lt;520 microm, n=146); normal CCT (group B, 520 microm&lt;or=CT&lt;or=550 microm, n=163); and high CCT (group C, CCT&gt;550 microm, n=142). In each group, we investigated the association of CCT with IOP measurement by GAT and DCT. The IOPs measured by GAT and DCT were significantly associated for all eyes (R=0.853, p&lt;0.001, Pearson correlation). CCT was related with both IOP measurement by GAT and DCT with statistical significance (mixed effect model, p&lt;0.001). However, subgroup analysis showed that CCT affected IOP measured by GAT for groups B and C, whereas it affected IOP measured by DCT only for group C. IOP measured by DCT was not affected by CCT in eyes with low to normal CCT, whereas this measurement was affected in eyes of high CCT range. CCT may have less effect on IOP measurements using DCT than those obtained by GAT, within a specified range of CCT. ","1131":"To examine the effect of panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) on the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Subjects included 118 eyes for a treatment group and 164 eyes for a control group. The peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured before and 6 months after PRP in treatment group. In control group, the peripapillary RNFL thickness was measured at baseline and 6 months later. The relationships between changes in RNFL thickness and the number of laser burns, duration of diabetes, HbA1c level, and vision change were analyzed. After 6 months, the RNFL thickness decreased an average of 2.12 microm and 0.93 microm in the treatment and control groups. However, the changes between the two groups were not statistically significant. The relationship between the number of laser burns and changes in RNFL thickness was not significant. No differences were found between changes in the RNFL thickness and the duration of diabetes in either group. However, in the treatment group a higher HbA1c level was correlated with a greater decrease in post-PRP RNFL thickness. This relationship was not observed in the control group. The difference in the change of the RNFL thickness between the two groups was statistically significant. Vision increased an average of 0.02 and 0.01 after 6 months in the treatment and control groups, respectively. However, this difference was not statistically significant. Although a decrease in peripapillary RNFL thickness was observed in the treatment group after 6 months, it was not statistically significant compared to control group. However, the decrease was greater when the blood HbA1c level was higher. ","1132":"To evaluate the effect of intravitreal bevacizumab on visual function and retinal thickness in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). Thirty eyes of twenty-eight patients (mean age, 57.9+\/-13.8 years) with DME were included in this study. Complete ophthalmic examination, including determination of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), stereoscopic biomicroscopy, and retinal thickness measurement by optical coherence tomography (OCT), was done at baseline and at each follow-up visit. All patients were treated with a 0.05 mL intravitreal injection containing 1.25 mg of bevacizumab. All patients completed 3 months of follow-up with a mean follow-up period of 5.26+\/-2.39 months. The mean BCVA at baseline was 0.73+\/-0.36 logMAR, which significantly improved to 0.63+\/-0.41 (p=0.02), 0.58+\/-0.36 (p=0.003), and 0.61+\/-0.40 logMAR (p=0.006) at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. Final BCVA analysis demonstrated that 15 eyes (50%) remained stable and 12 (40%) improved &gt;or=2 lines on BCVA. The mean central retinal thickness was 498.96+\/-123.99 microm at baseline and decreased to 359.06+\/-105.97 (p&lt;0.001), 334.40+\/-121.76 (p&lt;0.001), 421.40+\/-192.76 microm (p=0.035) at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months. No ocular toxicity or adverse effects were observed. Intravitreal bevacizumab injection resulted in significant improvement in BCVA and central retinal thickness as early as 1 week after injection in patients with DME, and this beneficial effect persisted for up to 3 months. However, the slight reduction in this improvement at 3 months suggests that repeated bevacizumab injections might be necessary. To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy, further prospective randomized controlled clinical trials will be needed.

The medical records of patients who underwent PPV between January 2005 and December 2006 after complicated cataract surgery in which lens material was dropped into the vitreous cavity were reviewed retrospectively. Five eyes of five patients were treated by vitrectomy and removal of the dislocated lens material and were administered an adjuvant intravitreal injection of 4 mg triamcinolone acetonide at the end of surgery. IVTA administration induced a rapid improvement in vision within six weeks postoperatively. Final visual acuity was 20\/32 or better in all patients. Inflammatory cystoid macular edema (CME) that existed preoperatively was promptly improved after IVTA. Intraocular pressure increased transiently in one patient. No procedure-related complications were observed. PPV with additional IVTA was successfully performed in five eyes with retained lens material and resulted in a marked resolution of vitreous inflammation, an improvement in CME and rapid visual recovery. The authors recommend that IVTA administration should be investigated more thoroughly as an adjunct during the management of retained lens material. ","1134":"To evaluate the refractive predictability of a partial coherence interferometry (PCI) biometry device (IOL Master) for cataract surgery and to investigate factors that may affect it. Retrospective review of 209 eyes from 151 patients that had undergone preoperative PCI biometry and an uneventful phacoemulsification cataract surgery with posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation was conducted. Prediction error defined as the intended refraction minus the postoperative refraction in spherical equivalent (SE) and the absolute error were analyzed according to IOL calculation formulas, patient characteristics, preoperative visual acuity (VA) and refraction, posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and axial length (AL). The overall refractive predictability of the PCI device was good. Generally, the SRK\/T formula performed better than the SRK-II formula. Refractive predictability was slightly worse in eyes with &gt;or=+2.0 diopters (D) of preoperative SE (with both SRK-II and SRK\/T) and in eyes with an AL&lt;or=23.0 mm (only with SRK-II. No other factors significantly affected the refractive predictability of the PCI, although poor VA, dense PSC, and poor SNR were closely interrelated. The SRK\/T formula performed significantly better than the SRK-II formula. Eyes with an AL&lt;or=23.0 mm were associated with significantly greater hyperopic shifts in postoperative refraction with the SRK-II formula, but not with the SRK\/T formula. A preoperative SE&gt;or=+2.0D was related to a significantly greater hyperopic shift in postoperative refraction. With proper verification of measured data and a suitable IOL calculation formula, good refractive predictability is expected from PCI biometry regardless of patient characteristics, preoperative VA, SNR, PSC, and AL.

A 66-year-old male visited our ophthalmology department because of decreased visual acuity in his left eye 6 months after he suffered ocular trauma while mowing. He had not been treated because he did not experience any discomfort. His corrected visual acuity was 0.4. Central corneal opacity, an intralenticular metallic foreign body, and an intact posterior capsule were observed on slit lamp examination. Phacoemulsification with posterior chamber lens implantation and simultaneous removal of the intralenticular foreign body was performed. Seventeen days after the operation, his corrected visual acuity was 1.0, the intraocular lens was well-seated, and there was no intraocular inflammation. In this case report, a patient was found to have an intralenticular metallic foreign body retained for 6 months. During this time he did not experience any ocular dysfunction due to the foreign body. Mowing accidents are common in Korea. Despite the absence of symptoms, patients reporting a history of lawn mowing should be thoroughly examined.","1138":"We report four cases in which a pericardium (Tutoplast) plug was used to repair a corneoscleral fistula after Ahmed Glaucoma Valve (AGV) explantation. In four cases in which the AGV tube had been exposed, AGV explantation was performed using a pericardium (Tutoplast) plug to seal the defect previously occupied by the tube. After debridement of the fistula, a piece of processed pericardium (Tutoplast), measured 1 mm in width, was plugged into the fistula and secured with two interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. To control intraocular pressure, a new AGV was implanted elsewhere in case 1, phaco-trabeculectomy was performed concurrently in case 2, cyclophotocoagulation was performed postoperatively in case 3 and anti-glaucomatous medication was added in case 4. No complication related to the fistula developed at the latest follow-up (range: 12-26 months).

A 6-year-old boy was treated for a 6.0 mm fluid-filled cyst in the anterior chamber of the right eye. Thirteen months previously, he had undergone primary closure of a 6 mm full-thickness corneal laceration. The subsequent cyst was diagnosed as an epithelial inclusion cyst of the iris. His vision decreased to finger-count at 30 cm as the cyst grew over the pupil. We performed needle aspiration of the cyst and Ab externo laser photocoagulation of the cyst wall. The treated lesion was completely removed. The patient's visual acuity recovered to 20\/40 without complications.

Four previously healthy patients were evaluated for unilateral upper eyelid retraction following periorbital trauma. A 31-year-old man (Case 1) and a 24-year-old man (Case 2) presented with left upper eyelid retraction which developed after blow-out fractures, a 44-year-old woman (Case 3) presented with left upper eyelid retraction secondary to a periorbital contusion that occurred one week prior, and a 56-year-old man (Case 4) presented with left upper eyelid retraction that developed 1 month after a lower canalicular laceration was sustained during a traffic accident. The authors performed a thyroid function test and orbital computed tomography (CT) in all cases. Thyroid function was normal in all patients, CT showed an adhesion of the superior rectus muscle and superior oblique muscle in the first case and diffuse thickening of the superior rectus muscle and levator complex in the third case. CT showed no specific findings in the second or fourth cases. Upper eyelid retraction due to superior complex adhesion can be considered one of the complications of periorbital trauma.","1142":"This study was conducted to investigate the role of the pattern visual evoked potential (pVEP) as a predictor of occlusion therapy for patients with strabismic, anisometropic, and isometropic amblyopia. The secondary aim was to compare the characteristics of pVEP between strabismic and anisometropic amblyopia. This retrospective comparative case series included 120 patients who had received occlusion therapy or a glasses prescription for correction of strabismic, anisometropic, and isometropic amblyopia (20 patients had strabismic amblyopia, 41 patients had anisometropic amblyopia, and 59 patients had isometropic amblyopia). For each patient, the value of the P100 latency on pVEP at the time of the initial diagnosis of amblyopia was collected. Subsequently, the P100 latency was compared according to types of amblyopia. Fifty of 120 patients (7 patients with strabismic amblyopia, 21 patients with anisometropic amblyopia, and 22 patients with isometropic amblyopia) who were followed-up for longer than 6 months were divided into two groups based on the value of their P100 latency (Group 1, P100 latency 120 msec or less; Group 2, P100 latency longer than 120 msec.) The amount of visual improvement after occlusion therapy or glasses was compared between two study groups. The mean P100 latency was 119.7+\/-25.2 msec in eyes with strabismic amblyopia and 111.9+\/-17.8 msec in eyes with non-strabismic (anisometropic or isometropic) amblyopia (p=0.213).

The P100 latency on pVEP at the time of initial diagnosis was significantly related to the visual improvement after occlusion therapy or glasses in patients with strabismic, anisometropic, and isometropic amblyopia. Therefore, it was presumed that patients with a delayed P100 latency might have less visual improvement after occlusion therapy or glasses. In addition, there was no apparent difference in P100 latency between patients with strabismic and non-strabismic (anisometropic or isometropic) amblyopia.

Thirty four patients who underwent recession and resection (R&amp;R) were divided into two groups: atracurium usage (group A, n=18) and no atracurium usage (group B, n=16). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to the amount of resection of the medial rectus (MR): less than 5 mm (group 1, n=13) or 5 mm and greater (group 2, n=21). Deviation angles were compared between groups and subgroups. Surgical outcome was defined as successful if distant deviation angles were equal to or less than 10 prism diopters. The overall postoperative deviation angles did not show statistically significant differences between groups A and B. However, in patients with larger MR resections (&gt; or = 5 mm), the 1 week postoperative distant deviation was significantly larger in group A (1.8+\/-2.6 PD) than in group B (-1.6+\/-4.6 PD, p=0.048 by t-test). The overall undercorrection rate at 3 months postoperatively for group A was 16.7%, which was higher than that of group B (6.3%), and the difference was even larger in subgroups with larger MR resections (&gt; or = 5 mm): 18.2% in group A and 0% in group B. Patients who underwent R&amp;R procedures under general anesthesia with a muscle relaxant tended to be less corrected than those without muscle relaxant, especially in the early postoperative period and with a larger MR resection equal to or greater than 5 mm.

Prospective cross-sectional comparative case series. A total of 162 eyes of 81 healthy volunteers with normal open angle were included in this study. Anterior chamber angle (ACA) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were measured with PTC and AOCT. Intra-observer variability and inter-methods agreement of both instruments for ACA and ACD were evaluated. Values of temporal and nasal ACA measured by two instruments were similar, and the results of ACD were also not significantly different between modalities (p &gt; 0.01). ACA and ACD measurements by PTC and AOCT showed good intra-observer and inter-method agreements (all &gt; 0.9). PTC and AOCT are presumed to be very useful for the anterior chamber angle examination.

Normal, NTG and HTG subjects who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were evaluated retrospectively. One hundred seventy eyes of 170 patients (30 normal, 40 NTG, and 100 HTG) were enrolled. Complete ophthalmologic examination, HRT, OCT, and automated perimetry were evaluated. Disc area, cup area and cup\/disc area ratio measured with HRT were significantly different between NTG and HTG (all p &lt; 0.05). Mean RNFL thickness measured by OCT with ascanning diameter of 3.4 mm was larger in NTG than HTG (84.97+\/-24.20 micrometer vs. 73.53+\/-27.17 micrometer, p = 0.037). Four quadrant RNFL thickness measurements were not significantly different between NTG and HTG (all p &gt; 0.05). Mean deviation and corrected pattern standard deviation measured by automated perimetry was significantly correlated with mean and inferior RNFL thickness in both NTG and HTG (Pearson's r, p &lt; 0.05). Mean RNFL thickness\/disc area ratio was significantly larger in HTG than NTG (35.21+\/-18.92 vs. 31.30+\/-10.91, p = 0.004).

A review of medical records was performed for 52 eyes that had undergone an IOL exchange due to IOL opacification. Surgical complications and their incidences were analyzed. The mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after the IOL exchange was compared with the mean pre-exchange BCVA and with the mean BCVA after the initial IOL implantation. Prediction error of refraction and biometric data obtained for the IOL exchange were, if available, compared with those obtained for the initial IOL implantation. The prediction error for the IOL exchange, calculated from the biometric data obtained before the IOL exchange, was compared with that calculated from the measurements obtained before the initial IOL implantation. The overall complication rates were low and no serious complications were found. The mean BCVA improved significantly after the IOL exchange and was not significantly different from that obtained after the initial IOL implantation. However, the refractive prediction for the IOL exchange was not as good as it was for the initial IOL implantation, which was thought to be related with difficulties in axial length (AL) measurements. Biometric data taken before the initial IOL implantation was associated with a significantly better refractive prediction than those taken before the IOL exchange. IOL exchange was both efficacious and safe for visual recovery. However, IOL exchange was related with increased difficulty of predicting postoperative refraction; difficulties in AL measurements are the suggested cause.

Clinical features and all possible causes were investigated including irrigating solutions or drugs, surgical instruments or intraocular lenses, sterilization techniques for instruments, or any other accompanying disease. The patients consisted of 2 males and 13 females with an average age of 64.7+\/-10.9 years. Five different surgeons had performed their phaco surgeries. No abnormal preoperative or operative findings were reported. Nevertheless, all 15 patients developed a moderate degree of corneal edema. Ordinary treatments were not helpful. We suspect that lack of sterilization resulted in the development of the syndrome, because after ethylene oxide gas sterilization was replaced with autoclaving, no such incidents have occurred. Toxic anterior segment syndrome requires special attention and thorough management, including sterilization of reused surgical instruments. ","1148":"To compare the predicted and actual refractive errors of hydrophilic, one-piece, C-flex 570C (C-flex) intraocular lens (IOL) implantation in simultaneous vitrectomy and lens extraction in various conditions. One hundred fifty-nine eyes of patients who had lens extraction between March 2004 and September 2005 were enrolled in a retrospective study. Group 1 had lens extraction and IOL implantation, and Group 2 had lens extraction and IOL implantation with vitrectomy. IOL calculation was done with axial length and keratometry measurements. The actual and predicted refractive errors were compared at 1 and 6 months postoperatively. The factors influencing the postoperative refractive outcomes were analyzed. The mean refractive predictive error (i.e., the actual minus predicted spherical equivalent) was +0.19+\/-0.39 D (Diopter) and -0.26+\/-0.45 D at 1 and 6 months postoperatively (all: p&lt;0.001) in group 1, and -0.22+\/-0.39 D and -0.06+\/-0.62 D at 1 and 6 months postoperatively (p=0.013, p=0.399 respectively). In group 2, all surgical factors related to refractive errors were not statistically significant (all: p&gt;0.05). Refractive errors in combined surgery showed myopic shift of -0.50 D and -0.32 D at 1 and 6 months postoperatively compared with C-flex IOL implantation alone. With the hyperopic tendency of IOL and myopic tendency of vitrectomy, the combined surgery made postoperative refractive errors near emmetropia. ","1149":"To compare and evaluate the total and internal aberrations measured by two aberrometers: the laser ray tracing aberrometer (iTrace, Tracey Technology) and the automatic retinoscope aberrometer (OPD Scan, Nidek). A total of 54 healthy eyes were enrolled in the study. Following pupil dilation, aberrations were measured with the iTrace and OPD Scan. We compared the aberrations obtained from measurements obtained at pupillary diameters of 4 mm and 6 mm with the OPD Scan and iTrace. Aberrations of internal optics and total aberrations were compared for the two aberrometers. For each aberrometer and each eye, the averaged Zernike data were used to calculate various root-mean-square (RMS) data. These parameters, together with the refractive parameters, were then analyzed and complimented by paired t-tests. At a pupil diameter of 4 mm, the number of total aberrations in the entire eye showed significant differences for the mean values of spherical aberrations (Z4,0) obtained with the OPD Scan and iTrace aberrometers (p=0.001). Aberrations of the internal optics showed significant differences in the mean values of total RMS, coma (Z3,-1), and trefoil (Z3,3) between the iTrace and OPD Scan (p&lt;0.001, p=0.01, p&lt;0.001) for the same pupil diameter of 4 mm. At a pupil diameter of 6 mm, the two instruments showed a similar number of total aberrations. Aberrations of the internal optics showed significant differences in the mean values of total RMS, spherical aberration (Z4,0), and coma (Z3,-1) between the two devices (p&lt;0.001, p=0.01, p&lt;0.001). The iTrace and OPD Scan showed the largest number of differences for aberrations of internal optics rather than total aberrations for both pupil diameters. These results suggest that in healthy eyes, the two aberrometers may vary in some details. The aberrometers showed more agreement at a pupil diameter of 6 mm compared to 4 mm.

In our experimental model analyzing the stability of acrylic haptics, we confirmed that the IOL could be in counterpoise without tilt using only a two-point fixation. This new surgical technique was performed in seven patients. The unique haptic design allows easy and secure suture fixation. The clinical outcomes were encouraging. It is conceivable that better stabilization can be achieved by the broad arc of distal haptic-tissue contact, in addition to suture fixation, using our surgical technique with the C-flex IOL. ","1151":"We report a rare case of oculomotor nerve palsy and choroidal tuberculous granuloma associated with tuberculous meningoencephalitis. A 15-year-old male visited our hospital for an acute drop of the left eyelid and diplopia. He has been on anti-tuberculous drugs (isoniazid, rifampin) for 1 year for his tuberculous encephalitis. A neurological examination revealed a conscious clear patient with isolated left oculomotor nerve palsy, which manifested as ptosis, and a fundus examination revealed choroidal tuberculoma. Other anti-tuberculous drugs (pyrazinamide, ethambutol) and a steroid (dexamethasone) were added. After 3 months on this medication, ptosis of the left upper eyelid improved and the choroidal tuberculoma decreasedin size, but a right homonymous visual field defect remained. When a patient with tuberculous meningitis presents with abrupt onset oculomotor nerve palsy, rapid re-diagnosis should be undertaken and proper treatment initiated, because the prognosis is critically dependent on the timing of adequate treatment.","1152":"A 36-year old female with acute myelogenous leukemia presented with a sudden decrease in vision one month following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). She had been taking multiple immunosuppressants to treat her recently-developed graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Visual acuity was 20\/60 in her right eye and 20\/25 in her left. Ophthalmic examination revealed mild inflammatory reaction in both the anterior chamber and the vitreous of both eyes, as well as densely opaque yellow-white infiltrates with well-demarcated borders in the posterior retina of both eyes. She was originally diagnosed as CMV retinitis, but treatment with ganciclovir failed to improve her ocular condition. Subsequent work-up, including serology and brain MRI, led to a diagnosis of combined ocular and cerebral toxoplasmosis. After 6 weeks of antiparasitic therapy, her retinal lesions became inactive and her cerebral lesions improved. Immunosuppressed patients with necrotizing retinochoroiditis should be suspected of having toxoplasmosis. Accurate differentiation between this condition and CMV, and early intervention with the appropriate treatment may be critical to preserve the best vision.","1153":"We report the clinical course of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in a patient with drusenoid pigment epithelium detachment (PED). A patient with drusenoid PED underwent PDT follow-up was carried out at one week, one month, three months, six months and one year after treatment. Fundus exam, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography were performed. After the PDT, drusen and PED were gradually diminished over one year. However, pure serous PED eventually developed at the same location of the drusenoid PED. The results of the PDT, on drusenoid PED, were initially effective, but not completely successful. Therefore, PDT may be considered as an alternative treatment option for drusenoid PED.","1154":"A 47 year old male patient visited our hospital with the chief complaint of deterioration of the visual acuity in the left eye. The fundus examination revealed thick hard exudates, multiple aneurysms and telangiectasias of the retinal vessels in the posterior pole. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated massive leakage over an area of the aneurysms. Optical coherence tomography (Stratus OCT; Zeiss-Humphrey, Dubin, CA) revealed diffuse and marked thickening of the retina. Laser photocoagulation was performed under the diagnosis of Coats' disease. However, the treatment could not be performed satisfactorily. On the first and 6th weeks, an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and triamcinolone acetonide was administered, and laser photocoagulation was again attempted. The effectiveness of eachagent on retinal edema was evaluated at the follow-up performed at 1, 2, 5, 7, 10 weeks and 6 months after the injection. At one week after the intravitreal bevacizumab injection, there was no improvement. An intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide was performed 6 weeks after the initial diagnosis,which resulted in a reduction in the thickness of the macular edema. Therefore, laser photocoagulation was performed sufficiently on telangiectasias. The follow-up at 6 months showed a relative increase in the macular edema, but there was reduced leakage from the telangiectasias compared with the previous angiograph.","1155":"To report a single case of improvement on choroidal metastasis of breast cancer after laser photocoagulation. A 52-year-old female patient who complained of visual disturbance of the right eye with multiple states of metastasis of breast carcinoma. On initial examination, the right best-corrected visual acuity was 0.63. Right fundoscopy revealed an elevated mass-like lesion temporal to the macule with serous retinal detachment. The mass had a 3.5-disc diameter. A right fluorescein angiogram revealed hypofluorescence during the prearterial and arteriovenous phase and hyperfluorescence during the venous phase. The venous phase showed almost total masking of background choroidal fluorescence at the elevated lesion because of leakage and neovascularization. The patient was treated 4 times by diode laser photocoagulation in addition to chemotherapy. Fifty days after the diode laser treatments, the funduscopy examination and fluorescein angiogram revealed that the serous retinal detachment had been absorbed, the choroid had become flat, the lesion had been reduced in size and hyperfluorescence. The right best-corrected visual acuity was improved to 0.8. Laser photocoagulation appears not to cause any problems for the patient and may be an efficient treatment for patients with choroidal breast carcinoma.","1156":"To evaluate the protective effects of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) against UV irradiation of cultured human lens epithelial cells. We irradiated cultured human lens epithelial cells with a 30-second pulse from a UV lamp with an irradiance of 0.6 mW\/cm2. Five minutes and 1 hour after UV irradiation, we administered 0, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, or 100 uM EGCG. The cell number was measured with a microscopic counting chamber and cell viability was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Compared to untreated cells, the total number of cultured human lens epithelial cells was markedly higher after UV irradiation. In a dose-dependent manner, viability was also higher in EGCG-treated cells. EGCG increased the cell count and cell viability after UV irradiation of cultured human lens epithelial cells, indicating that EGCG can protect lens epithelium against UV damage. ","1157":"The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical course of esodeviation after exotropia surgery in older patients (older than 15 years) and to compare it with that in younger patients (15 years or younger). The medical records of all surgeries for exodeviation from December 2004 to February 2007 were reviewed and 82 patients were found with consecutive esodeviation. The patients were divided into two groups according to their age: Group A (patients older than 15 years) and Group B (patients age 15 or younger). The clinical course of esodeviation in Group A was compared to that in Group B by means of survival analysis. The median survival times of the esodeviation were 2.0+\/-0.1 months in Group A and 1.0+\/-0.1 months in Group B (p=0.40). The prevalence of consecutive esotropia at six months was 0% in Group A and 6.1% in Group B (p=0.32). The myopic refractive error, worse sensory condition, and a larger preoperative exodeviation in Group A did not affect the clinical course of the two groups differently. The postoperative esodeviation of patients older than 15 years after exotropia surgery tended to persist longer during the early postoperative period than that of patients 15 years or younger, however, the difference did not persist at postoperative six months. ","1158":"To investigate the effect of unilateral medial rectus muscle resection for recurrent exotropia after bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession for intermittent exotropia A retrospective analysis was made of thirtypatients who underwent unilateral medial rectus resection for recurrent exotropia. All had prior bilateral lateral rectus recession for intermittent exotropia. Data were collected for age, the preoperative deviation, the postoperative deviation at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and the last visit, and the amount of medial rectus resection performed. The average preoperative deviation was 27.0+\/-3.6 PD. After unilateral medial rectus resection, average deviation at distance was 2.8 PD at postoperative 2 weeks, 4.5 PD at 3 months, 5.1 PD at 6 months and 5.8 PD at last visit. The average deviation corrected per millimeter of medial rectus resection was 3.53+\/-0.17 PD\/mm. Considering that deviation angles of recurrent exotropia is smaller than those of primary surgery and the possibility of saving the other medial rectus muscle, unilateral rectus muscle resection could be effective surgical method for recurrent exotropia. ","1159":"To evaluate the usefulness of OCT retinal mapping in determining the configuration of a vitreomacular adhesion and selecting a meridian for entry into the subhyaloid space in patients with vitreomacular traction syndrome. Six consecutive patients (6 eyes) with vitreomacular traction syndrome underwent vitrectomy with peeling of posterior hyaloid. Ocular coherence tomography (OCT) retinal mapping was performed preoperatively. Access to the subhyaloid space was made by creating an opening with a 25 gauge needle at a location where the detached posterior hyaloid membrane was farthest from the retinal surface. The location was selected based on six preoperative meridional OCT scans. The posterior hyaloid was then gently peeled off in a circular fashion around the fovea with a micropick. Visual acuity and foveal thicknesses were measured before the operation and 3 months afterwards. After the operation, visual acuity improved and central macular thicknesses were reduced significantly in all six patients. The best corrected visual acuity improved from 0.4 to 0.75 with a mean increase by 3.5 lines on a Snellen chart 3 months after the operation. The mean foveal thickness was reduced from 406 micrometer to 241 micrometer. The restoration of foveal pit was observed in five patients. Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications were observed during the follow up period. An OCT retinal mapping program is a valuable diagnostic tool in understanding the configuration of vitreomacular adhesion and planning the surgical approach for operating on vitreomacular traction syndrome. ","1160":"To compare changes of anterior corneal aberration (Pentacam) and ocular aberration (aberrometer, LADARWave) after laser refractive surgery. Sixty-six eyes underwent laser refractive surgery and were retrospectively reviewed. Anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration were measured by Pentacam and an aberrometer (LADARWave) respectively. Changes of root mean square (RMS) values of coma, spherical aberration, and total high order aberration (HOA) were evaluated before, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery Ocular aberrations displayed low preoperative values, but after laser refractive surgery, anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration increased equally. There were no statistically significant differences of internal optics aberration values (ocular aberration minus anterior corneal aberration) in coma, spherical aberration, and total HOA. Anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration showed statistically significant correlations at 1 and 3 months after surgery. Internal optics aberration compensated the anterior corneal aberration effectively before surgery, but the increase of anterior corneal aberration after laser refractive surgery exceeded the compensation of internal optics. As a result, anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration increased equally. The correlation between anterior corneal aberration and ocular aberration after surgery was statistically significant due to the increased proportion of anterior corneal aberration in ocular aberration.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 106 patients who had undergone Nd:YAG laser or surgical synechiolysis between January 2002 and December 2007 in our clinic. Laser synechiolysis was performed in the synechiae not exceeding the extent of one clock hour and reaching only to the iris sphincter, whereas surgical synechiolysis was performed in other diffuse and\/or thick synechiae. Surgical synechiolysis was performed in 93 eyes, and YAG laser synechiolysis was done in 21 eyes. Increases in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were observed in 61 eyes (53.51%). Intraocular pressure spikes after the procedure were present in only 4 eyes, and all of them were transient except for 1 eye, which needed additional glaucoma eyedrops. With suitable indications, laser or surgical synechiolysis can be performed safely, and a small rise in visual acuity may also be expected.

Cataract surgery using AquaLase was performed on 47 eyes. With a Scheimpflug camera, the density and thickness of lens were measured in eye of each patient preoperatively. During surgery, liquefaction time and total number of pulses were recorded. The correlation of both density and thickness of lens with liquefaction time and total number of pulses was analyzed. The mean density of anterior cortex, nucleus, and posterior cortex was 112.45+\/-42.1 computer compatible tapes (CCT), 76.5+\/-22.7 CCT, and 70.9+\/-52.2 CCT, respectively. The mean thickness was 0.97+\/-0.30 mm, 2.76+\/-0.54 mm, and 0.81+\/-0.24 mm, respectively. The mean liquefaction time was 174.8+\/-108.2 seconds. The mean total number of pulses was 4799+\/-3007. There was no significant difference between the density of each area of lens (anterior cortex, nucleus, posterior cortex, and total lens) and liquefaction time (p&gt;0.05), and between the thickness of each area of lens and liquefaction time (p&gt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the density of each area of lens and total number of pulses (p&gt;0.05), and between the thickness of each area of lens and total number of pulses (p&gt;0.05).

Thirty-six eyes in 34 patients were reviewed with nasal primary pterygium who were treated with pterygium excision with superior conjunctivolimbal transplantation with fibrin bioadhesive. Surgical durations were recorded and the patients were followed up on the first day after surgery and then at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postoperatively. The graft-recipient site attachments were examined and subjective symptoms of patients were recorded at every follow-up examinations. The mean patient age was 57.9+\/-10.1 (ranging from 33 to 83) years. The mean follow-up period was 22.05+\/-5.78 weeks. The mean surgery time was 18.04+\/-5.65 minutes. The subjective symptoms (pain, foreign body sensation, tearing and discomfort) disappeared in 23 of 36 eyes (64%) in one week after surgery, and all discomforts subsided within two weeks after surgery in all patients. The conjunctivolimbal autograft was correctly positioned and fixed in 34 of 36 eyes (94.4%) throughout the follow-up period. Graft dehiscence was seen in two eyes (5.6%), one eye was treated with remedial sutures, and the other eye showed a spontaneous healing without remedial sutures. Transient graft edema occurred in four eyes (11.2%) but subsided spontaneously within a month. There were no cases of pterygium regrowth or complications due to the fibrin bioadhesive. The use of fibrin bioadhesive in conjunctivolimbal autograft surgery in primary pterygium simplifies surgical techniques, shorten surgical duration, and produce less postoperative subjective symptoms .

Serial OCT scans of three eyes in which visual acuity continued to improve for 1 or more years after successful macular hole surgery were reviewed. Case 1. At postoperative four weeks, visual acuity was 20\/100 with disorganized photoreceptor layer on OCT. The photoreceptor layer had been reorganized and visual acuity had improved to 20\/25 by 1 year. Case 2. Two weeks after the operation, visual acuity was 20\/125 and disorganization of the photoreceptor layer was noted. Visual acuity improved to 20\/50 by four months. The photoreceptor layer had been partly reorganized and had appearance of a broken line. Visual acuity had improved to 20\/40 and the photoreceptor layer had been reorganized further with a residual defect on OCT by 15 months. Case 3. Visual acuity at two weeks was 20\/100. OCT revealed disorganization of the photoreceptor layer. Six months after the operation, the partly reorganized photoreceptor layer appeared as a broken line and visual acuity had reached 20\/80. Visual acuity had improved further to 20\/40 by 1 year, concurrent with improved organization of the photoreceptor layer.

A 71-year-old woman presented with a sudden decrease in vision in the right eye, seven days after a total knee replacement arthroplasty. The patient's history was unremarkable except for a severe pain greater than the visual analog scale of 8 points for about 2 days after surgery. Retinal examination showed a well differentiated serous detachment that was about 3.5 disc diameter in size and located in the macular area. Fluorecein angiography and indocyanine green angiography showed delayed perfusion of the choriocapillaris without leakage points in the early phase and persistent hypofluorescence with pooling of dye in the subretinal space in the late phase. There was a spontaneous resolution of the serous detachment and the choroidal changes with residual pigment epithelial changes. Severe postoperative pain may influence the sympathetic activity and introduce an ischemic injury with a focal, choroidal vascular compromise and secondary dysfunction of overlying RPE cells in select patients.","1168":"We report a case of recurrent occlusion of laser iridotomy (LI) sites after a Visian ICL (Implantable contact lens version 4, Staar Surgical AG, Nidau, Switzerland) implantation. A 45-year-old woman had bilateral ICL implantation after placement of two peripheral LI sites in each eye to prevent pupillary block. At one month after the operation, severe narrowing or occlusion of four LI sites occurred. After this, although she received four additional LIs at postoperative months 1, 6, 9 and 10 in both eyes, the narrowing or occlusion recurred. Mild chronic anterior chamber inflammation was observed intermittently throughout the follow-up period. We performed clear lens extraction in both eyes (at postoperative month 11 in the left eye and month 26 in the right eye) due to recurrent occlusion of the LI sites and excess trabecular meshwork pigment deposition presumably caused by the four repeated LIs. Recurrent obstruction of LI sites can occur after ICL implantation. These problems were unresolvable despite four repeated laser iridotomies. The risks associated with anterior uveitis must be considered when planning an ICL implantation.","1169":"To investigate the short-term efficacy of topical immunosuppressive agents on the survival of cultivated allo-conjunctival equivalents. Twenty-five eyes of New Zealand white rabbits were included. Temporal conjunctivae were trephined to a diameter of 7.5 mm, and then cultured allo-conjunctival epithelial cells on amniotic membrane were transplanted onto them. Various immunosuppressants including steroid, cyclosporine, and rapamycin were applied topically four times a day for a week. Epithelial defects and graft edema were graded daily. Numbers of inflammatory cells were measured in H&amp;E. PKH26 and cytokeratin 4 and 7 were immunostained. Earlier epithelialization was observed in 1% steroid-treated eyes and defects persisted significantly in 0.5% CsA applied eyes. In histology, PKH26 positive cells considered as donor cells were only found in 1% steroid or 0.01% rapamycin applied eyes. 1% steroid- or 0.01% rapamycin-applied eyes both showed positive staining for keratin-4 and -7.

One hundred two eyes of 51 children (age range 4 to 15 years) were measured using OCT including the RNFLT. For the ODA and the OD-CS, the relative area formed by the ODA and the circular scan was obtained. In addition, the correlation of the refractive error and the axial length to the optic disc factors was assessed. As hyperopia progresses to myopia, the axial length became longer, the ODA became smaller (r=-0.442, p=0.000) and the OD-CS showed a tendency to increase (r=0.471, p=0.000). As the OD-CS became longer, the measured average RNFLT decreased significantly (r=-0.248, p=0.012), and the ODA and the OD-CS showed a significant correlation to the RNFL thickness that was measured in the nasal and inferior areas, the S2, N2 and N3 areas and the I1 area. As ODA becomes smaller and the OD-CS becomes longer, the RNFLT measured in the nasal and inferior areas, the S2, N2, N3, I1 area has a tendency to be thinner. Hence, consideration of the disc area is required when interpreting the RNFLT of these eyes.

Previously reported risk factors for CD in RRD patients include high myopia, aphakia, pseudophakia, and advanced age. However, macular hole has not been discussed as an important factor in increasing the risk of CD in RRD patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate macular hole as a risk factor for CD in eyes evidencing RRD. The medical records of 480 patients with primary RRD were reviewed. We compared the CD incidence among the RRD patients in accordance with the presence or absence of macular holes. The relationship between gender, age, presence of systemic disease, refractive errors, lens status, intraocular pressure and the development of CD were also analyzed. The incidence (4\/21 eyes, 19.0%) of CD in the RRD with macular hole was significantly higher than that (7\/459 eyes, 1.5%) observed in the RRD without macular hole (p=0.010). The preoperative intraocular pressure (mean+\/-SD; 2.5+\/-1.3 mmHg) in the RRD with CD and macular hole was significantly lower than that (7.4+\/-4.4 mmHg) observed in the cases of RRD with CD without macular hole (p=0.035). The eyes complicated by CD evidenced a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (p=0.024) than was observed in the eyes without CD.

Intravitreal bevacizumab was repeated at 6-week intervals until the regression of active lesion was detected on fluorescein angiography (FA) which was done on a regular basis, Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) analyses. Intravitreal bevacizumab was given alone in 8 eyes (Group 1) and in combination with PDT in 4 eyes (Group 2). Mean follow-up duration was 17 weeks in group 1 and 15 weeks in group 2 after bevacizumab treatment. The mean number of bevacizumab injections was 2.2 in group 1 and 2.5 in group 2. Mean BCVA improved from 20\/63 to 20\/40 in group 1 and 20\/63 to 20\/32 in group 2.

Partial or complete regression of the polypoidal vessels and interconnecting vessels was reported for most cases at the last follow-up. No significant ocular or systemic side effects were observed in both groups. Short-term results indicate that intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg) alone or in combination with PDT is well tolerated and associated with improvement in BCVA and reduced angiographic leakage in most patients.

The demographic data, surgical technique, post-operative complications, and final visual prognosis were evaluated. The average age at surgery was 3.17 years (range 1 month to 11 years), and the mean follow-up was 40.02 months (range 6 to 46 months). Of the 56 eyes that could be checked for visual acuity after cataract extraction, 29 (51.7%) had a BCVA of &gt; or = 0.5 at last visit. Unilateral congenital cataracts (p=0.025) and congenital cataracts with strabismus (p=0.019) showed significantly poorer visual outcomes. Patients with nystagmus also experienced a poor visual outcome; 6 patients (67%) had a BCVA of &lt;0.1. Posterior cataracts had the worst visual prognosis (p=0.004). No statistically significant differences in posterior capsular opacity (p=0.901) or synechia formation (p=0.449) were observed between surgical techniques, but children younger than one year showed a higher tendency for PCO and synechia formation.

We investigated the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of APC in Koreans. The evaluation on the prevalence of APC in comparison to the other age-related cataracts was performed on the 2,108 cataract patients who were treated at 5 different areas in Korea from August 2003 to December 2003. The demographic characteristics of APC were studied on the, 656 cataract patients who were treated from January 2004 to January 2005 at one hospital. These patients were classified according to the type of lens opacity (nuclear, cortical, posterior subcapsular, mixed and APC). The prevalence of patients with APC among all the cataract patients was 6.02% during the 5 months in this hospital-based study. Eighty-seven per cent of patients with APC were male. In contrast, the proportion of female was greater than 50% in the other cataracts. The mean age of APC patients was 52.7 years. Among the APC patients, 38.9% were under 50 years of age, 42.6% in their 50s, 14.8% in their 60s, and 3.7% were in their 70s. However, 80% of patients were over the age of 60 years in nuclear, cortical, and mixed-type cataracts. The prevalence of APC among all cataracts was high in comparison with another country. The proportion of APC was high in individuals younger than 60 years of age, and in males.

Twenty-seven eyes with lower canalicular lacerations as a result of trauma were involved in the study. Surgery was performed within 48 hours after injury for canalicular reconstruction. Upper canalicular probing was utilized to identify the medial cut end of deep canalicular lacerations when difficulties were encountered. Total time from the initiation of the probing procedure to the identification of the medial cut end of the lower canaliculus was measured. A total of 27 eyes with lower canalicular lacerations were reconstructed. In 20 eyes, the medial lacerated end was located by upper canalicular probing. The mean time from initiation of the probing procedure to identification of the medial cut end of the lacerated canaliculus was 2 minutes.

A 64-year-old female who showed iridoschisis of her both eyes underwent cataract operation at her right eye without a pupillary device. The preoperative and postoperative ophthalmologic examinations including visual acuity, intraocular pressure, reaction of anterior chamber, and degree of damage on iris was evaluated respectively. Cataract surgery was performed under topical anesthesia through a clear corneal incision. Iris fibrils were held in place by ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD, sodium hyaluronate 3%-sodium chondroitin sulfate 4%, Viscoat) that was injected into the anterior chamber. A small capsulorrhexis was made and the nucleus was delivered with low-power phacoemulsification, most of which was performed under the anterior capsule. The iris came into contact with the OVDs only and received no mechanical trauma. There were no intraoperative complications such as tear of the iris, hyphema, loss of mydriasis, or rupture of the posterior lens capsule. The edema of corneal stroma and inflammation of anterior chamber was shown at immediate-postoperative period, but completely subsided 2 weeks later. The visual acuity showed improvement from 20\/400 to 20\/30. In iridoschisis patients, there is a risk of aspiration of iris fibers during cataract surgery. With adequate use of OVD and careful modulation of surgical devices, cataract surgery was successfully performed without using extra pupil-supporting device.

In one patient, the refraction of both eyes (the left eye was injured, but the right eye was not) was measured with an autorefractometer. The cycloplegic refraction was measured at the early stage of trauma and again 3 months after the blunt eye injury. The angle and depth of the anterior chamber, the ciliary body, and the choroids were examined by ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) over 3 months. The depth of the anterior chamber, the thickness of the lens, and the axial length were measured by A-scan ultrasonography in both eyes. During the 3 months after the injury, we made comparisons between the menifest and the cycloplegic refractions, the depths of anterior chambers, the thickness of the lenses, the axial lengths, and the UBM-determined appearances of the angles and depths of the anterior chambers, the ciliary bodies, and the choroids in both eyes. We suspect that the depth reduction in the anterior chamber, the increase in anterior to posterior lens diameter, and the edema in the ciliary body are all related to the change in the refractive power following the blunt trauma. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and ultrasonography of the anterior segment in the eye may be helpful to diagnose and confirm changes in the refractive power that occur after trauma.

Fifty-three eyes with an atypical birefringence pattern (ABP) based on SLP-VCC (28 glaucomatous eyes and 25 normal healthy eyes) were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. RNFL thickness was measured by both VCC and ECC techniques, and the visual field was examined by HVFA with 24-2 full-threshold program. The relationships between RNFL measurements in superior and inferior sectors and corresponding retinal mean sensitivity were sought globally and regionally with linear regression analysis in each group. Coefficients of the determination were calculated and compared between VCC and ECC techniques. In eyes with ABP, R2 values for the association between SLP parameters and retinal sensitivity were 0.06-0.16 with VCC, whereas they were 0.21-0.48 with ECC. The association of RNFL thickness with retinal sensitivity was significantly better with ECC than with VCC in 5 out of 8 regression models between SLP parameters and HVF parameters (P&lt;0.05).

Southern and Western blot analyses were done to determine the expression patterns of HGF\/c-Met in serum-starved ARPE-19 cells. The cell proliferation pattern in serum-starved condition was analyzed using MTS assay. Inhibition level of cell proliferation was analyzed using a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against c-Met (2 microg\/ml). Abnormal cell proliferation and scattering of ARPE-19 cells was observed under serum starvation. HGF\/c-Met were expressed in serum-starved ARPE-19 cells. ARPE-19 cell proliferation was also enhanced with recombinant HGF treatment. Neutralization against c-Met inhibited the proliferation of serum-deprived ARPE-19 by 64.5% (n=9, S.D. 5.5%). Serum starvation appears to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of ARPE-19 cells, resulting in scatter, and the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), a marker for fibrosis.

","1201":"To evaluate retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defect by a new scoring system for RNFL photography using the Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 1 (HRA1). This retrospective study included 128 healthy eyes and 836 primary open-angle glaucoma eyes. The RNFL photography using HRA1 was interpreted using a new scoring system, and correlated with visual field indices of standard automated perimetry (SAP). Using the presence of RNFL defect, darkness, width, and location, we established the new scoring system of RNFL photos. The mean RNFL defect score I in the early, moderate, severe, and control groups were 7.3, 9.2, 10.4, and 3.6, respectively. The mean RNFL defect score II in the early, moderate, severe, and control groups were 14.5, 28.5, 43.4, and 3.4, respectively. Correlations between the RNFL defect score II and the mean deviation of SAP was the strongest of the various combinations (r=-0.675, P&lt;.001). Using a new scoring system, we propose a method for semi-quantitative interpretation of RNFL photographs. This scoring system may be helpful to distinguish between normal and glaucomatous eyes, and the score is associated with the severity of visual field loss. ","1202":"To evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVBI) in patients with retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP). Seven eyes of 5 patients with RAP were included in this study. All of the eyes evidenced stage 2 RAP lesions, except for one eye with a stage 3 lesion. IVBI (1.25 mg\/0.05 cc) were conducted at 4 or 6-week intervals. Complete ocular examinations, angiographic results and optical coherence tomographic findings before and after the IVBI were analyzed at baseline and upon the follow-up visits. Seven eyes were studied in 5 patients who had undergone IVBI. Partial (3 eyes) or complete (4 eyes) regression of RAP was noted after IVBI in all of the studied eyes. Visual acuity improved in 5 of the eyes, and was stable in 2 of the eyes. One eye evidenced severe intraocular inflammation after IVBI and a subsequent development of new RAP, which was controlled with vitrectomy and repeat IVBI. This treatment was effective over 6 months, stabilizing or improving visual acuity and reducing angiographic leakage. These short-term results suggest that IVBI may constitute a promising therapeutic option, particularly in the early stages of RAP.

The authors conducted a retrospective study of patients with postvitrectomy diabetic vitreous hemorrhage who were administered 4 mg (0.1 cc) of triamcinolone acetonide ophthalmic suspension. Ocular history, adverse events, BCVA, intraocular pressure, external eye examination, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, B-scan ultrasonography, and fundus photography were assessed on day 1, weeks 1, 2, and 4 and months 2 and 3. There were 19 eyes of 18 consecutive patients with mean follow-up after IVT injection of 28 weeks. Of the 19 eyes, 17 eyes (89%) experienced clearing of vitreous hemorrhage within 1 to 5 weeks (mean, 1.7 weeks) with visible triamcinolone precipitates along with blood clot in the inferior aspect of fundus. Of these 17 eyes, 12 eyes (63%) maintained vitreous hemorrhage-free condition at last follow-up with a mean visual acuity of 20\/63 (range, 20\/320 20\/25), whereas 5 (29%) developed recurrent vitreous hemorrhage after clearing of vitreous hemorrhage. Vitreous hemorrhage was not cleared in 2 eyes, which required surgical procedures. IVT injection may be beneficial for clearing recurrent postvitrectomy Diabetic Vitreous Hemorrhage. ","1204":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of vitreoretinal surgery using a 23-gauge transconjunctival sutureless vitrectomy (TSV) system for various vitreoretinal diseases. A retrospective, consecutive, interventional case series was performed for 40 eyes of 40 patients. The patients underwent vitreoretinal procedures using the 23-gauge TSV system, including idiopathic epiretinal membrane (n=7), vitreous hemorrhage (n=11), diabetic macular edema (n=10), macular hole (n=5), vitreomacular traction syndrome (n=5), diabetic tractional retinal detachment (n=1), and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (n=1). Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), and intra- and post-operative complications were evaluated. Intraoperative suture placement was necessary in 3 eyes (7.5%). The median BCVA improved from 20\/400 (LogMAR, 1.21+\/-0.63) to 20\/140 (LogMAR, 0.83+\/-0.48) at 1 week (p=0.003), 20\/100 (LogMAR, 0.85+\/-0.65) at 1 month (p=0.002), 20\/100 (LogMAR, 0.73+\/-0.6) at 3 months (p=0.001). In 1 eye, IOP was 5 mmHg at 2 hours and 4 mmHg at 5 hours, but none of the eyes showed hypotony after 1 postoperative day. No serous postoperative complications were observed during a mean follow-up of 8.4+\/-3.4 months (range 3-13 months) The 23-gauge TSV system shows promise as an effective and safe technique for a variety of vitreoretinal procedures.

Clinical records of 2- to 6-year-old patients with unilateral cataract removal and primary PC-IOL implantation were reviewed retrospectively. Visual acuity and ocular alignment were measured. Sensory fusion was assessed with the Worth 4-dot test, and stereoacuity with the Titmus stereo test. Cataracts were classified according to cause, lens opacity location, age at onset, and presence of strabismus. Clinical characteristics of patients who obtained good visual function were identified. Forty-seven patients were included. Among 22 (46.8%) with good vision (20\/40 or better), only 6 (27.3%) achieved good binocular function (the presence of fusion and 100 seconds of arc or better of stereoacuity). Visual acuity was better in eyes with good binocular function (p=0.002). No other variables were significant for achieving good binocular function. The removal of unilateral cataract in a visually immature child can result in a combination of good visual acuity and binocular function. Good binocular function is closely related to good visual acuity.

BUT, Schirmer's test without anesthesia, and conjunctival impression cytology (CIC; goblet cell density, nucleus to cytoplasmic ratio, and epithelial cell morphology) were evaluated and compared between eyes before and after treatment (repeated measurement of ANOVA). After treatment, BUT and tear wettings were significantly prolonged in each group. Topical CsA treated eyes had greater increase in BUT (p=0.026); there was no significant difference in tear wetting (p=0.132). While the 3 parameters of CIC improved in both groups, goblet cell density was significantly higher in eyes treated with CsA (p=0.033).

A 58 -year-old woman was diagnosed with myopic CNV and treated with a combination of PDT with verteporfin and intravitreal bevacizumab injection that same day. She received the second injection of intravitreal bevacizumab four weeks after the initial treatment. The patient developed a sudden decline in vision one week after the second injection; and was subsequently diagnosed with retinal detachment associated with a macular hole. She underwent standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling, fluid-air exchange and silicone oil injection. The retina was still firmly attached at the patient's final follow-up visit. PDT and intravitreal bevacizumab injection used for the treatment of myopic CNV can be associated with retinal detachment with a macular hole.

The axial lengths, widths, horizontal and vertical lengths, refractive errors, and body weight of eyes were measured, and relationship between these parameters were investigated. Axial length was found to correlate significantly with eye width (r=0.914), and in emmetropic eyes and myopic eyes, axial lengths and widths were found to increase as age and body weight increased. Axial lengths increased rapidly until age 10, and then increased slowly. In emmetropic eyes, widths\/axial lengths increased with age, but in myopic eyes these decreased as age or severity of myopia increased. Moreover, as age increased, the myopic population and severity also increased. The axial length was longer in case of myopia compared to emmetropia in all age groups and there was almost no difference in the increase rate of axial length by the age of myopia and emmetropia. However, the width was wider in case of myopia compared to emmetropia in all age groups and the increase rate of width in myopia by age was smaller than that of emmetropia. Myopia showed decreasing rate of width\/axial length with increase of age, from 1.004 in 5 years to 0.971 in 20 years. However, emmetropia showed increasing rate of width\/axial length with increase of age, from 0.990 in 5 years to 1.006 in 20 years.

On postoperative day one, the patients with at least 17 PD overcorrection were classified as group 1 and those with less than 17 PD as group 2. Age, refractive error, type of surgery, lateral incomitancy, and the incidence of consecutive ET were analyzed for each group. Group 1 consisted of 116 patients (28.6%) and group 2 consisted of 289 (71.4%). At the six-month follow-up visit, consecutive ET had developed in 16 patients (13.8%) in group 1, and in five patients (1.7%) in group 2 (p&lt;0.001).

The increase of intraocular pressure (IOP) induced by DRPT and the results from A-scan ultrasound biometric measurements were obtained. An increase in IOP of at least 8 mmHg from baseline was considered a positive result for DRPT. Associations between the increase of IOP induced by DRPT and the parameters of A-scan biometry were tested by linear regression analysis. The DRPT results were positive in 28 eyes of 19 patients. After DRPT, the IOP returned to near-baseline levels within 2 hours in all patients; some patients were treated with anti-glaucoma eye drops. Lens thickness was significantly correlated with the amount of IOP elevation induced by DRPT (r=0.338, p=0.041). DRPT is a safe and effective test in patients with IAC.

Genes identified by the microarray were further evaluated by real-time PCR. Diabetic keratocytes over-expressed components of the MAPK and Notch pathways, and under-expressed components of the insulin, calcium, and TGF-beta pathways. Cytokine treated diabetic keratocytes differentially expressed components of the TGF-beta and MAPK pathways. After IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha treatment, nine genes were under-expressed, falling in the insulin, TGF-beta, and Toll-like receptor pathways. Real-time PCR showed a significant decrease in the IL-6 and TGF-beta2 genes and a significant increase in the Ppm1a gene. There were some differences in gene expression between normal and diabetic keratocytes related to signal transduction pathways, such as the insulin, MAPK, calcium, and TGF-beta pathways.

The gonioscopic criteria for ACGS were the trabecular meshwork invisible in 3 or more quadrants of the entire angle and the angular width less than 20 degrees by Shaffer classification. Twenty-seven eyes of 20 patients underwent anterior chamber angle and ciliary body imaging with UBM. Angle opening distance (AOD(500)), angle recess area (ARA), trabecular-ciliary process distance (TCPD) and trabecular-iris angle (TIA) were measured from the UBM images at each quadrant. The AOD(500), ARA, and TIA were not significantly different between the eyes with PAS (9 eyes) and without PAS (18 eyes) at each quadrant. However, the TCPD was significantly shorter in the superior quadrant when compared with the eyes without PAS (mean: 405.3+\/-70.9 microm vs 536.4+\/-140.5 microm) (p&lt;0.05).

The superior retinal attachment status can be evaluated from the summation of B-scan ultrasonography results performed in the right decubitus and left ducubitus positions. The proper time to evaluate the retinal attachment status was related to the degree of the gas absorption when performing B-scan ultrasonography after pars plana vitrectomy and gas tamponade.

In serum, calcium levels did not statistically differ between non-diabetics and diabetics. The phosphorus level was also not significantly different. In the aqueous humor, however, while calcium levels did not differ significantly, the phosphorus levels in diabetics were considerably higher than those in non-diabetics. When non-diabetics were compared to the three diabetic subgroups, calcium levels did not differ in serum or aqueous humor, but the phosphorus levels in diabetics with proliferative diabetic retinopathy were significantly higher than those in non-diabetics, diabetics without diabetic retinopathy, and diabetics with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The level of phosphorus in the aqueous humor and serum of diabetics was significantly increased, especially in diabetics with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This result may be related to hydrophilic acrylic IOL opacification. Future studies regarding the pathogenic role of a high concentration of aqueous humor and serum phosphorus are required. ","1228":"To determine the effect of the base curve radius (BCR) of therapeutic soft contact lens (T-lens) on epithelial healing after laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy (LASEK). Ninety-two eyes in 47 patients with myopia were prospectively evaluated after LASEK. All the patients wore T-lenses with the BCR (R1) randomly chosen after LASEK. The T-lenses were removed after complete healing of the epithelial wounds. We calculated an estimated BCR (R2) from postoperative topography using a diopter conversion table. The patients were divided into two groups according to the differences between the BCR (R1) and the estimated BCR (R2). The flat fitting group was R1 &gt; R2 (Group A), and the steep fitting group was R1&lt;R2 (Group B). Patient's age, epithelial healing time, ablation amount, and BCR were compared between these two groups. Group A (R1&gt;R2) had 53 eyes, and Group B (R1&lt;R2) had 39 eyes. Group A showed a shorter epithelial healing time than Group B (5.8+\/-1.7 days vs. 6.7+\/-2.1 days, p=0.04). The flat fitting group showed a shorter epithelial healing time than the steep fitting group after LASEK. ","1229":"To describe the characteristics and investigate the differences of higher-order aberrations (HOAs) between the eyes with a natural, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of 20\/12 and eyes with highly myopic eyes in Korean adults. Thirty-one eyes of 20 subjects with UCVA of 20\/12 (Group 1) and 54 eyes of 36 myopic patients with greater than -6 diopters (Group 2) were analyzed for type and magnitude of HOAs across a 6.0 mm pupil. HOAs were measured by Wavescan (VISX, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in natural scotopic conditions and were presented as root-mean-square (RMS: microm) in Belle aberration maps. The mean spherical equivalent (SE) of manifest refraction was -0.15+\/-0.25 D (range: +0.37 to -0.50 D) in Group 1 and -7.25+\/-0.78 D (range: -6.00 to -9.25 D) in Group 2. The total root-mean-square (RMS) values of HOAs for Group 1 and Group 2 were 0.28+\/-0.09 microm and 0.27+\/-0.087 microm, respectively (P&gt;0.05).

This study helped establish ocular aberration standards for those with natural supervision and those with highly myopic eyes among Koreans. Individuals with natural supervision had significant amounts of HOAs, and there was no significant difference in the amount of HOAs between the two groups. The index of higher-order aberrations may not be a perfect predictor of the amount of refractive error. ","1230":"To determine the sustaining effects of orthokeratology. This study enrolled 58 eyes with moderate myopia. LK-DM lenses (Lucid Korea Dream Lens) were fitted daily for at least eight hours on an overnight regimen. The effects of orthokeratology and it's sustainability throughout the day were recorded twice; immediately after removal in the morning and eight hours later. Sustainability was measured by comparing the changes from morning to afternoon for best uncorrected visual acuity, apical corneal power, keratometric values, spherical equivalent and induced astigmatism. UCVA demonstrated improved values at all follow up periods. Fluctuations during the day stabilized after 4 weeks of lens wear. K values averaged a mean of 42.4 mm at baseline, and reduced to 40.9 mm by week 12. Unaided logMAR visual acuity changed from 0.94+\/-0.14 at baseline to -0.11+\/-0.17 by week 12. The sustainability of orthokeratology, defined as the difference between morning and afternoon values of unaided logMAR visual acuity, increased from -0.82 on day 1 to -0.11 on week 12. UCVA and spherical refractive error did not change to a significant degree after 4 weeks. Although statistically insignificant minute fluctuations during the day were observed up to week 12, these fluctuations decreased to a statistically significant level after week 4.

An 81-year-old woman visited our emergency room for severe ocular pain and vision loss in her left eye. Her intraocular pressures (IOPs) were 14 mmHg in the right eye and 58 mmHg in the left eye. Her visual acuity was 0.4 in the right eye but she had no light perception in the left eye. The left anterior chamber depth was shallow and gonioscopy of the left eye showed a closed angle. In comparison, the right anterior chamber depth was normal and showed a wide, open angle. Computed tomography and ultrasonography demonstrated retinal detachment due to subretinal hemorrhage. After systemic and topical antiglaucoma medications failed to relieve her intractable severe ocular pain, she underwent enucleation. The ocular pathology specimen showed that a large subretinal hemorrhage caused retinal detachment and pushed displaced the lens-iris diaphragm, resulting in secondary angle-closure glaucoma. Prolonged anticoagulant therapy may cause hemorrhagic retinal detachment and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. If medical therapy fails to relieve pain or if there is suspicion of an intraocular tumor, enucleation should be considered as a therapeutic option. ","1234":"To evaluate the diode laser photodynamic therapy efficacy on choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in the treatment of three patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). The authors selected three patients with ARMD whose vision has decreased due to CNV, and applied diode laser treatment after injecting an indocyanine green (ICG) solution. The patients were followed for at least three months after treatment, and examinations included evaluating vision changes and possible leakage on fluorescein angiography (FAG). The final vision of two patients improved by more than one line on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) chart after at least three months of follow-up. However, the final vision of the third patient decreased by one line on ETDRS chart. FAG was done in all patients, and in two of the patients, there was no evidence of leakage at the laser-applied site. In the other patient, there was evidence of minimal leakage, with the area of leakage decreasing by more than fifty percent. Side effects of ICG were not found during or after the photodynamic therapy sessions. The photodynamic usage of ICG treatment of CNV in patients with ARMD, was effective in preventing or improving the visual outcome. Compared to the widely used verteporfin, ICG is more stable and is more cost effective. The authors therefore came to a conclusion that ICG can be very useful in the treatment of CNV. However, further studies are necessary.

This study is a case report detailing clinical follow-up and an aqueous humor test by PCR-RFLP. The deep, white retinal lesions coalesced and progressively expanded in a circumferential manner, with sparing of the perivascular retina. However, retinal and vitreous hemorrhages, unusual findings for PORN, could be noted around the optic nerve. Varicellar-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and herpes simplex types 1,2 (HSV-1,2) were detected in the aqueous humor by PCR. PORN has been described as a variant of necrotizing herpetic retinopathy, occurring particularly in patients with AIDS. Although the etiologic agent has been reported to be VZV, concurrent or combined etiologic agents can include HSV-1, HSV-2, and CMV in AIDS patients. Therefore, combined antiviral therapy with acyclovir and ganciclovir could be more reasonable as an initial therapy.

An ophthalmic examination showed no light perception vision, increased intraocular pressure, severe corneal edema, severe anterior chamber reaction, exudative membranes on the anterior lens surface, and severe vitreal reaction. There was no ocular history of trauma, infection, or surgery in either eye. Under the impression of endogenous bacterial endophthalmitis, immediate intraocular cultures and intravitreal antibiotic injections were performed, but the anterior chamber reaction, and the ultrasonogram findings were deteriorated.

To evaluate the enzymatic pathway of BH(4) synthesis, 10 microM dexamethasone, 5 mM diaminopyrimidinone, 100 microM ascorbic acid, 100 microM sepiapterin, or 10 microM methotrexate were also co-administered respectively. Cellular survival and NO production were measured with MTT and Griess assay. Insulin enhanced NO production in a dose-dependent manner significantly (0.05) without affecting cell viability, whereas dexamethasone inhibited NO production. With co-exposure of insulin, diaminopyrimidinone and sepiapterin inhibited insulin-induced NO production. Ascorbic acid increased NO production independent of insulin and methotrexate did not affect to the action of insulin in NO production. Insulin increases NO production in TM cells via de novo synthetic pathway for BH(4) synthesis.

The genotype and allele frequencies of these polymorphisms in patients with NTG and normal controls were compared using the Fisher's exact test and the chi-square test. In both groups, the genotype distributions were in accordance with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no significant difference in the frequency of the Nppa and Npr1 alleles or genotypes in the normal-tension glaucoma group as compared to the control group.

The thicknesses of the fovea for each of three groups were 142.16 +\/- 8.99 microm in group one (45 eyes), 153.58 +\/- 17.63 microm in group two (43 eyes) and 158.86 +\/- 11.93 microm in group three (28 eyes). The data showed significant differences in fovea thickness between the groups. The average thicknesses of the peripapillary RNFL for each of three groups were 113.29 +\/- 10.80 microm in group one, 103.85 +\/- 14.48 microm in group two and 100.74 +\/- 9.15 microm in group three. A statistically significant difference was found between group one and the other groups (p &lt; 0.05). As the level of myopia increased, the thickness of the fovea also increased, while the thickness of the peripapillary RNFL decreased. Therefore, when interpreting OCT results in the clinic, careful consideration should be given to various changes associated with myopia.

Twenty-two eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with recurrent macular edema underwent vitrectomy with AV sheathotomy and internal limiting membrane peeling. All eyes had previous intravitreal triamcinolone injection and\/or laser photocoagulation for macular edema. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) before and after surgery were compared. The mean preoperative BCVA (log MAR) were 0.79 +\/- 0.29 and postoperative BCVA (log MAR) at 3 months was 0.57 +\/- 0.33.

","1257":"To compare the short-term effects of intravitreal versus posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide for diabetic macular edema. This is a prospective and interventional study. Sixty eyes of 60 patients who had diffuse diabetic macular edema were assigned to receive a single intravitreal injection (4 mg) or a single posterior subtenon injection (40 mg) of triamcinolone acetonide. The central retinal thickness was measured using optical coherent tomography before injection and at 1 and 3 months after injection. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure (IOP) were also measured. Both intravitreal and posterior subtenon injections of triamcinolone acetonide resulted in significant improvements in visual acuity at 1 month and 3 months after injection. Both groups resulted in a significant decrease in central macular thickness (CMT) at 1 month and 3 months post-injection. IOP in the intravitreal injection group was significantly higher than in the posterior subtenon injection group at 3 months after injection. The posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide had a comparable effect to the intravitreal triamcinolone injection and showed a lower risk of elevated IOP. Posterior subtenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide may be a good alternative for the treatment of diffuse diabetic macular edema.

Eight hundred fifty patients (males: 342, mean age: 58.07 +\/- 8.60 years) with diabetes who underwent ophthalmologic evaluation were studied retrospectively. Diabetic patients were classified into a cataract group and control group (i.e. a group without cataracts). Risk factors like sex, age, duration of diabetes, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, BUN, creatinine, and total cholesterol were compared between patients with and without cataracts. Four hundred twenty-five patients (50.00%) had cataracts at evaluation. Females were more common in the cataract group than the control group. The mean age did not differ between the two groups. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL cholesterol levels were not different between the two groups. Duration of diabetes was significantly longer in patients in the cataract group than in the control group (13.03 +\/- 6.96 years vs. 7.03 +\/- 6.04 years, p &lt; 0.001). The patients in the cataract group also had higher levels of HbA1c, BUN, creatinine, and fasting blood sugar than those in the control group. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the duration of diabetes (p &lt; 0.001) was significantly correlated with the presence of cataracts. The duration of diabetes was the most significant risk factor for cataracts in patients with diabetes. This finding indicates that the accumulated effect of hyperglycemia is related to lens transparency in patients with diabetes. ","1259":"Ocular perforation during lid anesthesia is rarely reported. We describe here a case of inadvertent corneal perforation and traumatic cataract that occurred during lid anesthesia in a procedure for hordeolum removal. A 33-year-old woman presented with a sudden visual loss of her left eye. She had undergone hordeolum removal the day before at a local clinic. On ophthalmologic examination, the cornea was perforated and the lens cortex was extruded into the anterior chamber. After cataract removal and IOL implantation, antibiotics were injected into the vitreous. Her final visual acuity of the left eye was 20\/20. Postoperative specular microscopic examination revealed a normal-range endothelial cell count, coefficient of variation, and hexagonality despite the intracameral lidocaine injection. Anesthetic injection of an infected lid should be done with great caution. Although there are possibilities of corneal endothelial toxicity and endophthalmitis in case of intracameral lidocaine injection through the infected lid, yet proper management may save the patient's vision without complications.

A 63-year-old man with progressive vertical deviation of the right eye for the past 6 months visited our strabismus department; his condition was not painful. An examination indicated that he had 60PD of right hypertropia at distance and near in primary gaze. Additionally, a significant limitation of his downgaze was noted. The right eye appeared mildly proptotic, and the upper and lower eyelids were slightly edematous. Corrected vision was 20\/20 in both eyes. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed fusiform enlargement of the right superior rectus muscle, with prominent but irregular enhancement following gadolinium administration. Incisional biopsy revealed an intramuscular hemangioma in the superior rectus muscle with cavernous-type vessels.

","1261":"To present a case of peripheral T-cell lymphoma presenting as painful ophthalmoplegia. A 61-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of headache and eyeball pain. Examination showed mild exophthalmos, complete ophthalmoplegia, and ptosis of the left eye. Under the impression of nonspecific orbital inflammation, she was treated with oral prednisone with initial response. Two months later, she revisited the clinic with exacerbated symptoms. Anterior orbitotomy and incisional biopsy was performed for the inferior rectus muscle lesion. Histopathologic examination revealed an infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells between degenerative muscle bundles. It was consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. A metastatic workup was performed without any evidence of extraorbital tumor. The patient was recommended to be treated with chemotherapy, however, refused to take the treatment. The patient died of progression of the disease in a month. T-cell lymphoma in the orbit can present as painful ophthalmoplegia and take a rapid clinical course. The disease should be regarded as one of the differential diagnosis for painful ophthalmoplegia refractory to corticosteroid therapy.

The inferior oblique muscle was attached 4 mm posterior to the temporal border of the inferior rectus muscle in six eyes, 3 mm posterior in five eyes, 2 mm posterior in five eyes, 1 mm posterior in five eyes, and parallel to the temporal border in one eye. The average angle of vertical deviation prior to surgery was 11.3 +\/- 3.9 prism diopters (PD). The total average correction in the angle of vertical deviation after surgery was 10.8 +\/- 3.8 PD. In the parallel group, the average reduction was 14 PD. After surgery, normal inferior oblique muscle action was seen in eighteen of twenty-two eyes (81.8%). Graded recession and anteriorization of the inferior oblique muscle is thought to be an effective surgical method to treat unilateral superior oblique palsy of less than 15 PD. ","1263":"The surgical technique for intermittent exotropia [X(T)] is quite simple. However, in many cases, the condition recurs due to any one of a number of causes, including undercorrection. This study examined the factors associated with undercorrection on X(T) patients. The study examined 199 X(T) patients who underwent bilateral recession of the lateral rectus muscle or unilateral recession of the lateral rectus muscle and resection of the medial rectus muscle, and who were followed-up for more than a year. Patients whose near and far distance angles of deviation were 9 prism diopters (PD) or more at one year after surgery were designated as group 1. Those whose PD was 8 or below or who had orthophoria were assigned to group 2. Various factors were compared and analyzed. One day after surgery, group 1 showed an average overcorrection of 1.9 and 4.1 PD at near and far, respectively, and group 2 showed an average overcorrection of 6.3 and 7.6 PD at near and far, respectively. A statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups (p &lt; 0.05). Factors such as the age of onset of strabismus, age at the time of surgery, the interval from the onset of strabismus to surgery, the preoperative angle of deviation, the dissociated vertical deviation, amblyopia, anisometropia and vertical strabismus had no influence on the undercorrection of X(T) patients (p &gt; 0.05).

OCT was also performed on 42 normal children (84 eyes), for a total of 136 eyes. Retinal thickness measurements were taken from the fovea, and the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measurements were taken from the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal quadrants in the peripapillary region. The average age of the normal children was 8.5 years, and the average age of the children with amblyopia was 8.0 years. The average thickness of the fovea was 157.4 microm in normal eyes and was 158.8 microm in amblyopic eyes. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.551).

The subjects whose best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) did not improve by two lines or better within 2 weeks of wearing glasses full-time were prescribed occlusion therapy for 6 hours a day outside of school hours, along with the instruction to wear glasses full-time. Subjects who complied with occlusion for more than 3 hours a day were considered to comply well. The major component of the anisometropia was hyperopia in 51.7% of the subjects, and hyperopia plus astigmatism was found in 24.1%. The mean pretreatment BCVA score was 0.51 0.23 (LogMAR). Compliance was 89.66%. The mean posttreatment BCVA was 0.03 +\/- 0.01 (LogMAR), and the success rate, based on a posttreatment BCVA of 0.1 (LogMAR) and better, was 96.43%.

The concentration of the total and active form of TGF-beta2 was measured in 63 patients with primary open angle glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma complicated with diabetes (NVG), and secondary open angle glaucoma complicated with uveitis (SOAG) using a double antibody 'sandwich-indirect' ELISA method. The levels of total TGF-beta2 in the aqueous samples of POAG, NVG, and SOAG were elevated. The levels of active TGF-beta2 in the aqueous samples of POAG, and NVG were also elevated, whereas the level of active TGF-beta2 was within the normal range in the aqueous samples of SOAG.

The corneal diameter was 9.5 mm or less at the time of secondary PC-IOL implantation. Preoperative examinations were conducted for bilaterality, corneal diameter, eye abnormalities and systemic abnormalities. Postoperative results were evaluated in terms of visual developments, refractive changes, axial length measurements and the occurrence of complications. The follow-up period was at least one year after secondary PC-IOL implantation. Age at the first diagnosis for cataract with microcornea and\/or microphthalmos was 2.7 months on average. Among 15 patients, 8 (53.3%) had a family history. All patients received an initial irrigation and aspiration, posterior capsulectomy, and anterior vitrectomy at 0.8 years (0.1-3.3 years) of age and a secondary PC-IOL implantation surgery at 6.7 years (1.6-17.2 years) of age on average.

Combining cataract surgery with vitrectomy can achieve visual rehabilitation in the early postoperative period without requiring post-vitrectomy cataract surgery. A sutureless clear corneal incision, used in this procedure, can minimize the SIA and promote postoperative wound healing. If sutureless, transconjunctival, pars plana vitrectomy can be used more widely in the future, then the simplified, combined cataract surgery using a small clear corneal incision will also become more common, hence decreasing operation time, and hastening postoperative recovery.

The lOP increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) from 16.3 +\/- 2.5 mmHg preoperatively to a mean maximum of 21.7 +\/- 5.3 mmHg in the IVTA group, and from 15.3 +\/- 4.5 mmHg to 20.6 +\/- 3.0 mmHg in the PSTA group. An elevation in the IOP of more than 5 mmHg from the baseline lOP was seen in 52.4% of the IVTA group at a mean time of 3.1 weeks postoperatively, and 44.2% of the PSTA group displayed an IOP elevation at 5.9 weeks. Both developed significant elevations of IOP, but this appeared at a later date in the PSTA group. Careful follow-up after local injection of steroids is necessary. ","1281":"To evaluate the effectiveness of laser photocoagulation as adjuvant therapy in the treatment of large macular holes. A randomized clinical trial. Thirty-one eyes from 29 subjects with idiopathic macular holes of diameters larger than 400 microm were randomized into a laser group and a control group. All eyes underwent vitrectomy with peeling of the internal limiting membrane. Contrary to the control group eyes, the laser group eyes underwent laser photocoagulation at the center of the macular hole before vitrectomy. Visual acuity and anatomic outcomes assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were analyzed 3 months after surgery. On postoperative OCT, closure of the macular hole was noted in 17 of the 18 (94.4%) laser group eyes and 10 of the 13 (76.9%) control group eyes. Hole closure without bare retinal pigment epithelium was observed in 16 eyes in the laser group and 6 eyes in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The amount of improvement in logMAR visual acuity 3 months after surgery was 0.40 +\/- 0.29 in the laser group, and 0.19 +\/- 0.23 in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Laser photocoagulation constitutes a potent adjuvant therapy that may improve anatomical and visual outcomes of surgery for macular holes larger than 400 microm.

We evaluated 12 eyes in nine patients with very high myopic amblyopia who received angle-supported phakic intraocular lenses (Phakic 6H) and followed them for more than six months. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and complications were evaluated. A satisfaction score was rated by patients using a 5-point (1-5) numeric scale. The mean age of patients was 37.3 +\/- 9.4 years, ranging from 29 to 59 years old. The preoperative mean refraction (spherical equivalent, SE) was -20.10 +\/- 5.41 diopters (D). The postoperative mean refraction (SE) was -1.75 +\/- 0.76 D at six months. The postoperative BCVA improved an average 3.92 +\/- 1.24 lines over preoperative values, and mean endothelial cell loss was 8.9% at six months. Development of cataracts, glaucoma, and pupil abnormalities were not demonstrated in any case during the study. The patients were all very satisfied, as the average satisfaction score was 4.3. This study indicates that angle-supported phakic anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation may be an effective surgical alternative for the correction of amblyopic adult eyes with very high myopia. However, long-term evaluation is necessary to assess possible complications and long-term safety.

A retrospective case review of patients who developed TAO in close temporal association with periocular surgical interventions and presented at the orbital clinic from 1997 to 2004. History of previous thyroid abnormality and the lack of TAO signs and symptoms before surgery were reviewed and analyzed. Nine patients that developed TAO in association with periocular surgery were identified. All were women with an average age of 59.3years. (range: 45-75 years). The patients divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of four patients who had previously been diagnosed with Graves' hyperthyroidism (GH). They ranged in age from 48 to 75 years (average: 58.8 years). The diagnosis of GH had been made an average of 50.5 months (range: 12-96 months) before presentation with TAO. Group 2 consisted of five patients who had no previous history of thyroid abnormality. They ranged in age from 45 to 74 years (average: 60.2 years). No patients had any signs or symptoms of TAO before their recent presentation. Periocular surgery may lead to local inflammatory events that may contribute to the instigation of TAO in predisposed individuals.

Children were enrolled into the epicanthus group or non-epicanthus (control) group. The children with epicanthus were classified into four subgroups according to the Duke-Elder's classification. The thickness of the upper eyelid was measured at five points with A-scan ultrasonography. There was no significant difference in upper eyelid thickness between the epicanthus group and control group (P &gt; 0.05) or between the subgroups of the epicanthus group (P &gt; 0.05).

Endoscopic intranasal biopsy revealed alveolar RMS. Conservative debulking and orbital wall decompression were performed. Immunohistochemical testing was positive for desmin, S-100, and smooth muscle actin (SMA), supporting the diagnosis of RMS. Since ipsilateral cervical and spinal metastasis was detected, systemic treatment was administered simultaneously. Although rarely found in adults, RMS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of orbital tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis plays an important role in the definitive diagnosis of RMS.

A thirty-two year old male presented with painful swelling on the nasal side of his left lower lid two weeks prior to visiting this clinic. Fourteen years ago, the patient was involved in a traffic accident and underwent surgery to reconstruct the ethmoidal sinus. Lacrimal sac massage showed a regurgitation of a purulent discharge from the left lower punctum. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with acute dacryocystitis and an endoscopic transnasal dacryocystostomy was performed the next day. The surgical finding showed severe necrosis around the lacrimal sac and a 20 x 15-mm sized silastic sheet was found crumpled within the purulent discharge. The sheet was removed, the lacrimal sac was irrigated with an antibiotic solution, and a silicone tube was intubated into the lacrimal pathway. After surgery, the painful swelling on the nasal side of left lower lid resolved gradually, and there were no symptomatic complications three months later.

Three extraction techniques were compared to identify an efficient method of obtaining a large number of viable corneal epithelial stem cells from the limbus. Limbal tissues were extracted by incubation at 37 degrees C or 4 degrees C for 1 or 16 hours, respectively, with 1.2 U\/ml dispase\/trypsin or by treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.01% ethyldiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) at 37 degrees C in single procedure. Collected cells were cultured on NIH\/3T3-seeded plates, and colony forming efficiency (CFE) was evaluated. Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed with a Coulter EPICS 753 after incubation with Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide (PI). Hoechst negative cells were obtained using gates exhibiting low Hoechst blue with a 424\/44 nm BP filter. Gated cells of each fraction were re-cultured to assess the capability of colony formation. The mean numbers of viable cells obtained from treatment with dispase and trypsin was 3 x 10(4) cell\/ml and 8.06 x 10(5) cell\/ml at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C incubations; the number increased to 1.21 x 10(6) cell\/ml with a trypsin\/EDTA treatment (p &lt; 0.05).

","1291":"To investigate the causes and characteristics of glaucoma in children following cataract surgery. Twenty-four patients (37 eyes) with uncomplicated congenital cataracts who developed glaucoma after cataract surgery were studied retrospectively. Variables included cataract morphology, surgical techniques, post-operative complications, time to the onset of glaucoma, gonioscopic findings, presence of microcornea and the histopathologic characteristics of the filtration angle (in one case). There was a bimodal onset of glaucoma after cataract surgery. Early-onset glaucoma occurred at a mean age of 6 months in 15 eyes and delayed-onset glaucoma at a mean age of 12 years in 22 eyes. Early-onset glaucoma was significantly (p = 0.018) more likely to be due to angle closure than delayed-onset glaucoma. With delayed-onset glaucoma, the filtration angle was open in 86% of eyes and significantly (p = 0.006) more eyes in the delayed-onset group had microcornea. Medical treatment was sufficient to control intraocular pressure in the delayed-onset group while the early-onset group required surgical treatment (P &lt; 0.001). The onset of glaucoma after cataract surgery during infancy follows a bimodal pattern that is correlated with the configuration of the filtration angle. The early-onset glaucoma group had high incidence of angle closure requiring surgical treatment, while in the delayed-onset group non-surgical treatment was sufficient to control intraocular pressure. Prophylactic iridectomy in eyes at risk for pupillary block is recommended. Eyes with delayed-onset glaucoma have open filtration angles yet also have findings of incomplete development of filtration structures. Microcornea is a risk factor for delayed-onset glaucoma. ","1292":"To evaluate the outcomes of surgery for Brown syndrome. We reviewed the charts of 15 patients who underwent surgery for Brown syndrome. The limitation of elevation in adduction (LEA) ranged from -2 to -4 degrees. A superior oblique muscle (SO) tenotomy was performed in 4 patients, a silicone expander was inserted in the SO of 9 patients, and a SO recession was performed in 2 patients. The results of surgery were analyzed with a follow-up period of more than 6 months, 42.3 +\/- 48.42 months on average. Nine female patients and 6 male patients with unilateral Brown syndrome were selected for this study. The left eye was the affected eye in 9 patients. The degree of preoperative LEA was -2 to -4 in 4 patients in whom SO tenotomy was performed, -3 to -4 in 9 patients treated with the silicone expander, and -2 to -4 in 2 patients treated with SO recession. The LEA was released after surgery in all patients without postoperative adhesion. However, unilateral overaction of the inferior oblique muscle due to excessive weakening of the SO occurred in 1 patient with tenotomy (25%) and in 1 patient with insertion of a silicone expander (11%). LEA was released after tenotomy, insertion of a silicone expander and recession of the SO in 13 of 15 patients with Brown syndrome. SO palsy due to overcorrection and under-correction with postoperative adhesion should be avoided. ","1293":"To compare quantitative polarimetric measurements in eyes with NTG and HTG using GDx-VCC. Both groups were matched by age and glaucoma stage based on the Humphrey visual field test. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 146 patients who underwent Humphrey field analysis (HFA) and GDx-VCC. We compared outcomes of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) parameters among the three groups by ANOVA and between each pair of groups using the Tukey-Kramer Post-Hoc test. We also evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of GDx-VCC in detecting glaucoma in each group. The mean age and HFA mean deviation (MD) were 55.6 +\/- 9.5 years and -0.8 +\/- 1.5 dB in 47 control patients, 59.4 +\/- 9.0 years and -5.77 +\/- 4.38 dB in 49 NTG patients, and 59.4 +\/- 11.7 years and -8.09 +\/- 6.77 dB in 51 HTG patients, respectively. All thickness parameters were lower in HTG patients compared to NTG patients, but there were no significant differences in ratio parameters between age-matched early HTG and NTG patients. The sensitivity of GDx-VCC was significantly higher in both early and total HTG patients compared to the respective groups of NTG patients.

Thirty-six consecutive patients (39 eyes) with myopic CNV who were followed up for more than one year after PDT were enrolled in this study. Clinical features included age, gender, refractive error, great linear dimension, and subretinal hemorrhage. ICG features included the lesion size, lacquer cracks, hypofluorescence surrounding the CNV (dark rim), peripapillary atrophy size, and visible prominent choroidal veins under the macula. Linear regression analysis was performed using the change in visual acuity (delta logMAR) as the dependent variable and the above factors as independent variables. At one-year follow-up after PDT, a younger age (p = 0.002) and the presence of a dark rim (p = 0.002) were significantly correlated with an improvement of visual acuity (decrement in logMAR) after PDT. Other factors had no significant influence on changes in visual acuity. Younger patients and patients with a dark rim on ICG angiography had a higher chance of visual improvement after PDT in myopic CNV. ","1295":"We classified the Orbscan anterior elevation maps in normal eyes (under myopic, emmetropic and hyperopic conditions) and in those after myopic refractive surgery. We did this classification to demonstrate how Orbscan anterior elevation maps are useful in screening for the existence and extent of previous myopic refractive surgery. Such a classification can help clinicians interpret preoperative and postoperative topographies. We measured for visual acuity and refractive power in 4800 eyes. After a slit-lamp examination, a corneal topography exam was performed with an Orbscan corneal topography system. The eyes were divided into two groups, with Group I representing those who had not had refractive surgery (4438 eyes). Group II included those who had undergone previous refractive surgery to correct myopia (362 eyes). In Group I, the central island type (43.0%) was the most common, followed by the temporal ridge (25.8%), the with-the-rule regular ridge (16.7%), the against-the-rule regular ridge (6.6%), the nasal ridge (4.0%), and the saddle type (2.1%). In Group II, the depressed lake type (69.9%) was most common, followed by the de-centered ablation type (21.3%). The trend line of the postoperative central anterior surface elevation (E) and the ablation power of refractive surgery were calculated. Ablation power of refractive surgery = 0.0047 E + 0.0083 This study demonstrates that it is possible to use Orbscan anterior elevation maps to screen for the extent of previous refractory surgery used in the correction of myopia. This study may also be useful in understanding the shapes of Orbscan anterior elevation maps before and after myopic refractive surgery as well as in determining the degree of ablated myopic refractive power and decentration.

This study was performed on 22 total eyes from 17 patients who were diagnosed with ocular adnexal malignant lymphoma. We retrospectively analyzed the medical records for patient information including the histological classification based on age, the gender of each patient, the symptoms and signs at the initial diagnosis, the presence of binocular invasion, the findings of the surgical biopsy, the clinical stage of each patient's tumor, and the treatment methods used and their effectiveness. The mean follow-up period was 24.8 months. The mean age of patients studied was 46.8 years old. Six females and 11 males were included in the study. Fifteen cases consisting of 20 total eyes represented extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). Five of seven patients (71.4%) whose lymphoma occurred within the conjunctiva relapsed after irradiation or chemotherapy, and four of the relapsed patients were salvaged with further therapy. Extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) constituted 88.2% of all lymphomas involving the ocular adnexa. Lymphoma in the ocular adnexa responded well to conventional treatment, but the recurrence rate of lymphoma in the conjunctiva was significantly high.

We conducted this study to evaluate the clinical results of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy using a Microdebrider, which has also been used for functional endoscopic sinus surgery. We selected 76 patients (with a total of 84 affected eyes) who had been diagnosed with a nasolacrimal duct obstruction. These patients underwent an endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy using a Microdebrider, which removed both nasal mucosa and lacrimal sac mucosa and also trimmed the margins of the ostotomy site. We assessed patients' outcomes on an anatomical basis using a dye test and endoscopy, which were used to define the anatomical success. We also arbitrarily defined functional success as whether the subjective epiphora was absent. At a four to 18 month follow-up, we monitored the clinical course to examine any recurrent episodes. The symptoms were alleviated in 72 eyes, with a primary success rate of 85.7%. On nasal endoscopy, a functional failure was seen in four eyes. In these four eyes, the orifice was narrowed by the presence of either granulation tissue or conjunctivochalasis. By contrast, surgical outcomes were the anatomical failure in eight eyes. In these eight eyes, the orifice was obstructed by the presence of granulation tissue as well as the adhesion of nasal mucosa. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy using a Microdebrider enabled us to make the large fistula while minimizing the damage of adjacent tissue. It might be the recommended surgery that reduces the complications and enhances the success rate.

There was a significant difference between the RNFLT of the nasal and temporal quadrant in individual eyes. There was a significant difference between the RNFLT of corresponding sectors with respect to the vertical or horizontal meridian in individual eyes. The nasal and temporal RNFLTs were asymmetrical between the right and left eye in the quadrant and sector analysis. The RNFLT of the nasal and temporal quadrant was thicker in the right eye.

The frequency and dimensions of the retinal pigment epithelial detachment (RPED) with attenuation of internal reflectivity on optical coherence tomographic (OCT) examination were compared in both diseases. OCT showed the RPED with attenuation of internal reflectivity corresponding to the polypoidal structure in the indocyanine green angiogram in 75% of eyes with PCV, which was significantly more frequent than in eyes with exudative age-related macular degeneration (3.6%). In lesions suspicious of exudative age-related macular degeneration or PCV, the RPED with attenuation of internal reflectivity on OCT images strongly supported PCV diagnosis with a sensitivity of 84% and a specificity of 94%. The base diameter (p=0.010) and base diameter times height (p=0.028) of RPED were smaller in PCV than in exudative age-related macular degeneration.

However, since the number of patients sampled was insufficient and the average size of the lesions in the female patients was smaller, the size of the lesion seems to be the most important factor. ","1307":"The aim was to investigate the effect of low dose doxycycline (20 mg) therapy in patients with chronic meibomian gland dysfunction that were refractory to conventional therapy. The randomized prospective study enrolled 150 patients (300 eyes) who have chronic meibomian gland dysfunction and who didn't respond to lid hygiene and topical therapy for more than 2 months. All topical therapy was stopped for at least 2 weeks prior to beginning the study. After conducting the tear break up time test (TBUT) and Schirmer test, the authors randomly divided the patients into three groups a high dose group (doxycycline, 200 mg, twice a day), a low dose group (doxycycline, 20 mg, twice a day) and a control group (placebo). After one month, the author repeated the TBUT and Schirmer tests, and analyzed the degree of symptomatic improvement. Compared to the control group, both the high and low dose group showed statistically significant differences after treatment in TBUT, Schirmer test, the number of symptoms reported and the degree of improvement of subjective symptoms. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the high and low dose group after treatment in TBUT (9.42 +\/- 2.87 sec, 9.54 +\/- 1.58 sec, p=0.726), Schirmer test (19.98 +\/- 4.05 mm, 19.65 +\/- 5.02 mm, p=0.624), the number of symptoms reported (1.45 +\/- 0.62, 1.53 +\/- 0.52, p=0.304), as well as the degree of improvement of subjective symptoms (p=0.288). The high dose group (18 patients, 39.13%) reported side effects more frequently than did the low dose group (8 patients, 17.39%) (P=0.002). Low dose doxycycline (20 mg twice a day) therapy was effective in patients with chronic meibomian gland dysfunction that were refractory to conventional therapy. ","1308":"To evaluate the results of nasolacrimal polyurethane stent implantations for the treatment of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and to determine the effects of various surgical procedures, including stent removal, in subsequent nasolacrimal duct obstruction. This study included 15 patients who had nasolacrimal polyurethane implantations for the treatment of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Occluded stents were removed either by nasal endoscopy or during dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). Cultures and biopsies were performed on the removed stents, and the results of the secondary DCR were analyzed for a 6-month follow-up period. During stent removal surgery, various degrees of chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrous tissue formation were detected in the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct. Formations of granuloma and fibrous tissue were found in 15 eyes, and culture-positive reaction were found in nine of the 15 eyes. Conventional dacryocystorhinostomy surgery was performed in nine of the 15 eyes and a silicone tube was located at the canaliculi. Subjective and objective outcome were favorable in 13 of the 15 eyes. The success rate of nasolacrimal polyurethane stent implantation for the treatment of primary acquired nasolacrimal duct obstruction is low. This may result from a chronic inflammatory reaction. Despite the low success rate of nasolacrimal polyurethane stent implantation, the success rate of endonasal DCR as a subsequent surgery is favorable. ","1309":"To evaluate the efficacy of porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE, Goretex) containing large pores made with a 21-gauge needle as a graft for the correction of lower lid retraction. e-PTFE grafts were implanted between the tarsus and lower lid retractor via a transconjunctival approach with\/without amniotic membrane transplantation, or via a transcutaneous approach. Rabbits were examined and assessed for comeal and conjunctival complications and for e-PTFE graft status. Rabbits were sacrificed for a histological study at 8 weeks postoperatively. e-PTFE grafts were uniformly extruded 3 weeks postoperatively in eyelids operated on via the transconjunctival approach. However, rabbits operated on via the transcutaneous approach demonstrated e-PTFE graft retention; in addition, dense fibrovascular ingrowths into the large pores of e-PTFE were observed histologically. e-PTFE is a good substitute for other graft materials as a spacer in lower lid retraction operations, especially as an interpositional graft using a transcutaneous approach. ","1310":"Dacryocystorhinostomy via an eyelid incision has been described in Western literature. This study was undertaken to confirm that eyelid incision for dacryocystorhinostomy is suitable in Asians, because Asians have anatomic features that differ from those of Westerners. We performed dacryocystorhinostomy with an eyelid incision along skin wrinkles or relaxed skin tension lines in 57 eyelids of 49 patients from July 2003 to December 2004. The medical records of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. Postoperative scars were easily camouflaged by wrinkles or relaxed skin tension lines of the eyelid without major complications. An eyelid incision can be used for dacryocystorhinostomy in Asians, regardless of the lack of a definite lower eyelid crease and the presence of epicanthus.

We experienced a 27-year-old female at 12 weeks of pregnancy, who visited our clinic because of weight loss, gait disturbance, decreased mentality and dizziness after prolonged vomiting for 2 months. Neurological examination demonstrated ataxia of gait and loss of orientation. Ophthalmologic examination showed decreased visual acuity, upbeat nystagmus, diplopia and retinal hemorrhage. We report a relatively rare case of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome with ophthalmic symptoms induced by hyperemesis gravidarum. If a pregnant women has symptoms of severe vomiting along with other ocular findings such as retinal hemorrhage or restricted extraocular movement, one must suspect the diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, and should start appropriate treatment immediately. ","1312":"To present a case of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor which was manifested as an idiopathic subretinal mass without underlying pathology. The subretinal mass was surgically excised and evaluated histopathologically. Fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography were performed pre- and post-operatively. The mass was histologically composed of lymphoplasma cell infiltration and fibrous proliferation without microorganisms or malignant cells. Immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle actin revealed myofibroblasts as a major cellular component. Preoperative optical coherent tomography showed that the lesion was contiguous to the retina while inducing foveal detachment. Postoperatively, the fovea was attached with visual recovery, and the subretinal lesion did not recur during the follow up. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors may be included in the differential diagnoses of subretinal masses. ","1313":"To report a case of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis complicated by Alcaligenes xylosoxidans. A 37-year-old man suffered epidemic keratoconjunctivitis in both eyes. Eleven days later, he developed a corneal ulcer in his left eye. Bacterial staining, culture, and antibiotics sensitivity test were performed from a corneal scrape. The cultures revealed a growth of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, and the patient was treated with ceftazidime and levofloxacin, based on the sensitivity test results. After 21 days of treatment, the infection was resolved with mild scaring and final vision in the left eye of 20\/20. Alcaligenes xylosoxidans should be considered a rare but potential pathogen able to produce comeal ulcer complication in epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.

After primarily cultured human TM cells were exposed to 1, 10, and 100 microM of L-ascorbic acid (LAA), with or without co-administration of 1 mM sodium nitroprusside or 100 microM hydrogen peroxide for 48 hr, cellular survival and NO production were measured with MTT and Griess assay, respectively. LAA significantly potentiated NO production in a dose-dependent manner (p&lt;0.05) without affecting cell viability. LAA increased cell viability after hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. LAA enhanced NO production in TM cells and showed a cytoprotective effect against hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress. LAA might be involved in the regulation of trabecular outflow by enhancing NO production in TM cells. ","1315":"To examine whether citicoline has a neuroprotective effect on kainic acid (KA)-induced retinal damage. KA (6 nmol) was injected into the vitreous of rat eyes. Citicoline (500mg\/kg, i.p.) was administered to the rats once before and twice a day after KA-injection for 3- and 7-day intervals. The neuroprotective effects of citicoline were estimated by measuring the thickness of the various retinal layers using hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining. In addition, immunohistochemistry was conducted to elucidate the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Morphometric analysis of retinal damage in KA-injected eyes showed significant cell loss in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and inner plexiform layer (IPL) of the retinas at 3 and 7 days after KA injection, but not in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). At 3 days after citicoline treatment, no significant changes were detected in the retinal thickness and immunoreactivities of eNOS and nNOS. The immunoreactivities of eNOS and nNOS increased in the retina at 7 days after the KA injection. However, prolonged treatment for 7 days significantly attenuated the immunoreactivities and the reduction of thickness. The results indicate that citicoline has a neuroprotective effect on KA-induced neurotoxicity in the retina. ","1316":"To investigate the morphological characteristics of keratocytes and the interconnection of keratocytes with adjacent keratocytes using the flat preparation method and scanning electron microscopy with a frontal section of the human corneal stroma. The thin, corneal collagen lamellae were carefully dissected from the cornea (n=7), which had been stained by the flat preparation method. The remaining tissue was fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and observed by transmission electron microscopy following the frontal section. The flat preparation revealed the corneal fibroblasts between the lamellae of the collagen fibers and showed that the ramifying cellular processes of the keratocytes were in contact with the cytoplasmic processes or cell bodies of neighboring fibroblasts. Two types of discrete subpopulations of keratocytes were identified: a smaller, cellular type of keratocyte with spindle-shaped nucleus with heterochromatin, and a larger, cellular type with a large indented nucleus with relatively scanty cytoplasm. Collagen fibers ran parallel to each other toward the fenestration of the cytoplasmic wall of the keratocyte. These flat preparation method results showed that the keratocytes within the corneal stroma are interconnected with the adjacent keratocytes, which indicates the presence of a functional communicating network through the keratocyte circuits within the stroma. A smaller, cellular type of keratocyte with spindle-shaped nucleus was morphologically differentiated from a larger, cellular type with a large, indented nucleus by flat preparation and transmission electron microscopy.

Eyes of the surgical group (n=18) underwent surgery on two horizontal rectus muscles, and the control group was the contralateral eyes. CDI of the OA was performed before operation and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 7 and 30. Peak systolic (Vmax), end diastolic (Vmin), and mean (Vmean) blood flow velocities were measured, and resistivity index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were calculated. Vmax, Vmin and Vmean were significantly higher, and RI and PI were significantly lower in the surgical group than in the control group on POD 1 (p&lt;0.05). In the surgical group, Vmax, Vmin and Vmean were significantly higher, and RI and PI were significantly lower, on POD 1 than those measured on other days (p&lt;0.05).

The study subjects were 84 normal individuals, 130 AACG patients, and 86 CACG patients. Color optic disc photographs were evaluated for the presence or absence of 10 qualitative signs to differentiate between normal and glaucomatous optic discs. Abnormally shaped rim width (alteration of ISN'T rule), bared circumlinear vessel, vessel bayonetting, rim width narrower than the temporal sector, and zone beta (nasal and superotemporal sectors) were detected more frequently in the CACG group than in the AACG group (P&lt;0.05). The most accurate qualitative sign was abnormally shaped rim width in both groups. The specificity and sensitivity of abnormally shaped rim width were 71.4% and 60.8% for AACG, and 71.4% and 81.4% for CACG, respectively. The optic disc damage is greater in CACG than in AACG.

This study analyzed 144 eyes of 72 normal children and adolescents by OCTIII (Zeiss-Humphrey, San Leandro, CA., USA) and the results were compared with the RNFL thickness of Korean adults. The mean RNFL thickness of the 72 normal children and adolescents was 105.53 +\/- 10.33 microm. The mean values for left and right eyes were 104.28 +\/- 7.68 microm and 106.79 +\/- 12.98 microm, respectively. There was no significant difference in mean RNFL thickness between the 4 quadrants of the left and right eyes (p=0.926). Additionally, the mean RNFL thickness showed a similar size pattern regardless of age (p=0.99). RNFL thickness was found to be greater in adults than in children or adolescents, although the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.295). Likewise, no significant difference was found with gender (p=0.822) or in the pattern of RNFL thickness of 12 sectors between children and adults (p=0.08). This study reports RNFL thickness, as determined by OCT, for normal children and adolescents. We found this measurement method to be suitable for the early diagnosis of glaucoma and to the examination of its progression in these subjects. The findings could be used as clinical parameters for adolescent glaucoma.

Using Heidelberg retinal tomography (HRT) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), 30 patients with LC, 29 normal subjects, and 31 early glaucoma patients were examined. One eye from each subject was randomly selected. Significant differences between LC and glaucomatous eyes (GE) were found in parameters indicating loss of nerve fibers, such as rim area, rim volume, and mean RNFL thickness. However, there was no difference between LC and normal eyes (NE) in RNFL thickness, rim area, and rim volume. LC was able to be defined as a normal central excavation with a large disc and large CDR with a normal rim area. HRT ONH parameters and RNFL thickness obtained with OCT may be useful for differentiating between glaucoma and LC eyes. ","1321":"To evaluate the effects of laser photocoagulation on reopened macular holes. This study involved 9 eyes from 9 patients who underwent laser photocoagulation coupled with fluid-gas exchange for reopened macular holes. The photocoagulation was performed at the center of the macular hole. Closure of the reopened hole was categorized by optical coherence tomography (OCT) according to the presence (type 1 closure) or absence (type 2 closure) of continuity in the foveal tissue. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), closure types, and complications were assessed. Upon final examination, all macular holes were found to have closed. Six eyes were classified as type 1 closure, and three were classified as type 2 closure. The mean BCVAs, before and after laser photocoagulation, were 0.11 and 0.31, respectively (P&lt;.05). The eyes with type 1 closure were associated with shorter symptom durations and greater visual improvement than those with type 2 closure (P&lt;.05). The combination of laser photocoagulation and fluid-gas exchange appears to be a safe and effective treatment for reopened macular holes. Early intervention should be encouraged to ensure complete hole closure and improved visual outcomes. ","1322":"To verify the clinical correlation between retinopathy progression and the change of venous filling time (VFT), measured before and after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP), in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) patients. We conducted this study on 32 patients (32 eyes) who received PRP for PDR. These patients were subdivided into two groups in accordance with the clinical course of PRP: the stabilized group in which retinal neovascularization was regressed and the progressed group in which retinal neovascularization was continued and a complication, such as vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment, was developed within 12 months of laser treatment. Arteriovenous passage time (AVP) and VFT were measured by video fluorescein angiogram (FAG) using scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) before and after PRP. VFT values were assigned by measuring by the time duration from start of venous lamina flow to the fullness of fluorescence on the vascular arch. In the stabilized group, AVP was decreased by 0.20 +\/- 0.89 sec and VFT was decreased by 0.30 +\/- 1.69 sec through PRP. In the progressed group, AVP was increased in 0.12 +\/- 1.22 sec and VFT was increased by 0.99 +\/- 1.60 sec through PRP. In both groups, the VFT changes were significant (P=0.04) but the AVP changes were not (P=0.34). VFT was significantly decreased in the stabilized group and significantly increased in the progressed group after PRP. Accordingly, we suggest that VFT changes after PRP can be utilized as a prognostic indicator for evaluating clinical course of diabetic retinopathy after performing PRP and for monitoring the clinical effect of PRP. ","1323":"To evaluate the therapeutic effect of umbilical cord serum in the treatment of persistent epithelial defect of the cornea. Fourteen eyes of 14 patients with persistent epithelial defect that had persisted for at least 2 weeks despite conventional treatment were treated with 20% umbilical cord serum eyedrops six times a day. The images of the epithelial defects were captured using a camera attached to a slit lamp biomicroscope and the areas of the epithelial defects were calculated. Treatment was considered effective for epithelial defect healing within 2 weeks, partially effective for healing within 2 to 4 weeks, and ineffective for healing requiring either more than 1 month or additional measures. Mean duration of epithelial defect before treatment was 7.2 +\/- 6.3 weeks, and mean area was 7.86 +\/- 7.32 mm2. Umbilical cord serum therapy was effective in 6 eyes (42.9%), partially effective in 6 (42.9%), and ineffective in 2 (14.2%). Nevertheless, the epithelial defects in both the ineffective eyes were eventually healed within 8 weeks. Mean healing time in effective or partially effective cases was 2.75 +\/- 1.06 weeks.

Many methods of correcting enophthalmos have been reported, especially in patients with orbital wall fracture. The purpose of this study is to review the long term results of effectiveness in superior sulcus deformity correction by subperiosteal Medpor sheet implantation in anophthalmic patients. Subperiosteal Medpor sheets were used in 11 eyes of 11 anophthalmic patients. To estimate the effectiveness, photographs were taken and exophthalmometric value with their own prosthesis using Hertel exophthalmometer was measured in all patients before and after surgery. The overall cosmetic results in superior sulcus deformity were 'excellent' in 3 (27.3%), 'good' in 6 (54.5%), 'fair' in 2 (18.2%). The overall results in enophthalmos were 'excellent' in 3 (27.2%), 'markedly improved' in 4 (36.4%), 'slightly improved' in 4 (36.4%). Most patients had a marked increase in orbital volume, except two patients. They received irradiation treatment in early childhood so showed unsatisfactory results in both superior sulcus deformity and enophthalmos. Subperiosteal Medpor sheet implantation is considered to be a reliable and safe procedure without serious complication and with an excellent cosmetic result. ","1325":"To investigate the surgical results of an ear cartilage graft and supplemental procedures for correcting lower lid retraction combined with entropion in anophthalmic patients. We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of 7 anophthalmic patients with lower lid retraction and entropion, who received a posterior lamellar ear cartilage graft and one or both of lateral tarsal strip or eyelash-everting procedure between March 1998 and March 2003. Preoperative and postoperative lid and socket statuses were also investigated. Ear cartilage grafts were performed in all 7 patients, lateral tarsal strips in 6, and eyelash-everting procedures in 5. Postoperative follow-up durations ranged from 4 to 28 months (average 12.6 months). Retractions were corrected during follow-up in all patients. There were no cases of entropion immediately after surgery. However, the eyelashes of the lower lid returned to an upright position in 4 patients, but not so severe as to touch the ocular prosthesis, and thus did not require surgical correction during follow up. Lower lid retraction combined with entropion in anophthalmic patients can be corrected effectively using an ear cartilage graft with selective, supplemental procedures.

A 23-year-old Asian male patient was examined for a white spot on the left cornea that had been present since birth. On biomicroscopic examination, a well-demarcated vascularized comeal mass was found located nasal to the center. The pupil was displaced superiorly, and gonioscopic examination showed peripheral iridocomeal adhesion at 12 o'clock. The patient underwent penetrating keratoplasty. Histopathologic study showed a variously thickened epithelial layer, an absence of Bowman's layer, subepithelial fibrovascular hyperplasia, and an absence of dermal elements. These histopathologic findings suggested a congenital comeal keloid. The central graft comea remained clear at 18 months after surgery and the patient was satisfied with the result.

","1328":"Pupillary examination is an important objective method to diagnose lesions of the anterior visual pathways. However, errors and faults may easily alter the interpretation and value of the test as it is highly dependent on the examiner's skills. Therefore, we tried to develop a pupillography which is independent of the examiner. Hardware composed of a binocularly measuring instrument adapted for an infrared charge coupled device (CCD) was developed. Two arrays of infrared light emitting diodes (LED) were supplied in front of each of the subject's eyes. A microcontroller to modulate these LED was developed, as was software to save and analyze the pupil images. The hardware was able to deliver a light to either eye or to both eyes, and to change the time, frequency, and intensity of the stimulus. The software automatically analyzed the pupil size and location by image processing. Pupil size was calculated continuously. After artifact elimination, the response amplitudes of the pupils were determined for the right and left pupils. Pupillary images of size 320 x 240, at 30 frames\/second, were saved and processed to evaluate the change of the actual pupil size and the velocity of pupillary response. A pupillography to measure, save and analyze the pupillary response using image processing was developed.

The surgical results in 58 patients who had undergone reoperation for recurrent exotropia (reoperation group) were retrospectively investigated and compared with those of 100 patients who had undergone primary strabismus surgery only (primary operation group) using survival analysis. In the reoperation group, recurrence occurred in 19 of the 58 patients (33%). Survival analysis revealed that the recurrence rates in the reoperation group were significantly lower than those in the primary operation group at the same follow-up period after the corresponding strabismus surgery (p=0.018). The distant esodeviation at the postoperative 1st week after reoperation was the only significant factor associated with the recurrence after reoperation (p=0.01).

Despite the maximally tolerable medical treatment, IOP in the right eye remained above 50 mmHg for four months, and was simultaneously elevated in the left eye. So we performed bilateral trabeculectomy. On the first postoperative day, diffuse retinal hemorrhages were observed in the right eye; however, no retinal hemorrhage was found in the left eye. The hemorrhages resolved completely without consequences two months later. In the case of high IOP for a long period, sudden lowering of IOP may acutely increase the blood flow and consequently rupture multiple retinal capillaries because of altered autoregulatory function.

Mean IOP was elevated from the day after injection and peaked at 20.5 mmHg after 2 months (p=0.000). Twenty-six eyes (43.3%) showed significant IOP elevation. IOP was not controlled despite full glaucoma medication in 7 (11.7%) eyes. Two eyes underwent filtering surgery. Younger age was a statistically significant predictive factor for IOP elevation (p=0.009). In this study, patients who needed filtering surgery developed an IOP spike within one week after the injection. Therefore, clinicians should consider checking IOP at the end of the first week.

Eight-week-old female C57BU6 mice were kept at a constant temperature of 41-42 degrees C for 25-30 minutes. After dark-adaptation for 8 hours, intense light of 11000 lux was maintained for 6 hours. Histology and immunohistochemistry for the inducible heat shock protein 70 (hsp70), the constitutive heat shock protein 70 (hsc70), and westem blot analysis, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for hsp70.1 and hsp70.3 were performed just before photic injury and after 1, 4, 7, and 14 days. Light-induced retinal degeneration was prevented by thermotolerance. After hyperthermia, hsp70 was densely expressed in the inner segment of the photoreceptor layer on the photic injury. Hsp70 expression increased for 4 days after photic injury and slowly decreased thereafter. mRNA from hsp70.3 was induced earlier than that of hsp70.1. Retinal photic injury was prevented by hyperthermia-induced hsp70. Hsp70 from hsp70.3 may be a rapid and short-lived responder, and that from hsp70.1 is a slower and more sustained responder. Hsp70 from hsp70.3 may be an initial retinal chaperone while hsp70 from hsp70.1 may be a sustained chaperone.

Laboratory results disclosed a very low protein C activity level (10%) in the patient and moderately decreased levels in the other family members. Ophthalmic examination showed bilateral corneal opacity and shallow anterior chamber. B-scan ultrasonography which showed intravitreal mass lesions without microphthalmos and a funnel-shaped retinal detachment suggested bilateral retinal dysplasia. As the eyes were under progression of secondary glaucoma, bilateral lensectomies were performed at 2 months old and corneal opacity was regressed to some degree. However, at 14 months old, the left eye showed moderate corneal opacity with a band keratopathy.

The author recorded b-waves (rod response) with red light stimulation and the x-waves (dark-adapted cone response) that appeared before the b-waves. The author also recorded b-waves with blue light stimulation, which had the same amplitude as the b-waves from the red light stimulation. The differences with respect to age and gender were studied. Waveforms of the dark-adapted cone ERGs were recorded by using a digital subtraction technique. The x-wave always appeared before the b-wave with 0 dB (2.4 cd.s\/m2) red stimulation. With blue stimulation, a b-wave equivalent to the b-wave stimulated with the red light of 0 dB intensity appeared at an average of -14.57 dB. The implicit time for the b-wave was delayed significantly for the male group. There were no significant differences between different age groups. The dark-adapted cone ERG demonstrated the waveform of a negative response followed by a series of oscillatory potentials (OPs) and a positive response. The cone responses were followed by the rod responses with red light stimulation of 0 dB in the dark-adapted ERG. The waveforms of the cone ERGs were obtained in dark adaptation with red and blue light stimulation. ","1338":"To evaluate the change of axial length (AL), intraocular pressure (IOP), and corneal astigmatism after scleral shortening with scleral invagination in the rabbit eye. The authors performed scleral shortening (3 mm) with scleral invagination in two groups of 6 eyes each: 180 degrees (group 1) and 360 degrees (group 2). Average AL shortening was more prominent in group 2 (0.5 +\/- 0.17 mm) than in group 1 (0.37 +\/- 0.29 mm), but the difference was not statistically significant. IOP increased immediately after the procedure and was maintained at a high level through 2 months postoperatively. Induced corneal astigmatism was more prominent in group 1 than in group 2. The difference was statistically significant in group 1 (p&lt;0.05) but not in group 2. In the scleral shortening with scleral invagination procedure, a large amount of scleral invagination resulted in more shortening of axial length, but there was more corneal astigmatism in 180-degree invagination of the sclera than in 360-degree. Further research is required to determine the effect of the extent of scleral invagination on the change of these values. ","1339":"To use impression cytology to examine the structural changes in corneal epithelial cells infected with the herpes simplex virus in rabbit eyes. Corneal surfaces of 7 rabbits were scratched using a 25-gauge needle. Herpes simplex virus (type 1, Kos strain) was inoculated to the injured cornea. As the corneal diseases were observed using slit lamp biomicroscopy, impression cytology was performed for 18 days after inoculation. Specimens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined using optical microscopy. Corneal lesions consisted mainly of round epithelial cells, inflammatory cells, ballooning cells, multinucleated giant cells, and various inclusion bodies. Over time, the comeal epithelial cells peeled away as a result of corneal edema in the comeal lesions. Dendritic lesions were also observed. In the recovery phase, the number of detached cells and infiltrated inflammatory cells decreased. It was presumed that dendritic lesions might have been formed at the scratched cornea region, thereby aggravating the epithelial cells falling off as a result of the infiltration of inflammatory cells. These cytopathologic effects occur in experimental herpes simplex keratitis. ","1340":"To investigate the clinical features and course of conjunctival malignant melanoma in Korea. The medical records of 15 patients, 5 males and 10 females, diagnosed with conjunctival malignant melanoma who had been treated at Severance Hospital from May 1991 to March 2004 were reviewed retrospectively. The clinical parameters of the patients, tumors, and treatment were analyzed for their relation to outcome measures. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 53.4 years (+\/- 11.7 years). In all cases, the disease was unilateral and all patients had experienced at least one recurrence. Local lymph node metastasis was found in 3 patients (20%) and the mean time to metastasis was 3.5 years. Systemic metastasis was found in 6 patients (40%) and the mean time to metastasis was 9.3 years. There were 5 cases of tumor-related death (33.3%), 4 of which were attributed to systemic metastasis. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative survival rate were 90% at 30 months and 56.6% at 70 months. Although conjunctival malignant melanoma is a rare disease, it is life-threatening and complete tumor excision at an early stage is mandatory, as is additional therapy to prevent local recurrence and systemic metastasis. ","1341":"Alport syndrome is a hereditary, progressive disease characterized by progressive nephritis, sensorineural deafness, and ocular abnormalities, including anterior lenticonus. The ultrastructure of the lens capsule abnormalities in Alport syndrome is reported. Four anterior lens capsules from 31-year-old patient and 26-year-old patient with lenticonus who were affected by the Alport syndrome were obtained at capsulectomy. And all four anterior lens capsules were examined by transmission electron microscopy. The histopathologic findings showed that the thickness of the anterior lens capsules was decreased (4-13 microm) and that there were many vascular dehiscences localized at the inner part of the lens capsule. There were large numbers of capsular dehiscences containing fibrillar materials and vacuoles. The anterior capsules were clearly fragile in this disease, forming the basis for the progressive lenticonus and anterior polar cataract.","1342":"Simulated Brown syndrome is a term applied to a myriad of disorders that cause a Brown syndrome-like motility. We encountered a case of acquired simulated Brown syndrome in a 41-year-old man following surgical repair of fractures of both medial orbital walls. He suffered from diplopia in primary gaze, associated with hypotropia of the affected eye. We performed an ipsilateral recession of the left inferior rectus muscle as a single-stage intraoperative adjustment procedure under topical anesthesia, rather than the direct approach to the superior oblique tendon. Postoperatively, the patient was asymptomatic in all diagnostic gaze positions.","1343":"The authors report two cases of suddenly deteriorated accommodative esotropia with amblyopia during part-time occlusion therapy. A 7-year-old girl with right accommodative esotropia, which was well controlled, showed marked increase in esodeviation after part-time occlusion and regained orthophoria without occlusion. This phenomenon was repeated. Recession of both medial recti was performed and orthophoria was well maintained at both distant and near targets. Accommodative esotropia of a 9-year-old boy with glasses also showed a striking increase in esodeviation after part-time occlusion. The authors recommended wearing only glasses without occlusion or surgery and he recovered fusion. Three months later, orthophoria was maintained at distant target, with 8PD esophoria at near target with glasses. Although this complication should be considered before occlusion therapy, it must be taken continuously if needed, because an increase of the deviation size with occlusion may simply reflect a true deviation and may not be a poor prognostic sign.","1344":"A 63-year-old female with candidemia following necrotizing pancreatitis developed clinical signs of chorioretinitis and underwent the systemic administration of voriconazole, after which anterior chamber inflammation and multiple, white, fluffy, chorioretinal lesions, under 1mm in diameter, were gradually resolved and visual acuity improved. We report the first Korean case of candida chorioretinitis successfully treated with the systemic administration of voriconazole.","1345":"Sandhoff disease is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disease presenting bilateral optic atrophy and a cherry red spot in the macula. This case report presents the characteristics of a patient with Sandhoff disease as assessed by ophthalmic, neuroimaging, and laboratory procedures. Ophthalmologic examination revealed that the patient could not fixate her eyes on objects nor follow moving targets. A pale optic disc and a cherry red spot in the macula were seen in both eyes. Low signal intensity at the thalamus and high signal intensity at the cerebral white matter were noted in a T2-weighted brain MR image. A lysosomal enzyme assay using fibroblasts showed the marked reduction of both total beta-hexosaminidases, A and B. Based on the above clinical manifestations and laboratory findings, we diagnosed the patient as having Sandhoff disease.","1346":"This prospective study was performed to measure the macular and the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thicknesses using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with anisometropic amblyopia. Thirty-one patients with hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia were included. The macular retinal thickness and the peripapillary RNFL thickness were measured using OCT. The mean refractive error was +3.71 diopters (D) and +1.00 D, the mean macular retinal thickness was 252.5 microm and 249.7 microm, and the mean RNFL thickness was 115.2 microm and 109.6 microm, inthe amblyopic eye and the normal eye, respectively. OCT assessment of RNFL thickness revealed a significantly thicker RNFL in hyperopic anisometropic amblyopia (P=0.019), but no statistically significant difference was found in macular retinal thickness (P&gt;0.05). In conclusion, the amblyopic process may involve the peripapillary RNFL, but not the macula. However, further evaluation is needed.","1347":"We studied the relationship between eye position in the awakened state and in the surgical plane of anesthesia in orthophoric and horizontal strabismus patients. We classified 105 orthophoric and horizontal strabismus patients into 5 groups, measured the eye position at the primary position by photographic measurement of the corneal reflex positions and undertook a quantitative study of eye position. Under general anesthesia, the mean divergence was 39.7+\/-8 PD for the esotropia group, 36.6+\/-11.7 PD for exophoria, 27.4+\/-8.1 PD for orthophoria, and 11.1+\/-10.2 PD for exotropia I (&lt; or =30 PD). Therefore, the esotropia group had the largest amount of divergence among the groups, but the eye position of the exotropia II (&gt;30 PD) group was rather convergent at 11.0+\/-6.5 PD. According to the eye position of the fixating and nonfixating eyes in the esotropia group, both eyes converged with an angle deviation of 14.4+\/-4.8 PD divergent and 14.1+\/-4.8 PD divergent, respectively (P=.71). In the exotropia groups (I, II), the fixating eye diverged but the nonfixating eye rather converged. Therefore, the angle deviation was 19.0+\/-2.1 PD divergent for the fixating eye and 18.2+\/-6.4 PD divergent for the nonfixating eye (P=.68). In conclusion, under general anesthesia, eye positions in the awakened state and in the surgical plane of anesthesia were convergent or divergent, and showed a tendency to converge into the position of 25-35 PD divergent. Therefore, we could not distinguish fixating eye from nonfixating eye under general anesthesia.","1348":"To verify the postoperative ultrastructural changes of the myotendinous nerve endings of feline extraocular muscles, which are known as proprioceptors. Sixteen recti of four cats were used and divided into three groups. In group A, eight lateral recti were recessed. In group B, four medial recti were resected by 10 mm from insertion to include the myotendinous junction. In group C, four medial recti were resected by 4 mm of muscle bellies only, without disturbing the myotendinous junction. Four weeks after surgery, specimens were examined with electron microscopy. In group A, overall neural structures were well maintained with slight axonal degeneration. In group B, only muscle fibers were observed without any regeneration of neural sprouts. In group C, axonal disintegration and shrinkage were evident. These results indicate that myotendinous nerve endings can be damaged in strabismus surgery, and that resection was more invasive than recession in disrupting myotendinous nerve endings.","1349":"This study was performed to evaluate optic disc appearance, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and macular thickness in normal, ocular hypertensive (OHT) and glaucomatous eyes using optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3000. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of 167 consecutive subjects were enrolled: 60 normal, 53 OHT, and 54 glaucomatous. OCT topographic parameters of cup diameter, cup area, rim area, and cup\/disc area ratio were significantly less in OHT eyes than in normal eyes and were significantly less in glaucomatous eyes than in normal and OHT eyes. RNFL was significantly thinner in OHT eyes than in normal eyes in the inferior quadrant, and in glaucomatous eyes than in OHT and normal eyes in the mean and for all four quadrants. Macular thickness was significantly thinner in glaucomatous eyes than in OHT and normal eyes throughout all subdivisions. Optic disc parameters, and RNFL and macular thickness measurements made with OCT may be useful in the clinical assessment of glaucoma.","1350":"The aim of this study is to elucidate the association of neovascularization in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) combined with major arterial insufficiency (MAI), compared with BRVO alone. The authors retrospectively reviewed the charts, color photographs, and fluorescein angiograms of 304 patients (308 eyes) who had BRVO from 1990 to 2002 at Hanyang University hospital. Patients with BRVO combined with MAI and patients with BRVO alone were differentiated by angiographic appearance. Of the 308 eyes, 12 (3.9%) had neovascularization, all of which were in the 56 eyes of the MAI group for which the neovascularization rate was 21.4%. Neovascularization in BRVO was more strongly associated with the non-perfusion caused by MAI, rather than with the extent of the non-perfusion area that originated from retinal capillary obstruction. MAI is considered as a risk factor for neovascularization and hence could be a prognostic factor.","1351":"This study was performed to compare the incidence of posterior capsular opacity (PCO) and refractive errors between hydrophilic (ACR6D, Corneal) and hydrophobic (MA60BM, AcrySof) acrylic intraocular lenses (IOLs) over a 3-year follow-up after phacoemulsification surgery. The patients with AcrySof implanted in one eye and Corneal in the other eye were categorized as Group 1 (n=28), while those with one or both eyes implanted with IOLs of the same kind were categorized as Group 2 (AcrySof, n=90; Corneal, n=95). Refractive errors were evaluated at 3 months and 3 years postoperatively. The incidence of visually significant PCO was investigated 3 years postoperatively. Postoperative refractive values at 3 months were not significantly different between the two groups. However, refractive values at 3 years were significantly different between two IOLs in both groups [AcrySof -0.37+\/-0.43D, Corneal -0.62+\/-0.58D in Group 1 (p=0.04); AcrySof -0.38+\/-0.52, Corneal -0.68+\/-0.54 in Group 2 (p&lt;0.01)]. The incidence of visually significant PCO was 14% and 32% in Group 1, and 13% and 28% in Group 2, for the AcrySof and Corneal implants, respectively. The incidence of visually significant PCO of hydrophilic acrylic IOLs was higher than that of hydrophobic acrylic IOLs in the 3-year follow-up. The postoperative 3-year refractive value of Corneal showed myopic shift.","1352":"This study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the capsular tension ring on posterior capsular opacity in comparison with cases undergoing intraocular lens (IOL) implantation alone. We analyzed 127 eyes which had undergone cataract surgery, including capsular tension ring insertion, along with 127 eyes which had undergone IOL implantation alone by the same surgeon from September 1998 to March 2003. In the insertion group, 41 eyes (group A) had been followed up for more than one year after silicone IOL implantation, as had 40 eyes (group B) in the control group. We compared the incidence, type, and degree of capsular opacity between A and B groups and also endothelial cell loss after surgery between the two groups. For insertion group A, the frequency of posterior capsular opacity was lower(7.3%), the duration to development was longer, and the energy required for Nd-Yag capsulotomy of PCO was less than for control group B (25%) (p=0.037). The endothelial cell count loss rate was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.522). The capsular tension ring is associated with a significantly reduced incidence of posterior capsular opacity and is a safe procedure.","1353":"This study was performed to evaluate the changes of tear film and ocular surface caused by smoking. Symptom scoring, tear film break-up time (BUT), basal tear secretion test, corneal sensitivity test, keratoepitheliopathy scoring, and conjunctival impression cytology were performed in 29 smokers (58 eyes) and 26 non-smokers (52 eyes). Tear film BUT, basal tear secretion, corneal sensitivity, and squamous metaplasia were 7.71+\/-2.66 sec, 6.29+\/-2.85 mm, 53.69+\/-5.69 mm, and 2.45+\/-1.26 in smokers and 9.62+\/-3.14 sec, 10.04+\/-3.87 mm, 56.46+\/-4.79 mm, and 1.12+\/-0.83 in non-smokers, respectively (p&lt;0.05). Symptom score, keratoepitheliopathy score, and goblet cell density were not significantly different between the two groups. Tear film BUT was shorter, basal tear secretion and corneal sensitivity were lower, and squamous metaplasia was higher in heavy smokers than in light smokers. In conclusion, smoking deteriorates the tear film and ocular surface with decreased quantity and quality of tear film, decreased corneal sensitivity, and squamous metaplasia, and this deterioration is related to the amount of smoking.","1354":"We investigated the fibrovascular ingrowth and fibrovascular tissue maturation of hydroxyapatite-coated, porous alumina sphere (Alumina sphere) in comparison with the hydroxyapatite sphere (HAp sphere) in rabbits. Alumina spheres and HAp spheres were implanted in the left orbits of 42 New Zealand white rabbits after enucleation. Fibrovascular ingrowth and maturation were graded from 1 to 5 at postoperative 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks. We defined 4 phases: postoperative 1-2 weeks as phase I, 3-4 weeks as phase II, 8-12 weeks as phase III, and 24 weeks as phase IV. The grade was analyzed at each phases. There was no significant difference in fibrovascular ingrowth and maturation between the two groups at all 4 phases, except phase II at which the Alumina sphere showed significantly lower maturation grade (p&lt;0.05). We concluded that the Alumina sphere is an ideal orbital implant material and an ideal substitute for the HAp sphere in clinical practice.","1355":"To investigate the effect of basic Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF) on fibrovascular ingrowth into porous polyethylene orbital implants (Medpor) and to investigate any differences according to the method of administration. For the treated groups, after evisceration and Medpor implantation, bFGF was administered by soaking Medpor in the bFGF solution, and\/or by injecting bFGF into the Medpor 1 week after the operation. Implants were removed 4 weeks after the operation and examined for the degrees of fibrovascular ingrowth by light microscopy. The percentages of the cross-sectional area of the implant occupied by fibrovascular ingrowth and the numbers of proliferated vessels were significantly higher in the bFGF-treated groups (Mann Whitney test, p&lt;0.05). Administration routes had no effect on the degree of fibrovascular ingrowth (Kruskal-Wallis test, p&gt;0.05). bFGF promoted fibrovascular ingrowth into porous polyethylene orbital implants regardless of the route of administration. Therefore, bFGF might be helpful to prevent complications such as implant exposure.","1356":"Primary lid tuberculosis after lid surgery is a very rare condition and is likely caused by the introduction of bacilli through epithelial injury. Secondary infection, due to direct hematogenous spread or contiguous spread from adjacent structures are more common presentations of lid tuberculosis. The authors experienced a case of primary lid tuberculosis occurring in a 19 year old female after blepharoplasty for making a eyelid crease. Her upper lid skin showed a reddish and non-tender mass lesion measured 3x1 cm, which was diagnosed as the tuberculosis through typical histopathological findings (caseous necrosis), acid-fast bacilli stain and PCR, and treated with anti-tuberculosis medications.","1357":"Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by sensorineural hearing loss, pigmentary disturbances of the skin, hair, and iris, and other developmental defects such as lateral displacement of both medial canthi and lacrimal puncta called dystopia canthorum. While mutations of the PAX3 (paired box) gene have been identified in about 99% of WS type 1 cases, WS type 2 is a heterogeneous group, with about 15% of cases caused by mutations in microphthalmia associated transcription factor (MITF). We have experienced three cases of typical WS type 2 in a Korean family, for whom full ocular examination and genetic studies were performed. The genetic studies revealed no mutation in either PAX3 or MITF genes. The genetic basis, as yet unknown for most cases of WS type 2, might be found with further investigation.","1358":"Strabismus fixus is very rare and the convergent form is rarely accompanied by blepharoptosis. We successfully treated one patient with high myopia whose convergent strabismus fixus, accompanied by blepharoptosis, became severe after cataract surgery. We report the case with a discussion of its pathology. We performed levator advancement operation, bilateral lateral rectus 11 mm resection, and bilateral medial rectus 8 mm recession. The suture was removed after maintaining temporary traction suture for 6 days. Blepharoptosis was completely corrected by postoperative 2 months. Esodeviation was 15PD, which was not increased compared with immediately after surgery. Satisfactory cosmetic outcome was obtained.","1359":"Although there have been a few reported cases of Enterococcal endophthalmitis, this is an unusual case of endophthalmitis complicated with corneal ulcer caused by Enterococcus faecalis. A 67-year-old male patient with diabetes mellitus underwent secondary intraocular lens implantation. Post-operative recovery was uneventful until a wound rupture was noted 3 weeks after the operation. On day 12 after the repair of the wound, endophthalmitis accompanied by wound necrosis and a full-thickness corneal ulcer was detected. His vision was light perception, and Enterococcus faecalis was identified by culture in samples of conjunctival sac, anterior chamber and vitreous humor. After 3 rounds of intravitreal antibiotics injection, the vitreous opacity disappeared on ultrasonographic finding but corneal opacity and corneal neovascularization still remained.","1360":"This study was performed to investigate the changes of tear film and ocular surface in diabetic patients, as well as the ocular and systemic factors related to these changes. We assessed the scoring of keratoepitheliopathy, corneal sensitivity test, tear film break-up time (BUT), Schirmer test, and conjunctival impression cytology in 94 eyes of 47 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in 60 eyes of 30 normal subjects. The degree of keratoepitheliopathy was severe, and the corneal sensitivity, BUT, and tear secretion were significantly reduced in the diabetic patients. Conjunctival impression cytology showed a higher grade of conjunctival squamous metaplasia and lower goblet cell density in the diabetic patients. All parameters were related to the status of metabolic control, diabetic neuropathy, and stage of diabetic retinopathy. We think that diabetic patients with poor metabolic control, neuropathy, and advanced stage of retinopathy should be examined for tear film and ocular surface changes.","1361":"Unilateral or bilateral lateral rectus resection is commonly performed for the correction of residual esotropia, but few results have been reported. Twenty-eight patients with residual esotropia underwent bilateral lateral rectus (BLR) resection. Six months after operation (n = 25), there were 17 (68%) successful cases, 7 (28%) cases of undercorrection, and 1 (4%) case of overcorrection. The success rate at the 24th postoperative month (n = 11) was 72.7%. The success rate for cases of infantile esotropia (n = 18) was higher than that for acquired esotropia (n = 7) at the 6th postoperative month (p = 0.156). The results were not significantly affected by the presence of other deviations (p = 0.387), the performance of other surgery (p = 0.393), the presence of amblyopia (p = 1.00), or the amount of residual esotropia (p = 0.604). Performance of BLR resection in patients with residual esotropia after bilateral medial rectus (BMR) recession is considered appropriate due to its high success rate and provision of a stable alignment during two-year follow up.","1362":"Existing methods of stereoacuity testing need specific glasses or optical device for use. We have designed a new stereoacuity test for the digitalized, random-dot stereogram and researched its clinical usefulness. A digitalized, random-dot, stereoacuity test card was created with a computer program that used a preferred symbol and the designed system was tested along with the Randot preschool stereoacuity, Titmus-fly and Lang tests to compare their sensitivity and specificity. The mean success rate of the digitalized, random-dot test was 98.2%, while the rates of the Randot preschool stereoacuity, Titmus-fly and Lang tests were 89.3%, 74.2% and 86.1%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of the new test were 100% and 95.3%, respectively, which were not that different from those of the Randot preschool stereoacuity, Titmus-fly and Lang tests. We found that the digitalized, random-dot, stereoacuity test has a high success rate and can be appropriately used in medical examinations and follow-up tests for strabismus patients.","1363":"We reviewed the medical records of patients with acute retinal artery obstruction (RAO) and evaluated the importance of transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and carotid Doppler ultrasound in determining causes of cardiac and carotid artery origin in RAO. A retrospective case study conducted in the Department of Ophthalmology, Inha University Hospital, Korea comprised 26 patients presenting with acute RAO who underwent systemic evaluation, TTE and carotid Doppler ultrasound between June 1, 1997 and December 31, 2003. Among these 26 patients, abnormal cardiac findings were detected in 12 (46%) and abnormal carotid findings in 4 (15%). Furthermore, other risk factors for RAO were found in 2 (8%) and stroke broke out within 7 months after experiencing RAO in 4 (15%) of the 26 patients. In patients with acute RAO, TTE and carotid Doppler ultrasound play an important role in pinpointing the origins of retinal emboli. It is thought that TTE and carotid Doppler ultrasound may be essential examinations for determining the underlying cause, planning treatment strategies, and preventing stroke and death.","1364":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anatomical outcomes of vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane removal in highly myopic eyes with retinal detachment caused by a macular hole. Nineteen, consecutive, highly myopic eyes with full thickness macular hole with retinal detachment were treated by vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane removal, endolaser photocoagulation on the center of the hole and fluid gas exchange. In five eyes with other peripheral breaks, scleral buckling (3 cases), encircling (1 case) and barrier laser (1 case) were combined. In 15 eyes (79.0%) the macular hole was closed after the initial surgery. In 4 eyes (21%) the macular hole was reopened, but these were successfully treated with fluid gas exchange (1 case) or macular buckling (3 cases). The visual acuity was improved in 15 eyes (79.0%). In conclusion, these results suggest that the removal of the perifoveal internal limiting membrane may be an important adjuvant in the treatment of the myopic macular hole with retinal detachment.","1365":"This study evaluated the effects of glucose in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to investigate the cause of diabetic retinal complications. Human RPE cells were cultured in media containing 5.5 mM, 11.0 mM, and 16.5 mM D-glucose. The present study performed proliferation and migration assays, and conducted western blotting for the protein expression, as well as RT-PCR for the mRNA expression, of MMP-2 and -9, and TIMP-1 and -2. The results of the western blotting analysis showed that increasing glucose concentration significantly increased the expression of MMP-2 and -9, but significantly decreased the expression of TIMP-1 and -2. Moreover, the RT-PCR results indicated significant increases in the mRNA expression of MMP-2 and -9, as well as of TIMP-1 and -2, by raising glucose concentration. This study provides fundamental data for future research on the mechanism of retinal complication in diabetic patients.","1366":"We evaluated the effect of a basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and saporin conjugate (bFGF-SAP) on proliferation, migration and tubule formation in bovine choriocapillary endothelial cells (BCECs). Cell proliferation and MTS assays were done with 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nM bFGF-SAP, and an equimolar concentration of bFGF and saporin. TUNEL assay was performed to confirm apoptosis. Cells were treated with 1, 10, and 100 nM bFGF-SAP and migration assay and tubule formation assay were done. Results were evaluated with image analysis. All experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three times. Viable cells (ID50 = 0.62) and cell proliferation by MTS assay (ID50 = 0.75 nM) were inhibited. Saporin caused cytotoxicity and inhibition of proliferation at high concentration. DNA fragmentation was identified by TUNEL assay. Migration and tubule formation were also inhibited. All mechanisms responsible for neovascularization were inhibited, and this could be applied in the management of subretinal choroidal neovascularization (SRN).","1367":"We investigated pseudophakic residual astigmatism in order to minimize postoperative refractive astigmatism. We examined 110 eyes of 87 patients who had undergone phacoemulsification with small incision and posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Corneal astigmatism was measured using an autokeratometer (RK-5, canon), refractive astigmatism by manifest refraction, and residual astigmatism by vector analysis. Mean pseudophakic residual astigmatism was +0.47 x 176 degrees, predominantly against-the-rule. Variations of pseudophakic residual astigmatism according to sex, age and IOL type were not statistically significant. When performing cataract surgery as refractive surgery, we may consider that pseudophakic residual astigmatism is approximately 0.50D against-the-rule.","1368":"To estimate the rate of visual field progression in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), we reviewed the medical records of POAG and PACG patients who had a minimum of 5-year longitudinal Goldmann visual field data. I4e and I2e isopters were quantified using grid systems. The rate of change was calculated from the slope of a linear fit to a series of average visual field scores. Twenty-three eyes of POAG patients and 25 of PACG patients were studied. The rate of visual field score change was -2.00 +\/- 2.0% per year in the PACG group, and -0.81 +\/- 1.0% per year in the POAG group. In these two patient groups, who were on conventional treatment at two referral hospitals, better visual field on initial presentation yielded faster progression in the POAG group, while the higher average of highest intraocular pressure in each year during follow-up was related to faster progression in the PACG group.","1369":"We investigated the relationship between the circumferential extent of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and the severity of visual field defects in primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Correlations between visual field defects and the extent of PAS were analyzed in 73 eyes; 28 with and 45 without acute attacks. Spearman's correlation coefficient between the severity of visual field defects and the extent of PAS was 0.348 (P = 0.003) in all subjects (n = 73), 0.377 (P = 0.012) in the PACG eyes without acute attacks (n = 45), and 0.338 (P = 0.079) in the eyes with acute attacks (n = 28). Our results showed a statistically significant correlation between the extent of PAS and the severity of visual field damage in PACG overall, and especially in PACG patients without a history of acute attacks.","1370":"The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the frequency doubling technology (FDT) screening algorithm and parapapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in the eyes of glaucoma suspects and patients with open angle glaucoma. FDT C20-1 screening program and a scanning laser polarimetry (SLP) system (GDx-NFA) was used to assess 53 glaucomatous eyes, 53 glaucoma suspects and 36 normal control eyes. In glaucomatous eyes, there were correlations between the FDT the screening algorithm and RNFL retardation values in several polarimetric indices, most significantly \"inferior thickness\" (r = -0.321, P = 0.029). In the eyes of glaucoma suspects, however, we observed no correlation between the FDT results and RNFL retardation values (r = 0.080, P &gt; 0.05, \"inferior thickness\"). In glaucomatous eyes, the abnormal scores obtained with FDT screening program correlated negatively with RNFL retardation values, as measured by SLP. Despite poor correlation between the FDT abnormal score and RNFL retardation value in glaucoma suspects, detection of abnormality using the FDT screening protocol may aid in the assessment of early glaucomatous structural damage.","1371":"Air-bags have received widespread support as an effective means of enhancing automotive safety, and they are becoming more common as standard automobile equipment on many cars. Although air-bag induced ocular injuries are rare, they present a serious concern because of the possibility of permanent damage or visual impairment. To date, most reports have investigated ocular injury from high velocity motor vehicle accidents and reports of ocular injury from low speed motor vehicle accidents have been rare. We describe a patient who sustained severe ocular injury, including periorbital fracture, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, and choroidal rupture of the macular area, due to an inflated air-bag in a low speed motor vehicle accident.","1372":"Aicardi syndrome is a severe congenital disorder characterized by infantile spasms, chorioretinal lacunae, and agenesis or hypogenesis of the corpus callosum. A 6 month old female had developed abnormal eye movement and seizures of the complex partial type and myoclonic type. MRI pictures of the patient revealed the presence of genu associated with agenesis of the rest of corpus callosum. A funduscopic examination revealed bilateral small, solitary, pale areas with sharp borders, some of which had minimal surrounding pigmentation (chorioretinal lacunae), especially clustered around the disc, and they were more prominent on the left side. We report here on the unusual findings of a complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure and the atypical EEG finding in addition to the well-known characteristic clinical and imaging findings of a patient with Aicardi syndrome.","1373":"This study analyzed a hospital-based study to investigate the incidence and clinical features of ocular traumatic emergencies in Korea. Over a 6-year period, 1809 patients with ocular traumatic emergency each individually underwent clinical study including subject characteristics, type of ocular emergency, disease severity, etiology of ocular trauma, injury location, cause of decreased visual acuity, management of ocular injury, and final visual acuity. The homogeneity of each finding of the clinical features of ocular traumatic emergency was tested by an X2 test at a 95% level of certainty. During follow-up periods ranging from 3 days to 23 months (mean 2.0 months), the 1809 patients with ocular traumatic emergency, 1183 males (65.4%) and 626 females (34.6%), were studied. The incidence of ocular emergencies peaked in the third decade of life, irrespective of gender (P &lt; 0.05). Corneal abrasion was the most common etiology among 1,552 (85.8%) closed injuries, and corneal laceration among 257 (14.2%) open injuries (P &lt; 0.05). There were 542 cases (30%) of severe ocular injury, such as penetrating ocular injury, blow out fracture, and intraocular foreign body (IOF), and 1267 (70%) of less severe ocular injury, such as superficial ocular injury or contusion. The most common etiology of severe ocular injury was penetrating ocular injury, and that of less severe injury was corneal injury (P &lt; 0.05). The main causative activity of ocular injuries was work in 631 cases (34.9%), assault in 398 (22.0%), play in 278 (15.4%), traffic accidents in 145 (8.0%) and sports in 128 (7.1%). Five hundred and fifty-four cases (32.5%) underwent surgical intervention. There was an improvement of visual acuity in 502 cases (70.1%), no change in 122 (17.0%), and worsening in 92 (12.9%). We suggest that preventive educational measures be instigated at workplaces to reduce the incidence of ocular traumatic emergency, especially severe ocular injury.","1374":"This is a report of an atypical case of progressive outer retinal necrosis (PORN) and the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the clinical course of viral retinitis in an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patient. A 22-year-old male patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presented with unilaterally reduced visual acuity and a dense cataract. After cataract extraction, retinal lesions involving the peripheral and macular areas were found with perivascular sparing and the mud-cracked, characteristic appearance of PORN. He was diagnosed as having PORN based on clinical features and was given combined antiviral treatment. With concurrent HAART, the retinal lesions regressed, with the regression being accelerated by further treatment with intravenous acyclovir and ganciclovir. This case suggests that HAART may change the clinical course of PORN in AIDS patients by improving host immunity. PORN should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute unilateral cataract in AIDS patients.","1375":"We retrospectively evaluated the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of 20 pseudophakic retinal detachment (RD) patients (20 eyes) and 17 aphakic RD patients (17 eyes). Males were predominated in both groups. The time interval between cataract extraction and RD was 31 months on average in the pseudophakic group, 32 months with intact posterior capsule and 27 months with ruptured posterior capsule, and 148 months in the aphakic group. In 50% of cases with ruptured posterior capsule in the pseudophakic group, RD occurred within 1 year. The anatomic success rate was 95% in the pseudophakic group and 88% in the aphakic group. The most common cause of failure was the development of proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Visual acuities more than 20\/40 after RD surgery were found in 13 pseudophakic (65%) and 6 aphakic (36%) eyes. Aphakic patients were more inclined to have silent RD than pseudophakic patients because of their poor visual acuity. Post-operative follow-up is required especially for the first 1 year in cases of damaged posterior capsule due to the high incidence of RD during this period.","1376":"A 45-year-old man with retinitis pigmentosa (RP), who had undergone uneventful extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) in his right eye eight years previously, and phacoemulsification in his left eye six years previously, had spontaneously dislocated intraocular lenses (IOL) within the capsular bag in both eyes one month apart. We removed the dislocated IOLs, and performed anterior vitrectomy and scleral fixation of the new IOLs. Mild contraction of the capsular bags and uneven distribution of the zonular remnants' clumps along the equator of the capsules were found by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) examination. In this study, we propose the correlation between RP and zonular weakness. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of bilateral spontaneous dislocation of IOLs within the capsular bag of an RP patient.","1377":"A 28-year-old female presented with a palpable mass lesion on the superonasal aspect of her right globe and she had a progressive diplopia. She had a scleral encircling surgery with a Miragel explant (MIRA, Waltham, Mass, USA) for the tractional retinal detachment associated with pars planitis 9 years previously. On examination, she revealed restricted eye movements of her right eye. The magnetic resonance imaging documented a swelling of the Miragel explant that mimicked a periorbital mass lesion. The Miragel explant was removed and fragmentation of the explant was found intraoperatively. The removed Miragel explant was examined by a scanning electron microscopy, and this demonstrated a disintergrated and swollen structural composition of the Miragel explant. Postoperatively, her extraocular movement was almost restored and the retina remained well attached. Alterations in the structural composition of the Miragel explant results in an excessive swelling that causes a restriction of the extraocular movement, and this can mimick a periorbital mass lesion.","1378":"Neovascularization at the disc (NVD) is the most serious complication in diabetic retinopathy, and leads to vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment. We report two cases of spontaneous regression of NVD in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Two men (31 and 46 years old) with diabetes had NVD in both eyes. They were treated with panretinal photocoagulation on the left eye first, but their right eyes went untreated, because they did not revisit our clinic for several months. Fortunately, on revisit, their neovascularization had disappeared a few months later in both eyes, including their untreated right eyes. We could not find any specific causes for the spontaneous regression of the new vessels.","1379":"The aim was to investigate the proteolytic activity of plasmin and its long-term complications. Plasmin was injected into the vitreous cavity of rabbits' eyes. Slit lamp biomicroscopy and electroretinography were performed. Rabbits were serially sacrificed at four months, and globes fixated and prepared for light and transmission electron microscopy. In both the plasmin-injected and control eyes, electroretinography showed a transient decrease in the amplitude, but this recovered to the baseline level in a week. Under the light microscope, the plasmin-treated eyes had a smooth retinal surface, implying separation of the vitreous cortex from the retina. In the control eyes, the collagen fibers remained on the retinal surface. By transmission electron microscopy, the plasmin-treated eyes showed a vitreous-free retinal surface, but no vitreoretinal separation was observed in the control eyes. Plasmin induces a cleavage between the vitreous and the internal limiting membrane, with no long-term complications, so may be a useful pharmacologic adjunct to vitrectomy.","1380":"The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the multi-zone cross-cylinder method as compared with the single method for astigmatism correction using LASIK. This prospective study enrolled 40 patients (52 eyes) who underwent the cross-cylinder method using LASIK, and 52 patients (60 eyes) who underwent the single method using LASIK: all patients were given a diagnosis of complex myopic astigmatism from the department of ophthalmology of this hospital between January 2002 and July 2003. Preoperatively, the mean spherical equivalent refraction was -3.85 +\/- 1.13 D in the cross-cylinder group and -4.05 +\/- 1.20 D in the single method group (p = 0.23). The mean cylinder was -2.05 +\/- 1.58 D in the cross-cylinder group and -1.95 +\/- 1.12 D in the single method group (p = 0.31). 6 months after treatment the results were a mean spherical equivalent refraction of -0.26 +\/- 0.30 D in the cross-cylinder group and -0.34 +\/- 0.35 D in the single method group (p = 0.13). The mean cylinder was -0.38 +\/- 0.29 D in the cross-cylinder group and -0.45 +\/- 0.30 D in the single method group (p = 0.096). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups. The mean BCVA was not different from mean preoperative BCVA in both groups (i.e., 0.98 +\/- 0.10, 0.96 +\/- 0.25, p = 0.86). Postoperatively, patient complications that included night halo, glare and corneal haze were not noted in either group. In conclusion, the results of cross-cylinder method are no different from the single method for the correction of a complex astigmatism. In the future, studies will have to be conducted to assess the efficacy of the cross-cylinder method in consideration of those factors that can affect the postoperative outcome.","1381":"The goal of this study was to evaluate the function of hyaluronic acid (HA) on the active oxygen release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and the protective effect of bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCEC) from activated PMNs. We used HA with three different molecular weights (MW 700,000, 2,000,000, and 4,000,000) and five different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 2, and 3 mg\/ml). We evaluated the amount of released superoxide from activated PMNs by using dismutase-inhibitable ferricytochrome C reduction. To compare the property and protective effect of HA with those of other viscoelastic substances, we used the same concentration of methylcellulose. HA suppressed superoxide release from PMNs and protected BCEC from activated PMNs in a dose-dependent, rather than a molecular weight-dependent, manner. The effect of HA reached almost a plateau at concentration above 2 mg\/ml. However, methylcellulose, another viscoelastic substance, showed a similar effect. Therefore, it seems that the suppression of superoxide released from PMNs is not a property that is unique to HA, but is a general property of viscoelastic substances. Our results indicate that the action mechanism of HA proceeds not only through cell surface HA-receptor. We think that HA also acts as a physical barrier and\/or a scavenger of superoxide.","1382":"Glaucoma is characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Retrograde axoplasmic transport blockade and excitotoxicity were proposed to be a major cause of RGC apoptosis. We conducted this study to characterize the episcleral vessel cauterization glaucoma model in the rat with respect to decreased retrograde axoplasmic flow and subsequent apoptotic RGC death. After episcleral vessels were cauterized in Sprague-Dawley rats, Fluorogold was injected into their superior colliculi by stereotactic method. Retrograde axoplasmic flow and TUNEL-stained apoptotic dead cells were observed microscopically. Elevated intraocular pressure was maintained for up to 6 weeks during follow-up. Retrograde axoplasmic flow to the rat retina was significantly decreased. Apoptotic RGC was selectively TUNEL-stained in the retina, especially at the ganglion cell layers. We concluded that elevated intraocular pressure caused apoptotic RGC death through retrograde axoplasmic flow blockage. Further studies will elucidate the neuroprotection strategies in glaucoma patients.","1383":"This study was performed to demonstrate the ultrasound, biomicroscopic and dimensional changes of angle structure after laser iridotomy (LI) and primary trabeculectomy (PT) in primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). Angle-opening distance at a point 500 m from the scleral spur (AOD500), trabecular-iris angle (theta1), trabecular ciliary process distance (TCPD), ciliary process-iris angle (CPI), iris thickness (ID1, ID3), length of iris-lens contact distance (ILCD) and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were assessed before and after each procedure. Thirteen patients with LI and 16 with PT were prospectively enrolled. There were statistically significant increases in AOD500, theta1, and ILCD in both groups. CPI was decreased in both groups. ACD, TCPD, and iris thickness were not changed significantly. The changes in angle configuration after LI or PT may result more from alterations in aqueous pressure gradients across the iris and the changes of configuration were greater in the iris roots without rotation of ciliary body. However, we didn't find any significant differences in the changes of parameters between the two procedures.","1384":"We investigated the ability of the GDx-Nerve Fiber Analyzer (NFA) to discriminate between normal and early glaucomatous eyes among Korean individuals by reviewing the medical records of 217 consecutive subjects: 61 early glaucoma patients, 68 ocular hypertensive patients, and 88 normal subjects. GDx parameters were compared using ANOVA. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve for each GDx-NFA variable was used to diagnose each parameter, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the association between GDx-NFA parameters and visual field indices in early glaucoma. The best GDx parameters to discriminate between early glaucomatous and normal subjects were the number, maximum modulation, ellipse modulation and inferior ratio (i.e. area under the ROC curve &gt; 0.8). A value for the Number of equal to or greater than 27 was optimal for detecting early glaucoma, with a sensitivity of 80.3% and specificity of 80.7%. In addition, symmetry was positively correlated with the corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD) among visual field indices in early glaucoma.","1385":"Blowout fractures, fractures of an orbital wall, are a common result of orbital injury. The author has experienced a case of a 66-year-old man who sustained a blowout fracture of the orbital wall with his intact eyeball entrapped within the ethmoid sinus. After undergoing a successful reduction surgery, the eyeball was repositioned to its original position, but the patient lost extraocular motility as well as vision. The final visual acuity was perception of light as a result of traumatic optic nerve injury and secondary retinal ischemia.","1386":"As small astrocytic hamartomas can sometimes be missed during routine ophthalmoscopy in patients with tuberous sclerosis, fluorescein and\/-or indocyanine green angiography maybe more helpful in identifying such small astrocytomas. In fluorescein angiography, astrocytomas show gradually increasing hyperfluorescence due to the vascular permeability of astrocytomas. In indocyanine green angiography, astrocytomas appear hypocyanescent, most prominently during the late phases. We report the indocyanine green angiographic findings of retinal astrocytomas in a patient with tuberous sclerosis.","1387":"To clarify the diabetic complications mediated by increased platelet activity, we undertook a study of the mean platelet component (MPC), as determined by an automated hematologic analyzer (ADVIA 120, Bayer). Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and fibrinogen were also measured to investigate blood viscosity abnormalities. MPC was determined in 100 healthy controls and in 100 diabetic patients, the latter of which were subdivided into no diabetic retinopathy (DR) (n = 25), nonproliferative DR (n = 30), and proliferative DR (n = 45) groups. The mean MPC level was 26.9 g\/dl in the control group and 22.5 g\/dl in the diabetic patients (p &lt; 0.05). PT and aPTT were similar for the diabetic patients and the controls; however, their corresponding fibrinogen levels were significantly different between the two groups(3.26 +\/- 1.14 g\/L vs. 4.21 +\/- 2.35 g\/L, p &lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that platelet hyperfunction in diabetic patients may be implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.","1388":"Our purpose is to evaluate the correlation of retinal venous filling time (VFT), which reflects the peripheral retinal microcirculation in diabetic retinopathy, with fluorescein angiography (FAG) findings such as microaneurysm (MA), non-perfusion area (NP), neovascularization (NV) and relative retinal venous diameter (RRVD), and further, to evaluate the correlation between arteriovenous passage time (AVPT) and these factors. Partial F-test (multiple regression analysis) was performed on patients (32 eyes of diabetic retinopathy) who underwent video FAG, using scanning laser ophthalmoscope. In the four quadrants, VFT was compared with each MA, NP, and NV at each vascular arch at a distance of one disc diameter distant from the optic disc. VFT was significantly correlated to RRVD, NP, and NV at each quadrant (r &gt; 0.7). However, AVPT was not significantly correlated to any of the factors studied. Delayed VFT was associated with the hemodynamic change of the peripheral retinal microcirculation at each quadrant in diabetic retinopathy. VFT can be used as an index to indicate the peripheral microcirculation of the retina.","1389":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of scleral fixation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens and an anterior vitrectomy through sclerotomies, 1 mm posterior to the limbus. The study comprised of seven eyes that required a scleral fixation. Sclerotomies, 1 mm posterior to the limbus, were performed using a 20G sclerotome at the 2 and 8 o'clock positions. Group 1 was defined as four eyes requiring scleral fixation of the secondary IOL (Intraocular lens), and group 2 as three eyes where dislocated IOLs were repositioned and fixed to the sclera via sclerotomy sites. In all the eyes, the knot of string (10-0 prolene, W1713, Ethicon, USA) was buried. Postoperatively, the visual acuity was greatly improved, by more than 4 lines in the Snellen visual acuity chart, with the exception of one case of macular degeneration. The scleral fixation of the IOL through sclerotomies, 1 mm posterior to the limbus, had advantages in that the scleral fixation of the IOL could be achieved through sclerotomy sites, and the anterior vitrectomy parallel to the iris plane.","1390":"We investigated the results of cataract surgery in acute angle-closure glaucoma patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) was not controlled with conventional treatment. We compared postoperative IOP and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with preoperative data in 10 eyes of 10 patients who had undergone cataract surgery for acute angle-closure glaucoma. Initial and preoperative mean IOP were 50.0 +\/- 6.4 mmHg and 34.9 +\/- 9.3 mmHg, respectively. Mean follow-up was 6.3 +\/- 5.9 months. Postoperative mean IOP was 12.0 +\/- 4.2 mmHg. All eyes were controlled at less than 21 mmHg and seven of them (70%) were controlled at less than 21 mmHg without medication. Postoperative BCVA was improved in 9 eyes. The complications were transient IOP elevation in 2 eyes and exudative membrane in 4. Cataract surgery may be effective to control IOP and improve visual acuity in patients with acute angle-closure glaucoma. However, follow up is necessary because of a high incidence of postoperative complications.","1391":"The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of hypotony and the effectiveness of medical and surgical treatment. A total 117 eyes of 103 patients that underwent trabeculectomy with mitimycin C (MMC) between 1993 and 2000 were reviewed. Hypotony was treated with the following methods in a stepwise manner: medical treatment, intrableb autologous blood injection, additional sutures to the scleral flap, necrotic bleb excision and advancement of the forniceal conjunctival flap. Hypotony developed in 30 eyes (25.6%) of 26 patients, among, which hypotonic maculopathy developed in 11 eyes (9.4%). The risk factors of hypotony were young age and primary open angle glaucoma. Because of no light sense, 6 of the 30 hypotonic eyes were not treated. Nineteen (79.2%) of the 24 treated hypotonic eyes were successfully managed. Five eyes, 3 with hypotony but maintaining visual acuity and 2 with follow-up loss, were not included in the success group. The mean intraocular pressure (IOP) before treatment, 2.5 +\/- 1.2 mmHg, increased to 8.3 +\/- 4.0 mmHg at 18.5 months follow-up. The stepwise treatment seems to be a useful method to manage hypotony after trabeculectomy with MMC.","1392":"In order to compare the clinical efficacy of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membrane-tube implant (MT implant) and Ahmed implant in the treatment of refractory glaucoma, the medical records of the patients who had been followed-up for more than 1 year after glaucoma implant surgery were reviewed retrospectively. Either MT or Ahmed implants were selected randomly and implanted by one surgeon in patients with refractory glaucoma. There was no significant difference in clinical variables such as age, intraocular pressure and ocular surgery history between the MT implant and Ahmed implant groups (n = 20 eyes of 19 patients in each group) before surgery. The course of change in intraocular pressure and the number of anti-glaucoma medications were not significantly different between the 2 groups during the entire study period (p &gt; 0.1). Kaplan-Meier analysis for intraocular pressure control between 6 and 21 mmHg showed 90% and 95% at 6 months, and 85% and 85% at 12 months, in the MT and Ahmed groups, respectively (p = 0.982). A few self-limiting complications, all within the first month after surgery, were noted in each group. In this study, MT implant showed comparable results to Ahmed implant. MT implant may be useful as a good substitute for other currently used implants without any loss in efficacy or increase in risk, and with potential advantage coming from its soft consistency and small volume.","1393":"To evaluate the effect of epinephrine on the cellular proliferation and production of nitric oxide (NO) in trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, cultured porcine TM cells were exposed to epinephrine at various concentrations, with and without its NO inhibitor, N(omega)-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The proliferation of TM cells and the production of NO were quantified by rapid colorimetric assays. Acridine orange\/Hoechest 33342 staining and flow cytometry were done to evaluate apoptosis. Epinephrine inhibited the proliferation of cultured TM cells and produced NO at significant levels in a dose-dependent manner. However, the antiproliferative effect of epinephrine was abolished by L-NAME. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometric analysis revealed that epinephrine induced apoptotic cell death, which was suppressed by L-NAME. The current results suggest that the inhibitory effect of epinephrine on TM cell survival is associated with NO production. NO-mediated apoptosis may be involved in this epinephrine-induced antiproliferative effect on TM cells.","1394":"The anterior corneal surface is one of the most important elements determining the optical performance of the eye. Corneal topography provides quantitative data about the anterior corneal surface. We studied the corneal topography of 200 normal corneas in 110 adult subjects. All of the eyes were examined using the Corneal Analysis System (EyeSys 2000, Houston, Texas). The topographic maps were grouped into the following patterns: round, oval, symmetric bow tie, asymmetric bow tie, and irregular. The symmetric and asymmetric bow tie patterns were the most common topographic pattern (33.0%, and 32.5%, respectively) in our study population, followed by oval (14.5%), irregular (12.5%), and round (7.5%) patterns. The mean corneal astigmatism calculated from videokeratographic data was 0.32 D for round, 0.63 D for oval, 1.16 D for symmetric bow tie, 1.21 D for asymmetric bow tie, and 0.43 D for irregular patterns. There were significant differences among the corneal astigmatic values in the topographic patterns (p &lt; 0.01, Gabriel post hoc test). The distributions of symmetric and asymmetric bow tie patterns were skewed toward greater amounts of corneal astigmatism. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the relationship between topographic patterns and corneal astigmatism and should provide one possible normal standard for corneal topography in Korean adults.","1395":"We evaluated the change of corneal endothelium after trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C soaking (0.2 mg\/ml, 2.4 +\/- 1.2 minutes) and the effect of viscoelastic material in reducing this change. In randomly selected cases, 0.05 ml of sodium hyaluronate(Healon) was injected into anterior chamber (Healon group, n = 20), and same amount of balanced salt solution was injected in the other eyes (Control, n = 18) at the beginning of surgery. There were no differences in clinical variables and specular microscopy result between 2 groups before surgery. After surgery, the change of endothelial cells were significantly reduced in Healon group (cell density; -2.5 +\/- 1.6%, variability of cell area; 5.8 +\/- 2.5%, and percentage of hexagonal cell; -2.2 +\/- 0.7%) compared to control group (-7.7 +\/- 6.0%, 8.9 +\/- 4.4%, and -4.8 +\/- 3.5% respectively, p &lt; 0.01). In trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C, the damage to the corneal endothelium was reduced significantly by injecting the viscoelastic material without significant complication.","1396":"To describe the clinical outcome of a new surgical treatment for the acute stages of severe corneal burn injury and its complications, a prospective study of five acute corneal burn patients with severe limbal damage was performed. Amniotic membrane transplantation (AMT) and conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU) was performed at the acute stage of corneal burn injury to reconstruct the damaged ocular surface (step I). Three to six months later, the opaque central part of the amniotic membrane containing in vivo grown corneal stem cells were removed and retransplanted to the defect created after the removal of pseudopterygium (step II). All injured eyes were successfully treated, but in one eye with marked stromal lysis, three-layered AMT and penetrating keratoplasty with retransplantation of in vivo grown corneal stem cells was performed. In the former cases, visual acuity was greatly improved more than three lines (ranging from 3 to 12 lines). In short, retransplantation of in vivo grown corneal stem cells after AMT and CLAU is a recommendable modality for restoring a stable corneal epithelium of a severely burned ocular surface in the acute stage and can be considered a preventative measure for avoiding late onset complications.","1397":"Phthiriasis palpebrarum is a rare disease in which crab lice infest the eyelashes. It can cause pruritic lid margins or unusual blepharoconjunctivitis and is difficult to diagnose and treat. We diagnosed and managed a case of phthiriasis palpebrarum in both upper eyelids, accompanied by nits, on the scalp of a 6 year-old female child. We removed the eyelashes, including lice and nits, by pulling with fine forceps without sedation. On the second month after treatment, all lice and nits were eradicated without recurrence and the eyelashes grew back. In conclusion, phthiriasis palpebrarum can be diagnosed by close examination of the eyelashes and eyelid margins with slit lamp and can be managed mechanically.","1398":"To the best of our knowledge, isolated bilateral oculomotor nuclear palsy has not yet been reported in the literature, while bilateral oculomotor nuclear palsy with more widespread rostral brainstem infarction has often been reported. We present a patient having 'top of the basilar syndrome' with midbrain infarction selectively involving the bilateral oculomotor nucleus. A 61-year-old woman with two episodes of vertebrobasilar infarction presented with sudden onset of bilateral ptosis. Examination revealed pronounced bilateral ptosis. In the primary position, fixation of either eye produced an approximately 50 prism diopter exotropia. Adduction of the right eye was restricted to the midline. There was moderately decreased adduction of the left eye, severe limitation of depression, and moderately decreased elevation of both eyes. Abduction of both eyes was normal. The pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light. Bilateral ptosis is suggestive of oculomotor nuclear palsy. On the basis of clinical findings alone, we could not establish whether the precise location of the lesion was all the subdivisions of the oculomotor nucleus except the Edinger-Westphal nucleus or the central caudal nucleus and bilateral fascicles. However, because axial MRI showed a small midbrain infarct in the oculomotor nucleus region, we concluded that she had an isolated, pupil-sparing, bilateral oculomotor nuclear palsy caused by midbrain infarct.","1399":"A case of a juvenile xanthogranuloma of the corneoscleral limbus was encountered in a 5-year-old oriental boy, who presented with a 5-month history of a lump in the right eye. The lesion extended from the inferior limbus. This yellow-orange mass was vascular and firmly fixed to the underlying tissue. The lesion was diagnosed preoperatively as an atypical dermolipoma and an uneventful excisional biopsy was performed. The pathologic diagnosis showed the characteristic picture of a juvenile xanthogranuloma with numerous Touton giant cells. Dermoid and lipodermoid tumors, as a corneoscleral limbal mass, are the most frequently encountered in childhood. A juvenile xanthogranuloma is a rare and usually benign skin disease with an unknown cause, which occurs in infants and young children. However, it can occur also as a corneoscleral limbal mass in young children.","1400":"Choroideremia is a rare hereditary disease with characteristic fundus that causes night blindness and peripheral visual field loss. The authors encounter choroideremia accompanied by recurrent uveitis. This paper is designed to give a description of the condition, along with an investigation of the literature. Ophthalmological tests and treatments were performed. Characteristic fundus, night blindness, peripheral visual field loss, electroretinography and other manifestations led us to a diagnosis of choroideremia. The anterior uveitis was managed with medication.","1401":"Transcutaneous and transconjunctival approaches are still frequently used to repair orbital wall fractures. However, medial orbital wall fracture remains a challenging area for plastic surgeons due to technical difficulties and postoperative scars. The transcaruncular approach is described and we present our experience with this approach to access the medial orbital wall in 10 patients with blowout fracture in the medial orbital region. All patients were corrected satisfactorily without cutaneous scar. The transcaruncular approach is a useful technique to repair medial orbital wall fractures.","1402":"In order to describe the demographics, etiologic and clinical factors, and outcomes of orbital fractures in children, we have reviewed a case series of 17 patients under 18 years of age with internal orbital fractures (i.e., without involvement of the orbital rim) presenting to the Ghil hospital between March 2000 and June 2001. For 15 of the patients, we performed orbital wall reconstruction with Medpor barrier sheet implantation (thickness 1mm) through transconjunctival approach under endoscopic guidance, while maintaining mere observation on the other 2 patients. There were 14 male and 3 female patients. The most common cause of fractures was accident (7 cases). Inferior wall involvement was most commonly seen, and the trapdoor type fracture was the most common. Thirteen patients had extraocular muscle restriction, 9 had nausea\/vomiting and 5 had bradycardia. Diplopia of 9 patients disappeared after 43 +\/- 23 days. Nausea\/vomiting and bradycardia disappeared rapidly after surgical intervention in all cases. These results suggest that trapdoor fractures with soft tissue entrapment are the most common in pediatric orbital wall fractures, and that most of them are associated with nausea\/vomiting. We suggest that early diagnosis, and prompt surgical intervention are required for those patients with oculocardiac reflex.","1403":"This study evaluated the effects of prolonged primary chemotherapy in retinoblastoma. The data for 27 eyes in 22 children who were treated for retinoblastoma with up to 13 cycles of primary chemotherapy was reviewed. The chemotherapy consisted of etoposide, vincristine, and either carboplatin or ifosfamide. In bilateral retinoblastoma, 1 eye was in each Ia, Ib, and Va, according to the Reese-Ellsworth classification, 2 in each IIa, IIIa, and IIIb, 4 in IIb, and 5 in IVa. Enucleation was performed in I in IIa and 1 in Va. In unilateral, 1 was in each IIa, IIIa, IVa, IVb, and Vb, and 4 in Va. Enucleation was performed in 8 with the exception of 1 in IIa. Complete regression was observed in 17 eyes (12 patients). There was no toxicity severe enough to delay treatment. Prolonged primary chemotherapy can be considered as an alternative treatment for retinoblastoma in III or less.","1404":"AlamarBlue is used to induce color and fluorescence in the microenvironment of activated cells. The alamarBlue assay was studied to determine if it could be used as a method of evaluating the number of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. A series of two-fold dilutions of RPE cells were placed into 96-well culture plates. The alamarBlue was added to the culture media after attaching the cells. The absorbance and fluorescence were measured consecutively at various intervals over a period of 24 hr. Cell viability were evaluated by means of the trypan blue exclusion method and flow cytometry using a combination of propidium iodide and annexin V was done to prove the safety of alamarBlue assay to the cells. Both the absorbance and the fluorescence had a linear relationship with the number of RPE cells. Exposing the RPE cells to alamarBlue was not detrimental to the cells. In conclusion, the alamarBlue assay constitutes a one-step, extremely simple, reproducible, economical and non-toxic procedure for evaluating the number of viable RPE cells.","1405":"The loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with aging is related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced cell death in a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, ARPE-19. Hydrogen peroxide was added at different concentrations to ARPE-19 cells and cultured. The cytotoxicity was assayed by mitochondrial function using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) testing. The patterns of cell damage were assessed using an acridine orange-ethidium bromide differential staining method, in situ end labeling (ISEL) assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Catalase, a major antioxidant, was used to prevent cell death. The cleavage of procaspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was determined by western blot analysis. Hydrogen peroxide significantly induced cell death in ARPE-19 cells, whereas pretreatment of the cells with catalase prevented cell death. Application of the ISEL assay and acridine orange\/ethidium bromide staining demonstrated that the H2O2-induced cell death occurred by an apoptotic mechanism at lower concentrations of H2O2 (400, 500, 600 microM), whereas higher concentrations of H2O2 induced necrosis rather than apoptosis. Caspase 3 was associated with the apoptotic pathway in human RPE cell death. Western blot analysis confirmed caspase 3 activation and cleavage of substrate proteins in ARPE-19 cells treated with an H2O2 concentration of 600 microM. These results indicate that treatment with H2O2 induces apoptotic and necrotic cell death in ARPE-19, and that caspase 3 is associated with apoptotic cell death. Therefore, H2O2 may induce the destruction of RPE cells in AMD by the combined effects of apoptosis and necrosis.","1406":"The purpose of this study was to measure the level of expression of the inducible heat shock protein70 (Hsp70), the constitutive heat shock protein70 (Hsc70) in the outer nuclear layer and the photoreceptors in the human fetal retina. Fetal eyeballs were selected from fetal autopsy specimens of 12 and 17 to 40 week old fetuses, with no history of congenital anomalies. The retinas had differentiated from neuroblastic cells, into matured sensory retinas, from a gestational age (GA) from 12 to 36 weeks. The Hsp70 and Hsc70 were prominently expressed in the nuclear layers. The Hsc70 was expressed at all GAs and the Hsp70 was expressed from 20 to 33 weeks GA. This period is in accordance with the maturation of the sensory retina. The expression of heat shock protein may be regulated by the development of the fetus, and play an important role in the ocular development.","1407":"This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of heat shock protein70 (hsp70) on retinal photic injuries, and to determine the relationship between hsp70s from hsp70.1 and 70.3. C57BL\/6 wild type (hsp70.1 +\/+) and knockout type (hsp70.1 -\/-) mice from the same littermates were placed in light of 11000 lux for 6 hours, and were sacrificed at 1, 4, 7, and 14 days after stress. H &amp; E staining, immunohistochemistry, and western blot analysis were performed. The hsp70.1 -\/- mice exhibited more disarranged and more diffusely destroyed photoreceptors than the hsp70.1 +\/+ mice. Hsp70 induction by light in both the hsp70.1 +\/+ and hsp70.1 -\/- mice peaked at 1 day after light stress. The Hsp70 level in the hsp70.1 +\/+ mice reduced slowly and was almost constant for 7 days. However, in the hsp70.1 -\/- mice, it decreased rapidly and returned, after 7 days, to a similar level to that prior to light exposure. According to which gene they originate from, hsp70s may play specific roles in protecting the retina against stresses. Hsp70 from the hsp70.1 gene may act as a sustained responder to retinal photic injury.","1408":"To investigate the effect of nitric oxide (NO) on the proliferation of trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, primarily cultured porcine TM cells were exposed to NO donor (SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine) with and without its inhibitor (L-NAME, Nomega-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester). The proliferation of TM cells was quantified by a rapid colorimetric assay. Acridine orange\/Hoechest 33342 staining and flow cytometry with annexin-PI were done. As a result, NO inhibited the proliferation of TM cells significantly in a dose-dependent manner and this inhibitory effect was abolished by L-NAME. Fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometric analysis revealed that NO induced apoptotic cell death. The current results suggest that NO inhibit the proliferation of TM cells and apoptosis may be involved in some degree.","1409":"A brain lesion located at the lateral side of the sella turcica can produce a junctional scotoma by compressing the ipsilateral optic nerve and the contralateral inferonasal nerve fiber. This study reports a female patient with a junctional scotoma caused by a cerebral aneurysm. At the initial visit, she complained of visual disturbance in both eyes and the right optic disc was atrophied. The visual field showed right blindness and left superotemporal quadrantopsia. A brain CT indicated an approximately 3 cm sized brain mass located superolateral to the sella turcica. The brain MRI showed the lesion to be more like an aneurysm than a pituitary adenoma. Therefore, 4 vessels angiography was done, and this lesion was confirmed to be a sellar variant of an aneurysm located at the right carotid siphon. Like a tumor of the optic chiasm, a cerebral aneurysm can cause visual disturbance and visual field defects. Therefore, an early differential diagnosis is important because the prognosis and treatment of an aneurysm differ.","1410":"A 59-year-old woman was referred to our clinic with sudden visual loss in her right eye after she was treated with 40 mg\/day of oral prednisolone for 2 weeks under the diagnosis of idiopathic optic neuritis. At that time, computerized tomography (CT) of the brain showed no evidence of optic nerve or brain pathology. However, there was progressive diminution of right visual acuity associated with a limitation of adduction and abduction in the right eye. On magnetic resonance imaging and repeated CT, a malignant lesion was suggested, and was confirmed as an Aspergillus fungus colony by histopathologic examination. Postoperatively, she was treated with intravenous administration of amphotericin B for 13 weeks. However, her condition continued to deteriorate. She developed ptosis and total ophthalmoplegia in the right eye and blindness in both eyes. After discharge, she was given itraconazole for 20 weeks. She has shown no recovery of visual acuity or extraocular motion during a two-year follow-up period. The clinical features of our case suggest that early diagnosis in a case of aspergilloma presenting with visual loss is difficult and that a high index of suspicion, repeated radiological examination and adequate biopsy may be required for diagnosis.","1411":"A 41-year-old man visited our clinic complaining of esodeviation of the right eye. He had been operated on for corneal laceration 3 years before. One month later, exodeviation of the right eye had developed. The result of computed tomography (CT) was reported as orbital abscess and cellulitis. Although antibiotic treatment was administered for 2 weeks, the exodeviation didn't improve. On ocular examinations performed in our hospital in November-2001, his right eye was esotropic and had a relative afferent pupillary defect. Vision of the right eye was decreased to 0.02. Fundus examination showed optic atrophy. A new CT scan disclosed a foreign body introduced into the right medial orbital wall, nasal cavity and ethmoidal sinus. Although foreign body was surgically removed, vision and eye movement were not improved. In the case of a patient who has undergone orbital trauma, complete history taking and physical examinations must be performed. On suspicion of a foreign body, imaging study such as CT or MRI must be performed. However, because CT findings can be variable, careful follow-up is needed.","1412":"To describe the first case of the treatment of a corneoscleral cyst by distilled water injection into a corneal cyst. The anterior wall of a cyst of the limbal communication was punctured with a surgical blade. Aspiration and irrigation of the contents of the cyst with a 27-gauge anterior chamber cannula were performed repeatedly, three times. Distilled water, instead of balanced salt solution, was injected into the collapsed cyst, and was then aspirated completely after 5 minutes. The injection and aspiration of distilled water was repeated once more. The scleral cyst was surgically excised. Twelve months after surgery, several small white granular opacities, presumably epithelial cell nests, were observed on the interface of the collapsed cyst cavity, but there was no recurrence of the cyst. The best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) was 1.0 with a correction of +1.25-2.00 X 45. No significant change in central corneal endothelial cell density was noted. We suggest that this simple technique may represent an alternative method for the management of corneal cysts, and may have less risk of developing a corneal opacity or causing other serious damage to surrounding tissues.","1413":"This study was performed to assess the degree of acute pain in children following eye surgery using a Face Pain Rating Scale (FPRS), with a validity and reliability test employing a Numeric\/Word Graphic Rating Scale (NWGRS). The degree of pain was obtained at 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours after surgery using the FPRS and NWGRS. The changes in pain intensities were analyzed using a RM-ANOVA, while the relationship between the FPRS and NWGRS was analyzed by a Pearson coefficient in SPSS\/WIN. Two third of the children experienced pain equal to, or greater, than moderate to severe, and about one fifth of the subjects expressed the most severe pain at 2 hours after surgery. At 4 hours after surgery, 95.3% of the children still complained of pain, and 8 hours after surgery, 82.8% of the patients experienced 'a little bit' or 'a little more' pain or discomforts. At 1 day after surgery, only 34.4% of children were free of pain. A high correlation between the FPRS and NWGRS was identified over 5 time-points (.887 &lt; r &lt; .735). The gender, type of the surgery and past operation experience had no effects on the degree of pain. Our results suggest that FPRS is a reliable and valid measurement for acute pain assessment in Korean children following eye surgery, and warrants application in the integrated clinical protocol, including non-pharmacological and pharmacological management of acute pediatric pain reduction following surgery.","1414":"To evaluate the effects of early surgical intervention in infantile exotropia on the motor and sensory functions, we reviewed the records of 17 subjects diagnosed with exotropia before the age of 12 months, receiving surgery before the age of 24 months, with a follow-up period greater than one year, between 1996 and 2000. Of the 17 subjects (6 intermittent, 11 constant), 14 (82%) (6 intermittent, 8 constant) had a final horizontal deviation of &lt;10 PD, with 3 (18%) needing a re-operation. Fusion and gross binocularity were developed in 7 (4 intermittent, 3 constant), and 11 (6 intermittent, 5 constant) subjects, respectively. Seven subjects developed stereopsis of 200 seconds or better, and 5 of the 6 with intermittent exotropia (83%) being involved. In conclusion, over 80% of the successful alignments were obtained with surgery before the age of 24 months in infantile exotropia, which was similar to previous studies. Furthermore, early surgical intervention, particularly in the intermittent phase, resulted in more effective sensory function.","1415":"The present study was conducted to evaluate if there is a Norrie disease gene (ND gene) mutation involved in the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and to identify the possibility of a genetic abnormality that may be linked to the presence of ROP. Nineteen premature Korean infants, with a low birth weight (1500 g or less) or low gestational age (32 weeks or less), were included in the study. Eighteen infants had ROP, and the other did not. Genomic DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes of these patients, and all three exons and their flanking areas, all known ND gene mutations regions, were evaluated following amplification by a polymerase chain reaction, but no ND gene mutations were detected. Any disagreement between the relationship of ROP to the ND gene mutation will need to be clarified by further investigation.","1416":"Little is known about the natural history and management of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) which developed as a complication of laser photocoagulation for central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). We experienced two patients with CNV which developed after laser treatment for CSC. Submacular membranectomy was performed on both cases after the confirmation of subretinal CNV with optical coherence tomography. One patient received photodynamic therapy for recurrent CNV. The vision of both patients has been improved over 6 months of follow up. These cases suggest that active intervention, including submacular surgery, improves the visual prognosis of this condition.","1417":"Experiments show that collaterals that develop and maturate in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) are helpful in the drainage of blood from a blocked area to an adjacent area. Laser treatment on the nonperfusion area can reduce the retinal blood inflow that can impair the formation of collateral vessels. Furthermore, if collaterals were accidentally destroyed by laser photocoagulation, leakage and neovascularization would increase. Forty-five patients with BRVO were reviewed retrospectively. Collateral vessels were noted from angiographic analysis in 27 of 45 (60%) patients. Good visual prognosis was noted in the patients with collaterals. Cases with neovascularization underwent laser treatment. In one case, laser photocoagulation was applied to the collateral vessels accidentally, after which the leakage significantly increased on fluorescein angiography. In conclusion, collateral vessels in BRVO have a favorable effect on visual prognosis. Careful laser treatment is recommended to avoid destroying collaterals in BRVO.","1418":"In deep sclerectomy, collagen implant has been used to maintain space under the scleral flap. However, the effect of other implants has not been studied. In this retrospective study, we compared surgical outcomes between small collagen and chromic catgut used as implants in deep sclerectomy. Deep sclerectomy was performed on 23 patients (25 eyes) who either had an open angle and a high intraocular pressure (IOP) (&gt; 22 mmHg) in spite of receiving the maximal tolerable medical treatment, or who were intolerant to medications. Our study consisted of 14 patients (15 eyes) in the small collagen group and 8 (9 eyes) in the chromic catgut group. The mean follow-up period was 8.6 +\/- 3.3 months in the small collagen group and 4.4 +\/- 1.2 months in the chromic catgut group. The mean preoperative IOP was not significantly different between the two groups. The complete success rate of the small collagen group was significantly better than that of the chromic catgut group at the final follow-up when data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve (87% versus 30%; P = .01). As for the qualified success rate, the small collagen group showed significantly better results at the final follow-up (93% versus 80%; P = .046). The mean number of postoperative medications was significantly lower in the small collagen group (0.26 versus 1.10; P &lt; .05). These results confirmed that the use of small collagen implant in deep sclerectomy produced a higher success rate and a lowered need for postoperative medication compared to the use of chromic catgut implant. Because equal sized implants were used, the difference in biochemical properties, particularly the severity of inflammation caused by the implant, is presumed to be the cause of the different surgical outcomes.","1419":"The relationship between visual acuity, the level of visual field impairment, visual functioning, and the quality of life was evaluated in Korean patients with glaucoma. Forty-three consecutive glaucoma patients from the glaucoma service at Severance Eye and Ear Hospital were included in this study. Each subject underwent a vision-specific functional status questionnaire (VF-14), a modified VF-14 (VF'-14) and general quality-of-life questionnaires of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Items Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). The visual acuity and visual field measurements with a Humphrey automated perimeter were taken within one month of the initial visit. The mean age of the subjects was 57.9 +\/- 17.8. Among these patients, there were 23 males and 20 females. The mean deviation (MD) and the corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD) by the automated perimeter in the eye with the better visual acuity were -5.87 +\/- 5.16 dB and 3.92 +\/- 2.74 dB respectively. The VF-14 and SF-36 scores were 41.28 +\/- 14.56 and 52.39 +\/- 6.61 respectively. There were significant correlations between the VF-14, VF'-14, and the MD of the better eye (p &lt; 0.05). In Korean patients with glaucoma, the VF-14 and VF'-14 have significant relationship with the MD of the better eye in the visual field.","1420":"To purpose of this study was to evaluate complications of unintended thin corneal flap in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), such as visual acuity and myopic regression, at the one year follow-up. We performed a study on 54 eyes, i.e. 27 patients, having LASIK. The eyes were split into two groups, group one, 27 eyes with unintended thin corneal flap with a thickness of 100 microm or less, and as a control group, 27 eyes with a thickness of 110 microm or more. The average corneal flap thicknesses of the two groups were 88.89 +\/- 8.07 microm and 132.70 +\/- 19.58 microm, respectively. With regard to postoperative complications, there were no statistical differences between the groups for: foreign bodies in aspects of the interface, mild peripheral infiltration, superficial punctuate keratitis, myopic regression and decreased vision. The only complication showing any statistical difference between the two groups was the central corneal opacity. An unintended thin corneal flap, with an intact Bowman's layer, induced no significant postoperative complications. Central corneal opacity was apparent in 4 of the eyes in group one, so may be related with a thin corneal flap.","1421":"We conducted an investigation of the relation between RNFL thickness and optic disc size along with an interocular comparison of optic disc size, RNFL thickness, and RNFL density in healthy subjects. A total of 64 normal eyes from 32 Korean volunteers were enrolled in this study. A GDx Nerve Fiber Analyzer with software version 2.0.09 was used to image all subjects. Optic disc size was measured by pi x (horizontal radius) x (vertical radius). The RNFL density of each quadrant was calculated by dividing each quadrant integral by the total integral. Optic disc size was positively correlated with the total RNFL thickness (r = 0.615, p &lt; 0.01). Optic disc size and RNFL density were inversely related in the superior quadrant (r = -0.248, p &lt; 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between optic disc size and RNFL density in the nasal quadrant (r = 0.439, p &lt; 0.01) and the temporal quadrant to a certain degree. A significant positive correlation was found between the right and left eyes in terms of total RNFL thickness in and that of each quadrant. Interocular RNFL density was positively correlated in both the temporal and nasal quadrants. These findings must be considered when one evaluates and compares RNFL measurements between two eyes as is often the case where both eyes are usually affected in the course of glaucomatous RNFL damage.","1422":"A small number of cases of bacterial endophthalmitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes, a Gram positive organism, have previously been reported. In this case, rapidly progressive Streptococcus pyogenes endophthalmitis was developed five years after cataract surgery which had been. The previous cataract surgery was combined with intraocular lens implantation by trans-scleral suspension technique. Treatment included enucleation and intravenous antibiotic injection. In this case of delayed Streptococcus pyogenes endophthalmitis after extracapsular cataract extraction. It seems probable that progressive erosion of the suture material resulted in exogenous endophthalmitis.","1423":"A 21-year-old woman presented with bilateral optic neuritis, combined with central retinal vein occlusion. General physical examination and neurologic consultation revealed no other findings. Laboratory investigation yielded an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, positive LE preparation, elevated ANA titer, and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was made. Renal failure developed quickly and she was treated with hemodialysis, transfusion and subsequently systemic corticosteroid. Anti-phospholipid antibody was positive to lupus anti-coagulant and the titer was normalized after 2-month steroid therapy at which time the visual outcome differed between the eyes. The right eye showed improvement in visual acuity and visual field, but the left eye was not improved and retained a central scotoma. SLE needs to be considered in young women with optic neuritis when other causes of optic neuritis have been excluded, and serologic tests including anti-phospholipid antibody should be conducted.","1424":"Hereditary vitreoretinopathies are potentially blinding inherited disorders characterized by an abnormal-appearing vitreous gel and associated retinal changes. Four of these disorders, Stickler's syndrome, Wagner's disease, erosive vitreoretinopathy, and Goldmann-Favre syndrome, exhibit marked syneresis of the vitreous gel. Erosive vitreoretinopathy has associated retinal pigment epithelial changes, poor night vision, visual field defects, and abnormal electroretinographic findings; symptoms not found in Stickler's syndrome. A 36-year-old man with progressive visual loss and a visual field defect had no systemic disease. His vitreous cavity was liquefied. Vitreous strands and a cataract were found in both eyes. Pronounced RPE degeneration was found superotemporally in both eyes and a bullous rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the left eye accompanied two retinal tears. His visual field showed a ring scotoma in both eyes and the ERG finding was abnormal. We report one case of erosive vitreoretinopathy with retinal pigment epithelial changes, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, visual field defects, abnormal electroretinographic findings, marked vitreous syneresis and cataract. These symptoms are distinct from previously described entities.","1425":"Cat-scratch disease is a self-limited infection characterized by subacute regional lymphadenitis, which is usually preceded by a history of being scratched by a cat infected with the Bartonella species. Neuroretinitis, retinochoroiditis, isolated papillitis and peripapillary angiomatosis are features of posterior segment involvement. However, vision loss is very rare. We report a patient with cat-scratch disease associated with unilateral neuroretinitis and peripapillary serous retinal detachment, and discuss its fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographic features.","1426":"Cavernous hemangiomas are one of the most common benign tumors of the orbit in adults. We report a case of a longstanding retrobulbar hemangioma that was removed successfully through a temporal transconjunctival approach combined with lateral canthotomy. A 45-year-old female patient, with a 15-year history of slowly progressive proptosis and decreased visual acuity of the left eye, had a corrected visual acuity of finger count at 50 cm OS, compared with 1.0 OD. Exophthalmometry by the Nagle's method measured 15 mm OD by 26 mm OS. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-encapsulated retrobulbar main mass, 2.3 x 3.0 x 3.7 cm in size along with multiple small satellite nodules that were displacing the optic nerve and globe superiorly. The tumors were removed through a superotemporal transconjunctival approach combined with lateral canthotomy. Pathological examination revealed an intraorbital cavernous hemangioma. The patient was free of visible scars, proptosis and any other noticeable complications at her last follow-up, 6 months after surgery.","1427":"In order to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intravitreal phacofragmentation, we analyzed cases of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreal phacofragmentation and scleral fixation of an intraocular lens (IOL) performed in patients with a crystalline lens completely dislocated into the vitreous cavity without any damage to the lens capsule. Of the 23 eyes examined, the dislocated lens was related with a hypermature cataract in 4 eyes and Marfan syndrome in 2 eyes, developed after argon and Nd:YAG laser iridotomy in 2 eyes, and was due to ocular trauma in 15 eyes. The dislocated lens was present for more than a year in 6 eyes and less than 4 weeks in 13 eyes. PPV, intravitreal phacofragmentation and scleral fixation of IOL were performed in all 23 eyes. Additionally, trabeculectomy was performed in 4 eyes, iridoplasty in 1 eye and cryopexy with intravitreal injection of sulfur hexafluoride in 2 eyes. Perfluorocarbon liquid was used in 9 eyes. The mean follow-up period was 11.7 months. On final examination, the visual acuity was better than 20\/40 in 17 eyes (73.9%) and counting fingers in 1 eye due to traumatic optic neuropathy. There was no postoperative retinal detachment. These results demonstrated that PPV with intravitreal phacofragmentation and other combined procedures is a safe and effective surgical method for treating a completely dislocated crystalline lens.","1428":"The purpose of this study is to compare, by statistical analysis, intraocular lens (IOL) powers by SRK\/T formula using autorefractokeratometer-measured keratometric (K) values (SRK\/T-ARK-mK), by SRK\/T formula using refraction-derived K values (SRK\/T-R-dK), and by refraction corrected method (RCM), in eyes treated with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for myopia. Thirty-eight consecutive eyes of 23 patients with PRK for mild to moderate myopia and 35 consecutive eyes of 25 patients with LASIK for high myopia were followed up for more than 1 year. In the two groups, IOL powers by SRK\/T-ARK-mK, by SRK\/T-R-dK, and by RCM were compared by statistical analysis. In PRK group, the mean value of IOL powers by RCM was statistically higher than that obtained by the other two methods (p &lt; 0.05), while there was no significant statistical difference between the mean values of IOL powers by SRK\/T-ARK-mK and by SRK\/T-R-dK (p &gt; 0.05). However, in LASIK group, the mean values of IOL powers by RCM and by SRK\/T-R-dK, which did not differ statistically (p &gt; 0.05), were both statistically higher than that by SRK\/T-ARK-mK (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, there is a statistical difference in IOL powers by the methods used for IOL calculation, as there is according to the level of myopia in patients with PRK and LASIK treatment. We suggest that, in IOL power calculation in eyes with previous corneal refractive surgery, correction methods such as RCM and SRK\/T-R-dK are more effective at higher levels of myopia.","1429":"In order to evaluate the morphologic types of appositional angle-closure glaucoma, biometric measurements were made in angle-closure glaucoma patients using Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Twenty-six patients with primary angle-closure glaucoma and 21 cataract patients with as a control group were examined. The angle-closure glaucomatous eyes were classified as type B in which the angle closure started at the bottom of the angle and type S in which the angle closure occurred in the vicinity of Schwalbe's line. The trabecular-ciliary process distance (TCPD, type B; 873.20+\/-86.77 microm, type S; 832.52+\/-82.96 microm, control; 1233.50+\/-73.01 microm, p = 0.000) and the angle opening distance (AOD500, type B; 89.75+\/-63.27 microm, type S; 88.85+\/-72.95 microm, control; 304.40+\/-104.30 microm, p = 0.000) were significantly shorter in patients with angle closure vice control group. No significant difference were noted in the three groups of patients in regards to iris thickness or ciliary process-iris angle. In this study, we have demonstrated that there are two types of appositional angle-closure and have shown the forward rotation of the ciliary process without changes of the ciliary process-iris angle in cases of angle-closure glaucoma.","1430":"This study examined the influence of age, sex, blood pressure, and obesity index on intraocular pressure (IOP), in order to investigate the relationship between the upper limits of the following two conditions in the general Korean population: the \"systolic or diastolic hypertensive and obese\" group and the \"systolic or diastolic hypotensive and lean\" group. A total of 6828 healthy subjects (13,656 eyes) underwent automated multi-phasic tests, including tonometry, blood pressure, visual field, and body mass index. The 6,828 subjects were divided into five groups based on age; less than 40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and over 70 years old. They were also divided into four categories on the basis of sex, age, blood pressure, and obesity index. The mean IOP in males (15.8+\/-3.3 mmHg) was significantly higher than in females (14.8+\/-3.1 mmHg) (P &lt; 0.05), but this difference decreased proportionally with increasing age. IOP had a tendency to decrease with increasing age (P &lt; 0.05). IOP increased significantly with increasing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and obesity index (all, P &lt; 0.05). The mean IOP of the \"systolic or diastolic hypertensive and obese\" group was higher than that of the \"systolic or diastolic hypotensive and lean\" group in the general Korean population (P &lt; 0.05). These data could aid investigation into the epidemiological, etiologic and oriental influences related to the risk factors of glaucoma, especially in oriental populations.","1431":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of memantine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, in an experimental optic nerve ischemia. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) in a dosage of 0.1 microg\/day was delivered to the perineural region of the anterior optic nerve by osmotically driven minipumps for 8 weeks in 10 rabbits. In 5 rabbits, 1 mg\/kg memantine was administered concurrently by intramuscular injection once a daily. Morphologic optic nerve head changes were monitored with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Multivariate statistical analysis showed a significant change in topometric parameters (cup area, cup depth and rim volume), indicating an increase in optic nerve head cupping and a decrease of neural rim volume in the ET-1 administered eyes (P &lt; 0.0001). In rabbits where memantine was given concurrently with ET-1, no significant change in topometric parameters was observed after ET-1 administration (P = 0.78). The current results suggest that memantine has a neuroprotective effect in optic nerve ischemia. Memantine may potentially be useful in the management of various ischemic disorders of the optic nerve, including glaucoma.","1432":"Twenty four eyes from 23 neovascular glaucoma (NVG) patients, who underwent trabeculectomy with 0.2 or 0.4 mg\/ml MMC in least the previous 6 months, were examined in order to evaluate the mid-term effects of a trabeculectomy with mitomycin C (MMC) in NVG. Success defined when an intraocular pressure (IOP) &lt; 22 mmHg and &gt; 5 mmHg with or without medication was observed. The mean IOP was reduced from 46.8+\/-12.9 mmHg preoperatively to 18.2+\/-12.0 mmHg at the last follow-up (mean = 25.8 months). The overall success rates at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months after surgery were 71%, 58%, 50%, 29%, 29% respectively. The number of anti-glaucoma medications administered was significantly reduced from 2.6+\/-0.7 preoperatively to 0.9+\/-1.0 postoperatively (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p = 0.005). In addition both the intraoperative MMC concentration and application time had no influence on lowering the IOP (logistic regression analysis, p = 0.228, 0.910, respectively). There was a similar incidence of postoperative complications in both the success and failure group. These results suggest that a trabeculectomy with MMC is an effective surgical procedure in NVG patients and the MMC concentration is not crucial for reducing the IOP postoperatively.","1433":"We report the clinical features and the course of traumatic corneal endothelial rings by trauma. Fourteen eyes (of fourteen patients) with traumatic endothelial rings (twelve cases of BB shot injury), were enrolled in this study. With median follow-up interval of 50 weeks, initial and final best corrected visual acuity, presence of combined injuries such as gross hyphema, and time of disappearance of traumatic endothelial rings were recorded. And specular microscopic examination was performed. The duration of existence of traumatic endothelial rings was mean 4.6 days. On the specular microscopic examination, the count of corneal endothelial cells in the injured eye decreased by mean 16.8% (ranged from 1 to 56%) than that in the opposite unjnjured eye. The duration of existence of traumatic endothelial rings was 3.5 days in the group without combined angle recession and was 6.1 days in the group with combined angle recession. We suggest that the possibility of traumatic corneal endothelial rings and resultant endothelial cell loss and their clinical potential should be always kept in mind in ocular trauma, particularly BB shot injury.","1434":"To find out whether the cryotherapy for the treatment of the retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) causes structural changes of the extraocular muscle (EOM), and also whether the changes are related with the occurrence of strabismus. To examine the acute stage change, we conducted a transconjunctival cryotherapy around the superior rectus muscle of a rabbit and resected it 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after the cryotherapy. In observing chronic changes, we first categorized patients who had an esotropia surgery into groups, one of which combined prematurity and cryotherapy and one group affected by prematurity but without having had cryotherapy. Then we compared the change of EOM with that of a fullterm infant group. In a rabbit, edema, acute inflammatory cells and a large amount of degenerated muscle fibers were observed immediately after the cryotherapy and on the 3rd day. On the 7th day, regenerated muscle fibers were observed and on the 14th day, the inflammatory cells decreased and the amount of regenerated muscle fiber increased. On the 28th day, abnormal findings were not observed any more and the muscle was found to be normal. When chronic changes of EOM in human on 1 1\/2 to 8 1\/2 years after cryotherapy, there were no abnormal findings observed in three groups. From the study, we can infer that cryotherapy can cause acute inflammation and necrosis of muscle fiber but such an acute change will improve and does not result in structural change in the long term. Therefore, the occurrence of strabismus in patients with ROP is considered to be attributable to reasons other than injury of EOM.","1435":"We performed a retrospective study of serum factors associated with neovascular glaucoma that can occur following vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The medical records of 183 patients (241 eyes) who received vitrectomy between August 1996 and August 2000 were studied retrospectively and subsequently analyzed by linear logistic regression analysis and multiple logistic regression tests. Neovascular glaucoma developed at an average of 2.7 months in 31 of 241 eyes (14.1%). The overall anatomical success rate of retinal attachment was 82.5% (199 eyes in 241 eyes), although it decreased to 45.1% (14 eyes in 31 eyes) in eyes with neovascular glaucoma. Serum cholesterol (P = 0.041) and fibrinogen levels (P = 0.020) were significantly associated with the development of neovascular glaucoma. However, no significant association could be found concerning hypertension, diabetic retinopathy or hypercholesterolemia (P &gt; 0.05). We suggest that serum creatinine, cholesterol and fibrinogen levels can be used to predict the development of neovascular glaucoma in vitrectomized eyes with diabetic retinopathy and can further provide a more active approach to preventing the development of this condition.","1436":"It is known that CD95 (APO-1\/Fas) is expressed on the cell surface, and apoptotic cell death can be induced by the CD95 ligation in the cultured, proliferating human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. However, little is known about CD95 on the non-proliferating RPE cells. In this study, human RPE cells were cultured up to 4 weeks after they reached the confluence, to simulate the non-proliferating RPE cells in situ. There was no significant difference in CD95 expression on the cell surface between the predominantly proliferating, preconfluent cells and predominantly non-proliferating, postconfluent cells in flow cytometric assays. However, unlike proliferating cells, no cellular death occurred in the predominantly non-proliferating cells after the treatment of agonistic anti-CD95 antibody with cycloheximide, pretreated with interferon-gamma. Our results suggest that the CD95\/CD95L system probably plays a physiologic role in vivo to remove the abnormal, proliferating RPE cells, and factors other than the surface expression of CD95 may determine the sensitivity to the CD95 signals.","1437":"The purposes of this study are to elucidate the retinal changes of heat shock protein 70.1 (hsp70.1) knockout mice and to compare them between in normal and in retinal degeneration (rd) mice. Eyes of hsp70.1 wild type (+\/+) and knockout (-\/-) mice in the C57BL\/6 or FVB genetic backgrounds respectively, which were reared in the normal environment, were examined by fundus photography, electroretinography, light microscopy, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) stain, and immunohistochemistry. In C57BL\/6 mice, fundus photography showed no changes between hsp70.1+\/+ and -\/- mice at 1 and 6 months of age. Electroretinographic examination showed a tendency of decreased amplitude of a- and b-wave with aging in both genotype, but there were not different statistically. The ratios of the thickness of inner nuclear and outer nuclear layer to the retinal thickness were respectively decreased with aging in both genotype, but there were not different statstically. TUNEL assay showed a few positively labeled cells in the ganglion cell, inner nuclear and outer nuclear layers and the immunohistochemistry showed no immunopositivity of hsp70 in the inner segments of photoreceptor cell layer in both genotype. In rd mice, fundus photography showed a narrowing of the retinal vessels at the age of 4 weeks, however, there were no differences of retinal changes including pigment epithelial layer in both genotype. Electroretinographic examination at the postnatal 2, 3 and 4 weeks showed no differences between them. Loss of photoreceptor cell and outer nuclear layers showed no differences in both genotype. In conclusion, there were no differences of the retinal changes at least under the normal environmental condition in hsp70.1+\/+ and -\/- mice. These results show that hsp70.1-\/- mice can be used to study the role of hsp70.1 to the external stress to the retina.","1438":"The role of nitric oxide (NO) in ocular surface diseases remains unknown. We investigated the conditions leading to increase NO generation in tears and the main sources of ocular surface tissue. We evaluated the possibility of a dual action (cell survival or cell death) depending on the amount of NO. The concentration of nitrite plus nitrate, the stable end-product of NO, was measured in the tears of various ocular surface diseases. We also examined the main source of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) using immunohistochemical staining &amp; Western blot analysis. When cultured human corneal fibroblasts were treated with NO producing donor with or without serum, the viability of cells was studied. We found that sources of NO in ocular surface tissue primarily included corneal epithelium, fibroblasts, endothelium and inflammatory cells. Three forms of NOS (eNOS, bNOS, &amp; iNOS) were expressed in experimentally induced inflammation. Cell death by NO revealed TUNEL positive staining, however in the EM finding, this NO specific cell death was an atypical necrosis showing perinuclear large vacuolization and mitochondrial swelling. In the fibroblasts culture system, the NO donor (SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine) prevented the death of corneal fibroblasts caused by serum deprivation in a dose dependent manner up to 500 m SNAP, although a higher dose decreased cell viability. This study suggested that NO might act as a double-edged sword in ocular surface disease depending on the degree of inflammatory condition related with NO concentration.","1439":"An isolated rupture of the posterior capsule that is caused by a blunt ocular trauma has been rarely reported and is usually detected incidentally during surgery for a complicated cataract. We found an isolated posterior capsule rupture on the third day after trauma in a 25-year-old man who was admitted for the treatment of traumatic hyphema and we performed a phacoemusification and anterior vitrectomy with PC-IOL, implantation because of the traumatic cataract which had progressed after the injury. The PC-IOL was implanted safely into the capsular bag without severe enlargement of the posterior capsular rupture. The break seems to function as a capsulotomy which provides a clear visual axis. We report this case with a review of the literatures.","1440":"A 60-year-old man visited our clinic with a sudden blurred vision and ocular pain in his right eye occurring 15 years after cataract surgery. The intraocular pressure (IOP) was 55 mmHg in the right eye and gonioscopy revealed a wide open angle with white cortical lens material in the inferior angle. Since the IOP was unable to be controlled with medical therapy, removal of the lens material was performed by irrigation and aspiration. Following surgery, the IOP was decreased to 18 mmHg without medication and the patient's vision recovered to 20\/20. The pathology of the aqueous humor showed macrophages with engulfed lens particles.","1441":"Restriction of eye movement after surgery is an unusual but troublesome complication. A patient presented with a limitation of abduction after a 5 mm resection of medial rectus muscle and an 8 mm recession of lateral rectus muscle. Since the forced duction test was positive, restrictive factors were suggested to be implicated. A reparative operation was performed at the postoperative 9 month, and the forced duction test was negative after releasing the resected medial rectus muscle. The patient showed an improved abduction after recessing the resected muscle. Even after an uneventful surgery, resection of an extraocular muscle may cause restriction of ocular rotation caused by muscle scarring to the sclera or by an increased tightness of the muscle.","1442":"This report presents the use of various surgical treatment modalities in patients who were diagnosed as having thyroid ophthalmopathy. The records of 53 patients who received surgery because of thyroid ophthalmopathy at the Department of Ophthalmology, Yonsei University College of Medicine between Sept. 1996 and Jan. 2000 were retrospectively evaluated. Among the 53 patients, there were 30 females and 23 males. The mean ages of the patients were 40.8 +\/- 17.1 years. Orbital wall decompression (52.8%) was the most frequently performed surgery followed by lid surgery (49.1%) and strabismus surgery (26.4%). Only one type of surgery was performed on 86.8% of the patients while 13.2% received more than one type of surgery. Among the many different types of surgeries possible in patients that have thyroid ophthalmopathy, orbital wall decompression, lid surgery, and strabismus surgery are the most commonly used surgical methods for treatment.","1443":"Changes in the scotopic electroretinogram (ERG) and oscillatory potentials (Ops) were examined in patients who had rhegmatogenous retinal detachment within 3 days before and also at regular intervals after a successful reattachment operation. Electroretinograms were recorded in 38 patients (age 10 to 62 years) for the recent 5 year period. The amplitudes of the scotopic a-wave and b-wave in the detached eye were significantly decreased compared to the fellow normal eye preoperatively. Statistically significant differences were found between the preoperative and the postoperative recordings of the diseased eye. However, postoperative interocular differences in the amplitude of the a-wave between the reattached and normal fellow eye were not statistically significant. The amplitudes of the a-wave and b-wave were inversely related to the extent of the retinal detachment area, the duration of the detachment, and the extent of the buckles that were applied. Significant interocular differences in the b\/a wave amplitude ratio and the Ops amplitude were observed. These results strongly suggest that the retinal function, even after successful reattachment surgery, might be compromised mainly by an inner retinal malfunction rather than from a photoreceptor dysfunction.","1444":"We compared the effectiveness of and complications resulting from modified deep sclerectomy with catgut implant (modified-DSCI) with those of standard deep sclerectomy with collagen implant (DSCI) in the short term following surgery. In this retrospective study, standard-DSCI was performed on thirteen patients (17 eyes), and modified-DSCI was performed on seven patients (11 eyes). After dissection of a 5x5 mm sized superficial scleral flap, a 3x4 mm sized rectangular deep scleral flap was constructed in DSCI and a 2x3 mm sized triangular deep scleral flap in modified DSCI. A collagen implant was placed on the scleral bed in DSCI and # 0 CHROMIC Catgut Absorbable Suture was used in modified DSCI. The mean follow up was 11.0+\/-6.1 months in DSCI and 9.3+\/-4.7 months in modified DSCI. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 38.6+\/-10.9 mmHg in DSCI and 34.8+\/-8.6 mmHg in modified DSCI. In the DSCI group, the IOP was 13.4+\/-3.0 mmHg at final follow up, and was 11.4+\/-3.2 mmHg in the modified DSCI group. The number of Nd:YAG goniopuncture was 3 cases (25%) in the modified DSCI group, and 3 cases (21.4%) in the DSCI group. The number of intraoperative microperforations was 3 in the DSCI group and 2 in the modified DSCI group. Temporary hypotony was encountered in 8 eyes (57.1%) of the DSCI group and 4 eyes (50%) of the modified DSCI group. There was no significant difference observed between the two groups in regards to the effectiveness or rate of complications seen during short term follow up.","1445":"We evaulated the effectiveness and adverse effects of deep sclerectomy with collagen implant (DSCI), which is a kind of nonpenetrating filtering surgery. In this retrospective study, DSCI was performed in 15 eyes of 11 glaucoma patients. An trabeculo-Descemet's membrane (TDM) window is created by a deep sclerokeratectomy, and the collagen implant is placed in the sclera bed under a superficial flap (deep sclerectomy with collagen implant). In 3 of 15 eyes the DSCI was intraoperatively converted to conventional filtering surgery for a large perforation of the TDM. These eyes were not included in the results of the surgical outcomes. The mean age of the patients was 50.3 +\/- 14.4 years, and the mean follow-up period was 11.1 +\/- 5.9 months. A diagnosis of chronic open angle glaucoma was made in 7 eyes and a diagnosis of secondary glaucoma in 5 eyes. The mean preoperative IOP was 25.8 +\/- 11.9 mmHg, the immediate postoperative IOP was 6.4 +\/- 2.9 mmHg, and at the final follow-up, the IOP was 11.9 +\/- 2.5 mmHg. The IOP in 5 eyes was under 6 mmHg temporarily. However, there was no serious complication such as shallow anterior chamber. DSCI is considered to be a good surgical procedure that has similar surgical outcomes to a conventional trabeculectomy without serious complications.","1446":"We report five cases of complex microphthalmia with other ocular malformations in infants or children, which were evaluated to investigate the relationship between the corneal diameters and total axial length. The size of the globe was measured by using computerized tomographic scans (CT scan), A-scan ultrasonography, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is a limited range of well-described malformation, including anterior or posterior segment dysgenesis or combined pathology such as corneal opacity, small cornea, iris hypoplasia, lens dislocation, cataract, chorioretinal coloboma, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV), retinal dysplasia, and intraocular tumor. Corneal diameters were correlated significantly with total axial length (r2 = 0.88) and decreased linearly as the total axial length decreased in these cases. However, there was no relationship seen between the total axial length and posterior segment length (r2 = -0.06). The results of this study may aid the clinical ophthalmologist to accurately understand or assess microphthamia combined with other ocular malformations.","1447":"A central island is defined as a localized elevated area in corneal topography after excimer laser application for myopic correction. We experienced 15 cases of central islands developed 1 week after LASIK using VISX STAR on corneal topography. The uncorrected visual acuity and best corrected visual acuity were 0.52 +\/- 0.22, 0.66 +\/- 0.25 in central islands group and 0.69 +\/- 0.19, 0.78 +\/- 0.19 in control group at 1 week after LASIK. The visual acuity in control group was more improved statistically significantly than central islands group (respectively p = 0.01, p = 0.03). There was no statistical significance between the two groups, although the uncorrected visual acuity and best corrected visual acuity were somewhat more increased in control group at 2 months and 6 months after LASIK than in central islands group (respectively p = 0.06, p = 0.24 at 2 months, p = 0.10, p = 0.17 at 6 months). On the changes of spherical equivalent after LASIK, both the central islands group and control group were in hyperopic state at 1 week after LASIK and were somewhat regressed to myopia at 2 months and 6 months after LASIK. But there was no statistical significance between the two groups at different time points (respectively p = 0.15, p = 0.64, p = 0.67). In 12 cases the central islands were disappeared spontaneously at 2 months, but in 3 cases the central islands were remained 6 months after LASIK on corneal topography. In the one case of 3 cases the best corrected visual acuity was 0.5 at 6 months after LASIK, but in the others the best corrected visual acuity was not different from the mean best corrected visual acuity. Most cases in LASIK, the central islands were dissapeared without specific treatments as in PRK. We suggest, in the case of central islands at 6 months after LASIK, that if the patient complain visual discomfort, monocular diplopia, haloes, or ghost images, central reablation with excimer laser should be considered.","1448":"The purpose of this report is to document an unusual case of implant infection in a patient who had undergone enucleation and hydroxyapatite orbital implant surgery. A 32-year-old woman presented with chronic orbital discomfort and discharge following a history of hydroxyapatite orbital implant surgery at another hospital 4 years previous. She exhibited profuse discharge with a yellow, creamy color and marked conjunctival chemosis. Granulation tissue was noted on the central conjunctival surface. Following the removal of the conjunctival granulation tissue, a central 3x5 mm conjunctival dehiscence was present with exposure of the hydroxyapatite implant. A culture of purulent drainage emanating from the exposed implant showed a growth of Clostridium acetobutylicum. Removal of the orbital implant was done. The implant was noted to be filled with pus. This case suggests that anaerobic infection may be suspected when the granulation tissue is observed and a discharge with a foul odor is found.","1449":"The Sturge-Weber syndrome consists of a unilateral port-wine hemangioma of the skin along the trigeminal distribution and is accompanied by an ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma. Glaucoma is present in approximately half of the cases. The Nevus of Ota is a melanocytic pigmentary disorder, most commonly involving the area innervated by the trigeminal nerve. Elevated intraocular pressure, with or without glaucomatous damage, is observed in 10% of the cases. We report the first case of glaucoma associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome and Nevus of Ota in Korea.","1450":"Amyloidosis is a term encompassing a group of disorders characterized by the extracellular deposition of a substance called amyloid in various tissues. A very rare cause of chronic ocular discomfort is amyloidosis. We treated a patient with the above complaint in whom both eyelids were diffusely swollen with no other chronic ophthalmic complaints. Transconjunctival biopsy revealed amyloidosis and was confirmed on congo-red staining. Since we are aware that surgical excision may cause eyelid cicatrisation or secondary xerophthalmia, we explained the pros and cons of surgery to the patient. In view of the 12-year history and lack of other symptoms, the patient preferred to be kept under observation. Follow-up at two years did not reveal any significant increase in the size of the swelling. Therefore, we recommend that in a patient with amyloidosis with no visual\/ocular impairment, the condition should be left alone without surgical intervention.","1451":"In order to investigate the refractive error, amblyopic frequency, and refractive change, if any, following recovery of cornea injury through surgery of epiblepharon and congenital entropion patients, we retrospectively reviewed the sex distribution, age at operation, chief complaints, preoperative and postoperative refractive errors, and best corrected visual acuity in 160 previously operated patients. The average age at operation was 7.9 years. The preoperative best corrected visual acuity of 133 eyes (41.6%) was below 5\/9. Ninety-five eyes (29.7%) were preoperative myopes above -1.0D; 77 eyes (24%) were hyperopes above +1.0D; and 163 eyes were astigmatic above -1.0D. Of 228 eyes that were followed up for more than one year, 66 eyes demonstrated a best corrected visual acuity of below 5\/9. There was no significant difference in the change in corneal astigmatism following surgery between the group under the age of 7 and the group over the age of 7. However, the mean best corrected visual acuity at postoperative one year was 6\/9, which was significantly different from the preoperative value (P=0.006). Concurrent postoperative glasses correction and amblyopic therapy is indicated because the incidence of refractive errors and amblyopia is higher in epiblepharon and congenital entropion.","1452":"The visual field data (Humphrey C24-2) of early to moderate stage glaucoma between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and chronic primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) patients was compared. Eleven POAG (11 eyes) and 14 chronic PACG patients (14 eyes) were matched with respect to age, sex, and disease severity. Although the mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and short-term fluctuation were similar between the two groups, the mean corrected pattern standard deviation was higher in the POAG patients (p=0.048). When the numeric pattern deviation data (STATPAC II) was used for point-wise between-group comparisons, more depressed paracentral points were found in POAG patients. Different patterns were identified in visual field damages between the chronic PACG and POAG patients. The chronic PACG patients showed more generalized field loss than the POAG patients.","1453":"Predicting correct capsular tension ring size and intraocular lens size using measurements of lens diameter, corneal diameter, axial length and capsular bag diameters to determine anatomical relationships of post implantation capsular tension ring (CTR). The vertical and horizontal diameters of cornea and lens were measured in 62 human eyeballs supplied from the eye bank of the Catholic University. The relationship between corneal diameter and axial length was examined in 195 living human eyes. An extension of capsular bag diameter after implantation of CTR was measured in 19 pigs' eyes purchased from a slaughter house. The correlation between the lens diameter and the capsular bag diameter after CTR implantation was analyzed using linear regression. The average diameters (mean of horizontal and vertical diameters) of cornea and lens in human eyeball of postmortems (average age:69, ratio of male:female = 23:39) were 11.59+\/-0.42 mm for horizontal diameter, 9.54+\/-0.27 mm, for vertical diameter. The average corneal diameters and axial lengths in living human eyes (average age: 62, ration of male:female = 84:111) were 11.63+\/-0.53 mm for the cornea diameter, 24.48+\/-2.10 mm, for cornea axial length. There is a statistically significant correlation between corneal diameter and axial length (correlation coefficient=0.788; p&lt;0.001) and corneal diameter and lens diameter (correlation coefficient=0.711; p&lt;0.001). In pigs' eyes, there is a relationship between lens diameter and capsular bag diameter after implantation of 11 mm CTR (correlation coefficient=0.684; p&lt;0.001). In conclusion, axial length and corneal diameter may give surgeons a valuable clue to expected size of capsular bag and important parameters for selecting the correct sized CTR and IOL.","1454":"In order to compare the clinical results of silicone intraocular lenses (IOLs) and acrylic IOLs in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), we reviewed the records of 69 diabetic patients (79 eyes--40 eyes; silicone IOLs, 39 eyes; acrylic IOLs) who had undergone phacoemulsifications and posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCI) implantations between January 1994 and January 1999. Postoperative ocular examinations included measurements of uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity tests and recording any complication one day, one week and two months after surgery. There was no statistically significant difference in visual acuity between the eyes with silicone IOLs and those with acrylic IOLs. Additionally, there was no difference in visual acuity according to the method of blood sugar level control. The rate of posterior capsular opacity (PCO) was significantly lower in the patients with acrylic IOLs than in those with silicone IOLs (p&lt;0.05). These results suggest that there is no difference in visual outcome between acrylic IOLs and silicone IOLs in patients with DM. However in view of the lower rates of PCO with acrylic IOLs, they may be a better choice for eyes in diabetic patients.","1455":"The present study examined the effect of oxygen on photoreceptor degeneration in the retina of heat shock protein 70.1 (hsp70.1) knockout type and wild-type retinal degeneration (rd) mice. All the neonatal rd mice were exposed to hyperoixa for 5 days after birth, and then were returned to room air before being sacrificed. At the postnatal 10, 14, 18, and 21 days, the ratio of outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness to total retinal thickness was compared between hsp70.1 knockout type and wild type. The retina was also examined for DNA fragmentation by TdT-mediated biotin-dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL). In hsp70.1 knockout type, the ratio of ONL to total retinal thickness was higher than that in the wild type at each time. There was the remarkable difference in the number and distribution of TUNEL-positive cells between hsp70.1 knockout type and wild type rd mice. In conclusion, an oxygen-induced modulation of the rate of photoreceptor degeneration was more marked in the hsp70.1 knockout type than wild type rd mice.","1456":"Orbital metastases of hepatocellular carcinoma are rare. The authors report a case of hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the orbit. A 56-year-old woman with hepatitis B infection as confirmed serologic test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) demonstrated superior displacement of the left eyeball. The clinical appearance of the patient demonstrated an inferior displacement of the right eye. MRI disclosed an orbital mass that extended toward the lower eyelid and into the temporal fossa with destruction of the lateral orbital wall. Upon subsequent abdominal computed tomographic scans, the primary tumor was found in the liver. A biopsy specimen of the orbit showed trabecular structures with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Bile canaliculi and sinusoids were also seen. The tumor cells showed vesicular nuclei with mitoses. Immunohistochemical markers such as high-molecular-weight keratin and alpha-fetoprotein showed a positive response. However, immunohistochemical markers such as low-molecular-weight keratin and polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen showed as negative. We diagnosed the tumor as a hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the orbit. A review of the pertinent literature disclosed relatively few occurrences of hepatocellular carcinoma metastasizing to the orbit.","1457":"The authors investigated the efficacy of antibiotic irrigation as the therapeutic option in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. We retrospectively reviewed the medical record of 76 patients' eyes in whom congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction had been diagnosed. In 50 of these patients, the colonizing microorganism was identified and, irrigation through canaliculi was performed using antibiotics of suitable sensitivity. Nasolacrimal system probing was performed on 26 patients as the control group. Treatment was regarded successful when over a 4 week period epiphora or mucous discharge disappeared and when saline passed without resistance on irrigation. 96.0% of patients in the irrigation group and 84.6% of patients in probing group were treated successfully. There was no statistical difference in the success rate between the two groups (P = 0.173). The recovery period based on culture results was 3.22 +\/- 0.37 months in the group in which microorganisms were isolated and 2.39 +\/- 0.35 months in the group in which no organisms were isolated. There were no statistically significant differences in the success rates between the group in which there was growth and the group in which there was no growth (P = 0.1308). Thus a similar result was obtained using nasolacrimal probing and canaliculus antibiotic irrigation in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Antibiotic irrigation is a safe and simple therapeutic option in congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction.","1458":"All pterygia have similar histologic features of solar degeneration seen in the skin such as acanthosis, keratosis, or hyperkeratosis. Although the pathogenesis of pterygia is still unclear, an association with solar exposure, in particular with UV radiation, has been reported. Telomerase activity has been found to be higher in some degenerative, precancerous, and cancerous skin lesions. We investigated telomerase activity in the epithelium and the stromal tissues of the pterygium. Pterygeal tissues were obtained from 30 patients. Telomerase activity was measured with TRAPeze-ELISA kit. Three of the 28 (10.7%) pterygeal stromal tissues demonstrated positive telomerase activity. Fourteen of the 27 (51.9%) epithelial tissues were positive in telomerase activity, whereas telomerase activity was positive in only 3 of 9 normal epithelia (33.3%). Telomerase activity in the pterygium-covered epithelium was increased as compared with that seen in the normal epithelium, but the increase was not statistically significant. In conclusion, telomerase activity was somewhat increased in pterygeal tissues. Telomerase activity may be involved in the pathogenesis of pterygium.","1459":"In order to evaluate the results of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for the treatment of posteriorly dislocated intraocular lens (PC-IOL), we retrospectively examined and analyzed the hospital records of patients who had undergone PPV to exchange or reposition a PC-IOL dislocated into the vitreous cavity. Of 20 eyes in 20 patients, IOL exchange was performed in 6 eyes, and IOL repositioning in 14 eyes. Posteriorly dislocated IOL occurred in 14 eyes during or within 2 days, and in 6 eyes 6 months after the IOL implantation. Thirteen eyes were surgically treated early after the occurrence, within 3 days, while 7 eyes were treated later, between 5 to 7 days. Compared with preoperative best-corrected visual acuity, the final visual acuity improved more than 2 lines in 12 eyes. With no significant difference on the statistics, earlier visual rehabilitation seemed to be shown in late-treated patients than in early-treated. Accordingly, a posterior dislocation of IOL can be successfully treated with PPV, and barring any serious complications such as retinal detachment, there is no need for surgery immediately following the occurrence.","1460":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical usefulness of a newly developed biomicroscopic vitreous observation system. Vitreous observation was performed in 300 eyes with age- or disease-related vitreous changes using a 3 CCD video camera mounted on a slit-lamp biomicroscope and connected to a personal computer for real-time observation and especially for the capture and archiving of images. Various types of fundus lenses were used to scan the vitreous status systemically from the posterior pole to the vitreous base. This system allowed us to obtain and immediately review the images of the vitreoretinal relationship. The image quality was sufficient for clinical evaluation of the vitreous status. We were able to identify some variations of posterior vitreous detachments and clarify the changes of the vitreoretinal interface in the study eyes. This system is very useful for the dynamic observation and documentation of vitreous images in order to determine the role of vitreous in many vitreoretinal disorders. Furthermore it is more convenient and affordable than previous methods.","1461":"To determine the effects of axial length on the development of branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), determination of the affected eye, development of surgical complications, and visual prognosis, axial length was measured in 27 eyes each in surgical, non-surgical and control group and in 54 eyes each in occlusion (surgical + non-surgical group), non-affected eye (non-affected eyes of occlusion group), and non-occlusion group (both eyes of the control group). The average axial length was 22.61 mm in surgical, 22.48 mm in non-surgical, 23.09 mm in control, 22.55 mm in occlusion, 22.56 mm in non-affected eye, and 23.11 mm in non-occlusion group. The axial length showed a statistically significant difference between surgical and control group (p = 0.018), between non-surgical and control group (p = 0.002), and between occlusion and non-occlusion group (p &lt; 0.001); however, no statistically significant difference was seen between surgical and non-surgical group, between non-affected eyes of surgical and non-surgical group, and between occlusion and non-affected eye group. Also, in such as BRVO groups as surgical, non-surgical, and occlusion groups, no correlation was present between axial length and degree of visual acuity recovery and final visual acuity. Although the possibility of developing BRVO is higher in those with short axial length, the axial length may have no relationship with the determination of the affected eye, visual prognosis and development of surgical complications.","1462":"We performed laser photocoagulation for extrafoveal feeder vessels in a series of 10 eyes with subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVMs) in which feeder vessels could be detected by means of indocyanine green angiography using scanning laser ophthalmoscope. On the follow up indocyanine green angiograms performed within one week after treatment, successful occlusion of the feeder vessels with nonperfusion of the corresponding CNVMs was observed in 8 eyes (80%). Four eyes showed improved visual acuities with resolution of the exudative manifestation. But within 3 months, recanalization of the feeder vessels or further proliferation of the CNVMs developed in 7 eyes. We confirmed the possibility of infarction and regression of the CNVM by feeder vessel photocoagulation, which could improve the visual acuity. But it was rarely possible to maintain them.","1463":"There is a high concentration of zinc in ocular tissue, especially the retinachoroids, and the presence of physiological levels of zinc in these tissues seems essential for their normal function. The purpose of our study was to clarify this point using electroretinogram (ERG) recordings and spectrophotometer measurements before and after zinc treatment in a bullfrog's eye. The optimal zinc concentration used in this experiment was 1 microM ZnCl2, 100 microliters\/6 ml ringer solution, with the result that the total zinc concentration in the ringer solution was 16.4 nM. To determine the effects of zinc on the retinal function, the changes of ERG parameters, such as threshold, a-, b- and c-waves and absorption spectra were observed before and after zinc treatment. It is noteworthy that high concentrations of zinc are present in the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium. Our results indicate that zinc treatment elevated the dark-adapted ERG threshold, all of the peak amplitudes of ERG were increased and rhodopsin regeneration was accelerated during visual adaptation. In spectral scans, absorbance increment due to zinc treatment was shown over the whole range of spectral scanning (300 nm-750 nm). We believe that zinc, which is abundant in the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium particularly, is an essential factor for the visual process and may be required to improve visual sensitivity during visual adaptation.","1464":"Orbital infarction syndrome is defined as ischemia of all intraorbital and intraocular structures. It is a rare disease caused by rich anastomotic vascularization of the orbit. It can occur secondary to different conditions, such as, acute perfusion failure, systemic vasculitis, orbital cellulitis and vasculitis. It results in orbital and ocular pain, total ophthalmoplegia, anterior and posterior segment ischemia, and acute blindness. We report here upon two cases of orbital infarction with similar presentations but with different causes, namely, mucormycosis and as a postoperative complication of intracranial aneurysm, discuss the possible mechanisms of orbital infarction, and present a review of the literature on the topic. The prompt recognition of clinical pictures and rapid diagnosis is essential for the early treatment of orbital infarction, since its progression is very rapid and it can be even fatal.","1465":"The aim of this presentation is to report a combined form of vascular malformation of the orbit. A 2-year-old girl had a four-month history of severe proptosis in the right eye. The patient had intermittent proptosis in association with a common cold. The globe was displaced downward and extraocular motility was markedly limited. Multiple intraconal and some extraconal cysts were removed with transcutaneous transseptal anterior orbitotomy. Histological examination showed several characteristics of vascular anomaly. There were malformatively dilated veins intermingled with dilated lymphatic channels, focal cavernous and capillary hemangiomatous features. This combined form of vascular anomaly can be presented as a venous lymphatic malformation associated with hemangiomatous features.","1466":"The purpose of this report is to document an unusual case of fully recovered vision after optic neuritis caused by bee sting. A 46-year-old man presented with sudden visual loss after being stung by a bee on the left conjunctiva. He developed optic disc swelling and there was a delay in the P100 wave of the pattern visual evoked potential (VEP). The patient received acute treatment, with intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisolone. Two days later, visual acuity in the left eye was recovered to 20\/20 and P100 latency in pattern VEP was also normalized. Furthermore, visual field and color vision tests revealed no remaining abnormalities. This case suggests that early corticosteroid treatment is effective in optic neuritis caused by bee sting.","1467":"Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is caused by a point mutation in the mitochondrial deoxynucleic acid (mtDNA) and accounts for 30% of bilateral optic atrophy of unknown etiology. The authors found a Korean family with mtDNA mutations in the nucleotide positions (np) 11778 and np 4216. This is the first report confirming a secondary mtDNA np 4216 mutation in Koreans, as well as the first report of a Korean family harboring both primary and the secondary mutations that the authors are aware of.","1468":"Suprachoroidal hemorrhage(SH) may cause the expulsion of the intraocular contents. Vitreous incarceration in the wound and retinal detachment with SH are extremely poor prognostic signs. Treatment modalities depend on the severity of eye damage. This particular patient had \"kissing\" hemorrhagic choroidal detachment which completely filled the vitreous cavity after cataract surgery. It seemed to be inoperable. Secondary surgery was delayed 3 days to lower IOP to normal levels. The eye underwent anterior drainage sclerotomy under constantly-maintained limbal or pars plana infusion fluid line pressure. The authors performed a pars plana vitrectomy, followed by perfluorocarbon liquid injection and a silicone oil tamponade. After this surgical approach, the patient attained an attached retina and a visual acuity of 5\/200 at the 3 month follow-up.","1469":"Isocyanates are part of a group of important chemicals necessary in the production of adhesives, synthetic rubbers, and a variety of plastics. They are known to have minimal toxic effects when administered locally. However, we experienced a case of damage involving the entire eyeball in a person who accidentally exposed his eye to isocyanates. The patient presented with inflamed conjunctiva, and shrunken cornea and sclera, with focal atrophic changes in the iris. The lens and vitreous were opacified. After removal of the lens and vitreous, there were large areas of atrophic retina and areas of retinal necrosis with holes. We found that locally absorbed isocyanates can cause damage to the entire eyeball. Therefore, we recommend that if there is any evidence of isocyanate penetration, early vitrectomy should be performed to help in determining the extent of retina damage and to decrease the amount of toxic substance in the vitreous.","1470":"Min's glasses are specially manufactured in order to enhance the satisfaction of the wearer and increase treatment effectiveness. We compared the effectiveness of Min's glasses with that of conventional occlusion therapy in amblyopic pediatric patients. We prospectively studied 60 amblyopic patients. For four to 30 months, 24 of the patients were treated with conventional patch occlusion (patch group) and 36 of them were treated with Min's glasses (glasses group). We compared the improvement in visual acuity and the treatment compliance between both groups, according to age (over six and less than six), sex, type of amblyopia, and the duration of treatment. Sixteen patients (66.7%) in the patch group and 32 patients (88.9%) in glasses group showed improvement in visual acuity (p = 0.002). The pre-treatment average log MAR acuity was 0.56 +\/- 0.25 in the patch group, and 0.59 +\/- 0.25 in the glasses group. The average improvement in visual acuity was a 0.17 log MAR score in the patch group, and a 0.31 log MAR score in the glasses group (p = 0.004). Compliance was 59.54% in the patch group and 83.44% in the glasses group (p = 0.012). The pre-treatment average log MAR acuity was 0.49 +\/- 0.23 for children over six years of age in the patch group, and 0.58 +\/- 0.28 for children over six years of age in the glasses group. For children over six years of age in the glasses group the improvement in visual acuity (0.29 log MAR score) was greater than for children over six years of age in the patch group (0.06 log MAR score) (p = 0.0003). The pre-treatment average log MAR acuity was 0.55 +\/- 0.22 for female patients in the patch group, and 0.60 +\/- 0.25 for female patients in the glasses group. Female patients in the glasses group also showed a greater visual acuity improvement (0.29 log MAR score) than female patients in the patch group (0.14 log MAR score) (p = 0.0028). However, there were no differences between the groups in patients less than six years of age and in male patients. In conclusion, Min's glasses were more effective than conventional treatment with a patch in improving visual acuity and encouraging compliance in pediatric amblyopic patients, especially in children over six years of age and in girls.","1471":"To investigate changes in the level of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in the anterior chamber of rabbit with intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. The IOP was elevated with scleral encircling in 12 rabbits. In the control group (4 rabbits), IOP was not changed after scleral encircling, and in group 1 (4 rabbits) and 2 (4 rabbits), IOP was elevated about 10 and 20 mmHg respectively after scleral encircling. At 2 days after scleral encircling, aqueous sampling was performed and levels of MMP-2 were checked by Western blots and gelatin zymograms. The greater the IOP elevation, the more MMP-2 expression in the anterior chamber by Western blots and gelatin zymograms. The increase in MMP-2 expression in response to IOP elevation may have important implications for the IOP feedback control mechanism.","1472":"The long-term visual recovery after a scleral buckling procedure for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment involving the macula was investigated retrospectively. The patients had been treated with a segmental or encircling scleral buckle procedure and in this study the follow-up period was between 5 and 11 years. In order to investigate the natural course of functional recovery of the reattached retina, all cases with a history of intraocular surgery or trauma were excluded. In this investigation, 34 patients were selected in which 35 eyes were studied. The best corrected visual acuities between a 6-month and 5-year postoperative period were compared. They were found to be more improved 5 years after surgery than after 6-month by two or more lines in 19 eyes (54%). In these 19 eyes, the visual acuities continued to improve up to 10 years after surgery. Improvement in the long-term postoperative visual acuity was found to correlate with the shorter duration of macular detachment (30 days), zero or mild myopia (-6 diopters) and to a lesser extent, retinal detachment. the visual function of the reattached human retinas may continue to improve over the long term, especially when these beneficial factors are present.","1473":"In this study, we investigated whether retinal soluble proteins, such as S-antigen, play a role in the induction of nitric oxide by macrophages in vitro. Cells from the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and rat and rabbit peritoneal macrophages were incubated in the presence of retinal soluble protein. The nitrite level in the cultured supernatant was measured to determine nitric oxide production using the Griess reaction. S-antigen induced significant, dose-dependent nitrite production in both RAW 264.7 and rat peritoneal macrophages. The induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase by retinal protein was inhibited by the iNOS-specific inhibitor, aminoguanidine and the tyrosine inhibitor, genistein. These results show that soluble retinal protein significantly induces nitric acid production by macrophages. Increased production of reactive oxygen species by macrophages in the presence of this soluble retinal protein in vivo may accelerate photoreceptor degeneration in uveitis.","1474":"To evaluate the thickness and size consistency of the corneal flap created with the Innovatome automatic microkeratome and to determine any correlation between preoperative variables and these corneal flap dimensions, we performed a prospective study comprising of 268 eyes of 143 patients having laser in situ keratomileusis. Either No. 170 or No. 190 blade was used, and preoperative variables including the central corneal thickness, keratometry (K) reading, spherical equivalent, and the blade type were measured. The mean central corneal flap thickness was 138.8 +\/- 23.5 microns (range, 71.6-193.7 microns) in blade 170 group, and 148.3 +\/- 25.4 microns (range, 80.3-211.7 microns) in blade 190 group. No relationship was found between the corneal flap thickness and the preoperative K reading or the spherical equivalent, but the corneal flap thickness increased with the preoperative central corneal thickness. The mean vertical flap diameter was 9.18 +\/- 0.25 mm (range, 8.50-9.75 mm) in blade 170 group, and 9.50 +\/- 0.31 mm (range, 8.75-10.00 mm) in blade 190 group. No relationship was found between the corneal flap diameter and the preoperative central corneal thickness or the spherical equivalent, but the corneal flap size increased with the preoperative K reading.","1475":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the results of laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for high myopia after a follow-up of two years. A total of 42 eyes from 33 patients with high myopia (range: -9.00 D to -25.50 D) were studied. LASIK was performed using an automated microkeratome (Steinway, USA) and OmniMed II excimer laser with the standard MKM program (Summit Technology, Inc., Waltham, MA) in all patients. The patients were followed up at one, three, six, 12 and 24 months. During follow-up manifest refraction and best corrected and uncorrected visual acuity were measured. Any complications were also analyzed. The two-year follow-up results were as follows. The mean postoperative manifest spherical equivalents (MSE) were -0.51 D at one month, -1.09 D at three months, -1.78 D at six months, -2.17 D at 12 months and -2.61 D at 24 months. Myopic regression continued during the two-year follow-up (p &lt; 0.05). The accuracy of the intended postoperative correction within +\/- 2.00 D was 73.8% at one month, 69.1% at three months, 52.4% at six months, 52.4% at 12 months, and 45.2% at 24 months. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was unchanged or increased in 35 eyes (83.3%). Only three eyes (7.2%) lost two or more lines of BCVA. This was due to irregular astigmatism in one eye, macular degeneration in one eye, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in one eye. In this study, LASIK was effective and safe in the correction of high myopia, however continuous myopic regression was seen over the two-year follow-up. Refining the nomogram to adjust for progressive myopic regression will be necessary in order to obtain better results.","1476":"Myiasis is most prevalent in Mexico, central and south America, tropical Africa, and the southwestern United States. Although dermal myiasis is rare in most of the United States, it is a disorder that may be seen in international travelers. In the United States, external myiasis is usually caused by the cattle botfly. We report here a case of ophthalmomyiasis involving the left upper eyelid of a child. We examined a six-year-old boy who presented to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) in September 1998. He complained of persistent swelling of his left upper eyelid for the previous ten days. The edema and erythema were unresponsive to warm compresses and oral antibiotics. Ocular examination revealed a mild preseptal cellulitis of the left upper eyelid with a small draining fistula. On slit-lamp examination, we found one larva protruding intermittently from the fistula site. The larva was extracted with forceps, wrapped in a moist towel and sent in a jar to the parasitology laboratory. The specimen was identified as a Cuterebra larva by a parasitologist at the Harvard School of Public Health. One week later, the patient's eyelid edema and erythema had completely resolved.","1477":"This article describes the first report of phakomatous choristoma of the eyelid in Korea. A six-month-old boy underwent excision of a congenital inferonasal orbital mass arising from the left lower lid. A dermoid cyst was suspected, however a diagnosis of phakomatous choristoma was made following conventional histology. An immunohistochemical study of this rare benign congenital tumor was conducted. The cuboidal epithelial cells comprising this choristoma showed strongly positive cytoplasmic staining with S-100 protein and vimentin. They also showed focally positive staining with a neuron-specific enolase, while they showed no immunoreactivity to cytokeratin or epithelial membrane antigen. The results of the immunohistochemical study support the conclusion that this tumor is of lenticular anlage origin.","1478":"A rare case of a patient with orbitocranial injury by a wooden foreign body is reported. Penetrating periorbital wound by a wooden stick with entry site at the right upper eyelid was related to the invasion into the temporal lobe. Fortunately, the anterior and posterior segments of eye were unharmed, but right ocular motility was markedly restricted mechanically in all directions. Forced duction test was strong positive, especially the dextroversion of the right eye. Computed tomography scan showed a well-delineated low density from the orbital wall into the temporal lobe. The wooden foreign body was subsequently removed from the orbit and the temporal lobe, through the neurosurgical frontotemporal approach. After the wooden foreign body was removed, the ocular movement of the right eye fully recovered without any intracranial or ocular complications.","1479":"Postoperative upper lid asymmetry is a common problem following ptosis surgery. Recently we performed multiple ptosis operative procedures to correct lid asymmetry in the management of a patient with bilateral acquired upper eyelid ptosis. The patient's eyelids were corrected successfully after five procedures. We retrospectively reviewed the treatment of this patient with unsatisfactory results. The medical literature was reviewed for further insight into the common problem of reoperation after ptosis surgery.","1480":"There are many risk factors involved in the development of ischemic optic neuropathy such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and vascular incompetence. Therefore, the treatment of ischemic optic neuropathy should not be solely based on proper diagnosis but should also involve a thorough and systemic investigation to identify those multifactorial possibilities, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. We report upon a patient who developed non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy following treatment of a sphenoethmoid mucocele, which lead to recovered vision and a satisfactory improvement of visual field defects, after percutaneous trans-coronary angiography with stent insertion of the coronary arteries.","1481":"This is a case of presumed ocular toxocariasis in a 28-year old woman complaining of a sudden onset of nasal side field defect of the right eye. The patient had been suffering from uveitis for ten months. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye showed a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Furthermore, a retinochoroidal granulomatous lesion was observed nearby the tear site. Scleral buckling, cryotherapy, and gas injection(SF6, pure gas, 0.7 cc) were conducted. Mebendazole was prescribed for one month at 25 mg\/kg per body weight daily. Even though the interventions resulted in the recovery of the field defect, anti-Toxocara IgG and IgE titer levels did not decrease when checked three months after the treatment ended. This is the first confirmed serological ocular toxocariasis case in Korea. Uveitis may be a clinical presentation prior to retinal detachment of a person with toxocariasis.","1482":"A healthy 65-year-old man with sudden profound visual loss in his right eye presented with clinical signs of central retinal venous occlusion and retinal whitening, indicative of a cilioretinal arterial obstruction. He had been diagnosed with cilioretinal artery occlusion at a private ophthalmology clinic three days before being referred to our department. On fluorescein angiogram of the affected eye, the proximal portion of the retinal arteries filled with dye 27.3 seconds after injection, indicating a delay in retinal arterial filling. Moreover, the cilioretinal artery did not fill at that phase, but went on to fill 45.1 seconds after injection. Over 63.4 seconds after the filling of the retinal arteries, the laminar flow of the retinal venous vessels appeared. This was not until 90.7 seconds after injection. This patient was elderly, had no systemic diseases, and showed non-ischemic CRVO, prolonged retinal arterial filling on fluorescein angiography, and poor prognosis in visual acuity. His clinical course seemed to favor the pathogenetic hypothesis of a primary arterial affection.","1483":"Two cases of late postoperative capsular block syndrome that occurred 4 and 8.5 years, respectively, were encountered. One case underwent phacoemulsification after continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis in his left eye. The other case had a can opener type capsulorhexis and underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with trabeculectomy. One-piece posterior chamber lenses were implanted in both cases. Upon slit-lamp examination, the posterior capsules were found distorted posteriorly; the capsular openings were apparently sealed by the lens optic. A whitish material existed between the intraocular lens optic and posterior capsule, with thick aggregation in a lower fifth space in case 1. After Nd:YAG laser anterior capsulotomy in case 1, the thick aggregate spread diffusely on the posterior capsule which was sunken completely for 4 weeks. After Nd:YAG capsulotomy, the distorted posterior capsule disappeared and the best corrected visual acuity was restored to 20\/20 in both cases.","1484":"Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy(AION) is known to be caused by circulatory disturbance in the anterior optic nerve(AON). Because the AON shares blood supply from the paraoptic short posterior ciliary artery with peripapillary choroid, the authors investigated the angiographic evidences of combined choroidal insufficiency in patients with acute AION. Fundus fluorescein angiograms from 30 eyes from 28 patients with acute AION were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of acute AION was based primarily on angiographic evidences of filling delay of optic nerve head and the various clinical features, such as decreased visual acuity, visual field defects, afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc swelling. Angiographic evidences of combined choroidal filling delay were as follows: 1) circular or localized filling delay of peripapillary choroid in 15 eyes (50%), 2) generalized filling delay of posterior pole in 11 eyes (36.7%), 3) filling delay of unilateral choroid divided by watershed zone in 5 eyes (16.7%), and 4) choriocapillary filling delay in 10 eyes (33.3%). In this study, various types of choroidal insufficiency in patients with AION were observed, which helped us to differentiate AION from the other various diseases of the anterior optic nerve.","1485":"Internal and moving targets of scanning laser ophthalmoscopes are not capable of observing the fundus beyond a field of more than 80 degrees with high resolution. The authors enabled wide-angle fundus examination with high resolution through a modification of the target. Mirror image fixation targets(MIFT), which fixated the opposite side of the examined eye onto the mirror image of five lamps placed 1.5 m away from the patient, were used to observe the fundus during fluorescein angiography in five diabetic retinopathy patients. In three of them, the ranges of the fundus examinations were measured using conventional internal fixation targets. The mean ranges of the fundus examinations when using MIFT (77.2 +\/- 2.5 degrees horizontally, 67.9 +\/- 2.1 degrees vertically) were significantly wider than when using internal fixation targets (65.5 +\/- 2.6 degrees horizontally, 44.4 +\/- 2.8 degrees vertically). MIFT provided a wide angle fundus view with high resolution equal to that of 40 degrees angle images using a scanning laser ophthalmoscope.","1486":"Mitomycin C has improved the success rate of glaucoma filtering surgery in patients at high risk for surgical failure. However chronic hypotony is marked by decreased vision and a late-onset leaking bleb after filtration surgery using mitomycin C. Bleb excision and conjunctival advancement is the method of choice to repair bleb leakage and chronic hypotony. Five eyes from five patients were received glaucoma filtration surgery with topical mitomycin C. All of the patients' blebs were avascular and transparent. The reasons for bleb excision were two spontaneous bleb leaks, two traumatic bleb leaks and one case of severe irritation. The mean follow-up period was 18.4 +\/- 8.3 months (ten to 29 months). Cataract surgery was combined in one eye. Postoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) increased from 2.3 +\/- 1.5 mmHg to 9.5 +\/- 3.7 mmHg at nine months postoperatively in four eyes. It went from 28 mmHg to 40 mmHg in one patient with uveitis, for whom a second trabeculectomy with mitomycin C; 0.4 mg\/ml for 3 minutes, was performed. After surgery, IOP decreased to 4 mmHg in three months. Postoperative visual acuity improved four snellen lines in three eyes. A partially avascular bleb recurred in three eyes, a corneal bleb in one eye and blepharoptosis, which disappeared spontaneously at four months postoperatively, in one eye. Necrotic bleb excision and advancement of fornical conjunctiva were useful methods to increase IOP and to improve visual acuity for the patient experiencing irritation symptoms, and for leaking blebs, and hypotonic maculopathy.","1487":"Brimonidine tartrate of 0.5% was identified as the most effective and safe dose for acute intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering. The efficacy of brimonidine tartrate 0.2% in preventing IOP elevation after an argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT) was evaluated. Eighty patients were selected for a randomized, prospective study. Each patient was assigned to one of four treatment regimens: (1) brimonidine before and after ALT(B\/B), (2) brimonidine before and placebo after ALT(B\/P), (3) placebo before and brimonidine after ALT(P\/B), (4) placebo before and after ALT(P\/P). IOP elevation of 5 mmHg or greater occurred in 3.3% (2\/60) of brimonidine-treated patients and in 30% (6\/20) of placebo-treated patients. There was a mean decrease of IOP from baseline during the first 3 hours after ALT in all brimonidine-treated groups (7.1 +\/- 3.4, 6.2 +\/- 4.4, 3.5 +\/- 2.9 mmHg for the B\/B, B\/P, P\/B groups), but no change of mean IOP in the Placebo-treated group. Only one drop of brimonidine tartrate of 0.2% installed either before or after ALT was sufficient to prevent post-ALT IOP spike and minimize the undesired systemic adverse effects that two drop installation can produce.","1488":"To evaluate the effect of different concentrations 0.03%, 0.1% and 0.3% of FK 506 on xenograft corneal rejection, guinea pig corneas were transplanted into rats. FK 506 was then applied topically four times a day for 21 days. The grafts were inspected and scored according to opacity, edema, and graft protrusion. All grafts in the control group were rejected by the 14th postoperative day, and grafts in the FK 506 treated groups began to be rejected by the 17th postoperative day. Inflammatory cell infiltration was less dense in the FK 506 treated grafts than in the control group. Higher concentrations of FK 506 appeared to be more effective in preventing and decreasing the severity of the graft rejection. Topical FK 506 can delay the development of xenograft corneal rejection and decrease its severity in this animal model.","1489":"The primary objective of this study was to develop a simple experimental model of angiogenesis by photodynamic thrombosis of the retinal veins in Sprague-Dawley rats. After a tail vein injection of rose bengal (40 mg\/kg), all major retinal veins adjacent to the optic nerve head were photocoagulated with an argon green laser. The eyes were examined regularly for the following eight weeks. A grading system was devised using fluorescein angiograms and ADPase staining to describe the progression of the new vessels. Nine out of ten eyes showed development of the preretinal new vessels by day 14. Seven weeks after laser coagulation, 2 of 5 eyes developed localized tractional retinal detachment. Regression of the neovascularization was not noted in any of the animals during the follow-up period. The authors were able to establish an experimental model for preretinal neovascularization by vein occlusion. This model may be applied in study of the pathogenesis and treatment of retinal neovascularization.","1490":"In this study, we investigated whether retinal soluble proteins, such as interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein(IRBP), play a role in the induction of nitric oxide by macrophages in vitro. Cells from the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and rat and rabbit peritoneal macrophages were incubated in the presence of retinal soluble protein. The nitrite level in the cultured supernatant was evaluated for nitric oxide production using the Griess reaction. IRBP induced significant, dose-dependent nitrite production in both RAW 264.7 and rat peritoneal macrophages. Induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) by retinal proteins was inhibited by the iNOS-specific inhibitor, aminoguanidine, and the tyrosine inhibitor, genistein. These results show that soluble retinal proteins significantly induce nitric acid production by macrophages. Increased production of reactive oxygen species by macrophages in the presence of this soluble retinal protein in vivo may accelerate photoreceptor degeneration in uveitis.","1491":"The number of patients with low vision is increasing as life expectancy increases. In addition, the interest and demand for low vision aids are also increasing with improved socioeconomic status and the development of mass media. Therefore, it is imperative to recognize the importance of low vision aids. We reviewed the clinical records of 118 patients who visited our low vision clinic more than twice. According to the data analyzed, optic nerve atrophy, retinal degeneration, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were the most common causes of low vision in these patients. The best corrected visual acuities without low vision aids were less than 0.3, but with the help of low vision aids, vision improved to more than 0.4 in 87% of the patients for near vision, and 56% for distant vision. The patients had complained that they could not read books, see a blackboard, recognize a person at a distance, and had other problems because of low vision. However, with the use of low vision aids their satisfaction with their vision rose to 70%. Hand magnifiers, high-powered spectacle lenses, and stand magnifiers were the low vision aids commonly used by people for near vision, while the Galilean telescope and Keplerian telescope were the most popular devices used for distant vision. In conclusion, low vision aids are very helpful devices to patients with low vision.","1492":"Scleral perforation occurred as a result of using a silicone band during scleral buckling surgery for subtotal retinal detachment in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The patient was initially treated by cryotherapy and scleral buckling surgery for ROP, and was later referred due to a dark bluish mass in the superotemporal quadrant of the eyeball. After removing the overlying whitish membrane, uveal tissue prolapsed through the melted scleral wound (5 mm x 5 mm). A silicone encircling band had passed through the wound and was exposed subconjunctivally around the temporal and the inferior limbus. The band was removed and a scleral allograft was performed. After three years, follow up revealed the eyeball was slightly microphthalmic. Though scleral bucking surgery is helpful for the treatment of advanced ROP, a scleral perforation may develop as a disastrous complication.","1493":"We studied a case of unusual retinopathy in a 35-year-old woman who presented with bilateral visual deterioration due to retinal pigmentary mottling and serous elevation in the posterior pole. Two years before, she had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy for ovarian cancer. Her electroretinogram became subnormal, and her fluorescein angiogram exhibited multiple deep retinal pigment epithelial leakages and subretinal dye pooling in both eyes. Corticosteroid therapy failed to prevent visual loss. She was found to possess antibodies against retinal 45 kd protein. This led to a diagnosis of cancer-associated retinopathy with atypical protein profile. We report a rare variety of cancer-associated retinopathy in a patient with-ovarian cancer.","1494":"Internal carotid artery or ophthalmic artery occlusions are devastating ophthalmological events which lead to severe impairment of vision. A case of multiple branch retinal artery occlusions in a 63-year-old male with internal carotid artery and ophthalmic artery occlusions on brain angiography is presented. Emboli lodging in branches of the retinal arteries were bright, glistening, yellow or orange in appearance. Such a distinctive ophthalmoscopic appearance led to the diagnosis of cholesterol emboli. Fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography disclosed delayed filling of the retinal vessels and choroid, and showed multiple hypofluorescence distal to the vessels in which the emboli were lodged. At the time of initial examination, the number of emboli lodged in retinal arteries was estimated at more than 20. As time passed, a few of the previous emboli disappeared and new emboli appeared in other sites on fundus examination. We think that the lodging of new emboli in other sites is due to the continued break-up of atheromatous tissue through the collateral circulation associated with the occlusion of the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries.","1495":"The visual results of laser photocoagulation for subfoveal choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) has not always been satisfactory. The surgical removal of the neovascular membrane may be another treatment option. To investigate the prognosis and risk factors of this surgery, we analyzed the results of surgical removal of subfoveal CNVM (23 eyes), subfoveal hemorrhage with CNVM (6 eyes), and subfoveal hemorrhage alone (6 eyes). The mean follow-up period was 17.7 months (range 2 to 47 months). The mean preoperative membrane size was 0.89 disc diameter and the mean postoperative retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) defect size was 1.33 disc diameter. Visual improvement was observed in 13 out of the 23 eyes (56.5%) with sufoveal CNVM, four out of the six eyes (66.6%) with subretinal hemorrhage and CNVM, and five out of the six eyes (83.3%) with subretinal hemorrhage only. The visual outcome of subfoveal CNVM surgery was related to the presence of a subfoveal RPE defect (p = 0.005) rather than to the size of the RPE defect. No recurrence of neovascular membrane was observed during the follow up period. In conclusion, surgical removal may be a good alternative treatment for subfoveal CNVM.","1496":"We performed this study to evaluate the changes in refraction and axial length induced by intraocular silicone oil, and to compare with various clinical parameters between 1,000 and 5,000 cSt silicone oil. The refraction length was measured with an autorefractometer, and the axial length was measured with A-scan ultrasonography. These measurements were performed before and after removal of the silicone oil, using a clear cornea technique in which the silicone oil was injected in combination with pars plana vitrectomy. The mean age of the 25 patients was 38.73 years. On average the intraocular retention after the removal of the silicone oil lasted 5.13 months, and the follow-up time following silicone oil removal was 4.37 months. The changes in refraction and axial length were 6.32 diopters and 12.02 mm, respectively. Eyes injected with 5,000 cSt (11 eyes) tended to have higher changes in the refraction (5.84 vs 6.86 diopters) and axial length (11.70 vs 12.34 mm) than did eyes injected with 1,000 cSt silicone oil (14 eyes). Statistically significant differences were shown for the changes in refraction (p = 0.010) and intraocular pressure (0.63 vs 2.00 mmHg; p = 0.006), whereas but not for the changes in axial length (p = 0.306) and visual acuity (14\/100 vs 15\/100; p = 0.125). Intraocular silicone oil induced changes in refraction and axial length, and these changes seemed to vary with different viscosities.","1497":"Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells transdifferentiate in culture, a transition which is accompanied by a shift in biological activity. The present study investigates whether transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta has the same effects on morphologically transformed RPE cells that it has on primary RPE cells. It also evaluates the autocrine and paracrine activities of TGF-beta s synthesized by RPE cells as well as the anti-TGF-beta effect of mannose-6-phosphate (M-6-P). RPE cells were subcultured at the sixth passage to induce morphological change. The effect of second passaged RPE-conditioned medium (CM) on DNA synthesis was evaluated by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine in rabbit subconjunctival fibroblasts (SCFs) and primary RPE cells. The presence of TGF-beta in RPE-CM was determined using immunoblotting analysis. And the inhibitory effect of M-6-P on cell proliferation mediated by RPE-CM was also analyzed using 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA. TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2, and TGF-beta 3 inhibited the proliferation of the primary cultures of RPE cells in a dose-dependent manner, but the spindle-shaped sixth passaged RPE cells were not inhibited by these growth factors. The medium conditioned by RPE cells stimulated the proliferation of SCFs and inhibited the proliferation of primary RPE cells, in a manner similar to TGF-beta. When this medium was precipitated with either anti-TGF-beta 1, anti-TGF-beta 2, or anti-TGF-beta 3 antibodies, all three TGF-beta s, with an apparent molecular size of 25 kDa, were detected. Mannose-6-phosphate significantly blocked the effect of RPE-CM on cell proliferation. These findings indicate that RPE cells produce biologically functional TGF-beta s and that M-6-P can block the inhibitory effect of RPE-CM on cell proliferation.","1498":"To investigate the mitomycin C-induced apoptotic cell death of fibroblasts, the primarily cultured human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts were exposed to a clinically used dosage of 0.4 mg\/ml of mitomycin C for 5 minutes. TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay and electron microscopic studies were performed to determine the extent of mitomycin C-induced apoptosis. A flow cytometric study was performed to quantify the apoptotic cell population over time. The TUNEL stains were positive and electron microscopy showed features of apoptotic cell death in some fibroblasts 3 and 5 days after treatment. Flow cytometric analysis using Annexin V-propidium iodide double staining detected apoptotic cells 3 days after treatment. These apoptotic cell populations increased at 4 days and were sustained for one week. This study revealed that the clinical effects of mitomycin C on fibroblasts may be mediated not only by antiproliferative but also apoptotic cell death to some degree. Therefore, the apoptotic cell death of fibroblasts induced by mitomycin C should be considered to properly understand the mechanism of wound healing after trabeculectomy with adjunctive mitomycin C.","1499":"The distribution of sulfated proteoglycans (PGs) in the normal human trabecular meshwork was studied by histochemical electron microscopy using the cationic dye, cuprolinic blue (CB).. The trabecular meshwork was obtained from human enucleated eyes and incubated for three days. After incubation, they were stained with 0.2% CB at a critical electrolyte concentration and prepared for histochemical electron microscopy. Ultrastructurally, PG-CB complexes were found as small punctate or filamentous structures, and were associated with collagen fibrils in the cores of the trabecular beams and the basal laminae of trabecular endothelial cells. In addition, large filamentous PG-CB complexes were mainly associated with areas of amorphous extracellular matrix between the collagen fiber bundles and in the fine fibrillar material near the basal laminae of endothelial cells of Schlemm's canal. This investigation resulted in an illustration of the ultrastructural distribution of PGs in the human trabecular meshwork. Further studies will be needed to specify the nature of PGs and their role in the aqueous outflow system.","1500":"CHARGE syndrome, first described by Pagon, was named for its six major clinical features. They are: coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the choanae, retarded growth and development including CNS anomalies, genital hypoplasia and\/or urinary tract anomalies, and ear anomalies and\/or hearing loss. We experienced three cases of CHARGE syndrome who displayed ocular coloboma, heart defects, retarded growth and development, and external ear anomalies, and we also review the previously reported literature concerning CHARGE syndrome.","1501":"In order to determine the factors related to the worse final visual outcome following nonperforating traumatic hyphema, the clinical characteristics of 18 patients with visual outcome of 0.1 or worse were compared with those of 166 patients with visual outcome of 0.15 or better. The presence of posterior segment injuries such as macula edema, retinal hemorrhage, epiretinal membrane, and choroidal rupture were significant factors of a poor final visual outcome (P &lt; 0.01). The presence of anterior segment injuries such as corneal blood staining, traumatic mydriasis, iridodialysis, cataract, and lens subluxation had significant predictive factors on a poor final visual outcome and the concurrent posterior segment injuries were more frequent in these patients. Initial visual acuity of 0.1 or worse, glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, and eyelid laceration were also significant associations of a poor final visual outcome (P &lt; 0.05). Patients with initially larger hyphema (grade I or more vs microscopic) and older age group (16 years or more vs 15 years or less) tended to have poor final visual acuities. Rebleeding was not associated with significant deterioration in visual prognosis. We conclude that the posterior segment injuries seem to be directly related to a poor visual outcome rather than the occurrence of secondary hemorrhage.","1502":"This study is a case report of the histopathologic findings of the anterior chamber epithelial ingrowth in a patient who had penetrating injury in the right eye from an arrow approximately 20 years ago. The patient underwent the enucleation in the right eye due to pthisis bulbi and was fitted with a prosthetic eye. Specimens were prepared from the enucleated right eye for histopathologic observation using hematoxyllin-eosin to be observed under light microscopy. Epithelial ingrowth in the anterior chamber was noted in one layer or multi-layered epithelial cell growth. The ingrowth had spread to the posterior surface of the cornea to the anterior chamber angle, to the iris surface, and to the anterior surface of the vitreous. The finding suggests that epithelial ingrowth could invade even through a perforation site and spread wherever the cells could reach.","1503":"The in vivo confocal microscopy technique provides us with a real-time, non-invasive way of examining the human cornea. The most important advantage of this type of microscopy is to reveal the etiologic agents in infectious keratitis such as Acanthamoeba keratitis. We present several representative cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis, which were diagnosed in their early stages using in vivo confocal microscopy and managed based on that diagnosis. In our Acanthamoeba keratitis cases, highly-reflective round or ovoid organisms with a diameter of about 10-25 um were visualized distinctly against relatively-dark normal parenchymal structures, such as epithelial cells or keratocyte nuclei. Double-walled structures of Acanthamoeba cysts were clearly demonstrated in some cases. We can confirm that in vivo tandem scanning confocal microscopy is a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying the infecting organisms in Acanthamoeba keratitis.","1504":"A 24-year-old healthy male underwent uncomplicated laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) in left eye. One day after the surgery, he complained of ocular pain and multiple corneal stromal infiltrates had developed in left eye. Immediately, the corneal interface and stromal bed were cleared, and maximal antibiotic treatments with fortified tobramycin (1.2%) and cefazolin (5%) were given topically. The causative organism was identified as 'Streptococcus viridans' both on smear and culture. Two days after antibiotic therapy was initiated, the ocular inflammation and corneal infiltrates had regressed and ocular pain was relieved. One month later, the patient's best corrected visual acuity had returned to 20\/20 with -0.75 -1.00 x 10 degrees, however minimal stromal scarring still remained. This case demonstrates that microbial keratitis after LASIK, if treated promptly, does not lead to a permanent reduction in visual acuity.","1505":"To elucidate the ultrastructural change of corneal epithelium co-cultured with herpes simplex virus (HSV), the corneal epithelium of 3 rabbits was excised and cultivated in culture media. After 7 days, the Kos strain of herpes simplex virus was inoculated in the cultured cornea epithelium until cytopathic effect was occurred. It was fixed in the solution of 3% glutaraldehyde and examined with electronmicroscope. In co-cultured cells, the intercellular spaces had increased and microvilli were seen prominently. The virus particles that initiated the infection by fusing the viral envelope with the plasma membrane were also seen. The nuclear degeneration in an infected cell was prominent. The nuclear membrane was folded markedly, and the chromatin was degraded, condensed and displaced toward the nuclear membrane. Numerous viral particles and inclusion bodies were present in the nuclei. These findings suggest that the infectious process of herpes simplex virus in the human corneal epithelium may occur in a similar way. This result would be helpful in understanding the pathogenesis of herpes simplex epithelial keratitis.","1506":"The purpose of this study was to analyze the fundus findings and associated abnormalities in full-term babies with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)-mimicking retinopathy. In twenty-seven such babies suffering from this condition, retinal findings were retrospectively analyzed. These babies were not premature and had not required supplementary oxygen; there was no family history of the disease, and no known causes. Bilaterality and severity of retinopathy were compared between groups with associated systemic abnormalities and those without. Forty eyes in twenty-seven full-term babies had abnormal retinal findings; dragged retina accounted for 42.5%, and falciform retinal fold for 47.5%, and retrolental membrane for 10%. Nine babies had associated brain abnormalities, and in these, severe bilateral retinopathy was more likely to occur than in those without abnormalities. These results suggest that if full-term babies have associated abnormalities of the brain, the presence of retinopathy should be ascertained postnatally by cautious examination of the retina.","1507":"The purpose of this study was to assess surgical results of internal limiting membrane (ILM) maculorrhexis in macular hole surgery. This study is a part of continuing prospective clinical trial of our team of researchers. Thirteen eyes of 13 patients with idiopathic macular hole underwent vitrectomy with the removal of posterior cortical vitreous, peeling of the macular ILM, and intraocular gas tamponade, followed by postoperative face-down positioning. The excised specimens were evaluated with transmission electron microscopy. Complete closure of the hole was observed in all 13 eyes (100% anatomic success rate). Visual improvement of 2 or more lines on ETDRS visual acuity chart was achieved in 11 (85%) of the 13 eyes. Six (54.5%) eyes attained visual acuity of 20\/50 or better. Electron microscopy showed ILM in the removed specimens. ILM maculorrhexis is a promising new surgical approach to close idiopathic macular holes but requires further investigation and long-term evaluation.","1508":"The distribution and shape of melanosomes of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and acid phosphatase activity in melanosomes were studied in rabbits. The rabbit eyes were observed using electron microscopy and enzyme cytochemical electron microscopy. The majority of melanosomes were located near the apical region of the RPE. Melanosomes in the RPE were classified as two shapes, elliptical and spherical or oval. Elliptical melanosomes were located parallel to the apical process and spherical or oval melanosomes were arranged vertically or obliquely to the apical process. We think that the distribution and shape of melanosomes contributes to the effective absorption and blocking of light coming from all directions. Almost all of the mature and immature melanosomes we identified showed positive in acid phosphatase reaction, indicating that melanosomes are commonly incorporated into the lysosomal system of the RPE. However, a few melanosomes showed negative in acid phosphatase reaction, suggesting that some melanosomes are stable and inert. The observed premelanosome showed negative reaction. Two types of melanosome-related complex granules were identified; melanosomes with a cortex of enzyme-reactive material (melanolysosome) and melanosomes with a cortex of lipofuscin (melanolipofuscin). These findings indicate tha a relationship between melanosomes and the lysosomal system of the RPE exists, and suggest that melanosomes may undergo modification or degradation in the cytoplasm. Also, the observation of a premelanosome and the positive acid phosphatase activity in mature and immature melanosomes indicates that melanosomes of the RPE may continue to be synthesized at a low rate in adult eyes.","1509":"Oxidative stress has been proposed as a major injury mechanism in the central nervous system including the retina. In this study, as an initial attempt to study the mechanism of oxidative injury in the retina, we developed a cell culture model by utilizing the iron exposure paradigm. Exposure of rat retinal cultures for 24 hours to 10-40 MicroM ferrous or ferric chloride induced a concentration-dependent death of retinal neurons but not of photoreceptors or astrocytes. An antioxidant, trolox effectively attenuated the iron-induced death of neurons and photoreceptors in a dose-dependent manner whereas neither glutamate receptor antagonists nor cycloheximide were protective. Of retinal interneurons, GABAergic neurons were more vulnerable to the iron toxicity than calbindin (+) horizontal neurons. These findings show that iron exposure induces anti-oxidant-sensitive neuronal injury in retinal culture, independent of the excitotoxic or the apoptotic mechanisms. Of retinal neurons, different cell types exhibit differential vulnerabilities to the iron-induced oxidative injury. This simplified culture model system may be useful in elucidating mechanisms of oxidative injury in the retina.","1510":"To describe silicone oil drainage from the vitreous cavity to the subconjunctival space through a Molteno implant. A 52-year-old aphakic man with a Molteno implant inserted after lensectomy, vitrectomy and intravitreal silicone oil injection visited our hospital. The Molteno tube was located in the anterior chamber with two silicone oil drops on it. Corneal dellen, induced by marked bleb-like elevation of the conjunctiva was noted during follow-up and excision biopsy was attempted. The conjunctival elevation consisted of innumerable microdrops of silicone oil enclosed by inflammatory subconjunctival tissue. Silicone oil as well as aqueous humor had drained through the Molteno implant and glaucoma implant surgery may thus not be appropriate for the control of intraocular pressure of aphakia by intravitreal silicone oil before removal of oil.","1511":"To evaluate functional changes of the retina in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), we analyzed maximal combined response according to the recommendations of the International Society of Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision. Oscillatory potentials were extracted from maximal combined response by high pass filtering. Because most CRF patients suffer from hypertension, hypertensive patients were selected for the control group. Values recorded in CRF patients were compared with those recorded in hypertensive patients and in the normal control group. CRF patients underwent laboratory tests which included complete blood cell count and the determination of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, natrium, and potassium levels. The parameters of electroretinograms obtained from CRF patients were compared with those obtained from the normal control group, in the former group all amplitudes were significantly lower and all implicit times except those of b-wave were significantly delayed (P &lt; 0.05). In CRF patients, decreased b-amplitude of maximal combined response and delayed implicit time of oscillatory potentials 1, and 2 were significantly different from those in hypertensive patients (P &lt; 0.05). CRF patients had anemia, and their blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels appeared abnormal. There was, however, no clinical correlation between biochemical data and electroretinograms. Consequently, retinal function in CRF patients was severely damaged compared with control groups (i.e., normal and hypertensive patients). We suggest that these findings are result of anemia and uremia in addition to hypertensive retinal damage.","1512":"We studied the visual acuity and anatomical stability of 101 eyes which had undergone vitreous surgery for advanced retinopathy of prematurity. All were followed up for at least six months. The anatomical and visual results of vitrectomy in 87 eyes were reviewed. The patients' average age at surgery was 9.6 months, and the average follow-up period was 37.6 months. To preserve the structure of the eyeball or to prevent further complications due to a shallow anterior chamber, a further 14 eyes underwent lensectomy. Total attachment was achieved in 20 eyes(23.0%), and partial attachment in 24(27.6%). Finally, 42 eyes(48.3%) were able to perceive light, while fixation and following occurred in 15(17.2%). Six eyes(6.9%) were able to identify form. The relatively useful vision achieved in cases of advanced retinopathy of prematurity in this study with long follow-up suggests that the rationale of vitreous surgery is to salvage functional retina and to prevent total blindness and other complications.","1513":"The purpose of this study was to determine how closely peripapillary retinal vessel diameter is related to functional and structural optic nerve damage in primary open-angle glaucoma. Using optic disc photographs of 234 eyes of 141 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and 139 eyes of 86 normal subjects, the diameters of the superior and inferior temporal retinal arteries and veins were measured at the optic disc border. On the basis of rim\/disc area ratio, the glaucoma group was divided into four stages: early, more than 0.61; medium, 0.60-0.41; advanced, 0.40-0.21; far advanced, less than 0.20. In the normal group the diameter of the inferior temporal vein was the largest, followed by that of the superior temporal vein, the inferior temporal artery, and the superior temporal artery. The diameters of the inferior and superior temporal retinal artery were significantly smaller at the early and medium stage, respectively, whereas both inferior and superior temporal retinal vein diameters were significantly smaller at the far advanced stage. The diameters of the inferior and superior temporal retinal arteries correlated significantly with neuroretinal rim area (r &gt; or = 0.48, P = 0.0001), mean deviation (r &gt; or = 0.42, P = 0.0001), vertical cup-to-disc ratio (r &lt; or = -0.33, P = 0.0001), and peripapillary atrophy data (r &lt; or = -0.14, P &lt; 0.04). The results indicate that in primary open-angle glaucoma, vessel diameter becomes less as neuroretinal rim area decreases and visual field defects and peripapillary atrophy increase. Its evaluation can be helpful for the diagnosis of glaucoma and possibly also during follow-up.","1514":"This study was undertaken in order to determine the value of measuring peripapillary atrophy for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with glaucoma, and to evaluate how closely peripapillary atrophy is related to structural and functional optic nerve damage in glaucoma. Magnification-corrected morphometry of photographs using a computer graphic program and automated static threshold perimetry were performed in 234 eyes of 141 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and 139 eyes of 86 normal subjects. The groups were not significantly different in age, refractive error or disc area. Zones alpha and beta were significantly larger, total peripapillary atrophy was significantly more extensive, and zone beta occurred more often in the glaucoma group than in the normal group. The frequency of zone beta increased with advancing glaucoma stage. The areas of zones alpha and beta and total peripapillary atrophy increased significantly with decreasing rim\/disc area ratio, rim area, and mean deviation, and with increasing vertical and horizontal cup-to-disc ratios and cup area. Correlation coefficients were generally higher for zone beta than for zone alpha. Peripapillary atrophy was greater in a sector in which the neuroretinal rim loss was more marked. These findings suggest that increases in the extent of peripapillary atrophy are related to the severity of glaucomatous optic nerve damage and visual field defects, and that peripapillary atrophy is useful for the diagnosis and progression of glaucomatous nerve damage.","1515":"The objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the effects of three combined phacoemulsification and trabeculectomy procedures procedures (phacotrabeculectomy) involving intraocular lens implantation through a single incision. Twenty-eight eyes of 28 patients suffering from chronic open angle glaucoma and chronic angle closure glaucoma were enrolled in this study. No-stitch phacotrabeculectomy (Group A), modified T-flap phacotrabeculectomy (Group B) and phacotrabeculectomy with sutures (Group C) were performed in 11, eight, and nine patients respectively, who were followed up for 6 months. At the end of that period, the mean reduction of intraocular pressure was 6.39 mm Hg; in group A, B and C, the reduction was 3.27, 4.87 and 11.55 mm Hg, respectively. The procedure followed in group C was therefore most effective, and there was a statistically significant difference between the groups (p &lt; 0.05). The survival rate of blebs was also marked in group C. There were no apparent differences in terms of visual improvement, complications and number of medications between the groups. This study suggests that the choice of procedure should be determined by the desired degree of pressure reduction.","1516":"This study was performed to evaluate the result of photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) without topical corticosteroid treatment at postoperative two years. PRK was performed by Summit OmniMed excimer laser, using a 5.0 mm ablation zone in 51 eyes of 29 patients who were then followed up for more than 2 years. During this period, patients who showed myopic regression of less than 1.5 diopters(D) or corneal haze less than grade 2, were regarded as the favorable result group and those who showed myopic regression equal to or greater than 1.5 D or corneal haze greater than grade 1 were regarded as the unfavorable result group. Thirty-four of 51 eyes showed favorable results without any corticosteroid treatment, and 17 eyes showed unfavorable results. In this latter group preoperative mean refractive error (-7.94 +\/- 1.58 D) was significantly higher than in the favorable result group (-5.14 +\/- 1.30 D) (p &lt; 0.01, t-test); there was, though no statistical difference in age, gender, or corneal thickness. The results were unfavorable in only two of 32 eyes suffering from moderate myopia (&lt; or = -6.0 D), but in 15 of 19 showing high myopia (&gt; -6.0 D). In eyes suffering from moderate myopia, routine topical corticosteroid treatment after PRK does not appear to be necessary.","1517":"In order to elucidate in vivo neuronal cell death in the retina, and involvement of NF-kappa B in this process, we studied the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and the activation of NF-kappa B after transection of the optic nerve of adult rat at 5 mm from the eyeball. The morphology of dying ganglion cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer was observed by light and electron microscopy, the activation of NF-kappa B was investigated immunohistochemically. Seven and 14 days post-axotomy, dying cells contained pyknotic nuclei. The death of retinal ganglion cells involved apoptosis, activation of NF-kappa B (p50 and p65) was prominent in a time dependent manner. We observed axotomy-induced NF-kappa B activation, which may mediate apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells.","1518":"The etiology of uveitis, a general term for inflammatory disorders of the uveal tract, has not been clarified. The purpose of this study is to investigate the immunopathogenesis during experimental uveitis induced by bovine melanin associated antigen (BMAA). Experimental melanin-induced uveitis (EMIU) was induced in male Lewis rats by injection of BMAA and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing was performed. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was used to examine expression of cell adhesion molecules with antibodies to ICAM-1 and LFA-1. BMMA-induced uveitis resembled human AAU, with onset and peak at approximately 14 and 21 days after immunization, respectively. Signs of uveitis disappeared by 4 weeks postimmunization. Histologic study revealed major infiltration of the iris and ciliary body by numerous inflammatory cells and minor infiltration of the choroid. DTH testing showed that ears injected with antigen were more swollen than non-injected ears. FACS analysis demonstrated that ICAM-1 and LFA-1 expression increased during EMIU, with ICAM-1 expression higher than that of LFA-1. In conclusion, BMAA is uveitogenically active in Lewis rats. Immunopathogenesis appeared to be mediated by cell expressing ICAM-1 and LFA-1.","1519":"Pterygia are considered to be induced by predisposing factors such as the external toxic environment. Glutathione transferases (GSTs) have a role in the detoxication of toxic chemicals. Transglutaminases (TGases) are involved in apoptosis, cellular adhesion and the wound healing process. As their expressions may be changed in abnormal conditions, we evaluated the clinicopathological status of pterygia by immunohistochemical study with GST-pi and TGase C. Twenty one pterygia, two pseudopterygia and five normal conjunctival specimens were used. The formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin blocks, which were subjected to be stained with anti-GST-pi and anti-TG polyclonal antibodies immunohistochemically. They were graded from negative to strong. Staining patterns of GST-pi ranged from negative to weak in normal conjunctival epithelium, while in pterygia and pseudopterygia, one was weak, seven mild, ten moderate and five strong. As for TGase C expression, normal tissues were weak to mild, but ten were mild, nine moderate and four strong in pterygia and pseudopterygia. The general staining patterns of GST-pi and TGase C were prominent, ranged from moderate to strong in pterygia and pseudopterygia with basophilic degeneration and keratinization. On the corneal side of pterygia, TGase C was strongly positive in the basal epithelium on destroyed Bowman's layer and in conjunctival fibrous tissue. We suggest that GST-pi and TGase C are responsible for the process of pathogenesis of pterygia and pseudopterygia.","1520":"This study used primary culture of rabbit conjunctival epithelial cells to investigate the infection process of chlamydia. The epithelial cells isolated from conjunctiva of rabbit were initially cultured for three weeks. After attaining confluence they were infected with Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) serotype D, and after co-cultivation for 24, 48, and 96 hours, electron microscopic study was performed. An inclusion body, a characteristic finding of chlamydial infection, was observed in the vicinity of the nucleus after 24 hours of co-cultivation. It contained a large number of elementary and reticulate bodies and their intermediate forms. Infectious particles known as elementary bodies were noted in the inclusion as 20 to 30 microns sized round bodies with an electron dense core. Reticulate bodies were also noted; they too were round but somewhat pleomorphic and larger than elementary bodies. Some reticulate bodies multiplied actively by means of binary fission. In this study, we observed the characteristic changes of C. trachomatis-infected cells; this in-vitro system might provide a suitable model for the study of some aspects of the pathogenesis of ocular chlamydia infection.","1521":"Persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) occurs sporadically and few familial occurrences have been reported. The authors report PHPV unassociated with other congenital anomalies in male twins. One underwent a lensectomy for the management of angle-closure glaucoma and the other was treated for amblyopia. These cases provide further evidence to suggest autosomal recessive inheritance, though the possibility of developmental error cannot be excluded.","1522":"Subperiosteal hematoma of the orbit is a rare but well-recognized entity, usually caused by trauma. Two cases of subperiosteal hematoma associated with sinusitis are presented. A 44-year-old woman experienced the sudden onset of proptosis, and decreased visual acuity. Computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a frontoethmoidal mucocele and a biconvex mass in the upper part of the left orbit. The mucocele was drained during nasal endoscopic surgery and the subperiosteal hematoma was evacuated during superior orbitotomy. A 42-year-old man had a headache and proptosis. Computed tomographic scan revealed sinusitis and subperiosteal orbital hematoma of the left orbit. Subperiosteal orbital hematoma associated with sinusitis is extremely rare but should be suspected in a patient with acute onset of proptosis in whom computed tomographic scanning reveals paranasal sinusitis.","1523":"To determine a classification system for epiblepharon of the lower eyelid and to evaluate a possible correlation between lower lid epiblepharon and astigmatism. Three morphologic characteristics (skin fold, cilia touching the cornea and corneal erosion) were observed by slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination and Polaroid pictures in 186 eyes of 102 patients with epiblepharon of the lower lid. In 112 eyes, cycloplegic refractions performed. A classification system reflecting the severity of epiblepharon was then sought, and the incidences and type of astigmatism were evaluated. Epiblepharon of the lower lid could be classified according to the height of skin fold, the area of cornea touched by cilia and the area of corneal erosion. There was significant agreement between these three classifications. The incidence of astigmatism of 0.5D or more was 54%; most was 'with-the-rule', regardless of a patient's age. In addition to the representative nature of other characteristics, skin fold height can be easily measured without the need for slit-lamp examination in children and is closely related with the amount of skin which should be excised during surgery to correct epiblepharon. A classification system using skin fold height may therefore be the most appropriate method. In addition, there may be a correlation between lower lid epiblepharon and astigmatism.","1524":"Ethambutol is a useful first line antituberculous drug, but can cause significant visual impairment. In order to determine the clinical manifestations of optic neuropathy associated with ethambutol, and the margin of drug safety in Koreans, we investigated ten men and four women, diagnosed between 1995 and 1997 at Seoul Municipal Boramae Hospital as suffering from ethambutol toxicity. After determining their history, including the period during which ethambutol had been administered, and its dose, a complete eye examination was performed, including measurement of best-corrected visual acuity, pupillary examination, color vision, fundus examination and a test of visual field. Ocular ethambutol toxicity was observed at a dose as low as 12.3 mg\/kg. Abnormal ophthalmic findings include decreased visual acuity and abnormal visual field, especially in the central scotoma, and abnormal color perception. In conclusion, ethambutol at a low dose can cause optic neuropathy, and for the early detection of this, a color vision test is important.","1525":"To investigate the therapeutic potential of mitomycin C (MMC) in the management of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), antiproliferative effect of MMC on rabbit retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, its intraocular toxicity, and its preventive effect on experimental PVR were investigated. Cultured rabbit RPE cells were exposed to various concentrations of MMC ranging from 1.0 x 10(-3) to 1.0 microgram\/ml for 72 hours. The RPE cells were then cultured in a medium without MMC for another 7 days, and the cells were harvested and counted. Toxicity of MMC to rabbit retina was evaluated after intravitreal injection of MMC by means of clinical observation, electrophysiologic test, and histopathologic examination. To test antiproliferative effect of MMC on experimental PVR, 200,000 cultured RPE cells were injected into the vitreous cavity of pigmented rabbits, and either 0.2 micrograms or 1.0 micrograms MMC was injected intravitreally 24 hours after RPE cell injection. Two to four weeks later, the vitreoretinal status was compared between MMC-treated eyes and control eyes. The antiproliferative effect of MMC on RPE cells was evident at the concentration of 1.0 x 10(-2) micrograms\/ml. The drug concentration required for 50% inhibition of growth was 3 x 10(-2) micrograms\/ml. Nontoxic intraocular doses of MMC were 2.0 micrograms in rabbit eyes with normal vitreous and 1.0 microgram in rabbit eyes with gas-compressed vitreous. The rates of traction retinal detachment after intravitreal RPE cell injection were reduced in the eyes treated with MMC compared with control eyes. These results indicate that MMC may have clinical application to the treatment of PVR.","1526":"We reviewed the results of posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCL) implantation following scleral tunnel incision and phacoemulsification (PE) in 28 eyes with uveitis. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved in 89% of eyes and the final BCVA was 20\/40 or better in 64% of eyes. Intraoperative complication was a posterior capsular break (3 eyes). Postoperative complications were microcorneal edema (4 eyes), anterior chamber hyphema (3 eyes), posterior capsular opacity (3 eyes), fibrinous pupillary membrane (2 eyes), iris posterior synechia (2 eyes), neovascular glaucoma (1 eye), and retinal detachment (1 eye). In two eyes of three aftercataracts, visual improvement was achieved by Nd: YAG capsulotomy. A well-planned PE and PCL implantation through scleral tunnel in uveitis was not much more dangerous than expected.","1527":"We compared the tear break-up time (BUT) and Schirmer test value after myopic excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Patients with normal preoperative Schirmer test value and BUT were included. Pre- and post-operative tear break-up time and Schirmer test values were measured in 220 eyes who underwent PRK. Minimum follow-up was 6 months. Visx 20\/20 B excimer laser was used for myopic PRK. Six months after surgery, no significant changes in Schirmer test value between pre- and post-operation were observed. However, 47.8% of eyes showed a decrease in BUT after surgery, and 72.7% of patients with decreased BUT complained of dry eye symptom. There was no significant relationship between BUT changes and uncorrected visual acuity after PRK. BUT changes did not influence the PRK visual outcome, but excimer laser PRK may change the tear break-up time and cause a dry eye symptom.","1528":"In patients with herpes virus dendritic epithelial keratitis, the pathologic morphogenesis of the dendritic lesion was investigated by means of impression cytology. Impression specimens were taken from the lesions of 24 consecutive patients assessed with a slit lamp biomicroscope. After a Millipore membrane impression was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined by light microscope, cellular patterns were analyzed. The results of these examinations showed that most cells were epithelial cells; there were also occasional multinucleated syncytial giant cells, inclusion bodies and inflammatory cells. Basal epithelial cells were most prominent at the actively infected lesion, whereas superficial epithelial cells were shown at the margin of the active lesion and terminal bulb. These findings suggest that in dendritic keratitis, viral spread and replication in the dendritic keratitis may progress through basal epithelial cells along the nerve within the basal epithelium-stromal interface.","1529":"We investigated whether there is any difference in optic nerve head topography between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) in Koreans. Twenty-three eyes of 23 POAG and 20 eyes of 20 NTG Korean patients closely matched for mean deviation of automated static threshold perimetry (Humphrey Field Analyzer, program C30-2) were enrolled. The patients' mean age was 51.5 +\/- 11.7 years in POAG and 55.1 +\/- 10.6 years in NTG; the average mean deviation was -5.47 +\/- 1.84 dB in POAG and -6.45 +\/- 3.69 dB in NTG. Mean age and mean deviation were not statistically different between the two groups. Heidelberg Retina Tomograph was used to obtain topographic measurements of disc area, rim area, cup volume, cup-to-disc area ratio, mean cup depth, maximum cup depth, and cup shape measure. Disc area and cup volume were significantly larger in NTG than in POAG (p &lt; 0.01, p = 0.03, respectively, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Other variables were not significantly different between the two groups. There was significant negative correlation between cup volume and rim area only in POAG (r = -0.725, p &lt; 0.01, Spearman correlation analysis). These results suggest that the larger cup volume in NTG than in POAG may be influenced rather by larger optic disc in NTG not by smaller neuroretinal rim.","1530":"To identify TIGR gene mutation in two Korean pedigrees of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and in 25 steroid-induced glaucoma patients, TIGR gene assay was performed. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and the TIGR gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR amplification products were evaluated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism and direct DNA sequencing. In POAG families, not only those patients clinically diagnosed as glaucoma, but also most of their siblings, in whom glaucoma had not yet been detected, had a proline-to-serine (TCC-to-CCC) mutation in codon 334. However, no steroid-induced glaucoma patients showed TIGR gene mutation. TIGR gene mutation, in familial POAG, was found in a different codon from that previously reported. The TIGR gene does not, however, seem to be related to steroid-induced glaucoma.","1531":"After the injection of about 10 gm of dapsone, a 38-year-old male showed a whitish-yellow patch in the macular region of both eyes, with decreased visual acuity of the counting finger in the right and 0.04 in the left eye. Two weeks after the start of systemic steroid therapy the patch disappeared, and on follow-up at 11 months, visual acuity was 0.02 in the right and 0.08 in the left eye, with macular degeneration and foveal nonperfusion. This retinal damage seems to be ischemic in origin and to be caused by a combination of acute severe peripheral hypoxemia and the vascular obstructive effect of red cell fragmentation resulting from massive hemolysis.","1532":"Dacryocystocele is a rare complication of chronic dacryocystitis. We report four such cases in which epiphora and painless cystic mass located inferior to the medical canthus were manifested. Computed tomographic scanning of the orbit showed a well-demarcated low density mass in the lacrimal sac area, and extending to the nasolacrimal duct. We completely or partially excised the mass and depending on the condition of the canaliculi and puncta, performed dacryocystorhinostomy, canaliculorhinostomy, or conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy using Jones' tube. Operative findings revealed that the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct were dilated with obliterated proximal and distal portions the cyst. When cysts in the lacrimal sac area develop subsequent to chronic epiphora or are accompanied by punctal agenesis, differential diagnosis should consider the possibility of dacryocystocele.","1533":"Retinal ischemia and neovascularization have been demonstrated in several animal models. To determine 1) whether the retinal or preretinal neovascularization can be induced in albino rats by retinal vein occlusion and 2) the type and rate of occurrence on neovascularization, we occluded retinal veins in albino rats by photodynamic thrombosis. After anesthesia, each of 36 rats received an injection of rose bengal photosensitive dye, and their veins underwent argon green laser treatment. Half or all the major retinal veins were occluded in 12 eyes and in 24 eyes, respectively. Ten control rats underwent the same procedures but the laser beam was directed between major retinal vessels. In 46 control eyes, rose bengal dye was seen to have perfused without laser treatment. Retinal detachment developed in most vein occluded eyes within one day of venous occlusion, which was confirmed by fluorescein angiography. On follow-up at two weeks, only four of 24 eyes (16.7%) had undergone occlusion of all retinal veins showed new preretinal vessels on the optic disc. In these four eyes, severe disturbance of both retinal arterial and venous blood flow was observed, but no other eyes showed such severe combined disturbance. These data suggest that preretinal neovascularization in albino rats can be induced by this minimally traumatic method and that venous occlusion is severe enough to compromise arterial blood flow for a certain threshold period, thus inducing the development of preretinal neovascularization.","1534":"Surgical glove powders have been implicated in serious postoperative foreign body reactions due to contamination of the operative field. Inflammatory responses to glove lubricants or mold release agents have to date been studied to a lesser extent in ocular tissues than other body tissues, although powder contamination of intraocular lenses, with severe postoperative anterior chamber inflammatory responses, have been reported. The object of this study was to grade and quantitate the inflammatory response of surgical glove lubricants, namely Biosorb, Keoflo, calcium carbonate and Hydrocote (a hydrogel polymer film used in powderless gloves), as introduced into the posterior chamber on New Zealand white rabbits. In a double masked GLP study, a total of 150 eyes were evaluated. For each of the four test samples, a dose response curve was obtained at 10 micrograms (Keoflo only), 125 micrograms, 250 micrograms, 500 micrograms, 1000 micrograms, and 1500 micrograms. Study parameters were the quantitation of inflammatory cells in the aqueous and vitreous, and ocular irritation and inflammation, as graded by the rabbit inflammation score system, at 0 and 48 hours post-injection. A Wilcoxen signed-rank test used to evaluate statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05). A test vitreal cell count was less that 50 cells\/mm3 and the overall mean clinical response was less than 2.0. This study established that Keoflo at all concentrations 10 micrograms-1000 micrograms), and Biosorb at concentrations greater than 1000 micrograms were inflammatory. Calcium carbonate and Hydrocote were non-inflammatory at concentration of 125 micrograms-1500 micrograms. The unoperated, sham, vehicle and Ocugel controls were all non-inflammatory. The positive Zymozan A controls were defined as inflammatory. In conclusion, no glove powder is totally safe, even small amounts of glove powder (10 micrograms) can elicit an inflammatory immune response. If all glove powder averages 700mg\/pair, this should be removed prior to contact with a patients tissue. Powder-free gloves and greatly reduce the potential inflammatory risk associated with powdered gloves.","1535":"We applied ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) to identify Acanthamoeba isolates from contact lens paraphernalia, and characterized these on the basis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) RFLP and isoenzyme analysis. The 22 Acanthamoeba strains used as reference strains were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Twenty-eight isolates were classified into six ribogroups, as follows: Acanthamoeba ribogroup (AcRG) 1 consisted of 18 isolates; AcRG 2, of three, AcRG 3, of three; AcRG 4, of two; AcRG 5, of one, and AcRG 6, of one. AcRG 1, which was the most frequently isolated type, was identified as A. lugdunensis, and AcRG 2 as A. hatchetti. AcRG 4 was identified as A. triangularis, while AcRG 3 and AcRG 5 were closely related to A. triangularis. AcRG 6 was identified as A. castellanii. The mtDNA RFLP patterns and zymograms for five isoenzymes of the isolates belonging to a ribogroup were identical to one another. The mtDNA digestion phenotype and zymogram for acid phosphatase (AcP) of AcRG 1 were identical to those of A. lugdunensis L3a and KA\/E2, the type strain and corneal isolates from a Korean keratitis patient, respectively. The mtDNA digestion phenotype and zymogram for AcP of AcRG 6 were identical to those of A. castellanii Castellani and KA\/E3, the type strain and another corneal isolate found in Korea, respectively. The mtDNA RFLP and zymogram for AcP of AcRG 2 were very similar to those of A. hatchetti BH-2 and Chang, respectively the type strain and a pathogen. The mtDNA RFLP and zymogram for AcP of AcRG 4 were similar to those of A. triangularis SH621, the type strain. The mtDNA RFLP patterns of AcRG 3 and 5 were unique. These results showed that the riboprints, mtDNA RFLP and zymograms of 22 of 28 Acanthamoeba isolates were the same as or very similar to those of the clinical isolates, which can probably be regarded as keratopathogens. More attention should be paid to the prevention of contamination by Acanthamoeba and to the disinfection of contact lens paraphernalia.","1536":"The effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on corneal endothelial cell of rabbit, was evaluated. DNA synthesis of cultured corneal endothelial cells after adding EGF to culture medium and major histocompatibility (MHC) antigen expression of cornea preserved in EGF added Optisol were measured. EGF increased DNA synthesis of corneal endothelial cells at all concentrations tested (0.03 ng\/ml-300 ng\/ml) compared with control. The maximum increase of DNA synthesis was shown at the concentrations of 3.0-30 ng\/ml. The effect of EGF on increase of DNA synthesis was more profound in second sub-cultured cells compared with first sub-cultured cells. In corneas preserved in Optisol for 3 days, 4 degrees C, class I antigen expression is decreased while class II antigen expression was slightly increased. In corneas preserved in EGF added Optisol for 3 days, 4 degrees C, class II antigen expression was more increased compared with those without EGF.","1537":"Impression cytology was used to evaluate the conjunctival surface change after filtering surgery and its association with bleb type and mitomycin C. Impression cytology were obtained at least ten (mean, 20.4) months after surgery from 22 eyes of 19 patients who had undergone trabeculectomy, and were graded according to a previously described system. Blebs were divided into thin cystic and thick diffuse types. Abnormal impressions, demonstrated as disturbed epithelial and goblet cell morphology and a decrease in the numbers of both cells, were found in nine eyes (40.9%). With regard to the prevalence of abnormal impressions, there were statistically significant differences between bleb type and between the use or non-use of mitomycin C (p = 0.040, 0.013); these related more to the use of mitomycin C than to bleb type. This study reveals that filtering surgery causes long-term damage to the conjunctival epithelium overlying a filtering bleb, especially in a patient with a thin cystic bleb or one has been treated with mitomycin C. This change in the conjunctival surface may lead to the occurrence of late hypotony and bleb-related infection.","1538":"Chronic hypotony is marked by decreased vision and late-onset leaking bleb after filtration surgery using topical mitomycin C; to manage this condition we followed a three-step approach: first, intrableb autologous blood injection; second, surgical exploration and additional suturing of the scleral flap; third, excision of the cystic bleb and advancement of a fornical conjunctival flap. For the avascular flap cystic blebs of five patients. In three of the six eyes, there was no increase of intraocular pressure (IOP); two eyes showed massive hyphema and were mildly resistant to the injection of autologous blood, and in one, a leaking hole was seen in the bleb wall two days after the injection of blood. Two eyes of three in which blood injection had failed, and another, in which the bleb had spread over more than half the eyeball, and which was the patient's only sighted eye, underwent the second step of the procedure. The remaining leaking eye, in which blood injection had been complicated, and another, in which spontaneous leakage from a thin avascular bleb had occurred, were subjected to the third step. After each of the three approaches, IOP increased on average from 1.67 to 5.67 mmHg, from 2.33 to 11.33 mmHg, and from 1.5 to 7 mmHg, respectively; each approach successfully improved vision. Intrableb autologous blood injection is a simple procedure for the management of chronic overfiltration and a way of determining whether excessive filtration is occurring through the scleral flap, in which case additional suturing is required, or in another way. Depending on the status of the bleb, additional suturing or excision of the cystic bleb and advancement of the fornical conjunctival flap are useful modalities for the treatment of late-onset leaking filtration bleb.","1539":"The purpose of this study was to compare the circumferential profiles of relative peripapillary retinal surface height (RPSH) between normal and glaucoma, with a confocal scanning laser ophthalmology (CSLO), and to examine the ability of the mean height to distinguish glaucoma from normal. Fifty-three patients with open-angle glaucoma and forty-three normal subjects matched for age, race and refractive error were studied. To extract circumferential profiles, we developed software to quantify RPSH from images obtained with a CSLO (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), Heidelberg Engineering, Germany, Software: IR1-V1.11) outside the optic disc margin every 50 microns. Mean heights from circumferential profiles were calculated and compared between normal and glaucoma. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the mean height to discriminate normal from glaucoma subjects. T he average (+\/- SD) visual field mean deviation in the glaucoma group was -4.8 +\/- 3.4dB. The average height of each circumference increased from the disc margin to 250 microns away in both normal and glaucoma subjects. There were statistically significant differences for the mean height (P &lt; 0.001) between the two groups. The largest difference between normal and glaucoma was found in the inferior sector compared with the other sectors (p &lt; 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic precision of the mean height were 83%, 67% and 76%, respectively. The mean height from the circumferential profiles of RPSH can be used as a useful marker to identify early glaucoma.","1540":"Using Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany) we investigated whether reversal of glaucomatous optic disc cupping occurs in adult glaucoma patients following intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction by trabeculectomy, and whether topographic change in the optic disc differs according to region. Thirteen eyes of 13 glaucoma patients in whom IOP reduction was 25% or more at postoperative follow-up of 2 months were enrolled in the study. Cup\/disc area ratio had decreased significantly, while rim area and rim volume showed significant increases (p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Among the optic disc sectors, rim area in the superior and inferior quadrants, especially in the superotemporal and inferotemporal octant, had increased significantly. The decrease in maximum cup death correlated significantly with the recent IOP reduction (r = 0.698, p = 0.016). Reversal of glaucomatous disc cupping after IOP reduction following trabeculectomy in adult patients as confirmed by HRT. Furthermore, the regions of selective reversal in the superior and inferior quadrants coincided with those parts of the optic nerve head in which early functional and structural glaucomatous damage has been known to occur.","1541":"Persistent pupillary membranes are common congenital disorders. To reduce the surgical complications, we used vitreous scissors instead of conventionally used Vannas scissors to remove the membrane and reviewed the surgical results. Five eyes of 4 children with persistent pupillary membrane were treated by surgery. Through the 1.5 mm limbal incision, the membrane was removed by using vitreous scissors after intracameral sodium hyaluronate. After 22.6 months follow-up, all pupils of operated eyes were round and no complications associated with the surgery were found. Three eyes showed improved visual acuities after the operation. We suggest that the surgery with vitreous scissors is better than with Vannas scissors.","1542":"A 45-year-old Korean woman visited our hospital complaining of poor vision after carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. We have confirmed the presence of a point mutation at position 11778 in the ND4 gene of mitochondrial DNA. This case suggests that CO poisoning may precipitate the clinical expression of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). To our knowledge, this would be the first case report of clinical expression of LHON precipitated by CO poisoning.","1543":"We examined 18 cases of floppy eyelid syndrome, first reported in the Orient, in patients ranging in age from 11 to 55 years (mean 24 years); 16 were men and two were women. In contrast to previous reports in which almost all patients were obese men, only three of our patients were mildly obese. The most common abnormal corneal finding was punctate epithelial keratopathy (five patients-28%). Keratoconus was detectable in three patients (17%) overall; it was bilateral in one case and unilateral in two. Other miscellaneous corneal findings were corneal astigmatism and corneal opacity. In two cases, we found a familial tendency to skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility, and in one case, floppy eyelid syndrome developed after pars plana vitrectomy. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is still unknown, but our findings suggest that the more important pathogenetic risk factors are not obesity and sleeping pattern, but genetic collagen and\/or elastin abnormality.","1544":"The present study was planned to investigate the relationship between the magnitude of intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction after short-duration exercise and the intensity, duration and quantity of exercise in healthy subjects. Twenty-five healthy, sedentary male of the same age group, performed exercises at the levels of 80%, 60%, and 40% maximum heart rate (HRmax) for 15 minutes, 80% HRmax for 7.5 minutes, 60% HRmax for 10 minutes, and 40% HRmax for 30 minutes. IOP was measured with the Goldmann applanation tonometer. The IOP reduction at 5 minutes after 15 minutes of exercising at 80% HRmax, 60% HRmax, and 40% HRmax were 4.7 +\/- 0.9, 3.5 +\/- 0.7, and 0.9 +\/- 0.4 mmHg, respectively. At five minutes, after exercising 7.5 minutes at 80% HRmax, 10 minutes at 60% HRmax, and 30 minutes at 40% HRmax, IOP reduced by 4.5 +\/- 0.7, 3.3 +\/- 0.9, and 2.9 +\/- 1.1 mmHg, respectively. This study concludes that intensity of exercise seems responsible for the magnitude of the initial IOP decrease after short-term exercise. Furthermore, it seems that other factors such as duration of exercise or quantity of exercise, blood pressures, body mass index are not related to the amount of the initial fall in IOP.","1545":"A randomized prospective study was performed to evaluate intraocular pressure (IOP) change after extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) or phacoemulsification and aspiration (PEA) with implantation of posterior chamber intraocular lens in otherwise normal cataract patients. IOP was measured preoperatively and postoperatively at up to 6 months. There was a mean fall in pressure of 1.1mmHg (5.72%) in the ECCE group (15 eyes) and of 0.6mmHg (4.16%) in the PEA group (24 eyes) after 6 months. The decrease in mean IOP was significant at 2 months in the PEA group and at 4 to 6 months in the ECCE group, but there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups during the follow-up periods (p &lt; 0.05). The present study shows that there was some postoperative IOP reduction in both the ECCE and PEA group, but the amount of reduction was not significantly different between the two groups.","1546":"The occurrence of ptosis after trabeculectomy has been a common postoperative complication. Many factors have been implicated in the development of postoperative ptosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of ptosis following trabeculectomy and whether or not it was influenced by combined cataract surgery, type of conjunctival flap, and previous intraocular surgery. We reviewed 386 eyes of 386 patients who underwent either trabeculectomy alone or trabeculectomy combined with cataract surgery, with greater than 6 month follow-up. Ptosis occurred in 10.7% (18 of 150 eyes) after trabeculectomy alone and in 12.7% (30 of 236 eyes) after trabeculectomy with combined cataract surgery (p = 0.96). The incidence of ptosis was 12.3% (10 of 81 eyes) after limbus-based conjunctival flap and 12.5% (38 of 305 eyes) after fornix-based conjunctival flap (p = 0.98). There was no significant difference in the incidence of ptosis between primary surgery eyes (12.5%, 34 of 273 eyes) and secondary surgery eyes (12.4%, 14 of 113 eyes) (p = 0.97). The incidence of ptosis after trabeculectomy was about 12% overall and not significantly influenced by combined cataract surgery, type of conjunctival flap or previous ocular surgery.","1547":"Cryotherapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) stage 3+. However, the outcome of cryotherapy is less favorable in zone 1 ROP than in zone 2 ROP. We suspected whether there may be differences in the outcomes of cryotherapy if the zone of ROP is further divided. So we reviewed the records of 85 premature infants (145 eyes) who had undergone cryotherapy for ROP. The frequencies of favorable outcome were 42.9% of 14 eyes (zone 1), 78.9% of 38 eyes (posterior zone 2), 92.9% of 70 eyes (mid zone 2), and 100.0% of 23 eyes (anterior zone 2), respectively (p &lt; 0.001). These results suggest that the more posteriorly the ROP is located, the less favorable the outcome of cryotherapy.","1548":"Diurnal changes of lysosomes including ultrastructural changes of phagosomes and acid phosphatase reactions in phagosomes, as well as diurnal biochemical changes in cathepsin D activity, were studied in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of the rabbit. The rabbit was maintained on a natural light-dark cycle over seven days in fall and was sacrificed at various times during the day and night. The number of lysosomes or phagosomes in the RPE was the highest at 1.5 hours after exposure to sunlight (8:00 AM), and thereafter decreased with time. Three types of phagosomes were observed and acid phosphatase reactions were different in each type of phagosome; the fresh phagosomes were negative or positive, lamellar bodies positive, and dense bodies partially positive. The biochemical activity of cathepsin D was the highest at 8:00 AM, and this was consistent with the time of peak in phagocytic activity in the RPE. This report shows that phagocytic activity in the RPE occurred in the early stage after exposure to sunlight, and that fresh phagosomes were sequentially degraded to lamellar or dense bodies. Cathepsin D activity also increased, and this was consistent with the phagocytic activity in the RPE.","1549":"We studied the ultrastructural features of four consecutive subfoveal neovascular membranes (SFNM) associated with age-related macular degeneration. Cellular components of the membranes included retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, endothelium-lined vascular channels, macrophages, myofibroblasts, fibrocytes, glial cells, erythrocytes, and lymphocytes. Extracellular interstitial constituents included collagen fibrils, basal laminar deposits, fibrin and young elastic fibrils. These findings show that SFNMs consist of various cells originating from surrounding tissues and vessels. Among these RPE cells and macrophages are the main cellular components and in conjunction with various extracellular matrix, especially collagen, may play an important role in the formation and maintenance of the membranes.","1550":"The effect of topically applied 1% sodium hyaluronate (Na-HA) on the healing of a standardized corneal alkali wound was studied. The healing of the epithelium, stroma, and endothelium was evaluated separately, using quantitative methods. Central corneal alkali wound was produced in one eye of the rabbits by applying a 5.5-mm round filter paper, soaked in 1 N NaOH, for 60 seconds. 1% Na-HA in the treatment group and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the control group were given topically 4 times per day for 2 days, 1- and 3-weeks. Epithelial and endothelial healing was assessed morphometrically from standardized photographs and micrographs, respectively. Stromal healing was determined by counting polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and keratocytes in the central and marginal wound areas. A positive healing influence was observed in the epithelium. In stromal healing, 1% Na-HA treated corneas showed less PMNs and more keratocytes than the control group, suggesting that topically applied 1% Na-HA may suppress the stromal PMN infiltration and enhance the keratocyte repopulation during corneal alkali wound healing. However, no significant difference was found in morphometric evaluation of endothelial healing between the two groups.","1551":"Dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein (DTAF) has been used to stain corneal stromal collagen as part of in vivo animal experiments for many years. Toxicity of this drug, if present, might alter the observed wound healing. To determine if this drug has any deleterious effect on keratocytes, we evaluated it in vitro. Human keratocytes prepared in 24-well plates were exposed to varying concentrations of DTAF (10(-4), 10(-3), 10(-2), 1, 10, 10(2) micrograms\/ml). Exposure times of 1 hour and 24 hours at each concentration of DTAF were evaluated. The cell number was measured 1 and 3 days after initiation of exposure to DTAF using a Coulter counter. Keratocyte proliferation was not affected by 1-hour exposure to DTAF, but keratocyte proliferation measured 3 days after initiation of exposure to DTAF for 24 hours was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.02) and was significantly inhibited at concentrations of 10 and 100 micrograms\/ml (p &lt; 0.05). Fluorescent microscopy showed binding of DTAF to keratocytes. We have demonstrated that prolonged exposure to DTAF inhibits proliferation of cultured keratocytes. These results suggest that DTAF-induced cytotoxicity may alter net production of collagen in the corneal stroma in animal models.","1552":"Alloplastic implants are known to be inert for many years, though complications are infrequently reported many years after their insertion. We report the case of a patient who had undergone a blow-out fracture repair five years before the discovery of a hematic cyst. He had been free of symptoms for the first five years after his orbital floor repair but then developed pain on eyeball movement and persistent vertical diplopia, which finally led to surgical intervention. At surgery, a hematic cyst was found to have formed around the implanted silastic plate. When alloplastic material is used in orbital fracture repair, we should be alert for late complications which may occur many years after surgery.","1553":"Examination of a 36-year-old man with naked visual acuity of 20\/20 revealed a floating, conspicuous cyst of Cysticercus cellulosae in the vitreous cavity of the right eye. A vitreous traction band from the vitreous base and the optic disc was connected to the lodging bulb of the cyst. In the superonasal area, an ovoid retinal break surrounded by a white retinal lesion with two elliptical retinal hemorrhages was found, and this seems to be the previous lodging site of the cyst. A pars plana vitrectomy was performed to remove the parasite, and laser photocoagulation was carried out around the retinal break. Four months after the operation, the patient was satisfied with naked visual acuity of 25\/20 without any complication in the affected eye.","1554":"Changes in retinal sensitivity within central 30 degrees following panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for more severe diabetic retinopathy were investigated. Twenty-five eyes with visual acuity of 0.4 or better and minimal maculopathy were studied prospectively. All underwent PRP in two sittings, and Humphrey field analyzer 30-2 threshold test was done before and 1 week, 1 and 3 months after the treatment. The mean retinal sensitivity threshold was obtained from each hemifield between 15 and 30 degrees and from the central 15 degree area, and the changes in the values were analyzed. Mean sensitivity threshold in the upper visual field at pre-PRP, post-PRP 1 week, 1, 3 months were 15.62, 13.81, 14.31, 14.85, respectively. Values in the lower field were 18.71, 17.25, 17.10, 18.17. Difference between pre-PRP and post-PRP was statistically significant at 1 week but no longer thereafter. Retinal sensitivity within the central 15 degrees remained stable. The data show that retinal sensitivity decreases significantly 1 week after PRP but recovers upto 95% of pre-PRP level over the following 3 months.","1555":"To compare the effects of three different concentrations of mitomycin C (MMC) as an adjunct therapy to trabeculectomy, we reviewed 26 patients (36 eyes) who underwent trabeculectomy in which MMC was applied intraoperatively. The time of application was 5 minutes, and the concentration of MMC was 0.1 mg\/ml (n = 10), 0.2 mg\/ml (n = 17) and 0.4 mg\/ml (n = 9), respectively. Complete success was defined by intraocular pressure (IOP) of 21 mmHg or less without medication at postoperative 3 months. There was no statistical difference among the three groups in mean age of patients, preoperative IOPs, and the numbers of premedication. The mean IOP at postoperative 3 months was significantly lower in the 0.4 mg\/ml group (10.4 +\/- 5.5 mmHg) than in the 0.2 mg\/ml group (16.1 +\/- 4.7 mmHg) (p &lt; 0.05). The complete success rate in the 0.4 mg\/ml group was 100%, which was significantly higher than the rate of 40% obtained with the 0.1 mg\/ml group (p &lt; 0.05), but was not significantly different to the rate of 70.6% in the 0.2 mg\/ml group (p &gt; 0.05). There was no statistical difference among the three groups in the success rate regardless of medication, and the size and longevity of the filtering bleb. Postoperative hypotony was noted in two eyes of the 0.4 mg\/ml group.","1556":"To investigate the effects of postoperative mitomycin C (MMC) eyedrop as an adjunct to intraoperative MMC in refractory glaucomas, 15 eyes of 14 glaucoma patients (age; 47.0 +\/- 15.5 years) in need of trabeculectomy were studied. Preoperative diagnoses were secondary glaucoma to uveitis in seven patients, neovascular glaucoma in four, pseudophakic glaucoma in three, and aphakic glaucoma in one. Six patients who had neovascular glaucoma or history of a failed trabeculectomy with intraoperative 0.2 mg\/ml MMC received intraoperative 0.4 mg\/ml MMC. The others received 0.2 mg\/ml MMC for 3 minutes. During the follow-up period, postoperative MMC eyedrop was applied, depending on the condition of the filtration bleb. The eyedrop was 0.2 or 0.4 mg\/ml, applied four times a day for one week. The follow-up period was 18.1 \/+- 7.4 months. The success rates were 93.3%, 86.7%, and 78.0% at postoperative 1, 4, and 18 months, respectively. There was neither early hypotony nor wound leak. Corneal epithelial defects (26.7%), corneal ulcers (6.7%), and cataracts (6.7%) were, however, observed. Postoperative MMC eyedrop application was a convenient and effective adjunct to intraoperative MMC in refractory glaucomas.","1557":"Studies have been shown that intraocular pressure (IOP) shows a seasonal variation, but amount of change differs from study to study. The variability in their results may be due to negligence of factors that can affect IOP. Due to differences in environmental conditions of China than other countries, we investigated seasonal variations in IOP of 103 healthy male Chinese of Shanghai. IOP was measured each month over the course of fourteen months with the Goldmann applanation tonometer. The average intraocular pressures in the winter months were higher than those in the spring, summer, and autumn months. The IOP difference between winter and summer months was found to be 1.4 +\/- 0.7 mmHg. This study confirms that season influences IOP. As compared to other nations, effect of seasons on IOP seems to be somewhat less pronounced in Chinese. The possible mechanisms, responsible for the seasonal variation of intraocular pressure, are also postulated.","1558":"To investigate the correlation between optic nerve head configuration and visual field defects, optic nerve head analysis using confocal scanning laser tomography (Heidelberg Retina Tomograph, HRT) and automated static threshold perimetry using a Humphrey Field Analyzer (program C30-2) were performed on 81 eyes of 44 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients. The optic nerve head parameters-rim area, rim volume, mean retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, height variation contour, and third moment in contour were measured by HRT and were analyzed for correlation with visual field indices-mean deviation, and corrected pattern standard deviation. All optic nerve head parameters except HVC correlated significantly with the visual field indices; the highest correlation was between rim area and mean deviation (r = 0.6172, p &lt; 0.00001). The rim area of the superior and inferior quadrants correlated significantly with the visual field defects in corresponding sectors. Structural optic disc measurements by HRT correlated significantly with functional optic nerve head damage in POAG.","1559":"A study of histopathologic changes, ultrastructure, and expression of the HLA-Dr antigen within the giant papillae of patients with giant papillary conjunctivitis was performed to determine whether cell-mediated immune response is related to this condition. Conjunctival giant papillae from ten patients with giant papillary conjunctivitis were examined by light and electron microscopy and by the indirect immunofluorescent staining method with HLA-Dr antibody. The infiltration of eosinophilic neutrophils and granules was most prominent, with the occasional infiltration of mast cells, as shown by light microscopy. The infiltration of activated fibroblasts and Langerhans cells was also observed. Cells expressing HLA-Dr antigen were also markedly increased, as shown by the immunofluorescent method. These findings suggest that delayed hypersensitivity may, along with the processes of antigen presentation by HLA-Dr-expressing (including Langerhans) cells, contribute to the pathogenesis of giant papillary conjunctivitis.","1560":"To determine injection time and effective dose of ciprofloxacin in endophthalmitis and to evaluate the effectiveness of dexamethasone. In rabbits, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (2 x 10(4) CFU\/0.1 ml) was inoculated intravitreally. At 6, 12, 18, 24 hours postinoculation, single intravitreal doses of ciprofloxacin (300 micrograms\/0.15 ml or 100 micrograms\/0.05 ml) alone or with dexamethasone (400 micrograms) were given. Electrophysiological and histologic measures were utilized to rate drug effectiveness. 300 micrograms ciprofloxacin was effective in killing P. aeruginosa at 6 and 12 hours postinoculation, but one hundred ug ciprofloxacin was not effective. 300 ug ciprofloxacin had no significant effect in killing P. aeruginosa at 18 hrs and 24 hrs postinoculation. Eyes treated with dexamethasone (400 micrograms) and ciprofloxacin (300 micrograms) at 6 hours postinoculation did not differ from eyes treated with ciprofloxacin alone. Cultures from eyes treated with dexamethasone and ciprofloxacin at 12 hours postinoculation were positive. Cultures from eyes treated with ciprofloxacin alone were negative. The failure of treatment at 18 hrs and 24 hrs postinoculation may be due to either an increased rate of clearance of drugs from the eyes or a reduced bactericidal effect of ciprofloxacin which could be altered by acidic pH, degree of hypoxia or bacterial counts. Dexamethasone had no beneficial effect in the treatment of P. aeruginosa endophthalmitis in the early phase.","1561":"We evaluated the effect of the conjugate of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and saporin (FGF2-SAP) on proliferation of cultured keratocytes. Cultured rabbit and human keratocytes were incubated in medium containing 0.01 to 100 nM of chemical conjugate of EGF2 conjugated by disulfide bond to saporin (CCFS1), FGF2 genetically fused to saporin (rFGF2-SAP), FGF2, or saporin for three hours or four days and cell proliferation was quantified four days after the drug treatment. Proliferation of rabbit and human keratocytes was effectively inhibited by three hour and by four day exposure to CCFS1 and rFGF2-SAP in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it was affected minimally by four day exposure to saporin. Their inhibitory effects were detected at concentrations above 0.1 or 1 nM, and were most prominent in serum-stimulated rabbit keratocytes. These results suggest a potential role for FGF2-SAP in limiting proliferation of keratocytes during corneal wound healing.","1562":"An infant presented with persistent epiphora after successful probing of the lacrimal system. Examination of the nose showed a cystic structure occluding lower portion of the lacrimal drainage system. In cases of recurrent obstruction, nasal examination and endoscopic marsupialization may help guide the clinician towards the most appropriate treatment.","1563":"When a patient is presented with a subconjunctival cyst, it is not only hard to reveal its true nature clinically but also easy to rupture during excision. We experienced cases with cysts of the accessory lacrimal gland in two patients with subconjunctival cysts. They had lid swelling at initial presentation and underwent surgical excision of subconjunctival cysts located in superior portion of the upper tarsal plate. The lining of these cysts composed of ductal epithelia. Biochemical analyses for serum and cystic fluid were performed in one case, in which was found high Ig A titer in the cystic fluid. These cysts seemed to originate from the duct of Wolfring's accessory lacrimal gland, considering their anatomic locations and pathologic findings. Complete removal of the cyst is important, because recurrences have been reported in cases of incomplete removal or simple aspiration.","1564":"To investigate the chronological change of refraction in premature infants after cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), cycloplegic refractions had been performed at 6 months and 3 years after term in premature infants who underwent cryotherapy for ROP. The changes of refractions between the two study ages were evaluated not only in the total cryo-treated eyes, but also in the subdivided groups according to the posterior pole appearances. In the total 61 eyes of 32 premature infants, mean spherical equivalents were -4.05D vs. -5.94D (6 months vs. 3 years) (p = 0.0001). In the normal posterior pole group (48 eyes), mean spherical equivalents were -3.45D vs. -5.68D (6 months vs. 3 years) (p = 0.0000), and in the abnormal posterior pole group (13 eyes), -6.28D vs. -6.86D (6 months vs. 3 years) (p = 0.6496). These results mean that there is a myopic progressive change between 6 months and 3 years after term in the cryo-treated eyes for acute ROP and it is more evident in the eyes with normal posterior pole.","1565":"To investigate the retinal hemodynamics in branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO), we measured retinal circulation times using scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) and studied their relationships with clinical findings. Arm-retina time (ART) and arteriovenous passage time (AVP) were measured in 30 eyes of 30 patients. Mean ART was 13.07 seconds. ART showed no difference in relation to sex and systemic diseases, but increased with age. Mean AVPs were 3.00 sec. and 3.39 sec. in superotemporal and inferotemporal BRVO, respectively. AVPs were delayed significantly in occluded branch of retinal veins. AVP was delayed three-fold when the area of capillary nonperfusion was over 6 disc area, but showed no difference according to the duration of disease or macular edema. These results suggest that SLO may be a useful tool for studying retinal hemodynamics in BRVO.","1566":"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Excimer Laser Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK) on the correction of high myopia, we performed planned double-pass PRK procedure at the same session on 62 eyes of 55 patients with myopia ranging from -6.30D to -15.25D (mean, -9.94D). In the first pass, a myopic correction of -6.00D with a 4.5 millimeter ablation zone was performed, and immediately after, a second correction of remaining myopia with a 5.0 millimeter ablation zone was performed. Attempted correction ranged from -6.30D to -9.50D (mean, -8.70D). The eyes were divided into two groups which were -10.50D or less (group A), and higher than -10.50D (group B). All the eyes received topical corticosteroid therapy postoperatively. One year after double-pass PRK, uncorrected visual acuity in group A and B improved to 20\/40 or better in 84.0%, and 73.3% of the eyes and to 20\/30 or better in 75.0% and 33.3% of the eyes respectively. The mean refractive errors at 12 months after PRK were -0.3 +\/- 1.6D in group A, and -1.5 +\/- 2.1D in group B. The percent of achieved correction within +\/- 1.0D were 70.8% in group A, and 46.7% in group B 12 months after surgery. The epithelium healed by three days and there were no corneal erosions. Corneal haze (Grade 2 or more) was seen in 9.0% in group A and 36.4% in group B at 12 months after PRK. A planned double-pass PRK is a promising approach to correct high myopia (up to -10.50D), but long-term follow up will be required.","1567":"To know the pattern of visual field (VF) defect of low tension glaucoma (LTG), its diffuse and localized VF defects were compared using the significance values (p-value) of mean deviation (MD) and corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD), which are calculated with STATPAC in Humphrey Visual Field Analyser. Sixteen eyes of LTG were enrolled and 34 eyes of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) were used as controls. The degree of VF defects in LTG and POAG was relatively mild with the p-value of MD equal to or greater than 1%. Neither mean MD nor mean CPSD of LTG was significantly different from each of POAG (p &gt; 0.8 and p &gt; 0.2, respectively). Comparing the p-values of MD and CPSD, many patients showed more significant p-value of MD in LTG and POAG (62.5% and 61.8%, respectively). However, relatively more severe defect of CPSD tended to occur more frequently in LTG than in POAG (25% and 5.9%, respectively, chi 2 = 4.964, p &lt; 0.09). The relation between p-values of MD and CPSD was not significantly influenced by the intraocular pressure, MD or vertical cup to disc ratio in either LTG or POAG.","1568":"An attempt was made to observe the possibility of controlling intraocular pressure (IOP) without hypotony and ocular motility disorder by installing an experimentally designed glaucoma implant through a small conjunctival incision with the aid of a stylet and maintaining the aqueous reservoir using mitomycin C (MMC). The implant was made of silicone tube, of which one end was occluded by glue and on the same end 4 check-valve-like slits were made. Thirty-five healthy white rabbits were used and subdivided into 4 groups. In groups I to III, implants having 2.0, 2.5, 3.0 mm slit lengths, respectively, were installed with MMC application in one eye of each of the 10 rabbits. In group IV, a 2 mm slit-length implant was installed without MMC in one eye of each of the 5 rabbits. Pneumatonometry and ultrasonography were performed to check the IOP and the formation of aqueous reservoir in the implanted eyes for 8 weeks. In group I through III, there was a statistically significant 4-5 mmHg pressure-lowering effect in the implanted eyes compared to the contralateral control eyes for 8 weeks. The aqueous reservoirs were observed throughout the follow-up period. In group IV, we could observe neither a pressure-lowering effect nor aqueous reservoir formation in the implanted eyes after 2 weeks postoperatively. Hypotony did not occur in implanted eyes in any of the groups. This study shows the possibility of IOP control by installing a specially designed glaucoma implant with application of MMC.","1569":null,"1570":"Dexamethasone sodium phosphate (DSP) is increasingly used in the treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases by systemic, periocular, and recently, intravitreal injection. We have developed a method for the determination of vitreous levels of DSP by reverse phase HPLC. In this method, co-elution of vitreous proteins with DSP is resolved by a prior sample clean-up procedure using Waters Sep-Pak C18 cartridge; the protein is separated and eluted with water while DSP, paraben and prednisone are eluted with methanol. DSP in the resulting sample is then separated by reverse phase HPLC and quantified by UV absorption at 254 nm. The recovery of DSP through the sample clean-up is 68.9 +\/- 3.0%. DSP quantitation is linear from 0.1 mg to 1.0 mg per 1.0 ml vitreous. This method provides a simple, sensitive and reliable technique for determining the vitreous levels of DSP.","1571":"To simulate the posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in the rabbit, 1 IU hyaluronidase and\/or 0.2 ml of perfluoropropane gas was intravitreally injected. Ophthalmoscopic, light microscopic examination prepared by cryotechnique, electron microscopic examination, and electroretinogram were done on the 3rd and 28th postoperative days. As a result, the eyes undergone simultaneous intravitreal injection of 1 IU hyaluronidase and 0.2 ml perfluoropropane gas showed membranous structure split from the internal limiting membrane of the superior retina in 3 days after injection. The eyes also demonstrated membranous structure separated from the superior retina after 28 days, simulating vitreous detachment. On the contrary, neither agent alone induced vitreous detachment. No toxic retinal changes associated with simultaneous intravitreal injection of 1 IU hyaluronidase and 0.2 ml perfluoropropane gas were observed. Therefore, with a future support by histologic examination other than cryotechnique and by immunohistochemical analysis, the simultaneous intravitreal injection of perfluoropropane gas and hyaluronidase would be a promising method to induce vitreous detachment in non-vitrectomized eye.","1572":null,"1573":"The occurrence of a retinal detachment in a patient with a macular hole is quite rare unless the patient is a high myope or has experienced ocular trauma. The incidence of spontaneous reattachment of retinal detachment with a macular hole is not uncommon in the highly myopic patients. However, data on nonmyopic cases are lacking. I herein describe two nonmyopic cases of retinal detachment with a macular hole, of which retinas reattached spontaneously.","1574":"In adjustable strabismus surgery, a satisfactory final result would be achieved with delayed adjustment. However, the postoperative adhesions following strabismus surgery make delayed adjustment impossible. We evaluated the efficacy of mitomycin C in reducing the severity of postoperative adhesions following strabismus surgery and in delaying the time adjustment after surgery. Experimental rabbits underwent a hang-back recession procedure in the superior rectus muscle. A topical application of mitomycin C was made between the conjunctiva and the sclera for 5 minutes during the operation. We then studied the possible time of delayed adjustment and estimated the minimal forces required for the adjustment. The topical application of 0.1 mg\/ml mitomycin C between the conjunctiva and sclera allowed for a 2-week delayed adjustment after surgery, and 0.2 mg\/ml mitomycin C prevented the adhesions between these tissues and the muscle 5 weeks after surgery. These results suggest that topical mitomycin C may enhance the success rate of strabismus surgery with delayed adjustment and reduce postoperative adhesions.","1575":"Visual loss and field defects commonly occur after acute blood loss. We present a case of bilateral permanent visual field defect in a 30-year-old man after a massive hemorrhage caused by large vessel injury during a right nephrectomy. His postoperative visual acuity decreased significantly, and his visual field showed peripheral constriction and inferior altitudinal field defect in both eyes. A year and a half after the operation, visual acuity recovered to the preoperative level, but the field did not show improvement. We advance that this is a possible result of extensive injury to the occipital area, excluding the corresponding area of the macula.","1576":"Human amniotic membrane isolated from the placenta contained basement membrane components such as type IV collagen, laminin, and 6 and 4 integrins, all of which remained detectable while preserved in glycerin for one week. One month after the n-heptanol removal of the total corneal epithelium and the limbal lamellar keratectomy, all rabbit eyes carried features of limbal deficiency, including conjunctival epithelial ingrowth, vascularization and chronic inflammation. Ten control eyes then received a total keratectomy, and 13 experimental eyes received an additional amniotic membrane transplantation. Three-month follow-ups revealed that all control corneas were revascularized to the center with granuloma and retained a conjunctival phenotype. In contrast, in the experimental groups, 5 corneas became clear with either minimal or no vascularization; the rest had either mild peripheral (5) or total (3) vascularization and more cloudy stroma. Using monoclonal antibodies for epithelial markers and matrix components, we concluded that the success correlated with the return of a cornea-like epithelial phenotype and the preservation of the amniotic membrane, whereas the failure maintained a conjunctival epithelial phenotype and the amniotic membrane was either partially degraded or covered by host fibrovascular stroma. Measures taken to facilitate the former might prove this procedure clinically useful for ocular surface reconstruction.","1577":"This study was performed to investigate the corneal epithelial healing time and rate according to the method for promoting the reepithelization after myopic epikeratoplasty. A prospective study was conducted on 30 myopic epikeratoplasties which were divided into 3 groups according to the method for promoting the epithelial healing. The groups consisted of 10 eyes with pressure patches, 10 eyes with Acuvue disposable contact lens (CL) and 10 eyes with SeeQuence disposable CL. The cornea epithelial healing time were 3.4, 3.5 and 3.4 postoperative days for the pressure patch, Acuvue CL and SeeQuence CL groups, respectively. The corneal epithelial healing rates during postoperative 1, 2, and 3 days were 0.33, 0.78, and 0.44 mm2\/hour for the pressure patch group; 0.24, 0.92 and 0.37 mm2\/hour for the Acuvue CL group; and 0.30, 0.79 and 0.38 mm2\/hour for the SeeQuence CL group. These results suggest that a disposable contact lens may not hinder epithelial healing compared with a pressure patch.","1578":"This study was conducted to investigate the effect of ascorbic acid on oxidative injury of cultured porcine retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells induced by t-butylhydroperoxide. The porcine RPE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and the culture medium was replaced with one containing 0.01 mM to 5 mM ascorbic acid and\/or 0.2 mM t-butylhydroperoxide. After 2 hours incubation, the test medium was replaced with the control medium. The number of cells was counted with a Coulter counter after a 2-day incubation period. The medium was pretreated with 900 U\/ml and the previous procedure was repeated to eliminate the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide induced by ascorbic acid. Not only t-butylhydroperoxide (p &lt; 0.01) but also ascorbic acid (p &lt; 0.01) were found to have dose-dependent cytotoxicity on RPE cells. The cytotoxicity was more significant when both agents were added to the culture media. In the presence of catalase, the cytotoxicity of ascorbic acid became insignificant (p &lt; 0.05). The cytotoxicity of t-butylhydroperoxide decreased when 1 mM and 5 mM of ascorbic acid was added to the culture media with catalase pretreatment (p = 0.0277). These results indicate that ascorbic acid was toxic to RPE cells in our culture model but this cytotoxicity was not detected in the presence of catalase. With catalase pretreatment, ascorbic acid in relatively high concentration provided protection against oxidative injury of t-butylhydroperoxide.","1579":"This study was designed to determine the maximal safe drug concentration of intravitreal ciprofloxacin in phakic rabbit eyes. Twenty-two eyes of New Zealand pigmented rabbits received midvitreal ciprofloxacin of 100, 200, 400, 600 or 800 micrograms in BSS Plus, or BSS Plus only. Retinal toxicity was dose-dependent as determined with electroretinography, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. At a dose of greater than 400 micrograms, disorganization of the outer segments was a main pathological finding in transmission electron microscopy. We evaluated retinal function by measuring the electroretinograms for a graded series of flash intensities and by fitting electroretinogram b-wave amplitudes to the Naka-Rushton equation. At a dose of greater than 600 micrograms, Rmax was significantly decreased and log K was significantly increased. N-value tended to decrease. A decrease of b-wave amplitudes caused by retinal toxicity could be detected very sensitively with lower luminance stimuli. Determination of retinal toxicity with lower luminance electroretinography revealed a significant decrease of b-wave amplitudes at a dose of greater than 400 micrograms. We concluded that a safe dose of intravitreal ciprofloxacin in phakic rabbit eyes was 200 micrograms in phakic eyes.","1580":"Using computerized vitreous fluorophotometry (VFP, Fluorotron), we examined the effect of cryotherapy on the blood retinal barrier (BRB) and the effect of subtenon injection of methylprednisolone acetate (Depomedrol). In experiment 1, the right eyes of the 13 pigmented rabbits were treated with heavy cryotherapy after baseline VFP readings. The freezes were applied at 6 places in each quadrant around the equator are in two rows, a total of 24 places circumferentially. The left eyes were reserved as controls. In 6 rabbits (cryo with steroid group), Depomedrol 10 mg of Depomedrol was injected into subtenon space after cryotherapy. The other 7 rabbits were treated with cryotherapy only (cryo only group). The VFP readings were taken 1, 3, 5, and 7 days, 2, 3, 5, and 7 weeks after cryotherapy. Cryotherapy increased the breakdown of BRB significantly. The peak VFP readings were obtained 5 days after cryotherapy in the cryo only group and 7 days after cryotherapy in the cryo with steroid group. In the cryo only group, the severity of the breakdown of BRB was higher than in the cryo with steroid group, and the increased VFP readings could not be normalized until 7 weeks after cryotherapy. In experiment 2, both eyes of the 8 pigmented rabbits were treated with medium cryotherapy after baseline VFP readings. The freezes were applied at 3 places in the superior temporal quadrant and at 3 places in the superior nasal quadrant, a total of 6 places. Depomedrol 10 mg was injected into subtenon space after cryotherapy in the right eyes only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1581":"Choroidal neovascular membranes are often poorly defined on fluorescein angiography because of fluorescein leakage or blockage of hyperfluorescence by overlying hemorrhage, lipid, turbid fluid, or pigment. Indocyanine green (ICG) is a highly protein-bound dye in the near infrared portion of the spectrum. Therefore, ICG remained in and around the neovascular membrane and enhanced the visualization of certain membranes poorly defined with fluorescein. ICG penetrated through the overlying turbid tissue, and improved the visualization of the underlying choroidal neovascular membrane. Using an infrared angiography system, the authors obtained 21 ICG-angiograms with suspected choroidal neovascularization, and compared them to fluorescein angiograms. In 5 of the 21 eyes, occult choroidal neovascularization was well delineated on the ICG angiograms. In 2 eyes, we were able to detect a well-defined choroidal neovascular membrane underlying a subretinal hemorrhage. In 12 of the 21 eyes with choroidal neovascular membrane, we performed argon-green laser photocoagulation applying the overlay technique of the ICG angiogram to red-free photo or the early fluorescein angiogram, and evaluated the effect of full coverage laser treatment.","1582":"Extraocular muscle imbalance and diplopia after retina surgery have been previously reported, but the etiology is still controversial. In order to better understand the cause of strabismus after retinal surgery, the authors retrospectively studied 30 patients with persistent strabismus following retinal surgery and combined the result about seven patients of strabismus after retinal surgery in the previous report. Results showed multiple etiologies for the strabismus. Causes of strabismus included fat adherence syndrome (14 patients), non-specific restrictive adhesion (11), displacement of superior oblique tendon (2), scleral explant interfering with ocular motility (1), lost or slipped muscle with adhesion (2), sensory strabismus (2), macular pucker causing ectopic fovea (2), and previous strabismus before the retinal surgery (3). Knowledge of the varieties of abnormalities that can cause strabismus and diplopia will help both the retina and strabismus surgeon prevent and treat strabismus after retinal surgery.","1583":"Aconite is a common remedy of herb doctors and is widely used in the Far East. Clinical aspects of the visual disturbance produced by this drug have been described, but little is known about its pathology. Tinctura aconiti (0.6 mg of total alkaloid\/kg 2x) was administered intraperitoneally in rabbits to evaluate its toxic effects on the visual system. The alteration in the visual evoked potential following aconite injection consisted of a delay in the onset and peak latency. Histopathologically, there were damages to the myelin sheath of the visual pathway, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. These findings suggest that aconite may cause primarily myelo-optic neuropathy.","1584":"To investigate the effect of illumination on visual acuity and visual field in eyes with multifocal intraocular lens (IOL), the near and far visual acuity of the eyes with multifocal implants were compared to those of the eyes with monofocal implants in the diminished illumination, and the visual fields of two groups were also compared by the different target size and intensity. The near and far visual acuity of the eyes with multifocal implants were significantly decreased as compared to those of the eyes with monofocal implants under diminished illumination, and the visual field of the multifocal implanted eyes also significantly decreased as compared to that of the monofocal implanted eyes by the reduction of spot size and intensity. From the above results, it is assumed that the bifocal separation of incident light to two simultaneous focal points in the multifocal implants causes more decreased visual acuity and narrower visual field in the diminished illumination as compared to that of the eyes with monofocal implants.","1585":"Fresh rat corneas as well as corneas preserved in several different corneal preservation media were stained with Avidin-Biotin-peroxidase Complex method in order to evaluate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression. In fresh corneas, class I antigen was identified in corneal epithelium, stroma and endothelium. Class II antigen was identified only in stroma. In corneas preserved in the media which contained chondroitin and dextran for 7 days, class I antigen was somewhat decreased but class II antigen was increased. In corneas preserved in the medium which contained insulin or epidermal growth factor for 7 days, class II antigens seemed to be increased compaired to the fresh cornea. Expression of MHC antigens of corneas in the medium with fetal bovine serum were similar to those of fresh corneas.","1586":"We performed a randomized, prospective study to evaluate the effect of intraoperative, intracameral carbachol or acetylcholine on early postoperative intraocular pressure(IOP) after extracapsular cataract extraction(ECCE) and posterior chamber lens(PCL) implantation. Fifty-six eyes of 56 patients scheduled for routine ECCE and PCL implantation were randomly assigned into three groups: (1)carbachol infusion (19 eyes) (2) acetylcholine infusion (15 eyes) (3)balanced salt solution (BSS) infusion (control, 22 eyes). We compared the preoperative IOP, early postoperative IOP, postoperative 24 hours IOP and postoperative 1 week IOP. In the measurement of early postoperative IOP, IOP was measured at least twice at 3, 6 or 9 hours postoperatively. There was no significant difference in IOP between the three groups preoperatively, at postoperative 3 hours, and 1 week. At postoperative 6 hours, both the carbachol infusion group and acetylcholine infusion group were significantly different from the BSS infusion group. At postoperative 9 and 24 hours, only carbachol infusion group had a significant difference from BSS infusion group in suppression of postoperative IOP increase. Our results suggest that intraoperative, intracameral administration of carbachol or acetylcholine prevents early postoperative IOP increase, and that carbachol has a more lasting effect.","1587":"We quantitatively analyzed the changes of the (retinal) threshold sensitivities between normal status and dilated emmetropic status, and between dilated emmetropic status and -1.0D induced myopic status. Three consecutive visual field examinations by Humphrey Field Analyzer C-30-2 threshold test and STATPAC program were performed in 36 eyes of 21 normal subjects who ranged in age from 23 to 40 years. The results were as follows: 1) There was a statistically significant decrease (0.87 +\/- 0.91dB)in the mean threshold sensitivity within the central 30 degrees at the dilated emmetropic status (27.90dB) as compared with the normal status (28.77dB)(p = 0.0001). 2) There was a statistically significant decrease(0.99 +\/- 0.61dB) at -1.0D induced myopic status(26.91dB) as compared with the dilated emmetropic status(27.90dB)(p = 0.0001). 3) After dilation, the mean threshold sensitivity between 20 and 30 degrees of field showed statistically significant decrease as compared with those within the central 20 degrees of visual field(p &lt; 0.05). In case of -1.0D induced myopia, there were uniform decreases in the mean threshold sensitivities within the central 30 degrees of visual field (p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, we emphasize the importance of consistent pupillary size and correct refractive state in performing the serial automated visual field tests.","1588":"To analyse the results of diabetic vitrectomy according to the severity of proliferation [severe (SPG) vs. less-severe proliferation group (LSPG)], and methods of the operation, which was complete removal of anteroposterior vitreous traction with or without complete removal of preretinal memebrane, we compared both groups by using anatomic success rate and postoperative visual acuities (VA). The results were as follows: The anatomic success rate and postoperative VA were significantly better in LSPG than in SPG. In SPG, anatomic success rate and postoperative VA tended to be better when complete removal of anteroposterior traction was possible than when impossible. In SPG, postoperative VA tended to be better when complete removal of preretinal membrane was possible, but the anatomic success rate was the same for each group. So, when severe proliferation (including table-top elevation of posterior retina), complete removal of anteroposterior traction only can improve the anatomic success rate of the surgery.","1589":"Our previous experimental work with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) suggested the possibility of the clearance of vitreous hemorrhage by repetitive injections of low-dose TPA. We therefore investigated in rabbits the effect of both repeated injections of TPA and the change of the integrity of the vitreous body on the clearance of vitreous hemorrhage. Vitreous hemorrhage was produced by intravitreal injection of 0.05 ml of autologous whole blood in the pigmented rabbit eyes with intact vitreous or gas-compressed vitreous. Three intravitreal injections of 3-g TPA (total dose of 9 micrograms), separated by 7-day intervals, were performed. The endpoint for vitreous hemorrhage clearance was defined as clear visualization of the posterior central retina of the rabbits. Regardless of whether gas compression vitrectomy was performed, repeated injections of low-dose TPA resulted in rapid clearance of fresh vitreous hemorrhage in approximately two to three weeks after the last TPA injection. No evidence of retinal toxicity was seen in all experimental groups. Repetitive injections of low-dose TPA may be effective in the treatment of fresh vitreous hemorrhage.","1590":"We compared the success rate of filtering surgery of a single 5-minute intraoperative application of mitomycin-C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Animal experiment and clinical study were done. In animal study, thirty pigmented rabbits (60 eyes) weighing 2.0 to 2.5 Kg were enrolled. We divided into 4 groups, such as BSS, 5-FU 50 mg\/ml, MMC 0.2 mg\/ml and MMC 0.4 mg\/ml subconjunctival soaked group. Each group consisted of 15 eyes. In each group, 10 eyes was for examination of bleb survival and complications, 3 eyes for light microscopic examination and 2 eyes for electron microscopic examination. Bleb was survived 6.1 days (3 to 13 days) for BSS treated group, 16.3 days (9 to 23 days) for 5-FU 50mg\/ml treated group, 32.7 days (17 to 55 days) in MMC 0.2 mg\/ml treated group, and 64.4 days (49 to 84 days) in MMC 0.4 mg\/ml treated group. Duration of bleb survival was significantly prolonged in 5-FU, MMC 0.2 mg\/ml and MMC 0.4 mg\/ml group respectively. In clinical study, fifty-five eyes of 40 patients were enrolled. 29 eyes of 21 patients were treated with MMC 0.2 mg\/ml and 26 eyes of 19 patients were treated with 5-FU 50 mg\/ml. The success rate was 89.7% in MMC 0.2 mg\/ml treated group and 84.6% in 5-FU 50 mg\/ml treated group at postoperative 3 months, and postoperative 6 months 89.7% in MMC 0.2 mg\/ml treated group and 76.9% in 5-FU 50 mg\/ml treated group. There was no statistical significance at postoperative 3 months (P &gt; 0.05), but statistical significance at postoperative 6 months (P &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1591":"A subconjunctival orbital fat prolapse is frequently confused with a dermolipoma clinically. These two entities have similar clinical appearances, but are clearly distinct. The clinical features, differential diagnosis, and treatment modalities of subconjunctival orbital fat prolapse and dermolipoma are discussed.","1592":"To determine the prognosis of advanced retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) after surgery, we reviewed retrospectively the results of vitrectomy performed between November 1987 and December 1993 in 38 eyes with stage 5 ROP. The patients' mean age at surgery was 11 months, mean follow-up period was 24.1 months. Anatomical success, defined as reattachment of posterior pole retina, was achieved in 11 eyes (29.0%) and functional success, defined as presence of fixation and following was achieved in 7 eyes (18.4%). Anatomical success was well correlated with preoperative configuration of retina, i.e. open-funnel type showed better results than closed-funnel type (44.4% compared to 15.0%). There were no differences between anatomical success and failure group according to gestational age, birth weight, age at the time of diagnosis of ROP, chronological and postconceptional age, and body weight at the time of surgery. For good prognosis, it is necessary to operate early in stage 5 ROP when retinal funnel is still open.","1593":"A number of studies have documented the reasonable efficacy and safety of radial keratotomy, but most based upon results obtained in low or moderate myopia or short term follow up after surgery. We complied 5 year and longer follow up data on 91 consecutive radial keratotomy surgeries on high myopia (over -6.00 diopters) performed by one surgeon 5 year-follow up was obtained on 21 (23%) of these eyes. The mean spherical equivalent before surgery was -11.02 diopters (D), the average keratometry value was 44.40 D, and all of the eyes had an uncorrected visual acuity of 0.04 or less. The average change in spherical equivalent was 3.44 D for eyes examined at 1 year, compared with 3.05 D for eyes at 3 years and 2.87 D at 5 years after surgery. Average keratometry value were 42.30 D at 1 year, 41.60 D at 3 years, and 41.30 D at 5 years after surgery. In our study, the decrease in spherical equivalent of 0.57 D was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05), as was the reduction in average keratometry value of 1.00 D. The effect of the surgery on spherical equivalent continued to regress through all the 5 years of follow up. However, the keratometric measurement decreased up to 5 years which indicated progressive flattening of the cornea. Also we divided these eyes into 2 groups, lower-myopic group (-6.00 D-(-)9.75 D) and higher-myopic group (over -10.00 D). In each category, the changes in spherical equivalent were 3.60 D, 2.21 D at 5 years, compared with 3.65 D, 3.25 D at 1 year respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1594":null,"1595":"To determine surgical results and predictive factors of final visual acuity, a total of 30 eyes in 30 uveitis patients who underwent vitreous surgery including pars plana vitrectomy were followed for at least 6 months and various preoperative factors and postoperative results were analyzed. Our surgical indications were vitreous opacity, traction retinal detachment, combined rhegmatogenous-traction detachment. Preoperatively detached retina was finally reattached in 15 (83.3%) of 18 eyes. Final visual acuity improved in 19 (63.3%) of 30 eyes, but decreased in 3 eyes compared with the initial acuity. Cystoid macular edema was the main cause of poor visual acuity after surgery. Eyes with good final visual acuity showed relatively normal electroretinograms before surgery, but the relationship between them was not statistically significant. Duration of postoperative inflammation affected final visual acuity significantly. These results suggest that chronic uveitis patients with vitreoretinal complications can be managed by vitreous surgery with good anatomic and functional results.","1596":"To evaluate the histopathologic changes after an inferior oblique marginal myotomy with local injection of triamcinolone, an inferior oblique marginal myotomy was performed in 14 white rabbits and they were divided into 2 groups, one group with a local injection of triamcinolone and the other group without triamcinolone injection after a myotomy. At the postoperative one month, an edema of the muscle fibers and an infiltration of the inflammatory cells were observed and at postoperative three months, a fibrous tissue ingrowth around the muscle fibers and an atrophy of the muscle fibers were found and those changes were less prominant in the group with triamcinolone injection. The local injection of triamcinolone after the inferior oblique marginal myotomy would help in decreasing the fibrous tissue ingrowth and the formation of the scar tissue, thus it could be used in augmenting the effect of the inferior oblique marginal myotomy.","1597":"The Naka-Rushton equation of the form, R = Rmax I(n)\/(I(n)+Kn), has been used to describe the b-wave luminance-response function of the scotopic electroretinogram. Rmax is the asymptotic value of the b-wave amplitude as a function of stimulus luminance I, K is the luminance that produces a b-wave amplitude that is one-half Rmax, and n is a dimensionless constant that controls the slope of the function. These three parameters are often used in research laboratories, since it can show selective changes in each parameter. The present study describes these parameters (Rmax = 354 +\/- 28 uV, n = 0.80 +\/- 0.06, log K = -2.26 +\/- 0.15 log cd. sec\/m2) and the values obtained from the derivative analysis of Naka-Rushton equation (Anastasi et al) in 20 normal pigmented rabbit eyes. However, Naka-Rushton equation accurately describes the function only at low to moderate flash luminances. At high flash luminances, a second amplitude increase appears in the function.","1598":"Light microscopy and electron microscopic examination were carried out on the corneal buttons of two patients who required penetrating keratoplasty for treatment of corneal complication following the intraocular injection of silicone oil to repair recurrent retinal detachments in aphakic eyes. Light microscopic examination demonstrated increased cellularity and irregularity of collagen fibers of stromal layer, defect of endothelial cell layer and endothelial degeneration. Electron microscopy examination demonstrated marked decrease in endothelial cell population density, accompanied by flattening and thinning of the remaining cells and attenuation of cell borders. There were silicone droplets in the endothelial cell layer and collagenous layer posterior to endothelial layer. These findings are well correlated to clinical manifestation and are thought to be rather due to barrier effect of silicone oil than direct toxicity.","1599":"Using a rabbit model, we assessed the postoperative status and histopathologic findings of superior oblique tenotomy with silicone expander procedure. In the control group we marked and cut the superior oblique, and in the experimental group we inserted a silicone 240 retinal band 4 mm in length along the edges of incision. At the postoperative weeks 1,3,5 and 7, we randomly chose five rabbits and made a histopathologic examination after hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome stain. The distance between the incised edges was various in the control group, but constant in the experimental group. With time inflammation decreased and fibrosis of the superior oblique increased. Foreign body reaction occurred around the suture material in both groups., but not around the silicone expander. At 5 weeks atrophy of the superior oblique was observed in both groups. From the above results, we concluded that the superior oblique lengthening procedure using silicone expander is a useful surgical method for weakening the superior oblique muscle.","1600":"When the continuous circular capsulorhexis (CCC) is being performed, the nucleus delivery using nucleus dislocation into the anterior chamber is safer and easier than using conventional \"push and pull\" method to maintain an intact lens capsule. This method include such procedures that after CCC, the nucleus being freed in the capsular bag by hydrodissection and hydrodelineation, then hooked with a Sinskey hook and drawn out to the anterior chamber by rotation. It may damage the corneal endothelium because of the manipulation in the anterior chamber. To investigate an effect of this method on the corneal endothelium, we performed two months time analysis of changes of the central corneal endothelial cell density (CECD) in two groups--a group with an extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) using nucleus dislocation into the anterior chamber and a group with a conventional ECCE. Eighteen eyes of 18 cataract patients who were operated on with ECCE using nucleus dislocation into the anterior chamber method, and ten eyes of 10 cataract patients who were operated on with a conventional ECCE method were included. The CECD was measured by specular microscopy, preoperatively, postoperatively at 1 month and 2 months. The average endothelial cell loss at postoperative 1 month was 7.20 +\/- 2.98% in the experimental group and 7.88 +\/- 2.93% in the control group, and at postoperative 2 months was 9.05 +\/- 2.96% in the experimental group and 9.34 +\/- 2.95% in the control group. The change in CECD between two groups was not statistically significant.","1601":"To increase the success rate of intraocular pressure control in recalcitrant glaucoma, anterior chamber tube shunt to a surgical membrane (ACTSSM) surgery using silicone tube and expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE) can be performed. Applying mitomycin C (MMC) during ACTSSM surgery may increase the success rate by decreasing the fibroblast proliferation and collagen in the fibrous capsule. To evaluate the effects of MMC on the fibrous capsule formed after ACTSSM surgery, operations were performed on 18 white rabbits. Nine rabbits were treated with 0.04% MMC solution on the episclera for 5 minutes before ACTSSM (group A) and the others were not treated (group B). At postoperative 2, 4 and 8 weeks successively, 6 eyes of the 3 rabbits were enucleated from each group. Light microscopic examinations were performed after hematoxylin &amp; eosin staining and Masson's trichrome staining. In group A (MMC application group), fibrous capsules were not so dense, moderately thick, and showed many microcystic spaces. Proliferating fibrous connective tissues ingrowing between twofold surgical membranes were scanty. In group B (MMC non-application group), fibrous capsules showed high cellular density and less microcystic spaces, comparing those of MMC application group, suggesting low permeability of fibrous capsule to aqueous humor. MMC may be useful in increasing the success rate of ACTSSM surgery.","1602":"Electroretinograms (ERGs) were measured in 65 patients with diabetes and 10 control subjects. The single flash ERGs were recorded as a function of the stimulus intensity. A Naka-Rushton-type function was fit to b-wave amplitudes, measured as a function of stimulus intensity, to evaluate changes in ERG amplitude and sensitivity. We also measured the temporal aspects of the ERG b-waves. The ERG sensitivity tended to decrease as the retinopathy progressed. An average sensitivity loss in eyes with diabetic retinopathy was statistically significant. However, the eyes of diabetic patients without visible retinopathy did not show significant ERG sensitivity loss. There was less variability in temporal compared with amplitude measurements of ERG components, and significantly prolonged b-wave implicit times were found in all stages of retinopathy and in eyes of diabetic patients without retinopathy.","1603":"Suprofen eye drop was instilled into one eye of 10 pigmented rabbits and then anterior uveitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of endotoxin of Shigella flexneri serotype 1A to evaluate the effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug on endotoxin induced uveitis. The pupillary diameters were measured, and aqueous cell and flare gradings were recorded in 20 eyes of 10 rabbits for one week at an interval of 12 hours for the first 24 hours and then every 24 hours for a week. A difference between the treated and control groups were investigated. All the above parameters showed greatest changes at 12 or 24 hours after injection and became normal by one week. The two groups demonstrated statistically significant difference at 12 hours, day 1 and day 2 as for pupillary diameter, at day 1 and day 2 as for cell and at 12 hours and day 1 as for flare. Thus, it can be concluded that prostaglandins play a role in miosis, in the appearance of inflammatory cells and flare in endotoxin induced uveitis and the topical administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug can alleviate signs of anterior uveitis. Specific relationship between leukotriene B4 and aqueous cell was not demonstrated.","1604":"Corneal neovascularization, which is associated with complications in corneal diseases, can cause lipid deposit, decreasing vision, and graft rejection after penetrating keratoplasty (PKP). Corneal laser photocoagulation using an argon laser or yellow dye laser for ablation of corneal neovascularization has been described. We performed corneal argon laser photocoagulation (CALP) in two male patients with corneal neovascularization after herpetic keratitis. One PKP was performed after CALP and restored good vision with no rejection of the graft during an 8 month follow-up period. In the other case we observed visual improvement and no recurrence of corneal neovascularization after CALP.","1605":"The effectiveness of excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for astigmatism was evaluated. We treated 136 eyes of naturally occurring myopic astigmatism using the 193-nm excimer laser with an expanding slit and an iris diaphragm, and followed for a minimum of 6 months. At 6 months after operation, the mean refractive cylinder decreased from 1.62 +\/- 0.88 D preoperatively to 0.48 +\/- 0.48 D. For detailed analysis of the results, the surgically induced refractive change (SIRC) was determined from the preoperative and postoperative refractions by vector analysis of astigmatism. When we compared the cylinder of the SIRC with the preoperative refractive cylinder, the effect of the cylindrical ablation was 93.9 +\/- 36.7% at 6 months. The axial error of the cylinder of the SIRC to the preoperative cylindrical axis was 5.9 +\/- 10.2 degrees at 6 months. These results suggest that excimer laser PRK with an expanding slit appears to have a significant effect for the correction of astigmatism.","1606":"For the treatment of undercorrection after myopic epikeratoplasty, early suture removal, scar revision, retrephination, replacement of lenticule and, recently, excimer laser photorefractive keratoplasty have been employed. We performed trephination with Hessburg-Barron vacuum trephine on 11 eyes of 11 patients whose post-epikeratoplasty myopic power was over -4.00 diopters for 3 consecutive months. Patients were followed up on post-trephination 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. The mean duration from epikeratoplasty to trephination was 14.27 months, the mean pre-trephination spherical equivalent was -8.50 D and the mean keratometric reading was 40.87 D. The mean reduction of spherical equivalent was -4.07, -5.99, -8.02 D at post-trephination 1, 3, 6 months, respectively. The mean keratometric reading was 37.60 diopters at 1 month and 41.53 diopters at 6 months. At 1 and 3 months, there were significant reductions of myopic power in refraction and keratometry (p &lt; 0.01), but, at 6 months, regression to pre-trephination levels took place (p &gt; 0.05). There was no change of uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity between baseline and post-trephination 6 months.","1607":"Sodium hyaluronate can be used during a trabeculectomy to prevent early postoperative hypotony and shallow anterior chamber. To determine its long-term effect on the outcome of filtration surgery, fifteen rabbits underwent a posterior-lip sclerectomy in both eyes. Into their right eyes 0.2ml sodium hyaluronate, and into left eyes 0.2ml balanced salt solution were injected intracamerally. Gross and histopathological differences of bleb were observed. There was no statistically significant difference in longevity of the filtration bleb.","1608":"We studied the efficacy and safety of using topical mitomycin C (MMC) as an adjunct to glaucoma filtration surgery. Trabeculectomy was performed in 23 eyes of 19 patients with poor surgical prognosis. After the preparation of a scleral flap, 0.2 mg or 0.4 mg\/ml MMC was applied to the exposed tissue for 5 minutes. The wound was then irrigated with 250ml of normal saline. The mean follow-up period was 7.8 months. Preoperative mean intraocular pressure (IOP) was 33.8mmHg, and the mean IOPs on 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after operation were 10.3, 12.5, 12.4 and 12.3mmHg, respectively. At postoperative 12 months, 74.7% achieved an IOP of less than or equal to 20mmHg without any antiglaucoma medication. There were early postoperative complications of aqueous leaking from conjunctival wounds in 3 eyes (13.0%), shallow anterior chamber in 2 eyes, and hyphema in one eye and one eye had long-term hypotony lasting more than 3 months. Although MMC is simple to use, it is a potent adjunct to glaucoma filtration surgery, more work should follow to determine the mechanism of action, indications, dosage and optimal exposure time of MMC.","1609":"The intraocular pressure (IOP) of glaucomatocyclitic crisis with the attack fell 50.3%, from 37.8 +\/- 8.2 mmHg to 18.8 +\/- 4.8 mmHg, 4 hours after instillation of 1% apraclonidine. Glaucomatocyclitic crisis showed a more significant hypotensive response to 1% apraclonidine than primary open-angle glaucoma (24.8%, from 43. 1 +\/- 8.1 mmHg to 32.4 +\/- 7.5 mmHg after 4 hours). The intraocular pressure decrease percentage was similar regardless of the initial level of intraocular pressure. Clinically significant changes in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures, were not observed, however, a mild decrease in the pulse rate was noted. And the local mydriatic effect on the pupillary diameter was significant. Apraclonidine, 1% might be newly indicated to control the IOP rise of glaucomatocyclitic crisis. Further studies on the possible mechanism of the prostaglandin mediated hypotensive effect of 1% apraclonidine are suggested.","1610":"To investigate the risk factors for glaucoma, we reviewed the clinical record of 361 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients, 178 ocular hypertensives (OH), and 927 controls without POAG or OH, randomly selected from an urban medical center eye clinic. Old age defined as &gt; or = 55 year, (odds ratio ratio (OR) = 3.13 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.06-4.76, P &lt; .0001), black race (OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.79-3.74, p &lt; .0001), hypertension (OR = 1.709, 95% CI: 1.15-2.51, P &lt; .0108), and diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.08-3.09, P = .0308) were identified as significant risk factors in POAG compared to OH. Old Age (OR = 4.94, 95% CI: 3.62-6.76, p &lt; .0001), and black race (OR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.59-2.61, P &lt; .0001), HTN (OR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.26-2.11, P = .0002), and DM (OR = 1.40 95% CI: 1.02-1.92 P = .0450) were also significant risk factors when compared to normal controls. However, when the 361 POAG patients were compared to 361 controls matched with respect to age, race, and sex, hypertension and diabetes mellitus did not appear to be independent risk factors. Family history of glaucoma was found to be a risk factors more significantly for OH (OR = 6.79, 95% CI: 4.39-10.50, P &lt; .0001) than for POAG (OR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.90-4.21, P &lt; .0001) compared to the matched control subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1611":"Anterior radial keratotomy for high myopia (over-6.25 diopter) to reduce refractive error was not able to dispense with glasses or contact lenses due to the high myopia itself. However patients could see objects well and were free of dizziness while wearing glasses of relatively reduced power. We performed anterior radial keratotomies on 83 high myopic and\/or astigmatic eyes of 47 patients at Kangnam St. Mary's Hospital between May 1990 and Mar. 1991. Eight radial incisions with a diamond blade were performed and the Ruiz technique was added for astigmatism of over 2.0 diopters. The depth of incision was 90 to 95% of corneal thickness and the optical zone was 3mm in diameter. Patients were followed up on postoperative 7 days. 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and thereafter. Uncorrected visual acuity of 20\/40 or better after radial keratotomy could be obtained in 19.6% of high myopic eyes. A mean reduction of the spherical equivalent cycloplegic refraction of 5.13 diopters and a keratometric reading of 3.89 diopters after radial keratotomy were observed. About 90% of patients were satisfied with their visual outcome with reduced refractive power glasses. We recommend radial keratotomy for high myopic patients to reduce the refractive power and to help them enjoy a more comfortable life.","1612":"An animal experiment was done to evaluate the efficacy of tissue coating with sodium hyaluronic acid and subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone acetate in reducing the severity of postoperative adhesions following strabismus surgery. Experimental animals underwent a mild traumatic surgical procedure in one superior rectus muscle and a severe traumatic surgical procedure in the other superior rectus muscle. Each group was divided into control group, sodium hyaluronate coating group and triamcinolone acetonide injection group. Grading the severity of adhesions through surgical exploration of operative sites and histological comparison after 4 weeks revealed a significant reduction of postoperative adhesions in sodium hyaluronate group compared with control group under conditions of severe surgical trauma. But triamcinolone groups have no significant differences compared with control groups by statistical analysis. Tissue protection afforded by sodium hyaluronate may lead to an effective method which minimizes the surgical trauma to the tissues and reduces the postsurgical adhesions following strabismus surgery.","1613":"Overaction of the inferior oblique(IO) muscle is manifested by elevation of the adducted eye and from the clinical point of view there are two types of overaction. The primary type is of unknown cause, whereas the secondary type is usually related to the palsy of the ipsilateral superior oblique or contralateral superior rectus. An ultrastructural study on the overacting IO muscles was performed compared to normal IO muscles by electron microscopy. Of 16 biopsies of overacting IO muscles, four had primary overacting inferior obliques and twelve had secondary overacting inferior obliques due to paralysis of superior oblique muscle. Additional four IO muscle, obtained from patients with intraocular diseases served as control specimens. The most striking abnormalities were aggregations of mitochondria and degenerating mitochondrial profiles and increased vacuolization in primary and secondary overacting muscles. Many muscle fibers were in different stages of atrophy, and hypertrophy and regeneration of muscle fibers were sometimes visible. The results suggest that the primary overacting IO muscle might be the result of a paresis of the superior oblique muscle.","1614":"Posterior lip sclerectomies were performed in rabbits and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) was applied by topical instillation or subconjunctival injection. In both groups, the mean intraocular pressure (IOP) of the treated eyes was significantly lowered at postoperative week 1 and 2, but there was no significant difference between the mean IOP of the control eyes and that of the treated eyes at postoperative week 3 and 4. In both groups, at postoperative week 2, the sclerectomy sites of the control eyes were totally occluded by granulation tissue, but those of the treated eyes were partially replaced by granulation tissue. At postoperative week 4, the sclerectomy sites of the treated eyes were totally occluded by the granulation tissue ultimately in both groups. There were no differences in the mean IOP and the histologic finding of the treated eyes between the topical instillation group and the subconjunctival injection group. We concluded that either topical instillation or subconjunctival injection of Ara-C can delay wound healing at the surgical site after glaucoma filtering surgery in rabbits.","1615":"The most important problem in the transplantation of artificial cornea is the extrusion of keratoprosthesis. So we performed this study to know the conditions to keep the keratoprosthesis as long as possible after animal experiment with experimental keratoprosthesis of various material and structure. We concluded from the results that silicone barrier could not prevent the retroprosthetic membrane, and fluorosilicone was not adequate material as an optic. And the following conditions are required to maintain keratoprosthesis as long as possible; optic made of PMMA, retention plate made of PTFE with 0.6 mm thick, anterior direction of optic, large optic, intralamellar suture technique. Furthermore we postulated that enzymatic theory is more appropriate than aseptic necrosis theory about the extrusion of keratoprosthesis.","1616":"To elucidate the family history of glaucoma (FHG) as a risk factor for ocular hypertension(OH) vs glaucomatous optic nerve damage, we reviewed the clinical records of 361 primary open-angle glaucoma(POAG) patients, 178 OH subjects, and 927 normal controls randomly selected from an urban medical center eye clinic. The prevalence of a positive FHG was 27% in the POAG patients, 47% in the OH subjects, and 11% in the normal controls. Whereas a positive FHG was a significant risk factor for both OH and glaucoma compared to normal control subjects (OR = 7.56, 95% CI: 5.27-10.85, P &lt; .0001 for OH; OR = 3.15, 95% CI: 2.31-4.31, P &lt; .0001), it was a risk factor more significantly for OH than for glaucoma being significantly more prevalent in OH than in POAG (OR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.65-3.49, P &lt; .0001). These results suggest the importance of additional risk factors other than IOP for glaucomatous optic nerve damage.","1617":"Preoperative aqueous humor, known to inhibit the growth of fibroblasts in tissue culture assay, was used as an adjunct to filtering surgery in rabbits to determine its effect in vivo on the outcome of filtering surgery. Fifteen rabbits underwent a posterior-lip sclerectomy in both eyes. In experimental eyes 1.4 ml preoperative aqueous humor and in fellow eyes 1.4 ml balanced salt solution were injected intracamerally. Gross and histopathological differences of bleb were observed. In this animal experiment, although there was no statistical significance or late postoperative effect, the rabbit eyes refilled with preoperative aqueous humor intracamerally just after filtering surgery, had a larger bleb and less fibroconnective tissue on the bleb than the control eyes in the early postoperative period.","1618":"Congenital ocular motor apraxia (COA), first described by Cogan in 1953, is a rare disorder which shows characteristic defects of the horizontal voluntary saccades, and compensatory head thrust. Until now, most cases have showed a presumably congenital origin, bilaterality, and a tendency to various stages of recovery with aging. But the cause and mechanism of COA are not completely known. Occasionally, it combines with other neurologic abnormalities and metabolic diseases such as Gaucher's disease exhibit similar clinical characteristics to COA. We recently experienced a case of a 3-year-old girl who showed the clinical features of unilateral congenital ocular motor apraxia.","1619":"The authors performed cycloplegic refractions in 180 eyes of 99 premature infants at the age of 6 months to evaluate the incidence and the degree of myopia according to the development and disease course of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and to investigate the effect of cryotherapy on the refractive error. The incidences of myopia were not different between premature infants without ROP and premature infants with spontaneously and totally regressed ROP (36.3%, 25.5%), and the degrees of myopia were low in both groups (-1.76 D, -2.25 D). In premature infants with totally regressed ROP after cryotherapy, the incidence of myopia was high (75.5%) but the degree of myopia was low (-3.03 D). In premature infants with cicatricial ROP, cryotreated or not, both the incidence and the degree of myopia were high (93.9%, -5.50 D). It is suggested that cryotherapy increases the incidence of myopia but the degree of myopia induced by cryotherapy is low. Little is known about the incidence of myopia in premature infants with spontaneously regressed retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) without cicatricial changes or the effect of cryotherapy on refractive errors. The authors therefore report findings from cycloplegic refractions conducted in 180 eyes of 99 premature infants at age 6 months in order to evaluate the incidence and degree of myopia according to the development and disease course of ROP and to investigate the effect of cryotherapy on the refractive error.  No differences were found between incidences of myopia in premature infants without ROP and premature infants with spontaneously and totally regressed ROP.  The degree of myopia was low in both groups.  A 75.5% incidence of myopia was observed in premature infants with totally regressed ROP after cryotherapy, but the degree of myopia was low.  A 93.9% incidence of high degree myopia, however, was found among premature infants with cicatricial ROP regardless of whether or not they received cryotreatment.  These findings suggest that cryotherapy increases the incidence of myopia, but the degree of myopia induced by this treatment is low. ","1620":"Electron microscopic examination of proliferative membranes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was performed in order to evaluate the components of the membranes. The proliferative membranes were obtained from nine patients with ROP stage 5 during pars plicata lensectomy, vitrectomy, and delamination of membrane. Fibrous astrocytes, myofibroblasts, lymphocytes, macrophages, and calcification were found respectively in two cases, and fibroblast-like cells were found in one case. Varying amounts of collagen tissues were found in eight cases and vascular tissues in four cases. Most of membranes were hypocellular and composed mainly of collagen matrix. It is considered that fibrous astrocytes, myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, and vascular structures are involved in the formation of proliferative membranes of ROP, and that later these cells degenerate and disappear, and that finally only collagen matrix remains in the membranes.","1621":"Because the optic disc in myopic eyes is different from a normal optic disc, there are many difficulties in examining the optic discs of myopic eyes. To study optic disc change due to myopia, we performed a morphometrical study of stereophotographs of 61 men, 109 eyes, who had no glaucoma history. The range of refractive error was from +0.75 diopter to -12.75 diopter, and all subjects had intraocular pressure below or equal to 21 mmHg. According to the increase in the myopic degree, the temporal slope of the disc cup was significantly decreased, but the ratio of the vertical disc diameter (VDD) to the horizontal disc diameter and the ratio of the width of peripapillary atrophy (PPA) to the VDD were significantly increased. The above results suggests that in high myopia the optic disc was tilted and the rim-cup border was indistinct and there are some problems in the estimation of the morphometric parameters. Also in evaluation of the PPA of myopic glaucoma patients, there may be some difficulty in deciding whether it is due to myopic change or glaucomatous damage.","1622":"To quantify the dynamic changes taking place in the anterior segment, we measured the anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT) and their difference between sexes and age groups in normal eyes using contact ultrasonography and anterior chamber photography. There were 141 women (241 eyes) and 76 men (130 eyes) between the ages of 10 and 70 years. In normal eyes, the lens thickness was increased and the anterior chamber depth was decreased with aging in both sexes. The anterior chamber depth showed an accelerated decrease between the 4th and 5th decades in females and the ratio of anterior chamber depth to axial length was smaller in females than in males after the 5th decade. The results suggested that the prevalence of angle closure glaucoma will be increased in females after middle age.","1623":"The clinical efficacy was investigated of topical homologous fibronectin on persistent corneal epithelial defects of various etiologies. Fibronectin was purified from blood bank homologous plasma by gelatin-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography. Twenty eight eyes of twenty five patients with persistent corneal epithelial defects and sterile corneal ulcers that failed to improve with standard therapy were treated by the instillation of homologous fibronectin eyedrops 5 times a day (500 micrograms\/ml). Complete reepithelialization was achieved in all patients except two eyes due to uncontrolled glaucoma and the taking of steroids. The healing time tended to be different depending on the duration of persistent corneal epithelial defects and the severity of underlying diseases. The mean +\/- standard deviation duration of epithelial defect was 68.18 +\/- 77.80 days. Average healing time was 42.07 +\/- 17.47 days. Ocular symptoms were relieved significantly and no side effects were observed. Over an average follow-up period of about 8 months, two cases of recurrences were noted. These results show that homologous fibronectin was also effective in patients with persistent corneal epithelial defects and corneal ulcers.","1624":"The concentrations of fibronectin in aqueous humor, measured by ELISA which was developed to detect fibronectin, ranged from 5 ng\/ml to 100 ng\/ml. Aqueous humor was aspirated from human eyes with cataracts and glaucomas using a 26 gauge needle through the peripheral cornea before making the limbal incision into the anterior chamber during surgery. The results of the study show that the average concentration and standard deviation of fibronectin was 0.136 +\/- 0.192 microgram\/ml in cataract eyes, and 0.962 +\/- 0.918 microgram\/ml in glaucoma eyes respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between both groups (p = 0.000). However, no significant differences according to age and sex were noted. There was no influence due to preoperative intravenous mannitol injection on fibronectin concentration. The source of aqueous fibronectin is still not clearly known and the mechanism of the higher concentration of fibronectin in glaucoma has not been clearly disclosed, however it is thought that normally present fibronectin is accumulated in the anterior chamber because it can not pass the aqueous outflow pathway, or that fibronectin production may be increased in glaucoma.","1625":"A solitary lid mass was identified as a primary solitary plasmacytoma. A 71 year old male presented with a left upper lid mass. The mass was found to be firmly intermingled with the underlying tarsal plate. A total excision was successfully performed and the lid margin was reconstructed with a good cosmetic result. There were no positive findings in the systemic work-up. The light microscopic findings suggest that the mass is of tarsal plate origin. It is the first case of plasmacytoma of tarsal plate origin presented as a lid mass.","1626":"Hemangiopericytomas are soft tissue tumors composed of pericapillary pericytes. These tumors are rare in the lacrimal sac. To the author's knowledge, only four previous cases of these tumors occurring in the lacrimal sac have been reported. A primary hemangiopericytoma of the lacrimal sac in a 34-year-old female is reported. Total excision with the surrounding tissue appears to be the treatment of choice for this tumor.","1627":"A tectonic keratoplasty was performed with a keratoprosthesis using expanded polytetrafluoroethylene as a supporting skirt, on the left eye of a 23-year-old woman who needed an emergency corneal transplantation due to corneal perforation. The keratoprosthesis implanted, consisted of a supporting skirt which was made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and an optic portion which was made of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The optic portion and the supporting skirt were attached by cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive (Histoacryl). Two months post-operatively, the keratoprosthesis was extruded, leaving an opacified, vascularized cornea. A penetrating keratoplasty was performed 1 month later. The excised cornea was composed of granulation tissue. To our knowledge, this is the first case of tectonic keratoprosthesis using expanded PTFE as a supporting skirt in humans.","1628":"To understand the pathogenesis of proliferative vitreoretinal membrane formation which occurs in proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), etc., accurate identification of the cellular components of the membrane is needed. This study was performed to identify cellular components of the membranes by means of immunohistochemical technique. 11 proliferative vitreoretinal membranes which were surgically obtained from 7 eyes with PVR and 4 eyes with PDR were stained with monoclonal antibodies against cytokeratin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), or vimentin using immunoperoxidase technique (ABC method). In the PVR membranes, mean cell positivities for cytokeratin, GFAP and vimentin were 48%, 1% and 92%, respectively and in the PDR membranes, 0%, 5% and 93%, respectively. The above results suggest that retinal pigment epithelial cells and fibroblasts are major cellular components of PVR membranes, and that mesenchymal cells are major cellular components and glial cells are minor cellular components of PDR membranes.","1629":"Failure of a glaucoma filtering operation mainly results from scarring at the filtering wound, and postoperative proliferation and migration of fibroblasts play an important role histologically in the formation of scar tissue. As an inhibitory agent for fibroblast proliferation, gamma-interferon has been introduced, and the application of gamma-interferon following filtering surgery is now being made on a trial basis. We studied the effect of gamma-interferon histologically on the fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis occurring at the filtering site by comparing the effect of gamma-interferon on the experimental group with that of 5-fluorouracil on the control group, using 10 rabbits (20 eyes) after posterior lip sclerectomy. Both groups showed similar flat and diffused bleb grossly and also showed a similar inhibitory effect on fibroblast proliferation and collagen fiber synthesis histologically. Our findings seem to justify the clinical use of gamma-interferon. Further studies on adequate dosage, method of administration, and local and systemic complications would be desired.","1630":"Since the anterior chamber tube shunt to an encircling band(ACTSEB) is not a simple procedure, an extended polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE)-silicone tube (anterior chamber tube shunt to a surgical membrane; ACTSSM) was attempted as a new glaucoma drainage implant. To see whether the newly-modified, two-fold e-PTFE-silicone tube implant could prevent early hypotony and to compare the tissue response to each implant, ACTSEB and ACTSSM procedures were done in normal colored rabbit eyes. It was found the ACTSSM kept the depth of the postoperative anterior chamber normal. And in general, foreign body responses were light microscopically similar. The fibrous capsule lining the e-PTFE was composed of thicker, less dense fibroblasts, as well as less collagen than that lining the silicone encircling band. These findings seemed to be related to the difference in the pressure-lowering capacity between ACTSEB and ACTSSM.","1631":"The amino acid L-glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of vertebrates. NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) is one of the L-glutamate receptor subtypes. During a critical period of early postnatal development, the visual cortex is susceptible to experience-dependent modification of neuronal responses. Recently, the activation of NMDA receptors has been supposed as a prerequisite for the induction of such modification. We therefore investigated developmental changes of NMDA receptors in the rat visual cortex and questioned whether they could be related to the visual development. We assessed the density of [3H]-NMDA receptor in the visual cortex of normally reared rate (Group I) and visually deprived rats (Group II) using quantitative autoradiography. The density of [3H]-NMDA receptor was significantly lower in Group II than in group I during the early postnatal period, and increased rapidly by postnatal 1 week and, decreased after postnatal 5 weeks. These results suggested that NMDA receptors may play a role in neuronal development in the visual cortex during the early postnatal period.","1632":"When the oculomotor nerve is completely paralyzed, the affected eye shows severe outward displacement and poor cosmetic appearance. Past results of many surgical procedures for oculomotor palsy have been generally unsatisfactory. We tried a new surgical approach experimentally, in which the disinserted lateral rectus muscle was used as an adductor by medial transposition of the muscle. Five adult cats underwent disinsertion of the medial rectus muscle of both eyes to induce iatrogenic medial rectus paralysis. The disinserted medial rectus was removed as far back as possible to prevent reattachment. Then, the right lateral rectus muscle was disinserted and passed beneath the superior rectus muscle and resutured to the sclera 4mm superoposterior to the medial rectus insertion site. After excision of the bilateral medial rectus, a large exotropia of an average 47.6 delta (42.0-55.5 delta) was induced. The medial transposition of the right lateral rectus produced an average 36.6 delta (24.8-45.8 delta) correction of the exotropia. A satisfactory cosmetic result was achieved by this procedure.","1633":"A case with typical skin lesions of incontinentia pigmeti showed progressing retinal vascular abnormalities. So cryotherapy was done on avascular peripheral retina, and retinal vascular changes ceased. We propose that cryotherapy may be a good treatment method for progressing retinal vascular lesions of incontinentia pigmenti.","1634":"We reviewed the long-term results of implantation of posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) by suture fixation in 23 patients without zonular or capsular support. In terms of preoperative state, 15 were aphakic, 5 had cataracts and 3 were aphakic with concurrent corneal opacity. The latter had penetrating keratoplasty as well at the time of surgery. They were followed up for more than 1 year, and the best corrected vision remained the same or improved in all cases after surgery. The transscleral suture fixation-related complications included vitreous hemorrhage, hyphema and retinal detachment.","1635":"Measuring the tear meniscus height (TMH) is easy after fluorescein installation, but the TMH after fluorescein instillation is higher than the TMH before fluorescein instillation. Therefore, we measured the time that the TMH after fluorescein instillation became the same with the TMH, we studied the difference in the TMH between normal eyes and dry eyes. The TMH 0.19 +\/- 0.05 mm in the normal eyes and 0.10 +\/- 0.04 mm in the dry eyes, and there was a significant difference between the 2 groups. The time that the TMH after fluorescein instillation became the same with the TMH before fluorescein instillation was 2.19 +\/- 0.81 min. in the normal eyes and 2.29 +\/- 0.73 min. in the dry eyes. Within 4 min. after fluorescein instillation, the TMH became the same with the TMH before fluorescein instillation in all cases and the height persisted until 7 min. after fluorescein instillation. Therefore, measuring the TMH will be easy if it is measured at 4-7 min. after fluorescein instillation.","1636":"The 6 eyes of 6 patients operated on using keratoconic epikeratoplasty are evaluated, and the mean 11-month postoperative results are reported. Uncorrected visual acuities improved in 4 patients and were maintained in 1 patient. One patient revealed a decrease of uncorrected visual acuity in the postoperative 6th month. Two patients showed an improvement of over 2 Snellen lines. Two patients showed the same corrected visual acuity, and that of 2 patients decreased within the postoperative 6-months follow-up. There was a significant decrease of myopia in terms of spherical equivalent. As a result, 4 cases showed a postoperative refractive error from +1.0 to -2.5D. Two cases were myopic deviated, -4.0 and -5.0D, and need further observation. In all cases, there was an effective flattening of the protruding cone with a mean decrease of over 11D of keratometry readings. Complete reepithelization occurred within 12 days, (average 7.5 days) and a moderate pressure patch was used as a routine procedure to promote the reepithelization.","1637":"Three hundred patients who have congenital colour vision deficiencies were examined at the author's eye clinic for 3 years (1987-1990) using 5 types of colour vision tests: Hahn's, TMC's, Okuma's (new), H-R-R's colour vision tests and Double 15 Hue Test (Hahn). The results obtained from each test were quite different in type and grade, and the summarized results were considered to be the best: Type: protan 23.3%, deutan 76.0%, unclassified 0.7% Grade: mild 20.3%, medium 25.3%, strong 54.4% The frequency of coincidence both in type and grade between the summarized results and those of each test were compared, and the highest was 62.3% in Double 15 Hue Test. The efficiency of the author's colour vision test and Double 15 Hue Test were evaluated with the data in this clinical trial, and they were found to be useful for classifying the type and estimating the grade of the congenital and also acquired colour vision deficiencies.","1638":"Strabismus surgery results in the permanent interruption of anterior ciliary blood flow, predisposing the eye to anterior segment ischemia (ASI). A primate model was used to assess the effectiveness of a new muscle-scleral tuck for preserving anterior ciliary artery circulation. The model consisted of removing 3 rectus muscles from both eyes of 2 rhesus monkeys, then performing a tuck on the inferior rectus (IR) right eye while leaving the left IR as a control. Four weeks later, a modified tuck was performed on the virgin left IR. Fluorescein iris angiograms of both eyes were obtained, and preoperative angiograms at 5-15 sec. showed normal 360 degrees perfusion. Postoperative follow-up angiograms showed segmental superior temporal filling defects and preservation of perfusion in the distribution of the IR. Comparison of fellow eyes tucked vs control IR showed no difference in the filling pattern in both monkeys. Comparison of the same eye before and after tuck also showed essentially the same filling pattern in all 4 eyes with preservation of inferior circulation. Our conclusion is that the modified tuck preserves the anterior ciliary blood flow and may be useful as a muscle-strengthening procedure in patients predisposed to developing ASI.","1639":"We examined the fibronectin (FN) secretion of cultured trabecular meshwork (TM) cells in a normal human eye by indirect immunofluorescent technique using mouse anti-human FN monoclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. To localize FN on frozen sections of normal TM, which were obtained from 7 enucleated eyes owing to traumatic eyeball rupture, the same indirect immunofluorescent method was used. Immunoelectron microscopy was applied to demonstrate the distribution pattern of FN in the normal TM of 2 human eyes using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. In the tissue culture of TM, the TM cell walls and extracellular matrices showed an intense staining with antibody to FN. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of FN on frozen sections of TM showed strong positive reactions in the subendothelial region. There was no reaction in the central core of the trabecular beam. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed the reaction products to FN in the areas lining the trabecular endothelial cells.","1640":"To determine the effect of apraclonidine hydrochloride on the acute intraocular pressure (IOP) rise after argon laser iridotomy (ALI), a double-masked comparative study was carried out. Twenty-nine eyes (20 patients) with angle-closure glaucoma underwent ALI. Eighteen eyes were treated with apraclonidine, and the remainder received a placebo 1 hour before and immediately after ALI. The mean IOP increase in the apraclonidine group was lower than that in the placebo group at each postlaser interval (p less than 0.01). Although the average value of the maximal increases of IOP after ALI in the apraclonidine group was 4 mmHg, that in the placebo group was 16 mmHg. In the placebo group, 27.3% (3 out of 11 eyes) experienced an IOP rise greater than or equal to 10 mmHg. However, that kind of IOP rise was not found in the apraclonidine group (0 out of 18 eyes) (p less than 0.01). Ocular or systemic side effects were not found in a series of examinations in both groups. Therefore, apraclonidine proved to be effective in lowering the IOP rise after ALI.","1641":"Intravitreal fibrin clots were produced by intravitreal injection of 0.2 ml of autologous plasma in 62 rabbit eyes. The intravitreal injection of 0.25 micrograms or more of tissue plasminogen activator(tPA) resulted in a total clearing of intravitreal fibrin within one day in all treated eyes. This was significantly faster than in the control eyes, in which complete clearing was not seen until 8 days later. This represents the plateau on the dose-response curve in doses ranging from 0.25 to 200 micrograms. With light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, retinal toxicity was demonstrated in eyes enucleated seven days after injection of 25 micrograms or more of tPA. This study demonstrates that tPA was effective and safe at 12.5 micrograms or less in clearing intravitreal fibrin in an experimental model. These results suggest that low dosages of tPA, probably of 3 micrograms or less, may be useful in the treatment of severe postvitrectomy fibrin formation seen clinically.","1642":"The changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) following peritomy and wet-field coagulation of 10 rabbit eyes and 7 human cataractous eyes were investigated. The IOP difference before and after 180-degree and 360-degree wet-field coagulation on rabbit eyes showed an average increase of 11.0 +\/- 5.8 mmHg and 25.8 +\/- 7.1 mmHg(mean +\/- SD), respectively (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01). The IOP of both groups in rabbit eyes were elevated for 2 to 3 days postoperatively and then became normal by the 7th postoperative day. The IOP difference before and after 180-degree peritomy and wet-field coagulation in human cataractous eyes showed an average increase of 8.4 +\/- 5.8 mmHg(mean +\/- SD)(p less than 0.05). The outflow facility was poor immediately following wet-field coagulation but then improved gradually by means of tonography and concentration changes of anterior chamber neutral-red. Histologically, there was endothelial cell damage, congestion, and red blood cell extravasation of the episcleral and intrascleral vessels at one day after wet-field coagulation in the light microscopic findings. Recanalization of the episcleral and intrascleral capillaries was noted 3 days after wet-field coagulation and was completed 3 weeks after wet-field coagulation. There was poor plastic infusion through the trabecular spaces in the one-day postoperative group compared to the control group by scanning electron micrograph. In conclusion, we have to bear in mind the possibility of an IOP rise after wet-field coagulation following peritomy for cataract and retinal surgery.","1643":"In the early stages of glaucoma, the disc changes prior to visual field loss, so assessment of the optic disc is very important for the evaluation of the glaucoma patient. The aim of this study is to assess the glaucomatous disc and to look for the features of the optic disc that are commonly associated with early visual field loss. Forty-three eyes of 28 patients were included in this investigation. The criteria for inclusion were a cup\/disc(C\/D) ratio of more than 0.4 by direct ophthalmoscopy, no visual field defect with Goldmann perimetry, and open anterior chamber angle. Each optic disc was photographed with a Canon fundus camera with Polaroid 600 Plus film. Each photographic set was then examined stereoscopically for morphologic parameters: 1) comparison of vertical versus horizontal C\/D ratio; 2) presence of nasal cupping; 3) presence of overpassing vessels; 4) presence of baring of circumlinear vessels; 5) presence of peripapillary atrophy; 6) ratio of the thinnest neuroretinal rim(NRR) width in the vertical sectors of the NRR width of the temporal sector. All subject's central visual fields were examined with an automated static perimeter, Humphrey program C30-2 with STATPAC. The C\/D ratio estimated by direct ophthalmoscopy consistently showed a smaller C\/D ratio than that found by the stereophotographic method. The parameter with the highest probability value to differentiate between the optic disc of the early visual field loss and the optic disc of normal subjects was \"Ratio of the thinnest NRR width in the vertical sectors to the NRR width of the temporal sector less than or equal to 85%\". Although it has less resolving power than slide film, a stereo disc photograph with Polaroid film is a quick and simple method of recording changes, and the ratio of the thinnest NRR width in the vertical sectors to the temporal sector is a good predictive parameter for detection of early visual field loss.","1644":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cellular response and morphological changes of cells on the intraocular lens(IOL) implanted over a course of time and to identify the basic mechanism of IOL adaptation to tissue reaction in the implanted eye by comparing polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) IOL with heparin surface modified PMMA IOL. ECCE using Healon was done in 36 eyes of 36 rabbits. A heparin surface modified IOL was implanted in 18 eyes (Group I), while PMMA IOL was implanted into another 18 eyes (Group II). Corneal thickness and endothelial cell density were measured for 3 months. Postoperatively, the eyes were enucleated, and a cytopathologic examination of the cells on the surface of the IOL and their ultrastructural changes were observed with light and scanning microscope at various points of time. The findings of this present study suggested that heparin surface modified PMMA IOL reduced the degree of endothelial cell damage, postoperative tissue reaction, and pigment deposits on the surface of the IOL. These were statistically significant. The most important cell was considered to be the macrophage for the adaptation of IOL in the eye which gradually changed into a fibroblast-like cell, giant cell and finally disappeared after forming an acellular membrane on the IOL.","1645":"In the process of closing scleral wounds caused by various conditions, incarceration of conjunctiva, Tenon's capsule, or vitreous in the wound can occur unexpectedly. We created such conditions experimentally in order to discover their intraocular complications. The experimental materials consisted of 12 albino rabbits (24 eyes) divided into two groups (Groups I &amp; II). Vitrectomy was performed in the Group I rabbits (12 eyes) but not in the Group II rabbits (12 eyes). Flaps of conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule were made and inserted into the vitreous cavity through the sclerotomy site, which was soon closed. Fundal examination of the rabbits was carried out using an indirect ophthalmoscope at intervals after the procedure; first at 3 days, then at 1, 3, and 6 weeks, and then at 3 months and 6 months, respectively. Enucleation of the rabbits' eyes 4 from two different rabbits at each of these intervals was carried out, and the extracted eyes were examined under a light microscope at each interval. The results are summarized as follows: 1. All rabbit eyes studied showed intraocular fibrovascular proliferation. 2. The extent of tissue proliferation, which was proportional to the amount of vitreous hemorrhage, was greater in Group II than in Group I. 3. The proliferated tissue developed to \"band\" by three weeks postexperiment, after which it gradually regressed. 4. The fibrovascular band was made of fibroblasts, stromal matrix, and capillaries.","1646":"A case of painful ophthalmoplegia with unilateral ocular pain, fixed eyeball to all directions of gaze, and loss of vision is presented. After intensive steroid therapy, conjunctival chemosis subsided markedly, but no improvement was seen in other clinical signs. We took a CT scan of orbit brain and performed nasopharyngeal biopsy and open biopsy through craniectomy. Based on the results of clinical features and findings of the CT scan and tissues, we diagnosed painful ophthalmoplegia secondary to nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasized to orbital apex and brain.","1647":"Pseudoexfoliation syndrome is characterized by the presence of gray-white flakes on the pupillary borders and anterior lens capsule, increased trabecular meshwork pigmentation, and association with glaucoma. We describe 3 patients with this syndrome seen at Asan Meidcal Center Department of Ophthalmology in 1989, and we focus on their clinical features and management. We believe that patients with this syndrome are not as rare in Korea as has been thought, judging by scant report of cases in the past.","1648":"This survey comparing the primary causes of eye disease and visual impairment between rural and urban areas was conducted from the beginning of February through May of 1989. The outcome of that research on 686 residents (1372 eyes) of Buan-Kun, Chunbuk, and 997 residents (1994 eyes) of Dobong-Ku, Seoul, is as follows: 1. Of the basic ocular affections, pterygium was the most prevalent in Baun-Kun with 178 eyes (13.0%), while allergic and chronic conjunctivitis were in the majority in Dobong-Ku with 170 eyes (8.5%). 2. In causes of visual impairment, refractive error showed to be the main one in both Buan-Kun with 135 eyes (9.8%) and Dobong-Ku with 132 eyes (6.6%). 3. In rate of blindness, Buan-Kun had 7.0% monocular blindness and 3.2% of binocular blindness, while 4.1% of monocular blindness and 1.7% of binocular blindness were found in Dobong-Ku. 4. In causes of blindness, cataract (51.1%) was followed by macular degeneration (17.4%), corneal opacity (13.0%), and vascular retinopathy (9.8%) in Buan-Kun, while cataract (56.0%), macular degeneration (6.7%), corneal opacity (6.7%), and phthisis (6.7%) were recorded in that order in Dobong-Ku.","1649":"Iris neovascularization was produced in rabbits by hypotony following repeated aspiration of the vitreous. The hypotony was produced after 0.3 ml of vitreous fluid was aspirated using a 25-gauge needle through the pars plana of 10 rabbits. For the histochemical study, horseradish peroxidase(HRP) was injected through the ear lobe vein. After fixation of the iris tissue, the tissue was treated with diaminobenzidine and examined with both light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The newly-formed vessel was abundant, particularly on the upper stroma of the iris. The new vessel formation was evident due to the proliferation of endothelial cells, which may have been derived from preexisting iris vessels. The endothelial cells of the newly-formed vessels revealed prominent villous processes into the vascular lumen, formation of the marginal flap, numerous fenestrations in the endothelial junction, and reaction product onto extravascular space by the cytochemical electron microscopy. These results suggest that hypotony in the rabbit produces the disruption of the blood-iris barrier and the balance between angiogenesis-antiangiogenesis modulation.","1650":"Topical fibronectin, autologous and homologous, was used to treat nine patients (eleven eyes) with persistent corneal epithelial defects and corneal ulcers that failed to improve with standard therapy. The fibronectin was purified from autologous and homologous plasma by gelatin-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography and administered topically, 500 micrograms\/ml five times a day, for three weeks. Complete or nearly complete reepithelialization was achieved in all patients regardless of the source of fibronectin, autologous or homologous. But healing times varied. The average healing time was 41.7 +\/- 14.7 days (35.7 +\/- 12.4 days for autologous, 50.8 +\/- 14.4 days for homologous). Ocular symptoms were relieved significantly, and no side effects were observed. Over an average follow-up period of 5.2 months, no recurrences were noted. The results showed that homologous, as well as autologous, fibronectin was effective in patients with persistent corneal epithelial defects and corneal ulcers.","1651":"One patient with bilateral acute retinal necrosis underwent encircling scleral buckle, vitrectomy, and intravitreal acyclovir on both eyes. This procedure was performed on the right eye while the retina was attached. The retina of the right eye was reattached by performing fluid-gas exchange and modified panretinal photocoagulation when the retina subsequently detached. Soon after the development of retinal detachment in the left eye, the above surgical procedures were performed on the left eye, and the retina was successfully reattached. Bilateral acute retinal necrosis with significant vitreous opacification, which is a devastating ocular disease causing possible blindness in both eyes, requires more aggressive, early surgical management.","1652":"The oscillatory potentials (OPs) in electroretinogram (ERG) have clinical values in measuring retinal functions of the early stage of diabetic retinopathy. However, OPs have, until now, been evaluated as components of total ERG recorded with a full field stimulus over the entire retina. Therefore, little information could be obtained about the macular condition (diabetic retinopathy). Using focal stimuli, we successfully recorded OPs in the human macular region. We modified our previously reported system for recording local macular ERG under the fundus monitor with an infrared television fundus camera. We evaluated macular OPs with simultaneously recorded a- and b-waves in many patients with diabetic retinopathy. In some kinds of early diabetic maculopathy, the macular OPs were selectively reduced, leaving the a- and b-waves intact. The macular OPs can be a valuable indicator in assessing the macular function in diabetic maculopathy.","1653":"Eighteen eyes with vitreous strands adherent to the corneoscleral wounds of previous cataract surgery were treated with neodymium: YAG laser to lyse those strands. Twelve eyes were treated for management of cystoid macular edema (CME group); six eyes were treated for prophylaxis of possible CME (prophylactic group). In the CME group, visual acuity improved two or more lines in nine eyes (75.0%), and seven eyes had a post laser visual acuity of 0.5 or better (One eye had a pre-treatment visual acuity of 0.5 or better). In the prophylactic group, visual acuity was either maintained at the pre-treatment visual acuity of 0.5 or better. In the prophylactic group, visual acuity was either maintained at the pre-treatment level or improved in five eyes (83.3%) 18 months later following laser treatment. This procedure was complicated by retinal detachment in one case and the elevation of intraocular pressure over 10 mmHg in another case.","1654":"We evaluated one of the new non-contact tonometers, the Pulsair non-contact tonometer, to assess its accuracy and reliability. Measurements on 101 eyes were used to assess its accuracy against Goldmann tonometry measurements, and another 24 eyes were used to assess its reliability (reproducibility). The results showed the instrument to be highly accurate and reliable in measurement.","1655":"The intraocular pressure and the anteroposterior length of the eye are of great clinical importance for the diagnosis and management, before and after surgery, of congenital glaucoma. It is well-known that normal intraocular pressure in children is different from the normal levels in adults. We performed measurements of intraocular pressure and axial length in 141 children who had been admitted for eye problems other than glaucoma. The intraocular pressures were measured with the Perkins hand-held applanation tonometer at the beginning of general anesthesia. Simultaneously, A-scan ultra-sound measurements of the axial lengths of the eyes were made. In 10 children under the age of two years, the intraocular pressure was 11.85 +\/- 1.35 mmHg. In 79 children from two to seven years, the intraocular pressure was 12.80 +\/- 1.73 mmHg. In 52 children from seven to 15 years, the intraocular pressure was 13.31 +\/- 1.79 mmHg. The axial lengths of the eyes in children under the age of two years, from two to seven years, and from seven to 15 years, were 21.31 +\/- 0.97 mm, 22.04 +\/- 0.92 mm, and 23.22 +\/- 1.00 mm, respectively. These results were considered to be guidelines for measuring intraocular pressure and axial length in children suspected of having congenital glaucoma. The differences of intraocular pressures stated by other authors are due to early measurement of the intraocular pressure at the beginning of general anesthesia.","1656":"To evaluate its clinical efficacy, we report the results of Armaly central field screening test in comparison with those of central 30-2 threshold test of Humphrey Field Analyzer. In 83 cases of normotensives, ocular hypertensives, and glaucoma patients with open-angle or narrow-angle enrolled in this study, a total of 143 eyes were examined. Fifty-four out of 61 patients (88.5%) and 73 out of 81 eyes (90.1%) with visual field defects were detected by the Humphrey Field Analyzer screening test. Eight eyes out of 81(9.9%) with visual field defects detected by the screening test were confirmed as false positive. All points of false positive were solitary, which tended to occur more frequently on superior visual field. A false negative of eight eyes out of 62 (12.9%) detected by the screening test was confirmed by the threshold test, which was more frequent on superior field and shown to be located more peripherally from the fixation point. There was no significant difference in either central sensitivity or age of the false positive and negative.","1657":"Perimetric tests were performed on 32 ocular hypertensive eyes (17 patients) with the C-30-2 threshold program of the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer. The global indices of 32 ocular hypertensive eyes were compared with those of 34 normal eyes (17 controls). None of the 34 normal eyes had visual field sensitivity loss. However, three out of 32 ocular hypertensive eyes, which is 0.4%, had visual field sensitivity loss. Of these three eyes, two eyes showed generalized depression (MD, P less than 5%) and one eye showed paracentral scotoma.","1658":"To elucidate the mechanism of increased intraocular pressure in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), the protein profiles of aqueous humor obtained from POAG patients were compared with those of cataract patients as a control group. Aqueous humor proteins were analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and detected by the ultrasensitive silver staining technique. In 79% of the samples taken from POAG patients, protein bands of 140,000 or 160,000 daltons were stained, but none were stained from cataract patients. The presence of these protein bands revealed statistically significant differences between the two groups. Protein bands of 140,000 or 160,000 daltons were evenly visible at all ages in POAG patients, and the positivity of bands had no correlation with sex or initial intraocular pressure level. It is possible that the ultrastructural changes of the aqueous outflow pathway in POAG may be related to the changes in the aqueous protein, presence of 140,000 or 160,000 daltons protein bands.","1659":"Tissue plasminogen activator(tPA) is a fibrin-specific fibrinolytic agent that has recently been shown to be effective in accelerating the clearance of hyphema. Intravitreal injection of tPA can promote rapid lysis of experimental intravitreal fibrin clots. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of intravitreal tPA injection for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage in normal phakic non-vitrectomized rabbit eyes. Vitreous hemorrhages were produced by intravitreal injections of 0.05 ml of autologous whole blood in 25 rabbit eyes with intact vitreous. The injection of 25 or 100 micrograms of tPA in 15 eyes resulted in the clearance of vitreous hemorrhage in 99 +\/- 19 or 34 +\/- 6.5 days, respectively. This was significantly faster than in the control eyes in which the clearance was not seen until 131 +\/- 17 days later. No tractional retinal detachment was observed.","1660":"We implanted sulcus-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lenses (PCL) in three cataractous, six aphakic, and four eyes during penetrating keratoplasty due to corneal opacity in the absence of capsular and zonular support. This technique has been successfully performed in all cases and produced good visual outcome in 12 eyes (93%). In four eyes which had penetrating keratoplasty and the fixation of PCL, one developed vitreous hemorrhage and one developed corneal graft rejection.","1661":"A study on the pathologic findings after recession and resection of extraocular muscles in rabbits was performed. Fibrosis of the extraocular muscles increased with time, which showed no difference between the recessed and resected muscles. Inflammation and foreign body reaction decreased with time, which showed no difference between the recessed and resected muscles. Adhesions of extraocular muscles to the sclera were observed from one month after the operation. The resected muscles showed milder adhesion to the sclera than the recessed ones. The operated extraocular muscles showed atrophies at one month, which showed no difference between the recessed and resected muscles. According to our results, when reoperation is needed, fibrosis of the extraocular muscles after recession and resection should be considered when making a decision on the amount of muscle to be recessed and resected.","1662":null,"1663":"After the first description of epikeratoplasty for the correction of aphakia by Kaufman in 1980, the application of epikeratoplasty has been extended further to the treatment of keratoconus and high myopia. Six epikeratoplasty for five eyes of high myopia and one eye of keratoconus were performed and followed up for an average of 4.9 months. All cases improved their uncorrected visual acuity, and the preoperative best corrected visual acuity improved or had no change postoperatively except for one case. In the cases of high myopia, the mean preoperative spherical equivalent of -19.4 D was corrected to an average -0.23 D with a range of -1.0 D to +2.5 D postoperatively. In the case of keratoconus, there was a mean decrease in 12.0 D of myopia in terms of the spherical equivalent, and the cornea was flattened by over 8 D in keratometry readings.","1664":"The advantages of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are its sensitivity and its accuracy in detecting and measuring immunoglobulin classes. By ELISA, the tear IgA level was measured in 165 healthy persons. Tears were collected by a strong absorbent (Weck Cel). This is the first report of a tear IgA level in normal Koreans measured by ELISA. The mean level was 60.5 +\/- 23.4 mg\/dl. There was no statistically significant difference between the IgA level in the males (61.8 +\/- 23.2 mg\/dl) and that of the females (58.4 +\/- 23.5 mg\/dl)(p greater than 0.05). The difference between the tear IgA levels in the various age groups was not significant (p greater than 0.05).","1665":"Cyclodialysis and ciliochoroidal detachment were performed in three eyes of three rabbits and in three eyes of another three rabbits, respectively. After aspiration of the aqueous humor, 0.1 ml of 10% sodium fluorescein was injected intracamerally, and the eyeball was enucleated between 30 minutes and one hour after injection and prepared for fluorescence microscopy. Sodium fluorescein concentrations in the supraciliary space were much greater in the group with cyclodialysis or ciliochoroidal detachment than in the normal control group. These results suggest that (1) in the eye with cyclodialysis, the aqueous humor may freely gain access to the supraciliary space through the cleft between the anterior chamber and the supraciliary space and then be removed rapidly and (2) in the eye with ciliochoroidal detachment, the aqueous humor may pass through the uveoscleral outflow pathway.","1666":"Under the postulation that the double Ruiz procedure could increase the effect of radial keratotomy (RK), RK combined with horizontal and vertical Ruiz procedure was performed in three groups of 22 rabbit eyes. In the group A of six eyes, RK with vertical Ruiz procedure was performed, and eight weeks later horizontal Ruiz procedure was added. In the group B of eight eyes, RK with horizontal Ruiz procedure was performed, and four weeks later vertical Ruiz procedure was added. In the group C of eight eyes, RK with horizontal and vertical Ruiz procedure was performed simultaneously. As a control, in the group D of eight eyes, RK without Ruiz procedure performed. Changes in keratometry for four weeks and eight weeks postoperatively were analyzed. The results were as follows: 1. At eight weeks postoperatively, mean changes in keratometry were 6.434D, 3.663D, 4.030D and 1.585D in groups A, B, C and D, respectively. 2. Mean changes in keratometry of groups A, B and C were significantly higher than that of group D. 3. Mean changes in keratometry of 6.434D in group A was significantly the highest of the three groups in which double Ruiz procedure was performed. For the above results, it was concluded that double Ruiz procedure increased the effect of RK, and the procedure was more effective when the secondary Ruiz procedure was added eight weeks later.","1667":"Recently iridectomy using an argon or Nd-YAG laser to treat narrow angle glaucoma has become popular, and is now the procedure of choice over the standard surgical technique. However, the shock wave of the Nd-YAG laser causes hemorrhage in almost all cases and the high energy level of the Nd-YAG laser, which is required for iridectomy, causes injury to the lens and cornea. Furthermore, there is a tendency toward closure of the iridectomy site after argon laser application. We performed iridectomies by a combined application of argon and Nd-YAG lasers in pigmented rabbits to improve iris bleeding, iridectomy patency, and lens and corneal damage. The iridectomy patency and the lens and corneal damage were examined with a scanning electron microscope. The rabbits that underwent laser iridectomies with only the Nd-YAG laser were used as a control group. Based on the results, it can be concluded that laser iridectomy by a combined application of argon and Nd-YAG lasers results in a lower rate of bleeding, a higher rate of patency, and less damage to the lens and cornea as compared with iridectomy performed by Nd-YAG laser only.","1668":"Transverse incision astigmatic keratotomy procedures were performed, combined with radial keratotomy, in 16 eyes for correction of astigmatism and coexisting myopia. We used a transverse incision technique in which T-incisions vertically intersected radial incisions of the steepest corneal meridian. After a mean follow-up period of 10 months with a range of six to 27 months, an average 1.92 diopters of the cylinder was corrected. In comparison with 2.11 diopters of the cylinder corrected at postoperative one day, there was a 22.8% decrease in the effect of astigmatism correction after a postoperative period averaging 10 months.","1669":"The effects of hemocoagulase in injectable form (hemocoagulating enzymatic fraction of South American snake Bothrops jararaca venom provided by Ravizza) on the control of intraocular bleeding during vitreous surgery were evaluated in rabbit eyes. Intraocular infusion solution with hemocoagulase (1 NIH thrombin unit\/100 ml of BSS plus) significantly reduced the bleeding time. Electroretinogram b-wave and electroretinogram c-wave showed no abnormality. Infusate with hemocoagulase (1 NIH thrombin unit\/100 ml of BSS plus) is not toxic to retinal tissue and appeared to be a useful agent for the control of intraocular bleeding during vitreous surgery.","1670":"During the period from July to August 1987, the microbial flora in conjunctival sac of 93 newborns (186 eyes: normal vaginal delivery) and 19 newborns (38 eyes: cesarean section delivery) in nursery of Ewha Womans University Hospital were investigated for isolation and identification of bacteria on delivery day and on two days after birth. The results of the investigation are as follows: 1. Of 186 eyes (normal vaginal delivery), bacterial growth of one species was shown in 40 eyes (21.5%) on delivery day and in 64 eyes (34.4%) on two days after birth. Bacterial growth of two species shown in 10 eyes (5.4%) on delivery day and in 10 eyes (5.4%) on two days after birth. 2. Of 38 eyes (cesarean section delivery), bacterial growth of one species was shown in 2 eyes (5.3%) on delivery day and in 20 eyes (52.6%) on two days after birth. Bacterial growth of two species was shown 2 eyes (5.3%) on two days after birth. 3. Several kinds of bacterial species were isolated in normal vaginal delivery and cesarean section delivery. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus were isolated.","1671":null,"1672":"The possibility that patients with infantile nystagmus achieve spatial constancy by sampling the visual scene only during certain range of velocities or certain phases of their nystagmus cycle was investigated by asking patients to detect a flashed test target that was presented repeatedly during all phases of the nystagmus cycle. After observing a 543 nm fixation spot projected on a diffusely illuminated tangent screen 1 m in front of the eye, patients were asked to detect a 2 msec test flash of the spot, now locked to the retina, that occurred 200 msec after the fixation spot was extinguished. The test target appeared randomly at 3,6,9, or 12 o'clock at, in separate trials, 0.8 deg or 10.0 deg from central vision. To avoid forcing patients from guessing a direction cued by the disappearance of the fixation spot, sometimes the flash did not occur at all. To avoid dark adaptation in our patients, the diffuse background illumination was adjusted to the brightest level allowing easy detection of the test flash. In every condition, all patients reported the fixation spot stationary. The probability of detection was the same across all velocity ranges. Remarkably, patients were just as likely to detect the test flash when the eye was nearly stationary even when it was moving more than 100 deg\/sec. In one patient, the background illumination was raised so that he began missing the test flash more often. Here too, the probability of detection, now reduced to about 50%, was the same across velocity ranges.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1673":"Many surgeons have noted that when the visual field is markedly constricted, immediate and permanent loss of central vision may follow otherwise successful glaucoma surgery. The present study was undertaken to assess the relative risk of surgical therapy in the loss of central vision in patients with advanced glaucoma. We reviewed the records of 44 eyes (including 8 macular split eyes) of 36 patients who had undergone trabeculectomy for intraocular pressure (IOP) control. The patients were followed for a minimum of 4 months with an average follow-up of 4.1 years. None of the patient suddenly lost visual field following surgery when central vision was spared at the time of operation. There was good preservation of preoperative visual acuity except in 3 eyes which developed lens opacity. There was no progression of visual field loss when the IOP was controlled below 21 mmHg. There was good control of IOP of 43 eyes in 44 eyes operated. However, in one of the 2 reoperated eyes, we could not control the IOP below 21 mmHg.","1674":"The purpose of this study was to compare corneal wound healing between suture and sutureless lamellar keratoplasty in the rabbit eye. The tissue adhesive (Tisseel, Vienna) a commercially available two component adhesive system based on human fibrinogen, which is activated by thrombin, was used. 8.0mm half-thickness lamellar keratoplasties (autotransplants) were performed on the twenty-four rabbit eyes with tissue adhesive and the other eyes were operated with 10-0 nylon continuous suture as a control, respectively. At varying periods postoperatively, they were killed and the eyes were immediately enucleated and examined by transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy. The procedure was completed by the application of a bandage soft contact lens. Seventy-one percent of the glued lamellar keratoplasty grafts were retained and in six eyes, focal white opacities at the bed and graft interface were noted. There was no change in corneal contour, with the only irregularity being at the graft\/host junction in the tissue adhesive group. Histopathologic examination of the glued eyes demonstrated the presence of a layer of eosinophilic material between the corneal bed and the lamellar graft but a minimal inflammatory response was observed in the early postoperative days. At fourteen days the adhesive was no longer visible and at three weeks, the graft was well healed. We believe that this study indicates a potential adjunctive role for tissue adhesive in corneal wound healing.","1675":"Cryotherapy is implicated for inducing or aggravating proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) by releasing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. These are based on the fact that PVR rarely occurs in a non-operated eye, and many of the PVR patients have received cryotherapy during surgery. Nonetheless, eyes with diathermy also developed PVR, and although there have been many experiments, the effect of cryotherapy on inducing PVR has not been proven experimentally in the living eye. We made retinal tears in living rabbit eyes, and applied cryotherapy on one eye of each rabbit. The result was compared histologically with the contralateral noncryothermized control eye. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups concerning the migration of RPE, and the proliferation of RPE. Although the formation of an epiretinal membrane was more obvious in the cryothermized group, the difference was not statistically significant.","1676":"Thirty patients of vernal conjunctivitis were divided into two groups as 'A' and 'B'. A group received the aspirin and cromoglycate 2% eye drops and the B group received cromoglycate eye drops. The results attained the group who received the aspirin and cromoglycate shown encouraging results and the details discussed in the full text.","1677":"Antibacterial effect of tetracaine hydrochloride was studied. Tetracaine hydrochloride (preservative free) were incubated with Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respectively, for 18 hours and for 2 minutes. Then it was diluted and cultured on nutrient agar plate. Colony counts were done after 18 hours. In case of 18 hours incubation, there was no growth of microbials in 0.5%, 0.1% tetracaine hydrochloride, but there was no inhibitory effect of 0.02% tetracaine hydrochloride on growth of microbials, irrespective of inoculum amount. In case of 2 minutes incubation with 0.5% tetracaine hydrochloride, there was no difference between the amount of microbial inoculum and colony count. Above indicates that tetracaine hydrochloride has no inhibitory effect on bacterial growth after short exposure of less than 2 minutes.","1678":"","1679":"","1680":"","1681":"","1682":"","1683":"","1684":"","1685":"","1686":"","1687":"","1688":"","1689":"","1690":"","1691":"","1692":"","1693":"","1694":"","1695":"","1696":"","1697":"","1698":"","1699":"","1700":"","1701":"","1702":"","1703":"","1704":"","1705":"","1706":"","1707":"","1708":"","1709":"","1710":"","1711":"","1712":"","1713":"","1714":"","1715":"","1716":"","1717":"","1718":"","1719":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Author
