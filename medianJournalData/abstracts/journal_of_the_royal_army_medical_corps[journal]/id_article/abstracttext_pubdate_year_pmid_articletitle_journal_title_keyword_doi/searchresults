A text mining analysis of the titles of all published articles in the JRAMC between 1903 and 2019 was performed. The most commonly used terms were identified and their relative frequency over the decades analysed to identify trends. Article content and contemporary events were compared with the observed trends to identify explanatory events and themes of interest. Medical topics of interest centred around specific infectious diseases, particularly during the early\/mid-20th century, and trauma and battle injury. The medical specialties of surgery, anaesthetics and mental health were all well represented in nearly all decades, while primary care only came to prominence as a named specialty from the 1960s onwards. India, France, Egypt and wider Africa were the most commonly cited geographical regions, although there were spikes of interest associated with specific conflicts in the Falklands, Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq. The interests of the JRAMC have changed considerably over the years primarily driven by the geopolitical interests of Britain-in particular its colonial interests and the conflicts it has been involved in, but also by medical advances seen in contemporary society.

Predisaster host nation medical care relied on casevac for basic primary and secondary healthcare, with medivac by air for advanced medical treatment. Disruption to facilities and transport links by Hurricane Irma rendered the native healthcare system on its knees. During Op RUMAN, the Royal Air Force Medical Services (RAFMS) provided expertise in prehospital emergency care and critical care aeromed to enable emergency treatment and access to definitive care for local nationals and our own personnel. The ability to provide independent, safe aeromedical care across a variety of aviation platforms is unique to the RAFMS. The AO did not fit any current doctrine; an adaptable, functional unit concept was adopted to enable care to the walking wounded through to critical care along prolonged timelines.","6":"","7":"Operation RUMAN was the British government's combined military and humanitarian operations in September 2017 to provide relief to the British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean affected by Hurricane Irma. The Ministry of Defence (MoD), in conjunction with the Department for International Development, produced a tangible effect by the delivery of healthcare and a response to a humanitarian disaster with very little time for planning. The rescue element was accomplished within days but this was followed swiftly by a recovery phase requiring a 'whole force approach', with additional assets from non-governmental organisations and the private sector. The aim of this article is to provide information on the role of the Defence Medical Services on behalf of the MoD, and other departmental organisations in achieving the mission of providing medical and logistical support for these British Overseas Territories.","8":null,"9":"Food and catering and its impact on health and life satisfaction of coalition soldiers during their deployment on a military operation in the Middle East area was the aim of our research.

Although working in great secrecy, the UK military, and Porton in particular, did not operate in a social, political and legal vacuum. Paradigm shifts in civilian medical ethics, or public controversy about atomic, chemical and biological weapons, could thus influence Porton's self-perception and the conduct of its research. The paper argues that the creation of the first REC at Porton in 1965, that is, the ABC, as the ' father confessor ' inside the UK's military research establishment reflected a broader paradigm shift in the field of human research ethics in the mid-1960s.","11":"Part I provides the historiographical context and examines the causes which led to the creation of the first independent research ethics committee (REC) at Porton Down, Britain's biological and chemical warfare establishment, in operation since the First World War. The papers in part I and part II argue that the introduction of RECs in the UK stemmed from concerns about legal liability and research ethics among scientists responsible for human experiments, and from the desire of the UK military medical establishment to create an external organisation which would function both as an ' internal space ' for ethical debate and as an ' external body ' to share moral and legal responsibility. The paper asks: What factors were responsible for causing military scientists and government officials to contemplate the introduction of formalised structures for ethical review within the UK military? It argues that Porton may have been exempt from public scrutiny, but it was not above the law of the land. By the mid-1960s evidence of serious ill effects among staff members and service personnel involved in tests could no longer be ignored. Whereas the security of the British realm had previously trumped almost any other argument in contentious debates about chemical warfare, the role of medical ethics suddenly moved to the forefront of Porton's deliberations, so much so that tests with incapacitants were temporarily suspended in 1965. It was this crisis, examined in detail in part II, which functioned as a catalyst for the creation of the Applied Biology Committee as the responsible body, and first point of call, for authorising human experiments at Porton Down.","12":null,"13":"Increases in the number of women in critical positions on military missions place new demands for specialised healthcare services to promote performance.

In case of many victims, to respect the golden hour rule, first-line sorting is essential. Through simulation situations, the aim of our study was to assess whether the use of ultrasound was useful to military doctors. In combat-like exercise conditions, we provided trainees with a pocket-size ultrasound. Every patient for whom the trainees chose to perform ultrasound in role 1 was included. An extended focused assessment with sonography for trauma (E-FAST) was performed with six basic sonographic views. We evaluated whether these reference views were obtained or not. Once obtained by the trainees, pathological views corresponding to the scenario were shown to assess whether the trainees modified their therapeutic management strategy and their priorities. 168 patients were treated by 15 different trainee doctors. Of these 168 patients, ultrasound (E-FAST or point-of-care ultrasound) was performed on 44 (26%) of them. In 51% (n=20\/39) of the situations, the practitioners considered that the realisation of ultrasound had a significant impact in terms of therapeutic and evacuation priorities. More specifically, it changed therapeutic decisions in 67% of time (n=26\/39) and evacuation priorities in 72% of time (n=28\/39). This original work showed that ultrasound on the battlefield was possible and useful. To confirm these results, ultrasound needs to be democratised and assessed in a real operational environment.

The article begins by describing the distinction between biomedical enhancements and interventions intended to prevent, treat or mitigate disease. It then sets forth three principles to guide the ethical use of bioenhancements-proportionality, paternalism and fairness. The article applies these principles to concerns raised by military bioenhancement: safety, fairness in access to military reward, carryover effects to civilian life, whether service members can be ordered to use bioenhancements and when they may be permitted to do so voluntarily.","18":"In September 2017, the British Government called on the military to deliver aid and provide assistance to British Overseas Territories in the Caribbean affected by the devastating category 5 Hurricane, Irma.1 The military and humanitarian operation, named Op RUMAN, saw British military personnel from all services deploy at short notice to assess damage, reinstate vital infrastructure and help islanders get back on their feet as quickly as possible.

Considering the complexity of the multilayer insult and damage control care in an unstable patient, every procedure performed should promptly benefit the patient. We report an illustrative case of a patient with a gunshot wound to the head that resulted in a CCW for which we applied vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy according to damage control principles. We describe the technical approach and discuss the indications, results and technique by considering the literature available. VAC can be used for CCWs, particularly for large defects in selected patients according to clinical and CT evaluations following immediate resuscitation. In severely injured and unstable patients, VAC aims to delay definitive reconstructive and time-consuming treatment. Interestingly, it appears to be a safe treatment based on the previously described-but not exclusively trauma-cases with no secondary cerebrospinal fluid leakage encountered.","20":"","21":"A 34-year-old female soldier presented with fever and behavioural changes while deployed in Kenya and was diagnosed with encephalitis. The patient underwent urgent aeromedical evacuation to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham for further management. Microbiology tests excluded common infectious causes that are endemic in the East Africa region. However, an autoantibody screen was positive for antibodies against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). Full body imaging confirmed the presence of limbic encephalitis and an ovarian mass suggestive of a teratoma. The patient was diagnosed with ovarian teratoma-associated anti-NMDAR encephalitis, a potentially fatal disease. The patient underwent surgery to remove the teratoma and commenced immunotherapy with steroids, plasma exchange and rituximab. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of fever with behavioural changes in military personnel deployed in a tropical environment.","22":"Within military operations, military physicians and nurses experience a dual loyalty to their professional identities. The moral frameworks of the medical and military professions are not similar, and require different kinds of choices and action from its members. But above all, the legal framework in which the healthcare personnel has to operate while deployed is different from the medical moral standards. Military necessity is prioritised over medical necessity. In debates on dual loyalty, legal frameworks should be considered as a more decisive factor in ethical decision-making processes. Legal frameworks, both general and mission-specific, support this prioritisation of military necessity, complicating the work of military physicians and nurses. During the post-Cold War era, in which neutrality and moral supremacy have served as legitimising factors for military peacekeeping or humanitarian missions, this misalignment between the moral and the legal framework is problematic. What is legally correct or justifiable may not be morally acceptable to either the medical professional standards or to the general public. The legal framework should be given more prominence within the debates on dual loyalty and military medical ethics. This paper argues that the misalignment between the legal and moral framework in which deployed healthcare personnel has had to operate complicated ethical decision-making processes, impeded their agency, and created problems ranging from military operational issues to personal trauma and moral injury for the people involved, and ultimately decreasing the legitimacy of the armed forces within society.","23":"Exercise CAMBRIAN PATROL is an internationally recognised, arduous patrolling exercise held annually in Mid-South Wales.

We review the relevant anatomy and pathophysiology of long thoracic nerve injury and discuss management strategies of scapular winging. Occupational health considerations are reviewed, with respect to carrying large amounts of weight over distance and difficult terrain within the armed forces, along with discussion of a novel weight distribution system (VIRTUS) which has recently been brought into service by the British Army.","24":"This paper considers the manifestation and treatment of psychological trauma in the military. The article describes how military psychologists conceptualise psychological trauma within the culture of the Armed Forces (AF), which is reflected in the process of acquiring what has been referred to as cultural competency. Psychologists in this context acquire an understanding of the manner in which the psychological and organisational systems and culture of the military affect the presentation of psychological trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The paper outlines core psychological features of military life, including some of the ways in which the AF functions effectively as an adaptable fighting force. This highlights, for example, the potential for stigma within and between military personnel who experience mental health difficulties. The article proceeds to examine aspects of help-seeking in military mental healthcare, how symptoms can present at different stages in a deployment process, and the consequences that such problems can cause for military conduct and performance. Psychological care in the military is structured within an occupational mental health ethos, in which psychologists fulfil a range of clinical, organisational and leadership roles. These dynamics are explored with examples of care pathways and clarity on evidence-based interventions for trauma and PTSD in those experiencing military-related psychological injuries. Two vignettes are then offered to illustrate how some of these interventions can be used psychotherapeutically in addressing symptoms pertaining to hyperarousal, hypervigilance, guilt and shame.","25":"A 25-year-old infantry soldier, who was previously fit and well, had a cardiac arrest while undertaking an advanced fitness test.

A postmortem performed by an expert pathologist and a toxicology screen were normal and the death was attributed to sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS). Screening of his family in our Inherited Cardiac Conditions clinic identified Brugada syndrome (BrS) in two first-degree relatives. This case generates discussion on sudden cardiac death, family screening in SADS, BrS and the limitations of recruit screening with an ECG.","26":"Moral theory should be practically useful, but without oversight from the philosophical community, the practical application of ethics by other institutions such as the military may drift into forms that are not theoretically robust. Ethical approaches that drift in this way run the risk of becoming 'cargo cults': simulations that will never properly fulfil their intended purpose. The four quadrant approach, a systematic method of ethical analysis that applies moral principles to clinical cases, has gained popularity in the last 10 years in a variety of medical contexts, especially the military. This paper considers whether the four quadrant approach is a cargo cult or whether it has theoretical value, with particular reference to the more popular four principles approach. This analysis concludes that the four quadrant approach has theoretical advantages over the four principles approach, if used in the right way (namely, with all four quadrants being used). The principal advantage is that the four quadrant approach leaves more room for clinical judgement, and thus avoids the charge of being too algorithmic, which has been levelled at the four principles approach. I suggest that it is the fourth quadrant, which invites the user to consider wider, contextual features of the case, which gives the approach this key advantage. Finally, I make a more general proposal that theoretical ethicists should work closely with those practitioners who apply ethics in the world, and I call for a symbiotic relationship between these two camps.","27":"","28":"This paper describes the first ever analysis of health data to report influenza vaccine uptake and the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing general practice presentations for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the UK Armed Forces (UK AF). This was undertaken during the 2017-2018 influenza season. Clinical Read codes for ILI and influenza vaccinations were used to generate reports for the period from September 2017 to April 2018. Using a methodology adapted from Public Health England's (PHE) in hours syndromic surveillance, the ILI rate for the UK AF was calculated. Subsequent analysis explored vaccination uptake in target groups and compared the relative risk (RR) of ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated Service Personnel (SP). 4234 SPs had a record of ILI between September 2017 and April 2018, with a peak rate of 216 cases per 100 000 PAR. The absolute risk reduction for reporting ILI in vaccinated versus unvaccinated SP was 0.4% (p=0.0031), and the RR was statistically significant at 15% (95% CI 5% to 23 %) lower than in the non-vaccinated PAR. The number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one presentation of ILI was 241 (95% CI 145 to 714). The 8153 vaccinations recorded for the untrained strength equate to approximately 38% of overall training throughput and 65% of all Army SP recorded as being in phase 1 training at some point during this period. The relative risk reduction (RRR) for vaccinated personnel was modest and lower than reported elsewhere, but closely compares with ILI rates included in a 2018 Cochrane review. The small RRR and large NNV do not support widening the population of UK AF eligible to receive influenza vaccine. Regimental Medical Officers (RMOs) seeking advice on whether to vaccinate other groups of SP should be aware that this approach offers questionable clinical benefit. The ILI surveillance methodology used in this work could be adapted for syndromic surveillance of other infectious diseases. ","29":"The long-standing debate on medical complicity in torture has overlooked the complicity of cognitive scientists-psychologists, psychiatrists and neuroscientists-in the practice of torture as a distinct phenomenon. In this paper, we identify the risk of the re-emergence of torture as a practice in the USA, and the complicity of cognitive scientists in these practices. We review arguments for physician complicity in torture. We argue that these defences fail to defend the complicity of cognitive scientists. We address objections to our account, and then provide recommendations for professional associations in resisting complicity in torture. Arguments for cognitive scientist complicity in torture fail when those actions stem from the same reasons as physician complicity. Cognitive scientist involvement in the torture programme has, from the outset, been focused on the outcomes of interrogation rather than supportive care. Any possibility of a therapeutic relationship between cognitive therapists and detainees is fatally undermined by therapists' complicity with torture. Professional associations ought to strengthen their commitment to refraining from engaging in any aspect of torture. They should also move to protect whistle-blowers against torture programmes who are members of their association. If the political institutions that are supposed to prevent the practice of torture are not strengthened, cognitive scientists should take collective action to compel intelligence agencies to refrain from torture.

The aim of the Department is to equip officer cadets with the skills, knowledge and personal qualities in order for them to develop their own potential, as both individuals and leaders in the British Army. The members of the Department have a range of backgrounds, with most having served in various capacities across UK Defence, both in uniformed and\/or civilian crown servant contexts. Several members of the faculty are qualified psychologists, while others have related academic and professional backgrounds. The academic and applied discipline of psychology is the fundamental thread that runs through the various courses and projects delivered by the Department. This paper provides a brief overview of the activities undertaken by the Department, with a specific focus on the psychology components of the academic and applied activities. Although mainly serving in academic teaching roles, this paper illustrates the work of the psychologists outside the classroom, such as via field exercises and deployments overseas. It also touches on the importance of the outreach undertaken by the psychologists in the Department, which supports their ongoing research.","32":"Military medical ethics has been challenged by the post-11 September 2001 'War on Terror'. Two recurrent questions are whether military physicians are officers first or physicians first, and whether military physicians need a separate code of ethics. In this article, we focus on how the War on Terror has affected the way we have addressed these questions since 2001. Two examples frame this discussion: the use of military physicians to force-feed hunger strikers held in Guantanamo Bay prison camp, and the uncertain fate of the Department of Defense's report on 'Ethical Guidelines and Practices for US Military Medical Professionals'.","33":"Military personnel can experience psychosexual difficulties for a variety of reasons. Problems can arise because of psychological trauma, physical injury, consequences arising from pharmacological and surgical complications and social or emotional concerns relating to intrapersonal and interpersonal relationship dynamics. Such individuals might seek to minimise or avoid resolving their pertinent difficulties, while others can experience cultural, personal or organisational barriers to accessing professional help. This paper offers an overview of the development of a national specialist psychosexual therapy service (PST), commenting specifically on the service delivery for male military personnel. It will also consider factors which may support progress in treatment and reflect upon the importance of considering psychosexual functioning in relationships as part of the broader service-life context, which is especially relevant to military personnel.","34":"","35":"","36":"Poor mental health in the perinatal period is associated with a number of adverse outcomes for the individual and the wider family. The unique circumstances in which military spouses\/partners live may leave them particularly vulnerable to developing perinatal mental health (PMH) problems. A scoping review was carried out to review the literature pertaining to PMH in military spouses\/partners using the methodology outlined by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). Databases searched included EBSCO, Gale Cengage Academic OneFile, ProQuest and SAGE. Thirteen papers fulfilled the inclusion criteria, all from the USA, which looked a PMH or well-being in military spouses. There was a strong focus on spousal deployment as a risk factor for depressive symptoms and psychological stress during the perinatal period. Other risk factors included a lack of social\/emotional support and increased family-related stressors. Interventions for pregnant military spouses included those that help them develop internal coping strategies and external social support. US literature suggests that military spouses are particularly at risk of PMH problems during deployment of their serving partner and highlights the protective nature of social support during this time. Further consideration needs to be made to apply the findings to UK military spouses\/partners due to differences in the structure and nature of the UK and US military and healthcare models. Further UK research is needed, which would provide military and healthcare providers with an understanding of the needs of this population allowing effective planning and strategies to be commissioned and implemented.

Despite significant challenges and a relatively suboptimal start line position, the Operation was a success from a medical perspective, with lower than expected dNBI rates. This paper, written from the medical Operational in-Theatre HQ perspective, charts the phases of Operation RUMAN during Planning, Execution and Recovery. It examines the context and lessons that arose from the Operation RUMAN that could inform future fast-moving Humanitarian Aid and Disaster Relief Operations.","38":"A case of panfacial trauma is reported comprising of multiple facial fractures and a clearly evident Guerin's sign along with an oronasal communication.

Increasingly, these events occur in the civilian domain, and can potentially lead to injury and loss of life, on a very large scale. The environment at the time of detonation is known to result in different injury patterns in casualties exposed to blast, which is highly relevant to injury mitigation analyses. We describe differences in pelvic injury patterns in relation to different environments, from casualties that presented to the deployed UK military hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. A casualty on foot when injured typically sustains an unstable pelvic fracture pattern, which is commonly the cause of death. These casualties die from blood loss, meaning treatment in these should focus on early pelvic haemorrhage control. In contrast, casualties injured in vehicle present a different pattern, possibly caused by direct loading via the seat, which does not result in pelvic instability. Fatalities in this cohort are from injuries to other body regions, in particular the head and the torso and who may require urgent neurosurgery or thoracotomy as life-saving interventions. A different strategy is therefore required for mounted and dismounted casualties in order to increase survivors.","40":"Psychological injury has been associated with military service, and this can result in a variety of mental health symptoms and disorders. A range of barriers to help-seeking have been identified in the military and mental health services have sought to address such factors through effective and efficient care and consultation.

For example, it is still unclear which animal species is most similar to humans in terms of physiology of blood coagulation. To improve transferability and raise awareness of the existing differences, we compared human coagulation to coagulation of different animals. Rotational thromboelastometry was used to analyse the blood of pigs, sheep, rabbits and dogs. Animal data were compared with human coagulation based on the number of significant differences of the test parameters and on a descriptive comparison of the extent of relative deviation of the single values. All animal species showed significant differences in coagulation properties when compared with humans. Coagulation parameters of dogs and sheep were on average most similar to humans. However, there is no animal which is most similar to humans concerning all aspects of coagulation. Differences in coagulation between humans and animals are significant. This must be taken into account when transferring animal test data to humans.","44":"When militaries mention loyalty as a value they mean loyalty to colleagues and the organisation. Loyalty to principle, the type of loyalty that has a wider scope, plays hardly a role in the ethics of most armed forces. Where military codes, oaths and values are about the organisation and colleagues, medical ethics is about providing patient care impartially. Being subject to two diverging professional ethics can leave military medical personnel torn between the wish to act loyally towards colleagues, and the demands of a more outward looking ethic. This tension constitutes a test of integrity, not a moral dilemma.","45":"The Defence Clinical Psychology Service (DCPS) is the professional clinical psychology service and community of clinical psychology practice within UK Ministry of Defence (MoD).

These studies have used biological and cognitive markers of sustained attention and the human stress response, before and after training, in the period prior to deployment and made assertions of effectiveness on this basis. Progress has similarly been made in applying versions of mindfulness meditation to veteran patient groups with several difficult-to-treat conditions, to combat high dropout from services when little patient choice is offered. In short, a case has been made for offering mindfulness interventions as a further treatment option in combination with other approaches to maximise engagement with mental health services. Meanwhile, within the mindfulness literature more and more focus has been placed on ways to improve treatment fidelity and enhance teacher competency, and investment in teacher training is seen as essential for successful outcomes in any controlled trial.","47":"General Practice training in the civilian and military environments follows a common training pathway, yet the scope of practice of a military General Practitioner (GP) varies significantly. A level of care for the acutely unwell and traumatically injured patients is frequently provided in austere environments remotely located from definitive medical care. This qualitative service needs evaluation scopes current level of trauma and acute care training and requirement for further training within military GPs and GP trainees. The transition to contingency operations increases the likelihood of medical officers being deployed to remote, austere locations, and it remains important to be fully skilled to manage any acute medical or trauma situation. The aim of this project is to identify how to maintain skills in prehospital and acute care within the military general practice. The specific objectives are (1) to assess the current level of training and experience across military GPs and military GP trainees in the domain of prehospital and acute competencies; (2) to assess satisfaction with the current level of training in these domains; (3) to assess the current deficiencies in training in this domain; and (4) to suggest possible changes or enhancements to the current military GP training pathway. Qualitative data was collected using a combination of focus groups and semistructured interviews. An initial focus group gathered codes and concepts. A topic guide generated from the initial focus group informed six semistructured interviews. A final focus group was used for validation purposes. Data were analysed using the constructivist grounded theory approach. Concurrent observational data were also collected from military and civilian courses pertinent to the research topic. Focus groups (n=2, total participants=14) and semistructured interviews (n=6) suggest that military GPs and trainees feel their level of trauma and acute care training generally diminishes over time, with significant interservice variation, and is of generally a lower level than desired. Qualified GPs suggest that maintaining clinical currency in prehospital emergency care (PHEC) for short-notice deployments is difficult. Modification to the current military GP training programme and easier access to training courses are suggested as potential solutions to the perceived shortfall in training in these areas. Prehospital care and care of the acutely unwell patient remain an area of significant anxiety within military primary care doctors. While most military GPs may not want or choose to spend much of their time exclusively managing trauma and acute care, it is accepted that there is a professional requirement to provide this level of care on a frequent basis. The study suggests that there is an appetite for a higher level of training, both within the military GP specialist training pathway and postqualification. Suggested solutions to this challenge include (1) modification of the current military general practice specialty trainee residential course and (2) modification of military GPs' terms of reference to include PHEC experience during the working week. ","48":"Supplemental oxygen is a key element of emergency treatment algorithms. However, in the operational environment, oxygen supply poses a challenge. The lack of high-quality evidence alongside emerging technologies provides the opportunity to challenge current guidelines. The aim of this review was to appraise the evidence for the administration of oxygen in emergency patients and give recommendations for its use in clinical practice. A critical review of the literature was undertaken to determine the evidence for emergency supplemental oxygen use. Based on interpretation of the limited available evidence, five key recommendations are made: pulse oximetry should be continuous and initiated as early as possible; oxygen should be available to all trauma and medical patients in the forward operating environment; if peripheral oxygen saturations (SpO2) are greater than or equal to 92%, supplemental oxygen is not routinely required; if SpO2 is less than 92%, supplemental oxygen should be titrated to achieve an SpO2 of greater than 92%; and if flow rates of greater than 5 L\/min are required, then urgent evacuation and critical care support should be requested. Oxygen is not universally required for all patients. Current guidelines aim to prevent hypoxia but with potentially conservative limits. Oxygen should be administered to maintain SpO2 at 92% or above. New areas for research, highlighted in this review, may provide a future approach for oxygen use from point of injury to definitive care.

The Defence MODified Tool ('Stress Indicator Survey') asks personnel to rate their perceptions of eight working conditions known to be significantly associated with work-related stress. MOD psychologists are developing a Defence norm group against which future survey scores can be compared. This article describes the use of the Stress Indicator Survey in MOD and gives an overview of findings from 2016 to 2018. MOD psychologists conducted 27 Stress Indicator Surveys in 2016-2018. Data were collated from 6227 personnel for the Defence norm group and comparisons were conducted between Service personnel and MOD civil servants, and between Services (Royal Navy\/Royal Marines (RN\/RM), Army and Royal Air Force (RAF)). Service personnel had significantly more favourable perceptions than MOD civil servants of most working conditions. The RN\/RM had significantly more favourable perceptions than either the Army or the RAF of all working conditions. These findings indicate differential risks of work-related stress in different groups of personnel. Possible explanations for the observed differences in risk of work-related stress are discussed, including the nature of military life and planned changes to Defence civilian headcount. Examples of managerial actions to improve working conditions based on individual survey findings are given.

This includes the degree, if any, to which providers during the Vietnam conflict have carried out what we now refer to as harsh interrogation measures in an attempt to extract information from captured enemy soldiers, the extent, if any, to which the USA used medicine as a means to try to win over the hearts and minds of civilians in occupied territory and how providers should treat service members who return from the front with combat fatigue. An issue that arose during the first Gulf War in 1991 is discussed, namely US service persons being required to take botulism vaccine without their consent. Finally, present challenges are discussed including interrogation measures such as waterboarding and the ethical issues posed in the recent past by the exclusion of gay service members and those posed presently by the inclusion of transgender members. Two ethical values are suggested that have remained constant, namely giving priority to the individual needs of service personnel over those of the unit when there are no urgent combat needs and the reliance on individual virtue when what they should do is morally unclear.","52":null,"53":"Psychology is integral to the concepts and practice of leadership. Leadership models often have their roots in psychological paradigms, making it intrinsically easy for psychologists to grasp and apply them alongside clinical models. Psychologists' 'second-order' skills have been used to good effect in the changing landscape of military mental healthcare: modelling adaptive responses to change, understanding the non-conscious aspects of relationships in hierarchical organisations, working with systems, the ability to diagnose situational requirements and act accordingly, drawing on a range of psychological theories and leadership styles. The clinical psychologist as a professional who can help others 'reframe' a situation or experience is key to their leadership role within healthcare settings, 'enabling others to achieve shared purpose in the face of uncertainty'. The contribution that clinical psychology has made to leadership in Defence over the past 20 years will be illustrated by personal accounts from 'experts by experience'.","54":"Despite all local authorities in England signing up to the Armed Forces Covenant, only a small proportion of Joint Strategic Needs Assessments (JSNAs) include detailed consideration of the health of the local ex-military population.

Systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology for qualitative synthesis of mixed study designs. SCOPUS, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for published research on health outcomes among UK ex-military populations. All study designs were included. 43 studies met the inclusion criteria. Rates of mental illness and hearing loss are higher among ex-military populations compared with the general public, while rates of cancer among ex-military personnel born after 1960 are lower. Despite high rates of hazardous drinking among serving personnel, rates of alcohol-related harm among ex-military populations are no higher than the general public. There is a subpopulation at increased risk of a range of adverse outcomes. This group is variously identified as younger, male, less educated, more likely to have served in a combat role and\/or left service early. This review found evidence of areas of increased and reduced disease burden among ex-military populations. More detailed information on the make-up of the local ex-service population would support more meaningful needs assessments. The Ministry of Defence and local authorities and service providers should work together to support early identification and targeted support for those at the highest risk of adverse outcomes.

In the literature, these are often presented as the result of pressures, real or perceived, from the military institution or role and obligation conflicts that can divert physicians from their primary duty towards their patients. In this article, I present the ethical experiences of 14 Canadian military physicians who participated in operational missions, particularly in Afghanistan. Interestingly, although some dilemmas discussed in the academic literature were raised by Canadian physicians, ethical tensions were less frequent and numerous than what might have been expected. Instead, what emerged were distinctions between the ethical experiences of physicians: generalists experienced more frequent and different ethical challenges than specialists, and these also varied by context, that is, garrison versus on deployment. The main dilemmas during deployment were similar to those encountered by humanitarian physicians and concerned inequalities in the provision of care between coalition soldiers and Afghans (soldiers and civilians), as well as the lack of resources. Surprisingly, participants were evenly divided with regards to how they perceived their professional identity: one group clearly prioritised the medical profession (ie, doctor first and foremost), while the other group identified themselves as military physicians, but without prioritising one profession over the other.","59":"Psychologists first became prominent within the Armed Forces largely as a result of their contributions to military systems, operations and personnel during the First and Second World Wars.

A number of case reports have suggested the efficacy of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) in the treatment of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage from a range of medical causes, but its efficacy in blast lung is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether nebulised rFVIIa attenuates the haemorrhagic effects of blast lung injury in an animal model. Terminally anaesthetised rabbits subjected to blast lung injury were randomised to receive either rFVIIa or placebo via a nebuliser. The primary outcome was the level of blood iron-transferrin complex, a marker of the extent of blast lung injury, analysed using low temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Blast exposure led to a significant fall in iron-bound transferrin in both groups of animals (p&lt;0.001), which remained depressed during the study. There were no significant differences in iron-transferrin between the rFVIIa and placebo treatment groups over the duration of the study (p=0.081), and there was no trend towards elevated iron-transferrin in the rFVIIa-treated group once drug treatment had started. There was suggestive evidence of systemic absorption of rFVIIa given via the inhaled route. A single dose of nebulised rFVIIa did not attenuate pulmonary haemorrhage in a rabbit model of blast lung injury. As there was some evidence of systemic absorption, the inhaled route does not avoid the concern about potential thromboembolic complications from administration of rFVIIa.

Insurgents sought to develop new ways of concealing and detonating IEDs, and UK forces invested significantly in finding increasingly effective methods of detecting and avoiding them. Between 2010 and 2014 the UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory's Human and Social Sciences Group (HSSG) was asked to investigate the factors that might affect the performance of specialist search teams in the identification of IEDs. They sought to ascertain ways to improve effectiveness and maximise safety through training, human factors advice on equipment design, and recommendations on changes to tactics techniques and procedures.

Recent research indicates that the overall level of hazardous alcohol consumption remains high in the UK military, with little evidence of reduced consumption over time. Meanwhile, risky drinking in the general population appears to be decreasing. This paper describes work to develop a key aspect of an integrated care pathway for UK military personnel at all levels of alcohol risk. The project focuses on the development of an evidence-based treatment response across primary care and mental health services that will link with preventative initiatives.

It entails the application of psychological science to military operations, systems and personnel. The specialty was formally founded during World War I in the UK and the USA, and it was integral to many early concepts and interventions for psychological and neuropsychological trauma. It also established a fundamental basis for the psychological assessment and selection of military personnel. During and after World War II, military psychology continued to make significant contributions to aviation psychology, cognitive testing, rehabilitation psychology and many models of psychotherapy. Military psychology now consists of several subspecialties, including clinical, research and occupational psychology, with the latter often referred to in the USA as industrial\/organisational psychology.

Historically, the phenotype of the injuries studied was often severe, and it is unclear whether knowledge gained from these cases is entirely relevant to the frequently subtle injuries seen today. We therefore sought to characterise a recent case series of 100 patients referred with suspected NFCI to a military UK NFCI clinic. Their demographics, medical history and situational risk factors leading to their injuries were analysed, and comparison was made between those subsequently diagnosed with NFCI (n=76) and those receiving alternate diagnoses (n=24). Statistically significant predisposing factors for NFCI in the UK service personnel (SP) were being of African-Caribbean ethnicity and having a short duration of service in the Armed Forces. Past or current smoking was not identified as a risk factor. Injuries were almost always suffered on training exercises (most commonly in the UK); being generally cold and being on static duties were statistically significant situational risk factors. Non-significant trends of risk were also found for having wet clothing, wet boots and immersion. Self-reported dehydration was not found to be a risk factor for NFCI. Our demographic findings are in general agreement with those of previous studies. Our situational risk factor findings, however, highlight a pattern of NFCI risk factors to the modern UK SP: winter training exercises, when troops are generally cold and extremities often wet, with static duties frequently implicated in the disease mechanism. ","76":"World War 1 ended 100 years ago. The aftermath included the consolidation of significant advances in medical care of casualties. Some of these advances were made in the care of chemical casualties, in particular the mechanisms of toxicity and treatment of phosgene exposure. Phosgene, or carbonyl chloride, is an extremely poisonous vapour that was used to devastating effect during World War 1. Observations made of acutely poisoned casualties formed the basis of much research in the early post-World War 1 era. Some extremely elegant experiments, some at the nascent Porton Down research facility, further evaluated the toxin and defences against it. Researchers drew on knowledge that was later forgotten and has since been relearnt later in the 20th century and made many correct assumptions. Their work is the bedrock of our understanding of phosgene toxicity that survives to this day. The horrors of chemical warfare prompted the Geneva Protocol of 1925, prohibiting the use of chemical agents in warfare, and chemical warfare on this scale has not been repeated. The ease with which phosgene can be synthesised requires healthcare providers to be familiar with its effects.","77":"","78":null,"79":null,"80":null,"81":"Military medical research requires informed consent from test subjects, which is difficult to obtain for deployed (in-theatre) or prehospital studies where patients are incapacitated and legal representatives are not available. Although US and UK regulations make provisions for exceptions to informed consent, these are rarely used, thereby hindering trauma research and prospective experimental studies of new devices, surgeries or drugs. In their place, a survey of research articles published in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps and Military Medicine between 2004 and 2018 shows how researchers turned to clinical surveys and retrospective, case or animal studies instead. The reluctance to enrol military personnel in interventional studies stems from past instances of abuse and current misperceptions of soldiers as a particularly vulnerable class of research subjects. Increasing the pool of research subjects to facilitate interventional studies to improve combat casualty care requires honing military medical ethics in two ways. First, it is important to implement existing informed consent regulations without special regard for the status of service personnel. This will expedite approval of waivers of informed consent. Second, aggressively recruiting civilians for military-related medical research increases the number of subjects available for trauma research. Community consultation and public discourse are the proper venues to deliberate on each recommendation.","82":"The majority of patients injured in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan were as a result of explosion, and terrorist incidents have brought blast injuries to the front door of many civilian hospitals that had not previously encountered such devastation.

Despite this emergent trend, there has been little critical analysis and examination of the ethics of military actors engaging in this type of work. This type of mission represents the most common form of military medical deployment within the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and is now explicitly emphasised in many militaries' defence doctrine. The growth of these programmes has occurred with little analysis, examination or critique. This paper examines the history of global health diplomacy as directly related to humanitarian assistance, focusing on the difference in intention to highlight ethical dilemmas related to military involvement in the humanitarian sphere. The relationship between non-military humanitarian actors and military actors will be a focal point of discussion, as this relationship has been historically complicated and continues to shift. Relevant differences between these two groups of actors, their motivations and work will be highlighted. In order to examine the morally important differences between these groups, analysis will draw on relevant international doctrine and codes that attempt to provide ethical guidance within the humanitarian sphere.","84":null,"85":null,"86":"This article argues that medical personnel of armed forces occupy a ' peace role ', which continues and dominates their professional ethos during armed conflict.

PBLI carries high morbidity and mortality, but remains difficult to diagnose and quantify. Radiographic diagnosis of PBLI was historically made with the aid of plain radiographs; more recently, qualitative review of CT images has assisted diagnosis. We report a novel way of measuring post-traumatic acute lung injury using CT lung density analysis in two casualties. One casualty presented following blast exposure with confirmed blast lung injury and the other presented following extremity injury without blast exposure. Three-dimensional lung maps of each casualty were produced from their original trauma CT scan. Analysis of the lung maps allowed quantitative radiological comparison exposing areas of reduced aeration of the patient's lungs. 45% of the blast-exposed lungs were non-aerated compared with 10% in the non-blast-exposed lungs. In these example cases quantitative CT lung density analysis allowed blast-injured lungs to be distinguished from non-blast-exposed lungs. ","89":"Catastrophic haemorrhage is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma, in both military and civilian settings. There are numerous studies looking at the effectiveness of different haemostatic agents in the laboratory but few in a clinical setting. This study analyses the use of haemostatic dressings used in patients injured on the battlefield and their association with survival. A retrospective database review was undertaken using the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry from 2003 to 2014, during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Data included patient demographics, the use of haemostatic dressings, New Injury Severity Score (NISS) and patient outcome. Of 3792 cases, a haemostatic dressing was applied in 317 (either Celox, Hemcon or Quickclot). When comparing patients who had a haemostatic dressing applied versus no haemostatic agent, there was a 7% improvement in survival. Celox was the only individual haemostatic dressing that was associated with a statistically significant improvement in survival, which was most apparent in the more severely injured (NISS 36-75). We have shown an association between use of haemostatic agents and improved survival, mostly in those with more severe injuries, which is particularly evident in those administered Celox. This supports the continued use of haemostatic agents as part of initial haemorrhage control for patients injured in conflict and suggests that civilian organisations that may need to deal with patients with similar injury patterns should consider their use and implementation. ","90":"Having served more than 4000 personnel including the peacekeeping troops, UN police and civilian staff, the Chinese Peacekeeping Level 2 Military Hospital has accumulated 1235 inpatient medical records in 4 years. Assessment of the records stored in the CHN L2 identified that the data collected by different teams were incoherent and highlighted the need for implementation of a hospital-based combat injury registry and the establishment of a combat injury surveillance system. A one-page, 21-item registry form was designed to collect general information about the injuries, including such data as demographics, injury event, severity, diagnosis and treatment, and outcome. All relevant personnel was required to undergo a 2-day training in order to master the use of the registry form. The new registry form was used to collect the data on all of the cases recorded in the CHN L2 between 26 April 2014 and 31 March 2017. Analysis of the collected data identified improvised explosive device as the most common (44.95%) mechanism of combat injury in Sector East of MINUSMA. Anefis, the centre of the UN logistic transit, was identified as the location where most of the combat injuries (42.20%) occurred. Based on these results, certain suggestions that addressed this threat were given to the Operation department in Sector East of MINUSMA. A hospital-based combat injury registry was successfully developed and implemented in the Chinese Peacekeeping Level 2 Hospital. It can provide data to support the policy changes to minimise the impact of combat injuries on peacekeeping troops. The designed registry form provides more accurate estimates of the magnitude of the morbidity due to different causes in the battlefield and lays a foundation for an injury surveillance system.

Stool samples from soldiers with acute gastroenteritis illness were collected and screened for common enteropathogenic agents. Food and water samples served on the settings were also collected for microbiological investigation. Norovirus-positive samples were further characterised by sequence analysis using a public automated genotyping tool. The four outbreaks affected a total of 99 soldiers among the 618 stationed on base units and in a military exercise. A total of 27 soldiers provided a stool sample, of which 20 were positive for norovirus by real-time PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the noroviruses involved were all genogroup II, namely GII.17, GII.Pe-GII.4 Sydney 2012, GII.P2-GII.2 and GII.P16-GII.2. Of note, 30 soldiers had to receive treatment at the military hospital due to severity of symptoms.

This study investigates casualty data from three different military operations to determine whether survivability from blast injuries has improved over time and whether the tactics used could have influenced the injuries sustained. Casualty data from operations in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan were reviewed and found to contain a total of 2629 casualties injured by improvised explosive devices. The injury severities were examined and the suitability of comparison between conflicts was considered. The case fatality rate and mean severity score sustained remained consistent among the operations included in this study. Using the New Injury Severity Score, the probabilities of survival were calculated for each separate operation. The body regions injured were identified for both fatalities and survivors. Using this information, comparisons of injury severities sustained at an Abbreviated Injury Scale of 3 and above (identified as a threshold for fatal injury) were conducted between the different operations. The data showed that as operations changed over time, survivability improved and the proportions of body regions injured also changed; however, this study also highlights how studying casualty data from different conflicts without taking account for the contextual differences may lead to misleading conclusions.

Obesity in the trauma patient has been shown to be an independent risk factor of morbidity and mortality, and the incidence of pelvic and lower extremity fractures has consistently demonstrated to be higher in the obese patient compared with an individual with a normal body habitus. This article aims to highlight the challenges associated with pelvic fracture in the obese population.","126":null,"127":null,"128":"","129":"The People's Republic of China has been successfully deploying medical teams to support the peacekeeping mission at the Level 2 Military Hospital in Mali since December 2013. The aim of this paper was to compare the current practice in Chinese Peacekeeping Level 2 Military Hospital with the severe trauma treatment standards reported in China. A retrospective analysis was conducted between 26 April 2014 and 18 May 2016 using records stored in the Chinese Peacekeeping Level 2 Hospital (CHN L2). From 19 May 2016 to 31 March 2017, the data were prospectively collected for all casualties presenting in the hospital. Emergency response time, prehospital transit time, emergency rescue time, consultation call time and mortality were compared with the data from a study that evaluated the effects of standard rescue procedure (SRP) in improving severe trauma treatment in different hospitals across China. Indexes obtained from the analysis of CHN L2 data were equal or surpassed indexes reported in the study evaluating the implementation of SRP in Chinese hospitals. The deployed CHN L2 delivered a high standard of care in Gao, Mali, and generally surpasses the Chinese standards. This can mostly be attributed to an efficient coordination of work during both prehospital and in-hospital stages of rescue.

UBB may be considered a form of tertiary blast injury but is at a higher rate and somewhat more predictable than injury caused by more classical forms of tertiary injury. Recent studies have focused on the transmission of axial load through the cervical spine with clinically relevant injury caused by resultant compression and flexion. This paper seeks to clarify the pattern of head and neck injuries in fatal UBB incidents using a pragmatic anatomical classification. This retrospective study investigated fatal UBB incidents in UK triservice members during recent operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Head and neck injuries were classified by anatomical site into: skull vault fractures, parenchymal brain injuries, base of skull fractures, brain stem injuries and cervical spine fractures. Incidence of all injuries and of each injury type in isolation was compared. 129 fatalities as a consequence of UBB were identified of whom 94 sustained head or neck injuries. 87 casualties had injuries amenable to analysis. Parenchymal brain injuries (75%) occurred most commonly followed by skull vault (55%) and base of skull fractures (32%). Cervical spine fractures occurred in only 18% of casualties. 62% of casualties had multiple sites of injury with only one casualty sustaining an isolated cervical spine fracture. Improvement of UBB survivability requires the understanding of fatal injury mechanisms. Although previous biomechanical studies have concentrated on the effect of axial load transmission and resultant injury to the cervical spine, our work demonstrates that cervical spine injuries are of limited clinical relevance for UBB survivability and that research should focus on severe brain injury secondary to direct head impact.

One method to investigate the consequences of blast injuries is with the use of living systems (animal models). The use of animals allows the examination and evaluation of injury mechanisms in a more controlled manner, allowing variables such as primary or secondary blast injury for example, to be isolated and manipulated as required. To ensure a degree of standardisation across the blast research community a set of guidelines which helps researchers navigate challenges of modelling blast injuries in animals is required.

However, in the UK civilian practice, the use of FAST may decline given a recent change in National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance as a result of improvement in CT availability and resuscitation techniques. In the Role 3 Medical Treatment Facility, Camp Bastion, 187 patients with trauma who received FAST in the trauma bay in 2014 were reviewed to determine the accuracy of FAST in the deployed environment. The data demonstrates the sensitivity and specificity of FAST to be 75% and 99.3%, respectively. This study demonstrates that FAST is accurate on operations. FAST is provided by the integrated radiologist as part of damage control radiology, which gives the team leader rapid diagnostic information to improve decision-making and ultimately patient outcomes. CT is heavily utilised in civilian practice; however, the military operates in a different environment often with multiple casualties and limited access to CT, as a result, portable ultrasound will continue to be a valuable tool on operations if used properly. The next challenge is to develop and maintain this high diagnostic accuracy in future deployments where the memories of our prior success may fade.

We describe the case of a 40-year-old military soldier suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder was admitted for an adaptation of his treatment. Mirtazapine was introduced and quetiapine increased. Two days later, the patient presented with severe rhabdomyolysis syndrome. Mirtazapine administration was paused and intravenous hydration commenced. Shortly after the creatine kinase levels decreased enabling mirtazapine to be reintroduced without complication. It is our opinion that 5-hydroxytryptamine 2a serotonergic receptors inhibition (related to mirtazapine and quetiapine) associated with muscle training was responsible for inducing rhabdomyolysis. This must be kept in mind when psychotropic medications are adjusted, especially in an athletic population such as military.","146":"Ketamine is an effective drug for battlefield analgesia.

However, this may be technically challenging to undertake during night-time conditions where the use of light to aid cannulation may give the tactical situation away to opponents. The aim of this study was to investigate the success and tactical safety of venepuncture under battlefield conditions with different colour light sources. The procedure was carried out with naked eye in a bright room in the absence of a separate light source, with a naked eye in a dark room under red, white, blue and green light sources and under an infrared light source while wearing night vision goggles (NVGs). The success, safety, degree of difficulty and completion time for each procedure were then explored. All interventions made in daylight and in a dark room were found to be 100% successful. Interventions performed under infrared light while wearing NVGs took longer than under other light sources or in daylight. Interventions performed under blue light were tactically safer when compared with interventions performed under different light sources. Blue light offered the best tactical safety during intravenous cannulation under night-time conditions and is recommended for future use in tactical casualty care. The use of NVGs using infrared light cannot be recommended if there is the possibility of opponents having access to the technology.

The aim of this study was to assess the collection and sharing of medical intelligence and medical information (M2I) by NATO Nations, Partner Nations and NATO Command Structure and NATO Force Structure Headquarters (NCS\/NFS HQs). A transversal survey was conducted between December 2014 and March 2015 using a survey form on M2I sent to NATO Nations and Partnership for Peace (PfP) Nations as well as NCS\/NFS HQs. Correctly completed responses were received from 15\/40 (37.5%) of the possible NATO and PfP Nations (37.5%) and 7\/8 (87.5%) of the NCS\/NFS HQs (100.0%). Deficiencies in the collection of M2I data were found due to lack of specific doctrines, networks, tools, structures and organisation. The survey provided an indication even though the participation rate was low for Nations. Part of the problem is thought to be that medical information and medical intelligence often lie in different chains of command. Future directions for this research could include studying the possibilities of a new specific information technology (IT) system to collect and to share M2I. Collection and sharing of M2I within the NATO\/PfP community requires facilitation in order to strengthen the basis for decision-making and force health protection. The development of a dedicated NATO IT system may be a precondition for the implementation of an efficient M2I network.

There is potential utility for mCPR devices in the military context to ensure uninterrupted quality CPR following a medical cardiac arrest. Particular utility may be in a prohibitive operational environment, where manpower is limited or where timelines to definitive care are stretched resulting in a requirement for prolonged resuscitation. mCPR can also act as a bridge to advanced endovascular resuscitation techniques should they become more mainstream therapy.","153":"Snakebite envenoming is rare among military patients, with few cases reported in recent years. Increasingly, however, military operations are taking place in remote parts of Africa, which are inhabited by numerous species of venomous snake, and in Europe, where dangerous species exist but are less common. Bites from a venomous snake may prove fatal, and therefore military medics must be adequately prepared to manage them.

The Ovid Medline, Web of Science and PubMed online databases were interrogated for papers published between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2017. The literature search yielded a total of 64 papers that fulfilled the search criteria. Despite decades of dedicated research into different treatment modalities, ARDS continues to carry a high burden of mortality. The ARDS definitions laid out in the Berlin consensus are not entirely suited to trauma. While trauma-related ARDS represents a small portion of the available research, the evidence continues to favour low tidal volume ventilation as the benchmark for current practice. Positive end expiratory ventilation and airway pressure release ventilation in trauma cohorts may be beneficial; however, the evidence to date does not show this.

Protection can be provided to the lungs by decoupling the stress wave transmission into the thorax by managing the blast energy imparted through the protection system. It is proposed that the utility of the existing 'simple decoupler' blast overpressure protection is reviewed in light of recent developments in the treatment of those sustaining both overpressure and fragment injuries.

One potential area is the rapid proliferation and sophistication of automated and remote systems such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are already used to deliver blood to remote military locations in Afghanistan and defibrillators to those that need them in the USA and Sweden. An area of future opportunity would be to facilitate rapid evacuation of wounded personnel from high intensity, high threat, remote and austere areas directly to specialist care. Such a capability would reduce threat to human life while allowing rapid extraction of casualties from high risk or inaccessible environments straight back to Role 3 care, all of which in these situations is either not possible or carries too much risk using conventional aerial assets. The article aims to highlight a potential future capability, stimulate debate and reflection, all of which is essential for innovation and future organisational development. The potential uses and benefits of UAVs are highlighted including both the challenges and rewards of utilising UAVs for casualty evacuation. Key benefits are reduced risk to human life, cost, ability to insert into areas conventional aircraft cannot and the rapidity of transfer. Challenges are likely to be airspace management, decisions on appropriate level of care to deliver during transit and ultimately user acceptability. The article also highlights that in order to maximise our ability to exploit new technologies, all arms and trades within the military must be involved in collective research and development. Furthermore, sensible corroboration with private companies will further enhance our ability to acquire products that best serve our needs.","163":"","164":"Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is a technique to control haemorrhage by placing a retrograde catheter in an artery and inflating a balloon at its tip. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the proportion of injured people who could potentially have benefited from this technique prior to hospitalisation, including on the scene or during transport. A retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients with trauma registered in the Paris Fire Brigade emergency medical system between 1 January and 31 December 2014. Inclusion criteria included all patients over 18 years of age with bleeding of supposedly abdominal and\/or pelvic and\/or junctional origin, uncontrolled haemorrhagic shock or cardiac arrest with attempted resuscitation. During this study period, a total of 1159 patients with trauma (3.2%) would have been eligible to undergo REBOA. Death on scene rate was 83.8% (n=31) and six patients had a beating heart when they arrived at the hospital. Ten out of the 37 patients had spontaneous circulatory activity. Among them, four people died on the scene or during transport. Thirty-six out of 37 patients were intubated, one benefited from the use of a haemostatic dressing and one benefited from a tourniquet. REBOA can be seen as an effective non-surgical solution to ensure complete haemostasis during the prehospital setting. When comparing the high mortality rate following haemorrhage with the REBOA's rare side effects, the risk-benefit balance is positive. Given that 3% of all patients with trauma based on this study would have been eligible for REBOA, we believe that this intervention should be available in the prehospital setting. The results of this study will be used: educational models for REBOA balloon placement using training manikins, with an ultimate aim to undertake a prospective feasibility study in the prehospital setting.

Bilingual questionnaires were distributed to 496 serving Army, Navy and Air Force personnel serving in units local to the Zonal military hospital in North India. Having heard of the term glaucoma resulted in the subject being 'glaucoma aware', while 'knowledge of glaucoma' required at least three out of six questions to be answered correctly. 110\/496 (22%) participants were found to be glaucoma aware, while knowledge of glaucoma was found in 60\/496 (12%) participants. This study demonstrates that glaucoma awareness and knowledge is high compared with rural or urban Indian populations.

Cohort members provided data on perceived mental health problems and help-seeking from specialist mental health services. Both samples provided work strain and basic sociodemographic data. Work strain levels were compared among cohort and DCMH help seekers and non-help seekers using adjusted logistic regression analyses. Perceiving that mental health-related stigmatisation had reduced and being prompted to seek help by attending a health promotion event were among the least frequent reasons for seeking help in DCMH attendees. Realising that help was needed and being urged to seek help by one's partner, friends or family were the most common. Working very hard and experiencing excessive work were the most common work strain factors. Overall, the greatest levels of work strain were found among DCMH attendees. In all subsamples, work strain was significantly associated with experiencing a perceived mental health problem irrespective of whether help was sought or not. Work strain was significantly associated with experiencing a stressful, emotional, mental health or alcohol problem and was the highest among current DCMH help seekers.

The academic impact of military medical publications reflects the extent and depth of recognition, acceptance and utilisation of the concepts transmitted in these publications. The aim of this research was to construct an evaluation index system suitable for evaluating the academic influence of scholars in the field of military medicine. Using the Delphi consensus methodology, 30 experts from the field of military medicine, military medical information and library and information science were asked during three rounds of questioning to score the feasibility and importance of indicators that could be used to determine academic impact. An analytic hierarchy process method was used to calculate the relative weighting of each indicator in determining the final level of academic impact. Eight evaluation indicators were agreed on to potentially determine academic impact. These comprised: 'Web of Science documents', 'Citation impact', 'h-index', 'Percentage of international collaborations', 'Percentage of the top 10% of the cited frequency', 'Category normalised citation impact', 'Percentage of documents cited' and 'The number of F1000 Recommended papers'. The evaluation index system determined from this study combines the advantages of both qualitative and quantitative recognised evaluation indicators, which are subsequently weighted according to their importance in the field of military medicine.

A plateau in the number of annual publications on military trauma was found, as was a shift away from publications on wound and mortality epidemiology to publications on traumatic brain injury (TBI), neurosurgery or blast injury to the head. Extensive collaboration networks exist between highly contributing authors and institutions, but less collaboration between authors from different countries. The USA produced the majority of recent publications, followed by the UK, Germany and Israel.

The prevalence of hazardous alcohol consumption among military spouses or partners was estimated and potential sociodemographic and military factors associated with this outcome were identified. Nine papers met inclusion criteria, of which eight focused on female spouses or partners only. The limited evidence suggests hazardous alcohol consumption was not a common outcome among spouses or partners. None of the papers statistically compared the prevalence among spouses or partners to estimates from the general population and few reported associations with sociodemographic or military factors. Deployment abroad did not appear to be significantly associated with hazardous consumption, although increasing periods of separation from Service personnel may be associated with increased hazardous consumption among spouses or partners. Limited evidence was found concerning the prevalence of hazardous alcohol consumption among military spouses or partners or which sociodemographic and military factors might be associated with this outcome. The a dominance of US studies means applying the estimates of these outcomes to other nations must be undertaken with care due to differences in cultural attitudes to alcohol as well as differences between military structure and operations between the US and other nations.

The first was patriotism, which captures loyalty and full commitment to the military and its missions. The second was commitment to their family, reflecting the balance of responsibility to family of origin with the obligation one feels towards their military family. The last driving force was faith, or the drive to reach towards the transcendent to provide a moral compass and develop empathy in the face of difficult situations.

The retirement age for professional soldiers has also increased to 65 years, thereby greatly increasing the average length of military service. This necessitates greater attention to the health and care of service personnel due to the increase of chronic non-communicable diseases with age. The aim of this research was to identify how health behaviours might potentially contribute to diseases in the Hungarian Defence Forces. All members of the Hungarian Defence Forces undergoing health screenings between 2011 and 2015 were assessed. Health variables analysed were derived from the health screening data sheet which is collected from every member of the Hungarian Defence Forces undergoing a health screening since 2009. Items recorded were connected to health behaviour (physical activity, nutrition, smoking), subjective well-being (psychosomatic backache, fatigue and quality of waking up to describe the quality of sleep), sociodemographic data (age, gender) and the mental toughness quotient (MTQ). A logistic regression model was utilised to predict how health behaviour may affect the development of disease. Factors most associated with the development of disease included psychosomatic backache (P&lt;0.000), age (P&lt;0.001), frequency of undertaking sports (P&lt;0.05), quality of sleeping and waking up (P&lt;0.05) and the assessment of gender differences (P&lt;0.05). Extension of the length of active service will result in an increased burden of disease for members of the Hungarian Defence Forces.

This case serves to illustrate that British military personnel on exercise are potentially at risk of contracting borreliosis both in the UK and abroad, serological tests can be unreliable, and the differential diagnosis of meningoencephalitis can be broad with specialist input often required.","196":"","197":null,"198":"A 77-year-old male patient presented with dysphonia.

The mission of the Spanish military forces within this was to direct training missions for the Iraqi Army. The aim of this study is to analyse the medical care provided in the Spanish Role 1 deployed medical treatment facility during Operation 'Apoyo a Irak'. A cross-sectional, descriptive and retrospective study was conducted between 15 December 2015 and 18 November 2016. The study population comprised all personnel treated at the Spanish Role 1 medical treatment facility of the 'Gran Capitan' base in Besmaya, Iraq. During the study period, a total of 2208 consultations were performed, 1547 of which were first consultations. The predominant type of medical care was categorised as 'traumatology' (n=438; 19.8%), followed by 'healing of wounds and minor surgical processes' (n=332; 15%), 'acute upper respiratory tract infections' (n=267; 12%), 'dermatology' (n=214; 9.6%) and 'gastroenterology' (n=214; 9.6%). Twenty-eight patients (1.2%) required care in the upper medical echelon of care, three of whom were urgently evacuated. Oral diseases were the main reason for evacuation to the next medical echelon. Four patients were repatriated to the national territory for medical reasons. One death was recorded due to a vehicle accident. The results of our study reinforce those found in similar recent international missions in which the Spanish Armed Forces and other allied armies have deployed a Role 1 medical treatment facility.

Its multifactorial mechanisms of action, including lowering metabolic rate and reducing acute inflammatory cellular processes, ultimately provide protection for central nervous tissue from continuing injury following ischaemic or traumatic insult. Its clinical application within acute traumatic spinal cord injury would therefore seem very plausible, it having the potential to combat the pathophysiological secondary injury processes that can develop in the proceeding hours to days following the initial injury. As such it could offer invaluable assistance to lessen subsequent sensory, motor and autonomic dysfunction for an individual affected by this devastating condition. Yet research surrounding this intervention's applicability in this field is somewhat lacking, the majority being experimental. Despite a recent resurgence of interest, which in turn has produced encouraging results, there is a real possibility that this potentially transformational intervention for treating traumatic spinal cord injury could remain an experimental therapy and never reach clinical implementation.","203":null,"204":"Acute extremity compartment syndrome requires rapid decompression. In remote locations, distance, weather and logistics may delay the evacuation of patients with extremity trauma beyond the desired timeline for compartment release. The aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of performing telementored surgery for leg compartment release and to identify methodological issues relevant for future research. Three anaethetists and one critical care physician were recruited as operators. They were directed to perform a two-incision leg fasciotomy on a Thiel-embalmed cadaver under the guidance of a remotely located orthopaedic surgeon. The operating physician and the surgeon (mentor) were connected through software that allows for real-time supervision and the use of a virtual pointer overlaid onto the surgical field. Two experienced orthopaedic traumatologists independently assessed the adequacy of compartment decompression and the presence of iatrogenic complications. 14 of 16 compartments (in four leg specimens) were felt to have been completely released. The first evaluator considered that the deep posterior compartment was incompletely released in two specimens. The second evaluator considered that the superficial posterior compartment was incompletely released in two specimens. The only complication was a large laceration of the soleus muscle that occurred during a period of blurred video signal attributed to a drop in bandwidth. This study suggests that surgical telementoring may enable physicians to safely perform two-incision leg fasciotomy in remote environments. This could improve the chances of limb salvage when compartment syndrome occurs far from surgical care. We found interobserver variation in the assessment of compartment release, which should be considered in the design of future research protocols.

Traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA) is a precursor to traumatic death, but data on military outcomes are limited. In order to better inform military treatment protocols, the aim of this study was to define the epidemiology of TCA in the military population with a particular focus on survival rates and injury patterns. A retrospective database analysis of the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry was undertaken. Patients who were transported to a UK deployed hospital between 2003 and 2014 and suffered TCA were included. Those patients injured by asphyxiation, electrocution, burns without other significant trauma and drowning were excluded. Data included mechanism of injury, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for each body region and survival to deployed (Role 3) field hospital discharge. 424 TCA patients were identified during the study period; median age was 23 years, with a median ISS of 45. The most common mechanism of injury was explosive (55.7%), followed by gunshot wound (38.9%), road traffic collision (3.5%), crush (1.7%) and fall (0.2%). 45 patients (10.6% (95% CI 8.0% to 13.9%)) survived to deployed (Role 3) hospital discharge. The most prevalent body region with a severe to maximum AIS injury was the head, followed by the lower limbs, thorax and abdomen. Haemorrhage secondary to abdominal and lower limb injury was associated with survival; traumatic brain injury was associated with death.

Rates of scapula fractures are unknown in the military setting. The aim of this study is to analyse the incidence, aetiology, associated injuries, treatment and complications of these fractures occurring in deployed military personnel. All UK military personnel returning with upper limb injuries from Afghanistan and Iraq were retrospectively reviewed using the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine database and case notes (2004-2014). Forty-four scapula fractures out of 572 upper limb fractures (7.7%) were sustained over 10 years. Blast and gunshot wounds (GSW) were leading causative factors in 85%. Over half were open fractures (54%), with open blast fractures often having significant bone and soft tissue loss requiring extensive reconstruction. Multiple injuries were noted including lung, head, vascular and nerve injuries. Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were significantly higher than the average upper limb injury without a scapula fracture (p&lt;0.0001). Brachial plexus injuries occurred in 17%. While military personnel with GSW have a favourable chance of nerve recovery, 75% of brachial plexus injuries that are associated with blast have poorer outcomes. Fixation occurred with either glenoid fractures or floating shoulders (10%); these were as a result of high velocity GSW or mounted blast ejections. There were no cases of deep soft tissue infection or osteomyelitis and all scapula fractures united. Scapula fractures have a 20 times higher incidence in military personnel compared with the civilian population, occurring predominantly as a result of blast and GSW, and a higher than average ISS. These fractures are often associated with multiple injuries, including brachial plexus injuries, where those sustained from blast have less favourable outcome. High rates of union following fixation and low rates of infection are expected despite significant contamination and soft tissue loss.

The aim of this research was to explore potential health differences in order to support better service planning. A random cross-sectional sample of treatment-seeking veterans residing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was identified from a national mental health charity. 403 veterans completed a questionnaire highlighting their demographics, mental health and physical health difficulties. The data were analysed using a multinomial logistic regression with England as the baseline comparison. Help-seeking veterans residing in Northern Ireland tended to be older, have experienced less childhood adversity, joined the military after the age of 18 and took longer to seek help. Additionally, veterans from Northern Ireland had higher levels of obesity, sensory, mobility and systemic problems and a greater number of physical health conditions. Scottish and Welsh veterans had a higher risk of smoking and alcohol misuse. No differences were found in mental health presentations. The findings from this paper suggest that a greater focus needs to be placed on treating physical problems in Northern Irish veterans. Alcohol misuse should be addressed in more detail in treatment programmes, particularly in Scotland and Wales. As few differences were found in the mental health presentations, this suggests that standardised services are adequate.

Planners and operators may endorse collection of fresh whole blood from pretested donors in emergency situations. The biggest risk of transfusion is the accidental use of ABO incompatible blood which can be fatal. The risk may be mitigated by using only group O LOw (OLO) titre donors with plasma containing low levels of the naturally occurring antibody to group A and B red cells. This paper reviews the ABO blood group distribution in potential blood donors from a high readiness UK medical regiment and explores the feasibility of using only group OLO donors in small teams. A retrospective review of routine volunteer blood donor samples was undertaken at 6 monthly intervals during a 2-year period. Personnel were tested in groups when available during training to create multiple donor panels to simulate small teams. 206 donation samples were collected from 157 potential donors. All donors were acceptable based on the lifestyle questionnaire, serology and microbiology screen. Of the 206 samples reviewed, 85 (41%) were group O (D pos and D neg). 14 group O (16.5%) were shown to have high titre of anti-A or B. Therefore, 71, that is, 34% overall were suitable as OLO donors. The donor panel size varied from 15 to 44. The absolute number of OLO donors in each panel ranged from 4 to 17 and the number of O neg donors was 0-3. A third of samples were suitable as OLO donors; however, there were insufficient 'universal' donors within smaller subgroups (&lt;10).

This however must be balanced by an increased risk of injury. The aim of this paper is to review the current UK military drop zone medical estimate process, which may help to predict the risk of potential injury and assist in planning appropriate levels of medical support. In spring 2015, a British Airborne Battlegroup (UKBG) deployed on a 7-week overseas interoperability training exercise in the USA with their American counterparts (USBG). This culminated in a 7-day Combined Joint Operations Access Exercise, which began with an airborne Joint Forcible Entry (JFE) of approximately 2100 paratroopers.The predicted number of jump-related injuries was estimated using Parachute Order Number 8 (PO No 8). Such injuries were defined as injuries occurring from the time the paratrooper exited the aircraft until they released their parachute harness on the ground. Overall, a total of 53 (2.5%) casualties occurred in the JFE phase of the exercise, lower than the predicted number of 168 (8%) using the PO No 8 tool. There was a higher incidence of back (30% actual vs 20% estimated) and head injuries (21% actual vs 5% estimated) than predicted with PO No 8. The current method for predicting the incidence of medical injuries after a parachute drop using the PO No 8 tool is potentially not accurate enough for current requirements.

Although service personnel sustain civilian-type injuries, the specific rehabilitation goals and shift in the acute rehabilitation requirements for military personnel must be considered in the absence of enduring combat operations. It is notable that permanent medical downgrading secondary to trauma still occurs outside of warfare. The colocation of civilian major trauma services and R4 has ensured a mutually beneficial partnership that contributes to institutional memory and improves the coordination of patient pathways.

This was compared to their employment outcomes one to three years post discharge. We further evaluated whether this employment was sustained over successive years in the same patients. Finally, we identify those rehabilitation interventions deemed most influential in improving employment outcomes in brain injury. During this period, an average of 57 (51-61) such patients were discharged each year. A review conducted by telephone successfully contacted 46% (43%-49% across cohorts) of all possible patients; 71.4% (64-81) returned to work increasing to 80.7% (76-85) including those training\/actively seeking-work. Overall, 31.7% (24-40) returned to full-time military-in those leaving, 89.6% (85.4-90.9) were discharged for medical reasons.

The purpose of this paper is to align our experience of combat injuries with the known capability of REBOA to suggest an implementation strategy for the use of REBOA in combat care. It may replace the resuscitative effect of thoracotomy; can provide haemostasis of non-compressible torso injuries such as the junctional and pelvic haemorrhage caused by improvised explosive devices. However, prehospital use of REBOA must be in the context of an overall surgical plan and should be restricted to deployment in the distal aorta.

There is limited evidence to support existing triage tools, with a number of studies demonstrating poor performance at predicting the need for a life-saving intervention. The Modified Physiological Triage Tool (MPTT) is a novel triage tool derived using logistic regression, and in retrospective data sets has shown optimum performance at predicting the need for life-saving intervention. Physiological data and interventions were prospectively collected for consecutive adult patients with trauma (&gt;18 years) presenting to the emergency department at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, between March and September 2011. Patients were considered priority 1 (P1) if they received one or more interventions from a previously defined list. Patients were triaged using existing triage tools and the MPTT. Performance was measured using sensitivity and specificity, and a McNemar test with Bonferroni calculation was applied for tools with similar performance. The study population comprised 357 patients, of whom 214 (59.9%) were classed as P1. The MPTT (sensitivity: 83.6%, 95% CI 78.0% to 88.3%; specificity: 51.0%, 95% CI 42.6% to 59.5%) outperformed all existing triage tools at predicting the need for life-saving intervention, with a 19.6% absolute reduction in undertriage compared with the existing Military Sieve. The improvement in undertriage comes at the expense of overtriage; rates of overtriage were 11.6% higher with the MPTT than the Military Sieve. Using a McNemar test, a statistically significant (p&lt;0.001) improvement in overall performance was demonstrated, supporting the use of the MPTT over the Military Sieve. The MPTT outperforms all existing triage tools at predicting the need for life-saving intervention, with the lowest rates of undertriage while maintaining acceptable levels of overtriage. Having now been validated on both military and civilian cohorts, we recommend that the major incident community consider adopting the MPTT for the purposes of primary triage. ","242":"Insertion of an intercostal chest drain (ICD) is a common intervention in the management of either blunt or penetrating thoracic trauma. It is frequently performed by junior medical personnel as an emergency procedure during the initial resuscitation period and often within a stressful environment. Approximately one-fifth of all ICD insertions are associated with complications. In a retrospective review of over 1000 ICD insertions, 7% of the complications observed were due to inadequate fixation, resulting in dislodgement. The risk of dislodgement is greatest during transit or transfer of a casualty. In a military setting, this may involve movement of a casualty in a non-permissive environment and includes transfer on and off rotary wing, fixed wing, road vehicle and maritime transport platforms as well as between stretchers and hospital beds. While ICD insertion follows a standard technique in accordance with the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines, the method of securing ICDs has not been standardised across the Defence Medical Services (DMS). The aim of this paper is to first propose a modified version of a tried and tested technique of securing ICDs with alternative steps described for medical staff unfamiliar with surgical knot tying by hand. Second, we present the results from a pilot validation study of this technique when introduced to candidates on a trauma surgical skills course. We describe and demonstrate a robust, easily teachable and reproducible technique for securing ICDs. We would advocate the use of this technique among both surgically and non-surgically trained medical personnel and suggest that this should become the standardised technique for securing ICDs across the DMS. This could be easily implemented by introducing this technique into the various military trauma courses, for example the Military Operational Surgical Training, Medical Emergency Response Team and Critical Care Air Support Team courses.","243":"Under the laws of armed conflict military medics are deemed non-combatants, and as such are subject to certain protections and limitations. The non-combatant status is defined in the famous Geneva Conventions, which form the basis of the international law of armed conflict.

This paper describes the history and legal development of the non-combatant status, and summarises the importance and implications of the contents of the Geneva Conventions that are relevant to medical personnel as non-combatants. We conclude that, despite scope for criticism of its relevance in contemporary operations, the non-combatant status for medical personnel highlights our commitment to alleviating suffering in armed conflict, and provides a vital legal basis to protect those who serve to treat the sick and injured. The ultimate beneficiaries of this protected status for medical personnel are our patients themselves.

Patients were cared for based on guidelines given by the Brain Trauma Foundation and the Joint Theater Trauma System by non-neurosurgeon physicians with dedicated neurocritical care training. We report basic characteristics, injuries, interventions required and complications during transport. Intracranial haemorrhage was the most common diagnosis in this cohort. Most injuries were weapon related. During this study, there were no reported in-flight deaths. The majority of patients were mechanically ventilated. There were 45 patients who required at least one vasopressor to maintain adequate tissue perfusion, including four patients who required three or more. Some patients required intracranial pressure (ICP) management, treatment of diabetes insipidus and\/or seizure prophylaxis medications. Air transport personnel must be prepared to provide standard critical care but also care specific to TBIs, including ICP control and management of diabetes insipidus. Although these patients and their potential complications are traditionally managed by neurosurgeons, those providers without neurosurgical backgrounds can be provided this training to help fill a wartime need.

","251":"Women in the military are a minority group who, in addition to facing exposure to traumatic events due to the nature of the work, face additional stressors while deployed. It is argued that these exposures and experiences place individuals at a significantly higher risk of finding it difficult adjusting post deployment. This paper focuses on the psychological health and well-being of female veterans post-deployment. A systematic review of the literature related to female veterans' experiences upon returning home from deployment was conducted. Eight in-depth qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria for the study and were analysed using thematic analysis. Five key themes were identified in the papers: (1) bringing the war home, (2) post-deployment adjustment, (3) loss, (4) failed belongingness and (5) post-traumatic growth. These studies provide a useful insight into the different psychological health and well-being experiences that female veterans encounter. Additionally, the associated effects upon the individual and their families and communities are considered.

This was to determine if vectors of the virus such as Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus were introduced and established on the Island. An extensive survey of residential areas and natural habitats was initiated in order to collect mosquito larvae and adults by methods such as larval sampling, adult trapping and human landing catches. A. aegypti or A. albopictus were not collected by any of the three methods employed. Culex quinquefasciatus was the only species collected by all three methods. C. quinquefasciatus is a vector of lymphatic filariasis that can easily be transported by human means by air or sea. It is a container breeding species that lives in close proximity to human settlements and can cause significant amount of nuisance. Ascension Island is connected by air and sea with areas of the world where container breeding species such as A. albopictus and A. aegypti are established, therefore, it is not unlikely that these species become introduced to Ascension in the future. Sound surveillance on Ascension is imperative in order to act as an early warning and rapid response system for invasive mosquito species as well as a guide for the implementation of control measures against C. quinquefasciatus.

For some, this may increase the risk of using alcohol as a coping strategy when adjusting to multiple life events occurring when moving back into civilian life. A systematic review was conducted to determine the effectiveness of alcohol brief interventions for military personnel during transition. Electronic databases including Medline, Central, Healthcare Management Information Consortium (HMIC) and Embase, and grey literature, were searched. Two reviewers independently assessed potential studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed quality of selected articles using an established instrument. Ten studies met criteria for inclusion. Studies were synthesised narratively. Interventions were heterogeneous, and bias within studies may have acted to increase or decrease their reported effectiveness. The findings suggest some evidence for effectiveness of self-administered web-based interventions, involving personalised feedback over a number of sessions, and system-level electronic clinical reminders. All studies were from the USA. Delivery of interventions by a clinician during motivational interviews was most effective for those with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. A UK trial of web-based interventions with personalised feedback is recommended.

Such reproductive dysfunction consists of impaired ovulation with or without long-term subfertility. A critical review of pertinent evidence following an extensive literature search. The evidence points towards reduced energy availability as the most likely explanation for exercise-induced reproductive dysfunction. Evidence also suggests that reproductive dysfunction is mediated by activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, with elevated ghrelin and reduced leptin likely to play an important role. The observed reproductive dysfunction exists as part of a female athletic triad, together with osteopenia and disordered eating. If this phenomenon was shown to exist with UK military training, this would be of significant concern. We hypothesise that the nature of military training and possibly field exercises may contribute to greater risk of reproductive dysfunction among female military trainees compared with exercising civilian controls. We discuss the features of military training and its participants, such as energy availability, age at recruitment, body phenotype, type of physical training, psychogenic stressors, altered sleep pattern and elemental exposure as contributors to reproductive dysfunction. We identify lines of future research to more fully characterise reproductive dysfunction in military women and suggest possible interventions that, if indicated, could improve their future well-being. ","261":"Blast injuries in modern warfare are common, and the ear is often affected as it is an effective pressure transducer. This study aimed to evaluate military blast injuries of the ear. From May 2002 to October 2014, all patients referred to two military hospitals near Paris, France following exposure to massive explosions were analysed. Among the 41 patients (82 ears), 36 of them reported tinnitus, 25 hearing loss, 14 earache and 8 vertigo. It was noted that 44% of the patients had tympanic membrane perforations and that this was bilateral in two-thirds of the cases. The hearing loss in 29% of the cases was pure sensorineural, in 55% it was mixed and in 15% it was a pure conductive hearing loss. There was no correlation between the impact of middle ear lesions and the severity of the inner ear injury. Three patients had a pharyngolaryngeal blast injury detected on the battlefield associated with blast lung injury, but only two of them had tympanic perforations. Nine tympanoplasty procedures were performed, of which 44% succeeded in sealing the perforation. Blast injuries of the ear are characterised by significant functional signs and are not correlated to otoscopic examinations. Sensorineural hearing loss is almost immediately final. When deciding on initial management, the status of the tympanic membrane does not provide any information about the risk of a primary blast injury of the lung; laryngeal nasofibroscopy seems a more relevant screening test. ","262":"To assess the interactive experience of first year medical students attending the leadership and management course hosted by a British Army Reserve Field Hospital developed in partnership with Liverpool University. 244 students submitted a 1000-word structured reflective learning assignment about their reaction to, learning from and any behaviour and attitude changes as a result of, the training. The assignments were thematically analysed to identify how aspects of the training had impacted upon the students' understanding of leadership and teamwork. Their comments relating to the army were analysed to gain insight into their views and experience of the training. Students were surprised at how enjoyable and useful they found the course. Initially they expressed scepticism about what they could learn in an army-based environment. However, the training, particularly command and planning tasks, helped them appreciate and understand the different skills individuals can bring to a team environment, and the importance of everyone contributing. While some students were challenged by aspects of the course, with support and encouragement from team-mates and the army personnel, they learned they could achieve more together. Teaching leadership and management skills to medical students is a challenge which can be effectively addressed by adapting and developing army training resources. Students overcame initial scepticism about participating, and learned a lot about themselves and each other. In addition, the army developed a better understanding of the doctors of the future. The expertise of the army in delivering this training was crucial to its success as the medical school could not have provided this experience unsupported.

The pre-deployment training of MERT personnel is designed to foster individual knowledge, skills and abilities in PHEC and in small team performance and cohesion in 'mission-specific' contexts. Until now, the provision of airborne pre-deployment MERT training had been dependent on either the availability of an operational aircraft (eg, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter) or access to one of only two ground-based facsimiles of the Chinook's rear cargo\/passenger cabin. Although MERT training has high priority, there will always be competition with other military taskings for access to helicopter assets (and for other platforms in other branches of the Armed Forces). This paper describes the development of an inexpensive, reconfigurable and transportable MERT training concept based on 'mixed reality' technologies-in effect the 'blending' of real-world objects of training relevance with virtual reality reconstructions of operational contexts.","268":"","269":"This paper provides the definitive record of the UK Defence Medical Services (DMS) lessons from the organisation of medical services in support of Operation (Op) TELIC (Iraq) and Op HERRICK (Afghanistan).

Spouses of WIS military personnel (n=25) completed telephone interviews with the research team. The data were transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. The transcripts were cross-coded and checked for inter-rater reliability. Six major themes were identified: (1) communication between couples, (2) adverse family environment, (3) reintegration, (4) intimacy, (5) financial uncertainty and (6) transition from partner to caregiver. Partners caring for injured\/ill military personnel appear to be at risk of experiencing personal distress caused by impaired relationship functioning, which may lead to diminished physical and mental well-being.

From a common perspective of military mental health researchers from Germany and the UK, the lack of shared research might be related not only to the use of different languages but also the different ways in which the two militaries provide mental health and medical support to operations and differences in military institutions. One area that is suitable for military health research collaboration within UK and German forces is mental health and well-being among military personnel. This could include the study of resilience factors, the prevention of mental disorder, mental health awareness, stigma reduction and the treatment of mental disorder. Military mental health research topics, interests and the studies that have been conducted to date in the UK and Germany have considerable overlap and commonality of purpose. To undertake the investigation of the long-term consequences of operational deployment, the specific burdens placed on military families and to further the understanding of the role of factors such as biomarkers for use in military mental health research, it seems advisable to forge international research alliances across European nations, which would allow for researchers to draw transcultural and generalisable conclusions from their work. Such an enterprise is probably worthwhile given the shared research interests of Germany and the UK and the common perspectives on military mental health in particular.","278":"Stress fractures (SFs) occur when microdamage caused by repetitive mechanical load exceeds the biological load-bearing capacity of the bone. The study objective was to test whether a vest specifically designed and manufactured for female recruits, compared with the standard vest used on a regular basis by Border Police recruits, would reduce the incidence of SF in female Border Police recruits. Data based on reports of military personnel show that women are more likely to sustain SFs. A follow-up of 240 female Border Police infantry recruits, divided into two trial groups, was conducted from 2007 to 2009. Two different vests were evaluated-the standard special unit fighting vest, which was conventionally used by both men and women during basic training, and the new fighting vest, specially design for female body shape. No significant difference was noted in the number of SFs between the two groups which may be attributed to increased weight of the new vest. There was a lower incidence of long bone SFs which may have been due to the superior vest design. The female Border Police Infantry recruits expressed great satisfaction with the new vest. Increased effort should be invested to further reduce the weight of female combat gear, alongside efforts to improve fit and comfort.

Currently, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) are focusing on the development of three interlinking numerical models, each of a different fidelity, to answer specific questions on current threats. High-fidelity models simulate the physical events most realistically, and will be used in the future to test the medical effectiveness of personal armour systems. They are however generally computationally intensive, slow running and much of the experimental data to base their algorithms on do not yet exist. Medium fidelity models, such as the personnel vulnerability simulation (PVS), generally use algorithms based on physical or engineering estimations of interaction. This enables a reasonable representation of reality and greatly speeds up runtime allowing full assessments of the entire body area to be undertaken. Low-fidelity models such as the human injury predictor (HIP) tool generally use simplistic algorithms to make injury predictions. Individual scenarios can be run very quickly and hence enable statistical casualty assessments of large groups, where significant uncertainty concerning the threat and affected population exist. HIP is used to simulate the blast and penetrative fragmentation effects of a terrorist detonation of an improvised explosive device within crowds of people in metropolitan environments. This paper describes the collaboration between MoD and CPNI using an example of all three fidelities of injury model and to highlight future areas of research that are required.","283":"Even in the middle of an epidemic of a very serious illness, outbreaks of other infectious diseases will continue. Clinicians need to be able to make rapid decisions about the nature of the outbreak and how to manage it. A balance needs to be struck between managing all patients as if they have the worst-case scenario illness and the resultant risks to themselves, their colleagues and the mission. This paper reviews basic epidemiological tools that inform robust decision-making in the management of such outbreaks. It then describes how a pragmatic approach, combined with effective use of these techniques, rapid diagnostics and remote specialist support, allowed a large outbreak of gastroenteritis to be safely and effectively managed during the response to the Ebola virus disease epidemic in Sierra Leone.","284":"","285":"To identify and explore features of ethical issues that senior clinicians faced as deployed medical directors (DMDs) to the British Field Hospital in Afghanistan as well as to determine the ethical training requirements for future deployments.

Phase 2 included focus groups and an interview with 13 DMDs. Phase 1 identified working with limited resources, dual conflict of meeting both clinical and military obligations and consent of children as the most prevalent ethical challenges. Themes found in Phase 2 included sharing clinical responsibilities with clinicians from other countries and not knowing team members' ways of working, in addition to the themes from Phase 1. This study has drawn together examples of scenarios to form a repository that will aid future training.

Over the last few years, progress has been made in the management of such injuries, especially with the use of damage control resuscitation concepts. The early application of these procedures, on the field, may constitute the best opportunity to improve survival from combat injury during remote operations. Currently available literature relating to trauma-induced coagulopathy treatment and far-forward transfusion was identified by searches of electronic databases. The level of evidence and methodology of the research were reviewed for each article. The appropriateness for field utilisation of each medication was then discussed to take into account the characteristics of remote military operations. In tactical situations, in association with haemostatic procedures (tourniquet, suture, etc), tranexamic acid should be the first medication used according to the current guidelines. The use of fibrinogen concentrate should also be considered for patients in haemorrhagic shock, especially if point-of-care (POC) testing of haemostasis or shock severity is available. If POC evaluation is not available, it seems reasonable to still administer this treatment after clinical assessment, particularly if the evacuation is delayed. In this situation, lyophilised plasma may also be given as a resuscitation fluid while respecting permissive hypotension. Whole blood transfusion in the field deserves special attention. In addition to the aforementioned treatments, if the field care is prolonged, whole blood transfusion must be considered if it does not delay the evacuation.

In addition, the effects and outcome of combined arterial and venous injuries versus arterial injury alone are compared. All adults with extremity vascular injuries admitted to a military base hospital during an 8-month period were prospectively recorded and those with a venous injury were analysed. A total of 123 vascular injuries were recorded in the study period, of which 70 had a venous injury, combined with an arterial injury in 58 (83%) and in isolation in 12 (17%). There were 43 transections, 26 lateral tears and a single through and through penetrating injury. Twenty-five (36%) vein injures were repaired and 45 ligated. Only six popliteal veins were repaired in 21 lower limbs that underwent arterial revascularisation. In the combined arterial\/venous injuries group 13 primary amputations were performed and five delayed amputations were necessary. There were no amputations in the isolated venous injury group. There were three deaths (4.3%), 18 infections with four cultures positive for pseudomonas species, five arterial graft thromboses were recorded. There were significantly more blood transfusions and concomitant skeletal injuries, resulting in more amputations, in combined arterial and venous injuries in comparison with arterial injury alone (all p values&lt;0.05). In an ideal setting, venous injuries should be repaired when possible and tolerated by the patient in order to ameliorate the risk of thrombotic and infectious complications.

The proposed fuzzy logic-based algorithm takes physiological data and classifies the casualties according to their health risk level, calculated following the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) methodology. To verify the algorithm, eight different evaluation scenarios using random vital sign data have been created. In each scenario, the hypothetical condition of the victims was assessed in parallel both by the system as well as by 50 doctors with significant experience in the field. The results showed that there is high (0.928) average correlation of the classification results. This suggests that the proposed algorithm can be used for automated remote triage in real life-saving situations even before the medical team arrives at the spot, and shorten the response times. Moreover, an additional study has been conducted in order to increase the computational efficiency of the algorithm, without compromising the quality of the classification results.

Royal Centre for Defence Medicine personnel augmented NHS therapy provision, gaining significant experience in rehabilitating complex trauma. Multidisciplinary working was key to delivering this service, with a unique rehabilitation coordinating officer position established to manage the rehabilitation pathway. A military exercise rehabilitation instructor provided daily gym-based rehabilitation, developing exercise tolerance. Emphasis was placed on early independence, reducing pain, eliminating complications and optimising function. Innovative solutions and non-standard combinations of rehabilitation were required, with therapy working practices redesigned that, we believe, exceed provision elsewhere, including novel applications such as unique patient transfers, specialist seating, additional equipment, problem-solving teaching and early upper limb prosthetic provision. Active pain management allowed engagement in rehabilitation. With limited evidence available, therapeutic modalities attempting to alleviate phantom limb pain centred on patients' ability to engage in treatment. Finally, the requirement to measure change in early trauma rehabilitation was identified, leading to the development of the preprosthetic functional outcome measure.

Instead of reporting official decision for malingering, the military physicians apply alternative procedures for suspected malingerers. In countries where the military service is compulsory, prevalence of malingering is estimated to be higher (approximately 5-25%). The problem of malingering is often underestimated due to the fact it is usually overlooked.

At the beginning of the outbreak, no one could have predicted just how far-reaching its effects would be. The EVD epidemic proved to be a unique and unusual humanitarian and public health crisis. It caused worldwide fear that impeded the rapid response required to contain it early. The situation in Sierra Leone (SL) forced the formation of a unique series of civil-military interagency relationships to be formed in order to halt the epidemic. Civil-military cooperation in humanitarian situations is not unique to this crisis; however, the slow response, the unusual nature of the battle itself and the uncertainty of the framework required to fight this deadly virus created a situation that forced civilian and military organisations to form distinct, cooperative relationships. The unique nature of the Ebola virus necessitated a steering away from normal civil-military relationships and standard pillar responses. National and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs), Department for International Development (DFID) and the SL and UK militaries were required to disable this deadly virus (as of 7 November 2015, SL was declared EVD free). This paper draws on personal experiences and preliminary distillation of information gathered in formal interviews. It discusses some of the interesting features of the interagency relationships, particularly between the military, the UK's DFID, international organisations, NGOs and departments of the SL government. The focus is on how these relationships were key to achieving a coordinated solution to EVD in SL both on the ground and within the larger organisational structure.

A six-item questionnaire designed to identify recruits likely to be subject to premature dismissal on psychological or psychiatric grounds was developed and prospectively validated. The questionnaire was based on an analysis of medical and psychiatric\/psychological records of 26 recruits dismissed from a SF recruitment school. Six items were identified that appeared to have prognostic value for early discharge. These six questions were submitted to the remaining applicants in the recruitment school by a suitably qualified psychologist or psychiatrist and effectively identified candidates who would be discharged early. Based on these results a 0-6 scale was developed and applied prospectively to subsequent Grenadier recruitment courses. Statistical analysis showed that 75% of candidates with the lowest scores would eventually complete the course and that no candidates with highest scores would subsequently complete the recruitment course. Prospective studies in subsequent recruitment courses candidates with high scores were classified as not qualified to enter the course, and those with intermediate scores were subject to additional in-depth interviews with a psychologist or psychiatrist to determine their suitability. In the following courses a correlation was established between the questionnaire score and week of discharge for those discharged.

The goal of the Ebola virus disease treatment unit (EVDTU) was to provide care to affected HCWs and a beacon to attract and engage foreign HCWs to work in one of the international non-governmental organisation Ebola treatment centres in Sierra Leone. We focus on the CAF experience at the Kerry Town Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone in particular on the various clinical skill sets demonstrated in physicians, nurses and medical technicians deployed to the EVDTU. We outline some of the staffing challenges that arose and suggest that the necessary clinical skills needed to effectively manage patients with EVD in an austere environment can be shared across a small and diverse team of healthcare providers.

Over 50% of casualties were treated at the Royal London Hospital where clinicians witnessed large numbers of severely injured patients. In some casualties human biological foreign material was found embedded in the soft tissue originating from the suicide bombers or other casualties. This had the potential of placing individuals at risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases. Advances in the fields of medicine and biology have led to increased survivorship in the context of trauma and mass casualty incidents. This has resulted in the emergence of ethical scenarios surrounding patient management. A systematic review of the literature of the 7\/7 bombings, and suicide bombings reported globally, where biological implantation is noted, was performed to examine the medicolegal issues arising during such attack. Twelve casualties with human tissue implanted were recorded in the 7\/7 bombings. While all patients at risk were given prophylaxis based on recommendations by the Health Protection Agency, several ethical considerations surfaced as a result. In this paper, we compare the sequence of events and the management process of the victims of the 7\/7 bombings and the evidence-based research regarding blood-borne infection transmission. Furthermore, it explores the ethical dilemmas, experienced by the senior author on 7\/7, surrounding prophylaxis for blood-borne diseases and protocols to avoid confusion over best practice in future bombing incidents.","328":"Concerns have been raised about the level of support available to those families who provide unpaid care for wounded, injured or sick (WIS) personnel in the UK.

A systematic review of the literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method. The openly accessible literature was reviewed to investigate military head injuries and their severity. Fifty-four sources were identified that included pertinent openly accessible information relevant to this topic. Limited injury data exist for non-ballistic head injuries for UK forces, although some international data exist for parachutists. The majority of fatal head injuries are due to projectiles penetrating through the face rather than through the area of the head covered by the helmet. Penetrating head injuries are primarily caused by fragments, but helmets are more commonly perforated by high-energy rifle bullets than by fragments. No reports of a BHBT injury have been located in the literature. The description of body segment varies among articles and this makes comparisons among datasets difficult. There is a lack of detail regarding the precise position and severity of injuries, and long-term outcome for casualties. It is demonstrated that wearing military helmets reduces fatalities on and off the battlefield. The risk of BHBT injuries is widely referred to, but evidence of their occurrence is not provided by the authors that describe the risk of BHBT occurring. Further research into the causes and severity of head injuries would be useful for designers of military helmets and other associated personal protective equipment, particularly as advances in materials technology means lighter, thinner and more protective helmets are achievable.

This is a retrospective study examining the effect of the 2014-2015 Ebola virus epidemic on surgical activity in a Sierra Leone's main teaching hospital. The impact of national and local events on surgical provision is illustrated by the experience of Connaught Hospital, Freetown Sierra Leone. Surgical activity fell dramatically in August 2014, the month when the most health care workers died and continued to fall to just 3% of expected activity. Two of eight surgeons at Connaught Hospital died of Ebola. The example of Connaught Hospital serves as a graphic and poignant illustration of the difficulties faced by surgeons in low resource settings when dealing with the acute effects of a natural disaster. In any future epidemic, high levels of preparedness, training and protection, in addition to liaison with public health teams early in an epidemic, may allow surgeons to carry out at least some of their duties without the very high levels of personal risk seen here.In a country with so few specialists the loss of 25% is disastrous and will result in long term capacity reduction.

Mandatory annual medical appraisal of all DMS doctors was introduced in 2002. The General Medical Council (GMC) introduced licences to practise in November 2011. Revalidation went live in December 2012. In the 2013-2014 appraisal year, there were 1379 DMS doctors. The Responsible Officers (ROs) of the RN, Army, RAF, MOD and Defence Postgraduate Medical Deanery (DPMD) provide appraisal and revalidation services for doctors within their DBs. In the 2013-2014 appraisal year, 82% of DMS doctors completed an annual appraisal. ROs provided positive revalidation recommendations for 90% of DMS doctors without the need for additional supporting information. Additional supporting evidence was required for 10% of DMS trained doctors, but ultimately 100% of DMS doctors due revalidation in the 2013-2014 appraisal year received a positive recommendation. To assist DMS compliance with GMC quality assurance requirements, HQ Surgeon General now maintains a central database of appraisal and revalidation data across the five DMS DBs.

The MOD divided the threat into three risk categories: risk from disease and non-battle injury, Ebola risk for non-clinical duties and Ebola risk for healthcare workers. Overall risk management was directed and monitored by the OP GRITROCK Force Health Protection Board. There were six cases of malaria, four outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease, two needlestick injuries in Ebola-facing healthcare workers, one MOD Ebola case and five non-needlestick, high-risk exposures. This experience reinforces the requirement for the Defence Medical Services to have a high level of organisational competence to advise on Force Health Protection for the MOD.

The three most affected countries, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, have faced enormous challenges in controlling transmission and providing clinical care for patients with EVD. The Chinese government, in response to the requests of the WHO and the governments of the affected countries, responded rapidly by deploying Chinese military medical teams (CMMTs) to the areas struck by the deadly epidemic. A total of three CMMTs, comprising 115 military medical professionals, were rotationally deployed to Freetown, Sierra Leone to assist with infection prevention and control, clinical care and health promotion and training. Between 1 October 2014 and 22 March 2015, the CMMTs in Sierra Leone admitted and treated a total of 773 suspected and 285 confirmed EVD cases. Among the 285 confirmed cases, 146 (51.2%) patients survived after treatment. In addition, the CMMTs maintained the record of zero infections among healthcare workers and zero cross-infections between quarantined patients. In this manuscript, we aim to give an overview of the mission, and share our best practices experience on predeployment preparedness, EVD holding and treatment centre building and EVD case management.

A cross-sectional study was conducted consisting of two study phases. During phase 1, a questionnaire was undertaken via the telephone with nine female ex-Service personnel (all under 55 years of age) using clinical screening measures to identify the probable presence of the following mental health disorders: depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD, PTSD Checklist-Civilian) and alcohol misuse (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test). In phase 2, eight of the participants were interviewed face to face regarding the impact being visually impaired had had on their daily lives. Approximately 1 in 10 women screened positive for probable depression, probable PTSD or alcohol misuse; 1 in 5 fulfilled the criteria for probable anxiety disorder. Participants struggled to adjust to the loss of vision and its impact on their lives. They reported low self-esteem, feeling down and social withdrawal. As time went by, the women were able to apply various coping strategies such as having a positive attitude, relearning skills and integrating low vision aids in their daily routine. However, some coping strategies, such as alcohol misuse and lack of help-seeking when needed, hindered participants' success in adjusting to their visual impairment. Sustaining a visual impairment negatively affects psychosocial well-being in female ex-Service personnel. Over time, participants learnt to cope with the challenges and limitations associated with being visually impaired.

Principal component analysis was used to identify the key components of stigma\/BTC. The relationship between psychological symptoms, the stigma\/BTC components and help seeking were examined. Two components were identified: 'potential loss of personal military credibility and trust' (stigma Component 1, five items, 49.4% total model variance) and 'negative perceptions of mental health services and barriers to help seeking' (Component 2, six items, 11.2% total model variance). Component 1 was endorsed by 37.8% and Component 2 by 9.4% of personnel. Component 1 was associated with both assessed and subjective mental health, medical appointments and admission to hospital. Stigma Component 2 was associated with subjective and assessed mental health but not with medical appointments. Neither component was associated with help-seeking for subjective psycho-social problems. Potential loss of credibility and trust appeared to be associated with help-seeking for medical reasons but not for help-seeking for subjective psychosocial problems.

In particular it established which aspects of wound healing had the greatest impact in relation to living with a wound and the effect that military cohesion had on their recovery. The study was undertaken within the interpretivistic paradigm and followed an ethnographic design using semi-structured interviews. It contributes to the theoretical understanding of rehabilitation of the combat injured as no other study has been undertaken in this area in the UK. It captured the responses of this unique group as they reach the end of their journey through rehabilitation and detailed their reflections on the challenges they had faced and overcome. Analysis revealed that complications including infection, pain, foreign bodies and further surgery prevented the wounds from healing. The participants found this frustrating and they further highlighted time as an important factor in their journey.

Days are lost in training due to foot problems, most commonly blisters, causing a loss of working\/training days with a resultant low morale and a financial loss to the army. A cohort of Phase One British Army recruits completed a questionnaire in week 3 of training to identify previous and current foot problems and assess what education on the topic they received during their training. Also, 43 foot risk assessment tools were used by the medical staff to identify incidence, severity and working days lost. Questionnaires were completed by 31 instructors to gain data on prevention and management of foot problems. Focus groups were conducted among instructors to investigate their knowledge of prevention and management, and problems identified among recruits. A lack of formal training on foot care exists among recruits and instructors. Blisters were reported to be the main foot problem, and army-issue boots were reported to be the main cause of problems. Sizing of boots was inconsistent, and manufacturers can vary in their sizings. There were no policies available, and only one lesson on foot care was given. Currently, no policies exist on foot care at the Army Training Regiment (ATR). Foot clinics were available daily, and blisters and foot problems were already present; therefore, foot education is required in the early stages of training. The field craft exercise resulted in half of the recruits reporting blisters. Poor foot hygiene remained a problem when recruits arrived at the ATR for their training. Foot care instruction included in the training would reduce days and hours lost in training.

Although the DMS is not doctrinally staffed to deal with children on operations, severely ill and injured paediatric casualties continue to present to military medical facilities; therefore, staff must be competent to deliver the appropriate level of care. This paper reports the paediatric presentations to the emergency department (ED), at the Role 3 Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, over a 21-month period. The aim was to provide quantitative, statistical data of paediatric presentations seen by deployed ED nurses, to identify whether the current training was appropriate and to make recommendations for further training requirements for DMS ED nurses. All paediatric presentations to the MTF ED between January 2011 and September 2012 were analysed. The following aspects of the admission were analysed: date of admission, mechanism of injury, injury sustained, discharge, length of stay in the ED and length of stay in the R3. There were 159 paediatric presentations to the ED in 2011 of which 56% warranted admission to the intensive treatment unit (ITU). In contrast, over the shorter period in 2012, 79% of 73 paediatric presentations were admitted to the ITU. The most common mechanism of injury was hostile action. 13% of the patients who presented to the ED in 2011 did not survive to discharge, compared with 11% the following year. Although the exposure to paediatric polytrauma during the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq is not replicated in peace time roles, it is likely that wherever emergency nurses are deployed the treatment of children will continue. Analysis of the service evaluation has led to the recommendations for specific skills that emergency nurses could develop during the pre-deployment phase to better prepare for caring for such patients. These include recognition of the sick child\/triage, paediatric drug calculations, awareness of the massive transfusion requirements for children and skills to gain intravenous\/intraosseous access in a child.

When their partner was available, mothers contacted health services as a last resort, once all other avenues had been exhausted. However, in contrast, in their partners' absence, they were contacted as a first resort. An algorithm was generated from the findings, which illustrates the importance of ascertaining whether the mother is alone at the time of the consultation.

If a General Duties Medical Officer (GDMO) is nominated to support future operations, the provision of assured patient care and supervision within GMC guidelines, while ensuring career progression and ongoing education, may prove a challenge. Recently published British Army Policy aims to provide a framework to meet these challenges. The authors' first-hand experience in implementing this policy is explored further. The deployment of a remotely supervised GDMO, in line with British Army Policy, is both suitable and safe. This should assure quality medical care delivery during the era of Army Contingency Operations.

The Threshold Assessment Grid (TAG) is a brief structured assessment tool which is applied to written referrals with the aim of identifying the severity of mental illness and suitability for further psychological treatment by assessing perceived risk, safety concerns and clinical factors. The TAG criteria were used to structure a brief TAG-triage face-to-face assessment. As the use of triage has not been evaluated within a military occupational mental health service, differences in clinical and occupational outcomes were compared following either standard face-to-face assessment or receipt of TAG-triage interview among members of the UK Armed Forces who were referred for mental health assessment. During a period of service development, 56.6% of patients referred to a military mental health team received TAG-triage assessment (n=419) and 43.5% were assessed as usual (n=323). There were no significant differences in rank, age, sex and Service background between patients allocated to the two forms of assessment. Patients presenting following acts of deliberate self-harm were as likely to receive TAG-triage as they were to undergo standard assessment, suggesting that clinicians were willing to use TAG-triage for more challenging cases. Patients receiving TAG-triage were as likely to receive further therapy and be allocated a clinical diagnosis as those undergoing standard assessment. Short-term and longer-term occupational outcomes following discharge from care, represented by medical fitness to carry out one's military role, were similar among the TAG-triage and standard assessment groups. TAG-triage appeared to offer a viable alternative to standard face-to-face mental health assessment and could promote more efficient use of clinical time. ","389":"Defence Primary Health Care (DPHC) as an organisation has the responsibility for the provision of a basic level of sexual health service that every patient can access, regardless of their geographical location. The Military Advice and Sexual Health\/HIV service (MASHH), based in Birmingham, provides nationally validated sexual health training and accreditation. Training was delivered to an isolated DPHC region to allow as many doctors and nurses to attend and minimised associated travel and accommodation costs. This training initiative enabled military personnel to access sexual health services within their own medical centres and reduced the number of potential referrals to local services. To assess compliance with the relevant standards, MASHH audited the DPHC region 2 months following completion of training. This was to ensure that the level 1 sexual health service provided by the DPHC region met with current British Association of Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) Standards. Provision of sexual health services in the four medical centres in the DPHC region were assessed for a 6-month period against the standards set by BASHH. Few of the audit standards were met; this was in part due to personnel undertaking sexual health consultations who had not been appropriately trained and partly due to unrecognised deficiencies in the DPHC computer coding systems. Overall, this programme demonstrates a potential model for the cost-effective roll-out of accredited sexual health training and resultant service provision for other DPHC regions, but some changes are needed to ensure national standards are met. ","390":"While the pace of traumatic brain injury (TBI) research has accelerated, the treatment options remain limited. Clinical trials are yet to yield successful treatment options, leading to innovative strategies to overcome the severe debilitating consequences of TBI. Stem cells may act as a potential treatment option. They have two key characteristics, the ability of self-renewal and the ability to give rise to daughter cells, which in the case of neural stem cells (NSCs) includes neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. They respond to the injury environment providing trophic support and have been shown to differentiate and integrate into the host brain. In this review, we introduce the notion of an NSC and describe the two neurogenic niches in the mammalian brain. The literature supporting the activation of an NSC in rodent models of TBI, both in vivo and in vitro, is detailed. This endogenous activation of NSCs may be augmented by exogenous transplantation of NSCs. Delivery of NSCs to assist the host nervous system has become an attractive option, with either fetal or adult NSC. This has resulted in cognitive and functional improvement in rodents, and current animal studies are using human NSCs. While no NSC clinical trials are currently ongoing for TBI, this review touches upon other neurological diseases and discuss how this may move forward into TBI.

The epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in the Armed Forces coupled with the high physical demand placed on the cardiovascular system, often in remote locations make screening desirable. This is particularly pertinent as servicemen and women die from cardiovascular disease each year. To evaluate this particular screening system it is essential to understand the aim of the system, how it is designed and how screening systems in general are evaluated. The efficacy of a screening test is quantified using the measurements of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios. These measurements are defined and the pitfalls associated with evaluating a screening system are described. The different screening tests used to identify cardiac disease and their individual strengths and weaknesses, are illustrated. Finally the article reviews the previous British Army recruit cardiac screening system, that used a stereotyped history and physical examination and the newer system that replaced it, which includes the incorporation of the 12-lead ECG and on site echocardiography in individuals revealing abnormalities on history, examination or ECG. ","393":"","394":"Body armour is a type of equipment worn by military personnel that aims to prevent or reduce the damage caused by ballistic projectiles to structures within the thorax and abdomen. Such injuries remain the leading cause of potentially survivable deaths on the modern battlefield. Recent developments in computer modelling in conjunction with a programme to procure the next generation of UK military body armour has provided the impetus to re-evaluate the optimal anatomical coverage provided by military body armour against high energy projectiles. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify those anatomical structures within the thorax and abdomen that if damaged were highly likely to result in death or significant long-term morbidity. These structures were superimposed upon two designs of ceramic plate used within representative body armour systems using a computerised representation of human anatomy. Those structures requiring essential medical coverage by a plate were demonstrated to be the heart, great vessels, liver and spleen. For the 50th centile male anthropometric model used in this study, the front and rear plates from the Enhanced Combat Body Armour system only provide limited coverage, but do fulfil their original requirement. The plates from the current Mark 4a OSPREY system cover all of the structures identified in this study as requiring coverage except for the abdominal sections of the aorta and inferior vena cava. Further work on sizing of plates is recommended due to its potential to optimise essential medical coverage.

The effect of this is to increase the likelihood of developing dangerous ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes or ventricular fibrillation. Common examples of the pharmacological agents associated include antibiotics, antiemetics and antimalarials. Genetic predisposition, electrolyte disturbance, anaesthesia and trauma may exacerbate the proarrhythmic effect of these medications. Screening of recruits does not detect all those with a genetic predisposition to drug-associated arrhythmias, so vigilance in preventing this iatrogenic disorder and recognising and appropriately managing it when present is important.

The pericardium is associated with several disease syndromes that occasionally affect the military population. These include acute and recurrent pericarditis, pericardial effusion and tamponade, which may result from a large number of different aetiological agents. Pericardial diseases have a wide range of clinical manifestations and the diagnosis of pericardial diseases can be a challenge. This article reviews the anatomy and pathophysiology of pericarditis and pericardial effusions before outlining their clinical features, recommended investigations and management options. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of these diseases for patients in a military occupational environment.

In this article, we review the pathophysiology and clinical presentations of AF and describe appropriate investigations and management likely to be appropriate for a military population, in line with current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and European Society of Cardiology guidelines. The implications for the individual's Medical Employment Standard in the UK Armed Forces, with specific reference to specific military occupational activities such as aviation, diving and driving occupationally, are also reviewed. ","401":"Myocarditis, simply defined as inflammation of the heart muscle, is a commonly encountered cardiac disease in primary and secondary care, both in the UK and on Operational deployments. In the UK Armed Forces, myocarditis results in deaths as well as the premature termination of military careers on medical grounds. The aetiology is usually the result of a number of infectious aetiologies with viruses being the most common pathogens in the vast majority of cases. However, it may also be the result of autoimmune activation, chemical or pharmacological toxins, environmental insult or hypersensitivity reactions. Particular aetiologies that are more likely to be seen in a military population are discussed and include certain infections, smallpox vaccine, and hyperthermia and hypothermia. The clinical features can be highly variable ranging from an asymptomatic infection to fulminant heart failure. Features pertinent to the military doctor, including the natural history, investigative modalities and management strategies, with a particular emphasis on the occupational impact of myocarditis in the UK Armed Forces are reviewed.

This paper is a clinical review focused on military epidemiology, evidence-based recommendations for prevention, diagnosis and management of VTE and occupational considerations in a military population. A literature review was conducted through Pubmed and Embase for systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials relating to VTE. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, British Thoracic Society and the American College of Chest Physicians were reviewed and recommendations considered. Acute morbidity from VTE can range from limb pain and swelling to life-threatening cardiovascular compromise. Long-term sequelae include postthrombotic syndrome, chronic thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension. Diagnosis should follow a validated pathway depending on the patient's prerest probability. The management of the condition should vary with attention to risk stratification. Prompt initiation of anticoagulation reduces symptoms, rates of recurrent VTE and death but treatment must be balanced against the risk of major haemorrhage. Military operations expose personnel to a unique combination of risk factors for VTE and operating in austere environments can increase the challenge of diagnosis, prognostication and management. Furthermore, there are implications for troop attrition, operational readiness and return to work.

This paper reviews current evidence pertaining to the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease from a military perspective, encompassing stable angina and acute coronary syndromes. Emphasis is placed on the limitations inherent in the management of acute coronary syndromes in the deployed environment. Occupational issues affecting patients with coronary artery disease are reviewed. Consideration is also given to the potential for coronary artery disease screening in the military, and the management of modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors, to help decrease the prevalence of coronary artery disease in the military population.

It is defined as a transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion, characterised by a rapid onset, short duration and a spontaneous and complete recovery. While the symptom of syncope is easily elicited, discovering the mechanism can be more problematic and may require a plethora of diagnostic tests. The aim of this paper is to review current evidence pertaining to the classification, investigation and management of syncope, from a military perspective. Emphasis is placed on assisting primary healthcare professionals in the assessment and management of syncope, in the UK and on operations, while providing explicit guidance on risk. The occupational limitations required in safely managing patients with syncope are stressed along with the potential long-term limitations.

In the majority of cases, the cause is considered to be a malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia, which can be precipitated by a number of underlying pathologies. Conversely, a tachyarrhythmia may have a more benign and treatable cause, yet the initial clinical symptoms may be similar, making differentiation difficult. This is an overview of the mechanisms underlying the initiation and propagation of arrhythmias and the various pathological conditions that predispose to arrhythmia genesis, classified according to which parts of the heart are involved: atrial tachyarrhythmias, atrial and ventricular, as well as those affecting the ventricles alone. It encompasses atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardias and ventricular tachycardias, including the more commonly encountered inherited primary electrical diseases, also known as the channelopathies. The clinical features, investigation and management strategies are outlined. The occupational impact-in serving military personnel and potential recruits-is described, with explanations relating to the different conditions and their specific implication on continued military service. ","407":"When the general public look from the outside at the armed services, their impression is often one of earnest young men and women who are the pinnacle of physical fitness and health, and put their lives on the line for their country. There is usually sadness and respect for those killed on active operations, having put themselves in harm's way. Therefore, when the public discover that more than 1 in 10 deaths in the UK Armed Forces are due to cardiovascular disease, the air of sadness is invariably replaced with surprise and disbelief. These figures, while lower than those due to deaths in accidents, are approaching the numbers of those due to suicide in the armed services; yet deaths from cardiac disease are barely recognised by society, in spite of many of them being avoidable. This article reviews the epidemiology of cardiac disease in the UK Armed Forces, both in terms of morbidity and mortality. It outlines current understanding and gaps in the knowledge regarding the burden of cardiovascular disease in the military population. The particular demographics of the Armed Forces and its influence on cardiac disease burden are discussed. The role of inherited and congenital diseases in younger servicemen and women is highlighted, as is the trend that with increasing age, the burden of disease shifts to ischaemic heart disease, which becomes the dominant cause of both death and disability.

National Organ Retrieval Service teams need skilled surgeons, and a mutually beneficial partnership is in prospect. ","409":"Thoracic aortic disease is an important contributor to arterial disease and therefore, mortality in the UK. It has close associations with hypertension, atherosclerosis and genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome. The cardiovascular consequences of acute aortic dissection or the rupture of a thoracic aneurysm are life threatening with a 1% increase in mortality per hour with a type A aortic dissection and a high 30-day mortality rate. The clinical diagnosis can be difficult for the general physician as the symptoms can mimic more common conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism or acute abdomen. The investigations that carry the highest sensitivity and specificity, CT, transoesophageal echocardiography and MRI are not usually first-line investigations in most patients so a high index of clinical suspicion is key. The management of acute aortic syndromes involves good initial resuscitation and early discussion with the cardiothoracic surgeons. Given the serious consequences of acute aortic syndromes, it is important for all military doctors to be aware of these presentations and to appreciate the difficulties that can be encountered when trying to accurately diagnose them. Routine medicals, particularly entrance medicals, present a unique clinical opportunity to recognise the clinical features that would warrant further investigation and specialist advice. ","410":"'Palpitations' include a broad range of symptoms relating to the perception of abnormal activity of the heart. They may reflect an underlying arrhythmia or a hyperawareness of normal cardiac activity caused by stress or anxiety. The challenge to a clinician assessing patients with palpitations is to assess the likely cause of symptoms, to stratify the individual patient risk and to choose the correct management strategy delivered with appropriate urgency. The young military population, subject to increased exposure to environmental stress, is at an increased risk of palpitations. Due to the distracting nature of this symptom and the frequently sudden and unheralded onset, a common consequence is medical downgrading. This article will provide a guide to assessing the heterogeneous group presenting with palpitations and how to both establish the cause and identify the correct treatment for each patient in a timely manner.

Fifty per cent of IE cases develop in patients with no known history of valve disease. It is therefore important to remain vigilant to the possibility of the diagnosis in patients with a febrile illness and unknown source. From a military perspective, our patients are unique due to the breadth of pathogens they are exposed to, and blood-culture-negative IE is a risk. In particular, there should be awareness of Coxiella burnetii as a possible causative pathogen.

It appears that soldiers are choosing to forego PHP. This audit aimed to evaluate the effect of health promotion activity on the use of hearing protection in hostile territory. 46 dismounted infantry soldiers operating out of a forward operating base in Afghanistan during Op HERRICK 17 were directly observed in order to determine the rate of wearing PHP before and after health promotion activity. In the initial phase, 39% of soldiers (range 16-74%) wore PHP in at least one ear, but following health promotion activity the rate fell to 12% (range 9-14%). The reduction in the wearing of PHP appears to have been because the perceived diminished threat of enemy contact was outweighed by any benefit of health promotion activity. Reasons for poor compliance were not investigated, but it appears that behavioural factors, and specifically, leadership at the smallest unit level, are important. These should be investigated and considered in the development of future PHP.

Accelerated resolution therapy (ART) is an emerging psychotherapy that provides fast and lasting resolution for mental health problems such as PTSD. ART has been shown to achieve a positive result in one to five sessions, typically over a 2-week period, and requires no homework, skills practice or repeated exposure to targeted events. Initial research, including one randomised control trial, has demonstrated that ART interventions can significantly reduce symptoms of psychological trauma in both civilians and US service members and veterans. These results suggest that ART be considered as either a primary treatment option or for refractory PTSD in those with a suboptimal response to endorsed first-line therapies. Conservative estimates indicate substantial potential cost savings in PTSD treatment. Despite the need for more definitive clinical trials, there is increasing interest in ART in the USA, including in the US Army. The growing positive empirical evidence is compelling, and there appears to be sufficient evidence to warrant UK researchers undertaking ART research. The armed forces offer the potential for comparative international trials. However, equally important are veterans, emergency services personnel and those subjected to violence. ART appears to also have application in other conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders, and alcohol or drug misuse. ART can potentially help personnel traumatised by the unique challenges of war and conflict zones by providing brief psychotherapy in a readily accessible and culturally competent manner. ART facilitates the provision of interventions and resolutions in theatre, thus enhancing forces' fighting capability.

However, until recently automobile radiology units were assumed to be used for the first time during World War I. Historical archives and reports were researched, and extensive research in available literature was also conducted. The automobile radiology units were purchased from France and were probably constructed under the guidance of Marie Curie (1867-1934). The figure of Dr. Dimitrios Vasilidis (?-1937), a pioneer in Radiology in Greece and the first president of the Hellenic Radiological Society, is highlighted. This short historical note describes the first use of a mobile radiology unit during the Balkan Wars (1912-1913), predating its previously presumed first use in World War I.

In spite of the publication of several reviews in the last decade on the topic of exercise performance\/sports and creatine there is a need for an update related to the military given the lack of information in this area. The aim of this study was to critically assess original research addressing the use of creatine supplements in the military. A search of the electronic databases PubMed and SPORTDiscus, for the following key words: military personnel, trainees, recruit, soldier, physical fitness, physical conditioning, creatine supplementation, creatine ingestion, nutritional supplements to identify surveys and randomised clinical trials from journal articles and technical reports investigating the effect of creatine supplementation on military populations. Thirty-three out of 90 articles examined the use of creatine as a dietary supplement in military personnel. Twenty-one studies were finally selected on the basis of stated inclusion criteria for military surveys and randomised clinical trials. Most of the surveys (15\/17) in the military indicate a high popularity of creatine (average 27%) among supplement users. In contrast, in most of the exercise protocols used (6\/9) during randomised clinical trials creatine has produced a non-significant performance-enhancing effect. Creatine is one of the most widely used supplemental compounds in the military. It is not considered a doping infraction or related to any adverse health effects but its long-term usage needs further investigation. Experimental research suggests that creatine supplementation does not enhance physical performance in the military. However, limitations in creatine dosage, military fitness testing and sample group selection might have underestimated the ergogenic properties of creatine.

In the interest of 'force protection' and optimising operations, a key component of UN PKOs is healthcare and medical treatment. The expectation is that UN PKO medical support will conform to the general intent and structure of UN PKOs. To do so requires effective policies and planning informed by a review of medical aspects crucial to UN PKOs. The intent of this article is to report on a review of principal medical aspects practical to post-Cold War UN PKOs. This review was assembled through a comprehensive, grounded, systematic iterative inquiry of open-source articles. This inquiry revealed that the principal medical aspects in post-Cold War UN missions were the following: (1) the changed nature of UN PKOs, (2) new challenges in terms of proximity and distance to medical care, (3) expanded need for preventive medicine and disease contagion prevention and (4) increased propensity for psychological morbidity and need for intervention. Post Cold War, the dramatically changed nature of UN PKOs has resulted in new challenges mainly in terms of medical logistics, preventive medicine and psychiatry. The changed nature of post-Cold War UN PKOs altered the character of medical support most notably regarding (1) a need for emphasis on immediate response proximate to medical events and rapid transport over long distances and traversing barriers to higher levels of care, (2) proactive contagion and hazard identification and prevention and (3) interventions designed to reduce psychological morbidity. Recommendations are offered about possible courses of action in terms of addressing trends found in identified medical aspects of PKOs.

All the asymptomatic contralateral hips had femoral neck stress fractures diagnosed by screening MRI. Tension type and displaced femoral neck fractures were treated surgically. All the fractures managed healing without complications. Military recruits with unilateral groin pain should have an early referral for MRI hip to rule out femoral neck stress fractures and those military personnel with ipsilateral femoral neck fracture should have MRI of the contralateral hip.

Historically, there have been concerns that invasive analgesic techniques could carry an increased risk of infection, due to the mechanism of injury and the environmental conditions in which the injuries were sustained. Consequently, the epidural and continuous peripheral nerve blockade (CPNB) catheters that were inserted in UK military personnel during a 33-month period of Op HERRICK were clinically and microbiologically examined, after subsequent admission to the University Hospitals Birmingham (UHB) NHS Trust. Data on epidural and CPNB insertions were collected via the specialist pain service at UHB over the study period, including de novo and replacement insertions performed in both Afghanistan and the UK. Patients were regularly reviewed and relevant clinical concerns were documented in patients' case notes as necessary. The anatomical site, duration of placement and the results of microbiological culture of the epidural and CPNB catheter tips were all recorded. Overall, 236 catheters were assessed, of which 151 catheter tips (64%) were cultured (85 epidural, 66 CPNB). Of these, 48 grew bacteria (34% of cultured epidurals and 29% of cultured CPNB). There was no difference between the colonisation rates of epidurals inserted in Afghanistan and the UK. Only one infection related to a misplaced epidural catheter was confirmed. With the exception of the epidural (34%) and proximal sciatic (42%) catheters, these figures, in a military cohort characterised by significant injury scores, are consistent with those reported for civilian surgical patients.

He underwent elective resection of the first rib, and has now returned to normal duties. After review of the literature on UEDVT, it is suggested that in this military patient, the occurrence of an anatomical variant put him at risk of upper limb venous thrombosis, which was probably potentiated by the occupational factor of carrying a rifle. The external compression of the subclavian vein from the rifle butt and hypertrophied muscles, in addition to the anatomical variation, caused repetitive microtrauma of the vessel intima, which precipitated venous thrombosis. ","439":"Exercise ASKARI SERPENT (Ex AS) is a British Army exercise that provides primary healthcare (PHC) to Kenyan civilians in support of local health authorities. It is conducted in partnership with the Kenya Defence Force Medical Services (KDFMS). Accurate epidemiological data is critical in planning the exercise and for any future short-notice contingency operations in similar environments. This paper reports epidemiological data for Ex AS using a novel data collection system. PHC on Ex AS was delivered by trained and validated combat medical technicians (CMTs) using a set of Read-coded protocols. The CMTs were also directly supported and supervised by medical officers and nurses. A total of 3093 consultations were conducted over a 16-day period. Of these, 2707 (87.5%) consultations fell within the remit of the CMT protocols, with only 386 consultations (12.5%) being conducted exclusively by the medical officers or nurses. A Read-coded matrix built on CMT protocols is a simple and useful tool, particularly in civilian populations, for collecting morbidity data with the vast majority of conditions accounted for in the protocols. It is anticipated that such a system can better inform training, manning, medical material and pharmaceutical procurement than current category-based morbidity surveillance systems such as EPINATO (NATO epidemiological data). There is clear advantage to directly linking data capture to treatment algorithms. Accuracy, both in terms of numbers and condition, is likely improved. Data is also captured contemporaneously rather than after indeterminate time. Read coding has the added benefit of being an established electronic standard. In addition, the system would support traditional reporting methods such as EPINATO by providing increased assurance.

Measures that protect vulnerable individuals and contribute to effective Immediate Treatment may reduce the impact of heat illness, but depend upon adequate understanding and awareness among Commanders and their troops. To assess risk factors for heat illness in British soldiers deployed to the hot Collective Training Environment (CTE) and to explore awareness of Immediate Treatment responses. An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to British soldiers deployed in the hot CTEs of Kenya and Canada. Responses were analysed to determine the prevalence of individual (Intrinsic) and Command-practice (Extrinsic) risk factors for heat illness and the self-reported awareness of key Immediate Treatment priorities (recognition, first aid and casualty evacuation). The prevalence of Intrinsic risk factors was relatively low in comparison with Extrinsic risk factors. The majority of respondents were aware of key Immediate Treatment responses. The most frequently reported factors in each domain were increased risk by body composition scoring, inadequate time for heat acclimatisation and insufficient briefing about casualty evacuation. Novel data on the distribution and scale of risk factors for heat illness are presented. A collective approach to risk reduction by the accumulation of 'marginal gains' is proposed for the UK military. This should focus on limiting Intrinsic risk factors before deployment, reducing Extrinsic factors during training and promoting timely Immediate Treatment responses within the hot CTE.

To identify risk factors of BPP, we also surveyed, by questionnaire, healthy recruits of a company in a training centre who had just finished night marches.

The incidence of BPP in Korean soldiers was 29.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI 17.2 to 24.3). Body mass index (BMI) was significantly lower in patients with BPP than it was in healthy recruits. Among healthy recruits, those who had experienced paresthaesia and\/or weakness during marching had a significantly lower BMI than did those who had not. We report the incidence of BPP in young Korean soldiers. A low BMI was a risk factor for BPP.

LARC has been proven to be more cost effective than the combined oral contraceptive pill. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has released guidelines on contraception provision to ensure all women receive the contraception method that is most appropriate to the individual. A retrospective audit of 105 sets of primary healthcare notes of serving female soldiers was assessed to establish contraceptive choices and whether appropriate information had been provided within the last year of their last consultation. 100% had seen a healthcare provider capable of providing contraceptive advice in the last year. 69% documented as using some form of non-surgical contraception versus 58% quoted as national usage. 21% were using some form of LARC versus 8% national usage. 66% of eligible women had not had LARC discussed with them, and of these 50% did not have any contraceptive usage documented. Among other consultations, 41% had had a medical within the year period, of which over half had no documented contraceptive status. As military healthcare providers, we have more exposure to our patients than NHS equivalents and this small study suggests there is an increased demand for contraception.

It was first described 1000 years ago in the healing of fractures, and in relation to military wounds, texts from the American Civil War and World War I refer to HO specifically. It continues to cause problems to injured service personnel; the consequences of wound and soft tissue complications in traumatic amputations pose particular problems to rehabilitation and prosthetic use. While HO is seen in rare genetic conditions, it is most prevalent after joint replacement surgery and trauma. In the civilian setting HO has been commonly described in patients after traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and burns. Militarily, as a consequence of recent operations, and the characteristic injury of blast-related amputations, a renewed interest in HO has emerged due to an increased incidence seen in casualties. The heterogeneous nature of a blast related amputation makes it difficult for a single aetiological event to be identified, although it is now accepted that blast, amputation through the zone of injury, increased injury severity and associated brain injuries are significant risk factors in HO formation. The exact cellular event leading to HO has yet to be identified, and as a consequence its prevention is restricted to the use of anti-inflammatory medication and radiation, which is often contraindicated in the acute complex military casualty. A systematic review in PubMed and the Cochrane Database identified research articles related to HO to illustrate the military problem of HO and its management, current research concepts and experimental theories regarding HO. This also served as a gap analysis providing the researchers detail of any knowledge deficit in this field, in particular to the military aspects of HO; 637 out of 7891 articles initially identified that referenced HO were relevant to this review.","490":"","491":"","492":"Many pitfalls are evident in the event that a doctor becomes a patient requiring investigation or treatment.

Contemporaneous review of a series of patients with complex abdominal wall injuries who presented to the Role 3 MTF between July and November 2012. Five patients with penetrating abdominal trauma associated with significant damage to the abdominal wall were included. All patients were managed using DCS principles, leaving the abdominal wall open at the end of the first procedure. Subsequent management of the abdominal wall was determined by a multidisciplinary team of general and plastic surgeons, intensivists and specialist nurses. The principles of management identified included minimising tissue loss on initial laparotomy by joining adjacent wounds and marginal debridement of dead tissue; contraction of the abdominal wall was minimised by using topical negative pressure dressing and dermal-holding sutures. Definitive closure was timed to allow oedema to settle and sepsis to be controlled. Closure techniques include delayed primary closure with traction sutures, components separation, and mesh closure with skin grafting. A daily multidisciplinary team discussion was invaluable for optimal decision making regarding the most appropriate means of abdominal closure. Dermal-holding sutures were particularly useful in preventing myostatic contraction of the abdominal wall. A simple flow chart was developed to aid decision making in these patients.

In the UK, the Triage Sort (TSO) is the preferred method, combining GCS, systolic BP (SBP) and RR to categorise Priority 1 casualties. The Shock Index (SI) is calculated by dividing HR by SBP (HR\/SBP). This study examines whether SI is better at predicting need for life-saving intervention (LSI) following trauma than TSO. A prospective observational study was undertaken. Physiological data and interventions performed in the Emergency Department and operating theatre were prospectively collected for 482 consecutive adult trauma patients presenting to Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, over a 6-month period. A patient was deemed to have required LSI if they received any intervention from a set described previously. Complete data were available for 345 patients (71.6%). Of these, 203 (58.8%) were gold standard P1, and 142 (41.2%) were non-P1. The TSO predicted need for LSI with a sensitivity of 58.6% (95% CI 51.8% to 65.4%) and specificity of 88.7% (95% CI 83.5% to 93.9%). Using an SI cut-off &gt;0.75 provided greater sensitivity of 70.0% (95% CI 63.6% to 76.3%) while maintaining an acceptably high (although lower than TSO) specificity of 74.7% (95% CI 67.5% to 81.8%). At this SI cut-off, there was evidence of a difference between TSO and SI in terms of the way in which patients were triaged (p&lt;0.0001). Our study showed that a SI &gt;0.75 more accurately predicted the need for LSI, while maintaining acceptable specificity. SI may be more useful than TSO for secondary triage in a mass-casualty situation; this relationship in civilian trauma should be examined to clarify whether these results can be more widely translated into civilian practice.

Casualties wearing a combat helmet were 2.7 times less likely to sustain a fragmentation wound to the head than those that were unprotected (mean AIS of 2.9 compared with 4.1). Casualties wearing a body armour vest were 4.1 times less likely to sustain a fragmentation wound to the chest or abdomen than those that were unprotected (mean AIS of 2.9 compared with 3.9). Casualties wearing pelvic protection were 10 times less likely to sustain a fragmentation wound to the pelvis compared with those that were unprotected (mean AIS of 3.4 compared with 3.9).

We recognise this technique is limited in that it only records the surface wound location and may be specific to this conflict. However, gathering electronic SWM at the same time as recording injuries for the JTTR was simple, required little extra time and therefore we would recommend its collection during future conflicts. ","532":"The period to 2035 is likely to be characterised by instability between states and in relations between groups within states. It is predicted to include climate change, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, resurgence in ideology, and shifts in power from west to east. Many of these changes are likely to have an impact on the health of civil societies and those military personnel deployed by states to counter these challenges. This paper considers the potential impact of emerging global strategic trends on health service support (HSS) in the Future Operating Environment 2035. Global Strategic Trends-Out to 2040, The Future Character of Conflict and NATO Strategic Foresight Analysis Report 2013 provide the foundations of the paper. The study concludes that future impacts on HSS are neither completely predictable nor predetermined, and there is always a possibility of a strategic shock. Knowledge of vulnerability, however, allows an informed approach to the development and evaluation of adaptive strategies to lessen risks to health. ","533":"To determine the outcome following fasciectomy for chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) in the UK military, and the association between presurgical intramuscular pressure (IMP) and outcome. All patients who underwent fasciectomy for anterior CECS were identified between 2007 and 2010. Presurgery and postsurgery military medical grading for leg function was extracted from the medical records system. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared grades before and after surgery. Spearman's rank correlation examined the relationship between IMP and outcome. Presurgery and postsurgery grading was available for 63% of patients. These patients had significantly better leg function after surgery (Z=-3.63, p&lt;0.001). Of these, 49% improved by at least one grade, 36% showed no improvement in grading and 15% had a poorer outcome. There were no significant correlations between IMP and outcome. A large proportion of patients do not return to full fitness following fasciectomy in the military population. This is in line with a recent study in the US military, but conflicts with most civilian reports. The reasons for these differences are not clear. Furthermore, the lack of a relationship between IMP and outcome questions the role of pressure in this condition. These results suggest that the role of postoperative rehabilitation protocols and other conservative options should be explored.

This article describes a prospective cohort study which investigated screening strategies for these infections among Gurkha recruits arriving in the UK to begin basic training. Several recommendations were made as a result of the study which were supported for early implementation and subsequently fully adopted. Military screening and treatment policies have been directly influenced by this research which also has translational application to similar migrant civilian populations. ","535":"Wound infection is a key determinant of outcome in survivors of armed conflict. One factor having potential for promoting healing, decreasing bacterial burden and influencing prognosis is the dressing that covers the ballistic-injured extremity. Although antiseptic and silver dressings are applied to acute wounds, evidence to support their use is scarce with no controlled studies reported of antimicrobial wound dressings in extremity trauma. Given the recent burden of ballistic extremity injury, the requirement to investigate the role of antimicrobial dressings in contaminated wounds is transparent. This paper details a programme of work undertaken at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory of developing and trialling a recovery model to investigate the early management of contaminated war wounds. A New Zealand White rabbit flexor carpi ulnaris muscle belly, isolated and then injured by a drop rig mechanism, was contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus to provide a reproducible contaminated muscle wound. This model was developed to support a series of randomised controlled trials to determine the impact of antimicrobial dressings on decreasing the bacterial burden of combat related extremity wounds. The results of the initial trial indicated that over a 48-h period, dressings augmented with antiseptic or silver offer no advantage over saline-soaked gauze in reducing the bacterial burden of a contaminated soft tissue injury. The model has subsequently been used to investigate the efficacy of dressings over a 7-day study period and impact of antibiotics and to evaluate biofilm formation and wound cytokines. ","536":"The Combat Casualty Care research programme is an integrated suite of projects designed to address Defence Medical Services' research needs for casualty care. The programme covers a broad spectrum of topics ranging from the pathophysiological and immunological impact of military relevant injuries to the effects of these disturbances on the response to early treatment. Dstl Porton Down has a long history of studying military injuries and has developed models, both in vivo and physical, to address the research needs. The work is conducted in close collaboration with clinical colleagues at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine who have direct experience of the clinical issues faced by combat casualties and insights into the potential clinical implications of emerging strategies. This article reviews progress in research areas spanning forward resuscitation, with a particular focus on blast-related injuries, trauma coagulopathy, effects of drugs on the response to haemorrhage and deployed research. A significant 'value added' component has been the underpinning of higher degrees for seconded military clinicians at Dstl Porton Down who have made a valuable contribution to the overall programme. ","537":"The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have attracted considerable political and media interest in the mental health of UK military personnel. As a result of the close operational collaboration between US and UK forces, there have inevitably been many comparisons drawn between the mental health status of the two forces. Considerable research activity suggests that the mental health of UK forces appear to have remained relatively resilient in spite of their considerable exposure to traumatic events; one stark exception to this is the high rates of alcohol misuse which seem to be related to deployment. This paper explores the recently published literature relating to UK military forces and attempts to draw conclusions about the reasons for the apparent resilience shown by the majority of the regular forces.

Previous studies have reviewed the effectiveness of various pre-hospital analgesics, but there is no record of the knowledge and confidence of the relatively medically untrained soldiers who carry and use intramuscular morphine on the battlefield. The aim of this study was to assess soldiers' knowledge and confidence of the morphine auto-injector with a view to guiding further training. Structured questionnaire distributed to soldiers in two patrol bases in Helmand Province during Op HERRICK 17. 232 questionnaires were completed by a range of ranks and trades. 100% had received mandatory training on the auto-injector and over 70% had received more advanced training. Confidence in using the auto-injector was high, with 47% rating their confidence level as 10\/10. Overall, factual knowledge was good with the mean score for the questionnaire being 7.9\/10; 95% of respondents knew how to document the use of morphine and 79% knew when a second dose could safely be administered. Some misunderstanding of contraindications was revealed: 9% of answers were incorrect, and 47% wrongly answered that administering morphine to a patient changes the triage category. The majority of soldiers received far more than the minimum required training on the use of the morphine auto-injector. Confidence in using the device is high and generally knowledge is good. The authors suggest that deployed medical personnel in forward locations maintain regular training to soldiers on the morphine auto-injector in order to ensure that casualties receive analgesia appropriately and promptly. ","540":"Protecting the neck from explosively propelled fragments has traditionally been achieved through a collar attached to the ballistic vest. An Enhanced Protection Under Body Armour Combat Shirt (EP-UBACS) collar has been identified as an additional method of providing neck protection but limited evidence as to its potential medical effectiveness exists to justify its procurement. Entry wound locations and resultant medical outcomes were determined using Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for all fragmentation neck wounds sustained by UK soldiers between 01 January 2010 and 31 December 2011. Data were prospectively entered into a novel computerised tool base and comparisons made between three EP-UBACS neck collar designs in terms of predicted reduction in AIS scores. All collars reduced AIS scores, with the greatest reduction provided by designs incorporating increased standoff from the neck and an additional semi-circle of ballistic material underneath the collar at the front and back. This technique confirms that reinforcing the neck collar of an EP-UBACS would be expected to reduce injury severity from neck wounds. However, without knowledge of entry wound locations for injuries to other body areas as well as the use of AIS scores without clinical or pathological verification its further use in the future may be limited. The ability to overlay any armour design onto a standardised human was potentially the most useful part of this tool and we would recommend developing this technique using underlying anatomical structures and not just the skin surface. ","541":"This paper addresses the computational modelling of a series of specific blast-related incidents and the relationships of clinical and engineering interpretations. The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory were tasked in 2010 by the UK Ministry of Defence to assist the Coroner's inquests into the 7 July 2005 London bombings. A three phase approach was taken. The first phase included an engineering expert in blast effects on structures reviewing photographs of the damaged carriages and bus to give a view on the likely physical effects on people close to the explosions. The second phase was a clinical review of the evidence by military clinicians to assess blast injury in the casualties. The third phase was to model the blast environment by structural dynamics experts to assess likely blast loading on victims to evaluate the potential blast loading on individuals. This loading information was then assessed by physiology experts. Once all teams (engineering, clinical and modelling\/physiological) had separately arrived at their conclusions, the information streams were integrated to arrive at a consensus. The aim of this paper is to describe the methodology used as a potential model for others to consider if faced with a similar investigation, and to show the benefit of the transition of military knowledge to a civilian environment. ","542":"Medicine has historically advanced during conflict, but military medical services have consistently regressed during peace. As over a decade of campaigning in Iraq and Afghanistan draws to a close, securing the legacy of hard won clinical lessons and retaining flexibility to adapt to new patterns of illness and injury during contingency is critical. Central to sustaining exceptional outcomes for future operations and to maintaining the current position of the Defence Medical Services as providers of clinical excellence is retaining the capability to innovate. This capability must extend across the spectrum of clinical innovation-concepts, guidelines, equipment (invention and adoption), curricula (design, assessment and refinement), research and Defence diplomacy. To achieve this requires a strategy, a 'roadmap', with a clear vision, end state and centres of gravity (core strengths that must be protected). The direction for innovation will be guided by emergent analysis of the future character of military medicine. Success will be determined by ensuring the conditions are met to protect and enhance the existing 'winning culture'. ","543":"The Defence Medical Services (DMS) primarily recruits its trained General Practitioners (GPs) from the NHS and since 1970, the number of men entering medicine has doubled whereas the number of women has increased 10-fold; female GPs will outnumber their male counterparts by 2017. This study performs a quantitative assessment of the potential impact of feminisation of UK General Practice upon the DMS recruitment and workforce planning. General Medial Council General Practice Certificate of Completion of Training (GMC GP CCT) data were analysed to identify any change in the percentage of male and female GP Specialty Training Registrars successfully completing GP vocational training between 2007 and 2012, thus becoming potentially recruitable into the DMS as independent GPs. A 3% increase was seen in the number of women achieving GMC GP CCT between 2007 and 2012 (p=0.015). The percentage of DMS GP Specialty Training Registrars (GPStRs) gaining their GMC GP CCT in 2012 who were women (25%) was about half that seen nationally (59%). A lack of 2007 by-sex GMC GP CCT data for DMS GPStRs prevented a comparison with 2012. The national increase of only 3% infers feminisation of UK General Practice is not an immediate challenge for the DMS. Nevertheless, as feminisation of the UK GP workforce is expected to continue, the future cohort from whom the DMS will recruit its GPs is likely to contain increasing numbers of women. With the return to contingency, the DMS may wish to consider the implications of increasing numbers of female GPs upon service delivery in the UK and overseas, and explore more flexible medical employment models.

Despite apparently successful surgical treatment, the patient presented to our colorectal department 7 years after injury with disabling faecal incontinence. Following assessment, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) was initiated with excellent results. We report the successful use of SNS to treat faecal incontinence resulting from a combat gunshot injury. We recommend that surgeons carefully document the anatomical position of retained ballistic fragments after gunshot or blast fragment injury and that attention should be paid to the functional results in a patient's follow-up after intestinal surgery.

Due to difficult terrain and night time movement restrictions, there were limitations to the transfer of patient. So he was attended at a peripheral hospital. At emergency thoracotomy, three segmental arteries to left upper lobe were ligated and haemostasis was secured. The level of transection of left lower lobe bronchus was identified to be below the origin of the apical segmental bronchus. The lower lobe bronchus was successfully re-attached and followed up with a daily bronchoscopic clearance of distal airway. The patient made a full recovery. Anastomosis of left lower lobe bronchus after traumatic transection is a viable option for preserving an amputated lobe, in trauma settings, provided haemostatic control has been adequately achieved.

It is supported by a number key definitions including: the 'All-Hazards Environment', the Defence PAR, and the seven Capabilities of Operational Healthcare. Key new clinical concepts include: Tactical Field Care, Care under Fire, Enhanced Field Care, Prolonged Field Care, Progressive Resuscitation and Enhanced Diagnostics. The Operational Patient Care Pathway has been introduced to embed the medical lessons from the last decade of military operations into concepts and doctrine for the Defence Medical Services of the future.

In a concerted effort to dovetail research efforts, there has been a collaboration between the UK and USA, with British military surgeons conducting translational studies under the auspices of the US Institute of Surgical Research. This paper describes 3 years of work. A variety of studies were conducted using, and developing, a previously validated rat femur critical-sized defect model. Timing of surgical debridement and irrigation, different types of irrigants and different means of delivery of antibiotic and growth factors for infection control and to promote bone healing were investigated. Early debridement and irrigation were independently shown to reduce infection. Normal saline was the most optimal irrigant, superior to disinfectant solutions. A biodegradable gel demonstrated superior antibiotic delivery capabilities than standard polymethylmethacrylate beads. A polyurethane scaffold was shown to have the ability to deliver both antibiotics and growth factors. The importance of early transit times to Role 3 capabilities for definitive surgical care has been underlined. Novel and superior methods of antibiotic and growth factor delivery, compared with current clinical standards of care, have been shown. There is the potential for translation to clinical studies to promote infection control and bone healing in these devastating injuries. ","552":"The aim of qualitative research is to produce empirical evidence with data collected through means such as interviews and observation. Qualitative research encourages diversity in the way of thinking and the methods used. Good studies produce a richness of data to provide new knowledge or address extant problems. However, qualitative research resulting in peer review publications within the Defence Medical Services (DMS) is a rarity. This article aims to help redress this balance by offering direction regarding qualitative research in the DMS with a focus on choosing a theoretical framework, analysing the data and ethical approval. Qualitative researchers need an understanding of the paradigms and theories that underpin methodological frameworks, and this article includes an overview of common theories in phenomenology, ethnography and grounded theory, and their application within the military. It explains qualitative coding: the process used to analyse data and shape the analytical framework. A popular four phase approach with examples from an operational nursing research study is presented. Finally, it tackles the issue of ethical approval for qualitative studies and offers direction regarding the research proposal and participant consent. The few qualitative research studies undertaken in the DMS have offered innovative insights into defence healthcare providing information to inform and change educational programmes and clinical practice.

An IT-based system was created that could display, manage and integrate the pre-hospital healthcare activity on Op HERRICK 18. The system was based on the Defence Medical Services Common Assurance Framework and run through Microsoft Office SharePoint. Pre-hospital healthcare activity was made available and visible across an operational theatre. This supported delivery, assurance and governance at any time. Activity from each medical facility could be integrated and display automatically improving theatre wide situational awareness. The availability of information resulted in a shift towards a more continuous process of assurance and governance rather than reliance on inherently threatening and increasingly intermittent inspection regimes. The ability to review healthcare activity remotely at anytime significantly improves the validity of assurance possible for a deployed force. Governance activity can be more responsive and less reliant on the fixed timescale and datasets of reports from outlying medical facilities. However, assurance and governance authorities must not allow such a wealth of information to impact local leadership and innovation through a perception of, or actual, micro-management. ","556":"The nature of general surgical training within the UK has undergone significant changes recently, including the evolution of the Intercollegiate Surgical Curriculum Programme (ISCP). In 2013, new task-specific goals tailored towards military surgery were incorporated into the general surgery curriculum. In order to meet the demands of training the next generation of military general surgeons, a new compendium of workplace-based assessments (WBAs) is now required. In 2013, the ISCP general surgery curriculum was revised to include new, military-specific WBAs to allow formative assessment of a trainees' experience and preparedness for their future deployed role. Index procedures considered mandatory for a deployed military general surgeon to be effective in the field are now included in the general surgery curriculum. These will permit formative assessment of trainees and also permit revalidation of deployed skills among the consultant cadre. General surgical training in the UK is in a transitional period, and the move towards increased sub-specialisation appears inexorable as evidenced by the split of Vascular Surgery into a separate specialty, along with its own training pathway and curriculum. With the 'generalist' demands on deployed surgeons in the Defence Medical Services, the task of training towards broader surgical competencies may appear daunting. Inclusion of defined military WBAs into the curriculum should help focus trainees and their trainers to identify the deployed general surgical skill set, identify the appropriate learning opportunities\/placements required to enable the acquisition of relevant competencies and document their attainment and later retention.

In addition, the study aimed to determine whether the 4QA needed to be amended to make it more effective in assisting the ethical decision-making process for military health professionals on deployment. A qualitative pilot study in two phases was undertaken between September 2012 and January 2013. In Phase I, senior deployed clinicians completed a pro forma of the 4QA on cases that potentially raised ethical issues. Thirteen pro formas were submitted on four cases; the Deployed Medical Director submitted a log of 14 cases that had involved using the 4QA. Phase II consisted of interviews with five senior clinicians who had recently returned from deployment in Afghanistan to discuss their experiences and perceptions of using the 4QA. Phase I identified a variation in the level of detail recorded and where that information was placed on the quadrant. Four themes were generated from Phase II. These included the characteristics of ethical decisions; the processes used to make ethical decisions; use, usefulness and limitations of the 4QA; and views about training in ethics. The findings suggested that amendments to the pro forma may improve its utility. The 4QA is a useful tool within an operational setting but amending its diagrammatic presentation could improve its effectiveness. Pre-deployment training should include practising using the quadrant as described in Clinical Guidelines for Operations.

Blast-mediated through-joint TAs were considered extremely rare with published prevalence &lt;2%.

However, recent evidence suggests that the mechanism of TA and the link with fatal primary blast exposure merit review. A trauma registry (UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry) and postmortem CT (PM-CT) database were used to identify casualties (survivors and deaths) sustaining a blast-mediated TA in the 2 years from August 2008. TA metrics and associated significant injuries were recorded. Detailed anatomical data on extremity predebridement osseous and soft tissue injuries were only consistently available for deaths through comprehensive PM-CT imaging. 146 cases (75 survivors and 71 deaths) sustaining 271 TAs (130 in survivors and 141 in deaths) were identified. The lower limb was most commonly affected (117\/130 in survivors, 123\/141 in deaths). The overall through-joint TA rate was 47\/271 (17.3%) and 34\/47 through-joint injuries (72.3%) were through knee. More detailed anatomical analysis facilitated by PM-CT imaging revealed only 9\/34 through-joint TAs had a contiguous fracture (ie, intra-articular involving the joint through which TA occurred), 18\/34 had no fracture and 7\/34 had a non-contiguous (ie, remote from the level of TA) fracture. No relationship between PBLI and TA was evident. The previously reported link between TA and PBLI was not present, calling into question the significance of primary blast injury in causation of blast mediated TAs. Furthermore, the accepted mechanism of injury can't account for the significant number of through-joint TAs.

Previously, a consensus statement on lower limb amputation from the UK Defence Medical Services reported better outcomes in some patients with TKAs when compared with those with above knee amputations. This study sought to define the proportion of recent combat casualties sustaining severe lower extremity trauma with acute osseous and soft tissue injury anatomy amenable to definitive TKA. The UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry and post mortem CT (PM-CT) databases were used to identify all UK Armed Forces personnel (survivors and fatalities) sustaining a major extremity TA (through\/proximal to wrist or ankle joint) between August 2008 and August 2010. Through knee and all below knee TAs were grouped as 'potential TKAs' (pTKAs), that is, possible candidates for definitive TKA. 146 Cases (75 survivors and 71 fatalities) sustaining 271 TAs (130 in survivors, 141 in fatalities) were identified. The through-joint TA rate was 47\/271 (17.3%); 34\/47 through-joint injuries (72.3%) were TKAs. Overall, 63\/130 TAs in survivors and 66\/140 TAs in fatalities merited analysis as the pTKA group. Detailed anatomical data on pre-debridement osseous and soft tissue injury levels were only consistently available for fatalities through PM-CT findings. Further analysis of the soft tissue injury profile revealed that a definitive TKA in the pTKA group (all BKAs as well as TKAs) would have been proximal to the zone of injury (ZOI) in only 3\/66 cases. Traumatic TKAs following explosive blast are more common than previously reported. The majority of lower limb TAs are skeletally amenable to a definitive TKA. Maximising residual stump length carries the risks of definitive level amputation within the original ZOI but this study demonstrates that the proximal extent of the soft tissue injury may frequently make this unavoidable.

However, of the 16 patients with predicted mortality &gt;50% by Trauma Injury Severity Score, seven survived. Seven cases required specialist advice and were discussed with the Birmingham Children's Hospital paediatric intensive care retrieval service. The mechanisms by which the Defence Medical Services support children admitted to the deployed adult ITU are described, including staff training in clinical, ethical and child protection issues, equipment, guidelines and clinical governance and rapid access to specialist advice in the UK. With appropriate support, it is possible to provide intensive care to children in a deployed military ITU. ","578":"We evaluated the potential of Cryptosporidium spp. for intentional transmission as a terrorist tactic in asymmetric conflicts in terms of the recognised optimum conditions for biological warfare. Published and widely accepted criteria regarding the optimum conditions for the success of biological warfare based on experience from passive biological warfare research were applied to hypothetical intentional Cryptosporidium spp. transmission. The feasibility of the use of Cryptosporidium spp. transmission for terrorist purposes was established. Particularly on tropical deployments with poor hygiene conditions, such attacks might have a good chance of remaining undetected as a deliberate terrorist attack. Intentional transmission should be suspected in cases of sudden outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, particularly where adequate food and drinking water hygiene precautions are being enforced. Appropriate diagnostic procedures should be available so that the diagnosis is not missed. ","579":"Parotid fistula is a rare but very distressing sequelum of post-operative or traumatic injuries. The management of these injuries has been reported in the literature previously and techniques employed include pressure dressings, surgery and more recently botulinum toxin A (BTA) injections. We present a patient who developed a parotid fistula as a late complication of an extensive gunshot injury to the face with subsequent successful management with ultrasound-guided intraglandular injections of BTA. This case demonstrates that the BTA injection is an effective and safe method under ultrasound guidance and should considered as a first-line treatment option for the treatment of salivary fistulas. ","580":"The management of patients who have sustained blast injuries poses an important challenge for military healthcare professionals. Current military operations are generating large numbers of casualties and modern military healthcare facilities are increasingly using CT scanning to facilitate their management. This small case series serves to draw attention to a rare (or possibly under-reported) phenomenon after blast injury. We report two patients exposed to blast who had pneumoperitoneum identified by CT scan but who did not have abdominal visceral injury or ballistic peritoneal violation. The use of cross-sectional imaging is leading to the recognition of otherwise occult injury. Military practitioners should be aware of this injury pattern when using CT to help select patients for conservative management after abdominal blast injury. ","581":"Snake bite envenomation causes a significant health burden globally, especially in austere or resource poor settings. This case series describes envenomation in two adults and two children presenting to the Role 3 Medical Treatment Facility in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan. Each case has similarities with respect to the coagulopathy of envenomation but differs in terms of time delay to presentation and response to treatment, including reactions to antivenom. We discuss the challenges and ethical dilemmas in delayed-presentation snakebite, the diagnosis and treatment of coagulopathy and the role of antivenom and surgical debridement. ","582":"","583":"Acute abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint to both primary and secondary care, and is a frequent cause of hospital admission among deployed personnel. Identification of generalised peritonism on abdominal examination is a classical indicator of intra-abdominal pathology that may warrant exploratory laparotomy. Negative findings at laparotomy should serve as a diagnostic prompt to consider other non-surgical mimics of an acute abdomen. ","584":"Modern travel and military operations have led to a significant increase in the need to provide medical care in extreme climates. Presently, there are few data on what happens to the doctor, their drugs and equipment when exposed to these extremes. A review was undertaken to find out the effects of 'extreme heat or cold' on anaesthesia and critical care; in addition, subject matter experts were contacted directly. Both extreme heat and extreme cold can cause a marked physiological response in a critically ill patient and the doctor treating these patients may also suffer a decrement in both physical and mental functioning. Equipment can malfunction when exposed to extremes of temperature and should ideally be stored and operated in a climatically controlled environment. Many drugs have a narrow range of temperatures in which they remain useable though some have been shown to remain effective if exposed to extremes of temperature for a short period of time. All personnel embarking on an expedition to an extreme temperature zone should be of sufficient physical robustness and ideally should have a period of acclimatisation which may help mitigate against some of the physiological effects of exposure to extreme heat or extreme cold. Expedition planners should aim to provide climatic control for drugs and equipment and should have logistical plans for replenishment of drugs and medical evacuation of casualties. ","585":"Behind armour blunt trauma (BABT) has been defined as a non-penetrating injury caused by the rapid deformation of body armour. There has been an increasing awareness of BABT as an injury mechanism in both the military and civilian worlds; whether BABT results in serious injuries is debatable. A systematic review of the openly accessible literature was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses method to investigate those injuries classified as BABT and their severity. 50 sources were identified that included pertinent information relevant to this systematic review on BABT injuries. Typical injuries reported included skin contusion, laceration and penetration, rib fracture and contusions to lungs, kidneys, spleen and (rarely) the heart. No evidence of fatal injuries due to BABT was identified. Whether BABT can lead to life-threatening injuries when small-arms ammunition impacts body armour components designed to stop that ammunition is debatable. It should be emphasised that other data may be available in government reports that are not openly available. Further research should be considered that investigates developments in body armour, including initiatives that involve reducing burden, and how they affect BABT. ","586":"Post-traumatic Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) continues to be a major critical care challenge with a high associated mortality and extensive morbidity for those who survive. This paper explores the evolution in recognition and management of this condition and makes some recommendations for treatment of post-combat ARDS for military practitioners. It is aimed at the generalist in disciplines other than critical care, but will also be of interest to intensivists.

A regimental level, two-and-a-half day refresher package was developed following analysis of PHC conditions most likely to be seen on Op HERRICK 18. It consisted of lectures and skill stations with written and case-based assessment phases to demonstrate effective and safe use of CMT clinical protocols on simulated patients. Internal feedback assessed the CMT's subjective understanding of each individual section. A qualitative questionnaire was used to retrospectively evaluate the package after 1 month of deployment. Immediate feedback showed that the refresher training was well received. Following the first month of deployment, CMTs who had attended the PHC refresher package felt more confident in managing PHC patients and felt they had received training for the majority of PHC conditions witnessed during their deployment in comparison with CMTs who had not. By delivering a training package acceptable to the majority of medics, we have increased the confidence and capability of CMTs in delivering PHC within the context of their protocols and prepared them for their first month of deployment. It suggests that PHC delivery can be improved by such a package and consideration should be given to formalising this into a military training qualification.

Ronald Bellamy launched a worldwide challenge to develop a new resuscitation fluid to aid survival after catastrophic blood loss on the battlefield. In 1996, after careful compromise among need, cube weight and efficacy, the US military and later coalition forces adopted 6% hetastarch (HES) fluids for early resuscitation. In the intervening years, evidence has amassed indicating that the HES fluids may not be safe, and in June 2013 the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that HES solutions should not be used to treat patients with hypovolaemia or the critically ill. We review the unique challenges of early battlefield resuscitation, why the 'Bellamy challenge' remains open and discuss a number of forward-looking strategies that may help to solve the problem. The first two pillars of resuscitation that we believe have not been adequately addressed are rescuing and stabilising the heart (and brain) and the vascular system. The 'ideal' resuscitation fluid needs to nurture the heart and body slowly back to health, and not 'shock' it a second time with unnatural colloids or large volumes of unphysiological saline-based solutions.

The standard of this care should be to the same standard as that afforded to one's own troops. However the medical practicalities of maintaining such standards can be difficult. This article reviews the practicalities of the medical care of CPERS as part of the UK deployment in Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK. ","595":"The unique nature of counterinsurgency warfare in Afghanistan highlights the tactical and technical challenges of the non-contiguous battlefield. Although remote military outposts distant from their support hubs help project NATO power, they also operate without the advantages of a secure rear area or interior lines of communication. Commonly referred to as 'firebases', these outposts typically house a platoon or company-sized element and present numerous challenges to the delivery of medical care and support. Medical planners and providers can mitigate many of these inherent risks through targeted interventions designed to increase the capabilities of these remote outposts. These interventions include focused higher-level trauma and non-trauma medical training for both medical and non-medical personnel, expanded equipment lists, ongoing medical education, training and rehearsals, and a proven and redundant communications plan. ","596":null,"597":"Infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms are increasingly prevalent, and antimicrobial stewardship has become a priority for many healthcare organisations, including the Defence Medical Services. In military environments, infectious diseases remain a significant burden, and infections complicating the care of modern complex combat injuries are well recognised. A focus on infection prevention and control in the deployed environment is essential, and an important element of this is an antimicrobial formulary and stewardship programme. This audit analyses antimicrobial prescribing practices by military clinicians in patients admitted to UK\/US Role 3 medical treatment facility in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, relative to the UK published guidance. Retrospective case note review of all in-patient admissions during two time periods (October 2011 and October 2012). Notes were independently reviewed by an infection specialist not involved in the management of the patients. 475 case notes were reviewed, of which 250 received antimicrobials. Coalition forces represented the most common patient group (131\/250), with battle injury the most frequent indication (139\/250) for antimicrobial prescription, followed by disease (100\/250). A total of 302 antimicrobials were prescribed, with co-amoxiclav being the most frequently used antibiotic in 74% (185\/250) of patients. 84.8% (212\/250) were prescribed antimicrobials in line with the antimicrobial formulary. In battle injury, 93.5% (130\/139) of antimicrobial prescriptions were in line with the formulary compared with 73.9% (82\/111) in disease and non-battle injury patients. Maintaining a strong infection control effort in the deployed setting, even in a stabilised operational environment, is difficult, but our data show good compliance to the antimicrobial formulary superior to that reported in civilian hospitals. To improve this, further innovative strategies are required, combined with a continued focus on infection control basics across the full spectrum of care. ","598":"Skin complaints are common in travellers to foreign countries and are responsible for up to 25% of medical consultations by military personnel during deployments in the tropics. They also have relatively high rates of field hospital admission, medical evacuation and referral to UK Role 4 healthcare facilities. Non-infectious tropical skin diseases include sunburn, heat rash, arthropod bites, venomous bites, contact dermatitis and phytophotodermatitis. During tropical deployments skin infections that commonly occur in military personnel may become more frequent, severe and difficult to treat. Several systemic tropical infections have cutaneous features that can be useful in making early diagnoses. Tropical skin infections such as cutaneous larva migrans, cutaneous myiasis, cutaneous leishmaniasis and leprosy do occur in British troops and require specialist clinical management. This illustrated review focuses on the most significant tropical skin diseases that have occurred in British military personnel in recent years. Clinical management of these conditions on deployments would be improved and medical evacuations could be reduced if a military dermatology 'reach-back' service (including a telemedicine facility) was available. ","599":"Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) are common in military populations regularly living and training in close contact with each other. The majority of such infections are simple and can be easily treated with antibiotics and appropriate infection control practices. Some, however, can progress to become complex and even life threatening, such as Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL)-associated staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, or Streptococcus pyogenes necrotising fasciitis, which carry a mortality rate of up to 65% and 30%, respectively. This review focuses on the most important SSTIs and those more commonly affecting military personnel with advice on how they are best managed. ","600":"Sexual acquisition of infections has always been an important part of military history and although disease patterns have changed over time, the problem has not gone away. This article will look at how to recognise infection, the general principles of management, where to access guidance and how to get specialised help within the complexities of the military environment. ","601":"Undifferentiated febrile illnesses (UFIs) present with acute symptoms, objective fever and no specific organ focus on clinical assessment. The term is mostly used in developing and tropical countries where a wide range of infections may be responsible. Laboratory diagnosis often requires specialist microbiology investigations that are not widely available, and serology tests that only become positive during convalescence. Optimal clinical management requires a good travel history, awareness of local endemic diseases, an understanding of the features that may help distinguish different causes and appropriate use of empirical antibiotics. This review describes the most common examples of UFI in military personnel on overseas deployments, and provides a practical approach to their initial management. ","602":"Tuberculosis (TB) causes significant morbidity and mortality among the global civilian population. Historically, TB has also been responsible for a considerable burden of disease among military populations during periods of both peace and conflict. TB will continue to be of importance to the military for several reasons. Military units live and work in confined environments, personnel may deploy to areas highly endemic for TB where there is the potential to be exposed to infected local communities, and they undertake physiologically stressful activities during training and operations. These are just a few of the factors that may increase the risk of acquiring, developing and transmitting TB among military personnel. This review examines the military relevance of TB in the modern era within the context of epidemiological, pathological and clinical considerations of this ancient disease. ","603":"Military training facilities and operational theatres, and the stressful activities undertaken in such settings, are unique. Military personnel living and working in these environments are at considerable risk of the acquisition and onward transmission of a variety of respiratory infections. While these generally cause mild illness, severe disease may occur with significant associated morbidity and, occasionally, mortality. Epidemic outbreaks among military personnel may have a significant detrimental impact on training schedules and operational effectiveness. The recognition of the burden of such illness among British military personnel, and the development of strategies required to prevent or limit negative impacts, can only be achieved through the use of comprehensive laboratory-based surveillance programmes. ","604":"Sepsis, a syndrome caused by severe infection, affects a small proportion of military casualties but has a significant effect in increasing morbidity and mortality, including causing some preventable deaths. Casualties with abdominal trauma and those with significant tissue loss appear to be at a greater risk of sepsis. In this article, the diagnosis and management of sepsis in military casualties with reference to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines are examined. We discuss the management considerations specific to military casualties in the deployed setting and also discuss factors affecting evacuation by the UK Royal Air Force Critical Care Air Support Team.

This article discusses the epidemiology and treatment of these viruses, together with occupational health considerations. ","606":"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) has a long military association being first discovered during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s after an outbreak of unexplained hepatitis at a military camp. HEV is now endemic in the UK, and should be considered in all cases of jaundice. The prevalence is high in certain operational areas (28.5% in Afghanistan), and maintenance of integrity of food and water supplies together with scrupulous attention to environmental hygiene remains paramount. Pregnancy confers a much higher risk of fulminant hepatitis, with a mortality rate of up to 25%. Management is usually symptomatic, but ribavirin can be considered in non-pregnant patients with fulminant hepatitis. This narrative review examines the presentations and management of Hepatitis E in military populations. ","607":"Malaria is a life-threatening disease, with its largest impact being due to Plasmodium falciparum infection in Africa. Military populations continue to be at a high risk of malaria and reported case series have frequently revealed poor compliance with preventative measures. The symptoms of malaria are non-specific and its management depends on awareness of the diagnosis and early recognition and treatment. This is aided by new and simple rapid diagnostic tests, but these should not replace the examination of blood films if these are available. Artemisinin combination therapy provides a more rapid and dependable cure of uncomplicated P falciparum infection, with artesunate now being the drug of choice in severe infection. ","608":"Infectious and tropical diseases have been a problem for British expeditionary forces ever since the Crusades. Outbreaks were especially common on Navy ships from the 16th to 18th centuries due to poor living conditions and travel to the tropics. However, since these occurred in small, isolated and controlled environments it meant that naval medical practitioners were able to keep detailed records and develop empirical approaches for their prevention. The first Royal Naval Hospitals were established in response to these diseases and Royal Navy doctors made valuable early contributions towards understanding them. Even larger outbreaks of infectious and tropical diseases occurred in the Army during the Napoleonic, Crimean and Boer Wars and throughout the colonial era, which strongly influenced the formation of the Army Medical Services including provision for teaching and research. The establishment of germ theory led to a golden era of discovery regarding these diseases and British Army doctors made numerous important contributions. Subsequent improvements in prevention, diagnosis and treatment reduced the mortality from infectious and tropical diseases during the World Wars, but they remained a significant problem in the non-European campaigns and also the numerous 'small wars' that followed. Even in the 21st century some of these diseases still cause outbreaks with significant morbidity and impact on deployments, but the military clinical and academic resources to deal with them are now much reduced. Preventive measures such as hygiene, sanitation, infection control, vaccination and chemoprophylaxis are invaluable, but history shows that these can become neglected over time and disrupted or overwhelmed during the early or most intense stages of military operations. This is why military specialists in infectious diseases, tropical medicine, sexual health, medical microbiology and communicable diseases control are still required.

These UK Role 4 Military Infection Services have adapted well to recent overseas deployments, but new challenges will arise due to current military cutbacks and a greater diversity of contingency operations in the future.

This will entail a discussion about whether in a deployment such as Op OLYMPICS medical care should be based upon offering solely primary healthcare in medical centres or using Role 1 medical treatment facilities, which include primary healthcare and pre-hospital emergency care. The main recommendations arising from the deployment are: clinicians should deploy with a minimum of basic emergency drugs and equipment; a medical facility treating a large population at risk for a prolonged period should have a broad stock of medications available on site; and medical risk assessments must be performed on all Reservists during mobilisation.

With an increasing number of battle casualties having had an amputation after combat trauma, it is inevitable that both primary and secondary care clinicians will come into contact with a patient with phantom limb pain (PLP). It is widely acknowledged that its complex aetiology means that this condition is often poorly understood and difficult to manage. A growing pathophysiological understanding is shedding new light on the mechanisms which underlie PLP. Knowledge of these mechanisms will inform treatment and enable clinicians to plan and implement solutions which make a difference to those individuals with this condition.

We wished to analyse the pattern of blast trauma on the modern battlefield and to compare it with combat gunshot injuries. Analysis of a consecutive series of combat trauma patients presenting to two Bulgarian combat surgical teams in Afghanistan over 11 months. Demographics, injury patterns and Injury Severity Scores (ISS) were compared between blast and gunshot-injured casualties using Fisher's Exact Test. The blast victims had significantly higher median ISS (20.54 vs 9.23) and higher proportion of ISS&gt;16 (60% vs 33.92%, p=0.008) than gunshot cases. They also had more frequent involvement of three or more body regions (47.22% vs 3.58%, p&lt;0.0001).

In contingency operations, off site sterilisation facilities may not be available. There is a need for a bronchoscope system which can be rapidly cleaned and reused.

Many of these injuries could potentially have been prevented had the soldiers been wearing their issued neck collars at the time of injury. The aim of this research is to develop an accurate method of predicting the resultant damage to cervical neurovascular structures from explosively propelled fragments. A finite element numerical model has been developed based on an anatomically accurate, anthropometrically representative 3D mathematical mesh of cervical neurovascular structures. Currently, the model simulates the passage of a fragment simulating projectile through all anatomical components of the neck using material models based upon 20% ballistic gelatin on the simplification that all tissue types act like homogenous muscle. The material models used to define the properties of each element within the model will be sequentially replaced by ones specific to each individual tissue within an anatomical structure. However, the cumulative effect of so many additional variables will necessitate experimental validation against both animal models and post-mortem human subjects to improve the credibility of any predictions made by the model. We believe this approach will in the future have the potential to enable objective comparisons between the mitigative effects of different body armour systems to be made with resultant time and financial savings. ","628":"Prevention against head wounds from explosively propelled fragments is currently the Mark 7 general service combat helmet, although only limited evidence exists to define the coverage required for the helmet to adequately protect against such a threat. The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine was tasked by Defence Equipment and Support to provide a framework for determining the optimum coverage of future combat helmets in order to inform the VIRTUS procurement programme. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to identify potential solutions to three components felt necessary to define the ideal helmet coverage required for protection against explosively propelled fragments. The brain and brainstem were identified as the structures requiring coverage by a helmet. No papers were identified that directly defined the margins of these structures to anatomical landmarks, nor how these could be related to helmet coverage. We recommend relating the margins of the brain to three identifiable anatomical landmarks (nasion, external auditory meatus and superior nuchal line), which can in turn be related to the coverage provided by the helmet. Early assessments using an anatomical mannequin indicate that the current helmet covers the majority of the brain and brainstem from projectiles with a horizontal trajectory but not from ones that originate from the ground. Protection from projectiles with ground-originating trajectories is reduced by helmets with increased stand-off from the skin. Future helmet coverage assessments should use a finite element numerical modelling approach with representative material properties assigned to intracranial anatomical structures to enable differences in projectile trajectory and helmet coverage to be objectively compared. ","629":"","630":"Conflict in the Middle East over the past 10 years has seen a change in warfare tactics from the use of ballistic missiles to blast weapons, which has resulted in a well-documented change in wounding patterns. Due to the severity of these injuries, there have been large numbers of amputations, both as life and limb saving procedures. The purpose of this paper is to retrospectively review all UK service personnel who have undergone limb amputation in the last 8 years of conflict and compare those from the early years with the more recent. All UK service personnel scoring more than 1 on the extremity score of the Abbreviated Injury Score were identified from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry and separated into two temporal cohorts (August 2003-February 2008 and August 2008-July 2010). Intheatre medical facility and Role 4 hospital notes from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham were examined for details of mechanisms of injury, number of limbs injured, associated injuries, method of amputation, microbiology of contaminating organisms and outcome. There were significant differences in the nature of the amputations, the number of multiple amputations and soft tissue perineal wounds, as well as a significantly higher Injury Severity Score in the later time period. There were also significant differences in the surgical techniques, with more guillotine amputations in the early group, and mechanism of injury, with more blast injuries in the late group. This study has confirmed the clinical impression that there has been a significant change in the limb trauma from the Iraq conflict to Afghanistan. These injury patterns have significantly different logistic implications and this must be considered when planning the required medical assets in future conflicts.

The management of burns in recent conflict has been found to be a resource-heavy undertaking, though its impact on both personnel and resources in current conflicts is unclear. A case analysis has been carried out in order to quantify the logistical impact of the management of burns on Role 3 Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) infrastructure and to examine if and how the cause and management of burns have evolved in early 21st century conflict. All casualties treated for burns at a Role 3 MTF over one calendar year were identified and scanned copies of their notes obtained from the UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry and retrospectively analysed. 88 of the 1461 (6.0%) trauma patients presenting to the Role 3 MTF over the year were treated for burns of whom 52.3% were combat troops and 45.4% civilians. Half of the burns were caused by non-conflict related mechanisms; the two commonest mechanisms were flame burns in 38\/88 mostly non-conflict related cases and blast in 30\/88 cases most of which were conflict related. The management of burns at war is a complex process. It is further confounded by the management of civilians with non-conflict related burns, which places a predictable strain on Role 3 MTF resources: theatre time, nursing time, dressing resources and bed space. This must be planned for in current and future deployed operations. ","633":"Penetrating wounds from explosively propelled fragments and bullets are the most common causes of combat injury experienced by UK service personnel on current operations. There is a requirement for injury models capable of simulating such a threat in order to optimise body armour design. A systematic review of the open literature was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology. Original papers describing the injurious effects of projectiles on skin, bone, muscle, large vessels and nerves were identified. Projectiles injure these tissues by producing a permanent wound tract (PWT), comprised of a central permanent wound cavity, in conjunction with a zone of irreversible macroscopic tissue damage laterally. The primary mechanism of injury was the crushing and cutting effect of the presented surface of the projectile, with an additional smaller component due to macroscopic damage produced by the radial tissue displacement from the temporary tissue cavity (TTC). No conclusive evidence could be found for permanent pathological effects produced by the pressure wave or that any microscopic tissue changes due to the TTC (in the absence of visible macroscopic damage) led to permanent injury. Injury models should use the PWT to delineate the area of damage to tissues from penetrating ballistic projectiles. The PWT, or its individual components, will require quantification in terms of the amount of damage produced by different projectiles penetrating these tissues. There is a lack of information qualifying the injurious effect of the temporary cavity, particularly in relation to that caused by explosive fragments, and future models should introduce modularity to potentially enable incorporation of these mechanisms at a later date were they found to be significant.

","635":"Ultrasound has been used in the field and in emergency departments for more than two decades. In a military setting, its use has grown rapidly as it has gained widespread acceptance among emergency physicians and as the range of diagnostic and triage applications has continued to expand. Technological changes have enabled ultrasound devices to become accessible to general practitioners (GP), and it could be of particular interest for military GPs in isolated environments. We have investigated both the training of French military GPs in the area of ultrasonography and the use of ultrasound devices, in daily practice and abroad, in isolated military settings. In 2011, a questionnaire was sent to all 147 in-the-field GPs of the French southeast regional military health service. The questionnaire evaluated the training of military GPs in ultrasonography, the use of ultrasound in France in daily practice, and during military operations in isolated environments abroad during 2010. The response rate was 52%. On the one hand, half the responding GPs had been specially trained in ultrasound, mainly (97%) in military institutes. On the other hand, only a quarter of doctors used ultrasound in daily practice. Among those GPs performing ultrasound examinations in France, 75% used it in 2010 during isolated operations abroad. Ultrasound examinations performed in such an austere environment were retrospectively declared useful to guide clinical reasoning (41% of examinations carried out), diagnosis (21%) and decision making as regards evacuation (11%). The challenge for the future is to make ultrasound courses mandatory for all military GPs going on overseas operations, to develop daily practice, and to investigate effective triage systems, combining both ultrasound imagery and physical examination. ","636":"Indirect ballistic fractures occur when a projectile passes close to, but not contacting, the bone. The mechanism of how these fractures occur is not yet proven, but recently the acoustic shockwave has been excluded as a cause. The objective of this study is to determine whether the expanding temporary cavity, the collapse of this cavity or its oscillation causes these fractures. In addition, we describe the fracture morphology and biomechanical causes of this injury. 40 fresh deer femora were strain gauged and embedded in ballistic gelatin before being shot with four different projectiles with varying distances off the bone. Pressure recordings, chronographs and radar allowed assessment of local pressures and energy transfer. High-speed video allowed the temporal relationship between the temporary cavity and fracture formation to be analysed, while sample dissection allowed the fracture morphology to be described. The fractures produced were consistently wedge-shaped and caused by the expansion of the temporary cavity, flexing the bone beyond its yield point, causing tension failure on the cortex opposite the expanding temporary cavity and a compression wedge on the side of the cavity. Local pressure was not predictive of fracture formation but the energy transfer to the gelatin block was predictive. Indirect fractures are caused by the expansion of the temporary cavity and relate to the proximity of this cavity to the bone. Fractures occur from flexion of the bone and classically display wedge-shaped fracture patterns with the apex of the wedge pointing away from the expanding cavity. ","637":"Explosively propelled fragments are the most common cause of injury to soldiers on current operations. Researchers desire models to predict their injurious effects so as to refine methods of potential protection. Well validated physical and numerical models based on the penetration of standardised fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs) through muscle exist but not for skin, thereby reducing the utility of such models. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology to identify all open source information quantifying the effects of postmortem human subject (PMHS) and animal skin on the retardation of metallic projectiles. Projectile sectional density (mass over presented cross-sectional area) was compared with the velocity required for skin perforation or penetration, with regard to skin origin (animal vs PMHS), projectile shape (sphere vs cylinder) and skin backing (isolated skin vs that backed by muscle). 17 original experimental studies were identified, predominantly using skin from the thigh. No statistical difference in the velocity required for skin perforation with regard to skin origin or projectile shape was found. A greater velocity was required to perforate intact skin on a whole limb than isolated skin alone (p&lt;0.05). An empirical relationship describing the velocity required to perforate skin by metallic FSPs of a range of sectional densities was generated. Skin has a significant effect on the retardation of FSPs, necessitating its incorporation in future injury models. Perforation algorithms based on animal and PMHS skin can be used interchangeably as well as spheres and cylinders of matching sectional density. Future numerical simulations for skin perforation must match the velocity for penetration and also require experimental determination of mechanical skin properties, such as tensile strength, strain and elasticity at high strain rates. ","638":"Amputation is a common injury in survivors of current military conflicts. The primary aim of this study was to establish the prevalence rate of phantom limb pain (PLP) in military personnel undergoing rehabilitation at the UK's Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre. The secondary aims were to establish treatment failure rates and prevalence rates of phantom limb sensations (PLS) and residual limb pains (RLP). A questionnaire survey was developed from that used in a previous study of pains in veterans. Questions were asked of the intensity of PLP, RLP and PLS over the previous month and the entire time since amputation. Treatment failure was defined as greater than 'mild' pain. A literature review for similar studies was undertaken. There were 48 responders with 65 amputations. PLP in the previous month was reported by 49% of respondents and 20% were classed as treatment failures; 76% had PLP at some point and 56% were analgesic failures. PLS was commoner with 70% reported over the previous month and 66% at any time. 65% had RLP over the previous month, 31% were treatment failures and 80% had experienced RLP at some point and 63% of these were failures of treatment. Eight other papers were found for comparison. This is the first paper that describes prevalence of pains associated with amputation in a serving military population. It also describes the use of analgesic failure as a concept and provides an encouraging rate of as low as 20% in this population.

A pilot study was conducted using an EMHA questionnaire with questions about depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use, sleep and anger\/irritability. At pilot sites, the EMHA was completed during all routine and discharge medicals between May 2011 and July 2011. At the end of the study period, qualitative data were collected from participating medical officers and practice managers regarding their opinions about the pilot study. The quantitative data revealed an average pick-up rate for mental health (MH) problems. Out of the four military medical centres who participated and the 325 questionnaires collected, one referral to a Department of Community Mental Health was made. 26 (8%) patients were categorised as 'some concern and patient offered advice and\/or reassurance'. The vast majority of patients were found to have no evidence of MH problems. However, using a validated alcohol screening tool, 64% of service personnel were found to have a score indicating 'higher risk drinking'. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that the EMHA is an easy tool to implement with minimal additional time and resources needed. The interviewees pointed out a number of limitations and suggestions for possible further studies. The pilot study successfully demonstrated that the EMHA questionnaire is easy to administer, does not take up a large amount of additional resources or manpower and provides a useful check of MH status. The study picked up an average number of MH cases and the questions on alcohol consumption highlighted that military personnel may be at a 'higher risk of drinking'. ","642":"To explore the first period of sick leave in military patients following a traumatic battle injury, and the role of primary care. To identify if and where patients perceived difficulties. Participants were recruited from The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) Headley Court on their second admission. Purposive sampling was used to access a range of different injuries and experiences. Nine patients were interviewed at DMRC where they were asked to recount their stories throughout rehabilitation. Thematic and structural analysis of the narrative accounts was applied. The majority of problems encountered by the participants occurred during their initial period of sick leave between Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM), Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, and DMRC. Participants often had difficulty identifying who to contact if they had a problem on sick leave, with many ringing secondary care directly. Time spent travelling to medical reviews was identified as affecting the quality of leave. There is a need for greater patient understanding regarding whom to contact should they develop problems while on sick leave. A patient passport containing all discharge documentation and simplified contact details may help reduce patient confusion regarding whom to contact. GPs require greater awareness and understanding of the complexity of these patients' injuries and the need for early secondary care review to prevent delayed or inappropriate admissions. Most problems that patients face will occur on their first period of sick leave. Reducing the time spent on sick leave before admission to DMRC would limit the likelihood of problems occurring at this high-risk time.

Main Operating Base (MOB) Price in Helmand Province has a small medical centre and due to its location provides critical care to civilians and military casualties and this article describes the patterns in trauma patient care at the MOB Price medical centre regarding the types of patients and injuries. The study population consists of 64 consecutive critically injured patients treated in MOB Price during a 4-month period from September to December 2010. The outcomes were battle-related injuries, treatment received before arriving to MOB Price, types of injury and treatment. There were 35 civilians (12 children and 23 adults), 28 Afghan National Security Forces and one International Security Assistance Force soldier; they were divided into three groups (civilian adults, civilian children and military). 22% of the patients suffered fragmentation injuries and civilians were more likely to incur fragment injury than military personnel (OR (95% CI) 7.04 (1.4 to 34.8)). Regarding intubation, there was a trend towards more civilians needing it than military personnel and significantly more children than adults underwent intubation (OR (95% Cl) 51 (5.2 to 498.5)). Gunshot wounds (GSW) occurred in 30% of the patients. Civilians patients had a lower OR for GSWs than military patients (OR (95% CI) 0.35 (0.1 to 1.1)). Other trends in injury types and treatment were apparent but did not reach significance due to the small number of patients. Both civilians and military personnel benefitted from the in-theatre Role 1 medical facility treatment. The most frequent injuries were fragmentation damage and GSW. ","647":"Chronic exertional compartment syndrome is one of the main causes of exertional leg pain. Diagnosis is based on the history and intracompartmental muscle pressure testing during exercise prior to consideration of fasciotomy for treatment. We present the data gathered at Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre Headley Court during the first year of a revised protocol on dynamic pressure testing from May 2007. The exercise protocol involved exercising patients using a representative military task: the Combat Fitness Test with a 15 kg Bergen on a treadmill, set at 6.5 km\/h with zero incline up to 15 min and if completed, a further 5 min at 7.5 km\/h. Subjects informed us when the exertional leg pain was 7\/10 on a visual analogue scale and were instructed to carry on till failure (pain 10\/10) or till the test finished. Mean pressure during this time period (7\/10 to 10\/10) was calculated by computer. Over 1 year, we performed 151 intracompartmental pressure studies in 76 patients. 120 were successful in 68 patients, with 31 technical failures. All studies were performed in the anterior or deep posterior muscle compartments as these were the symptomatic compartments; no patients had symptoms in the lateral or superficial posterior compartments and these were not tested. There was only one complication with a posterior tibial artery puncture. In 119 compartment studies, the mean pressure was 97.8 mm Hg (SD 31.7). These data are normally distributed (Shapiro Wilk test, W=0.98 p=0.125). Our data based on this exercise protocol are comparable with the few studies that record dynamic pressure during running-based exercise. There is no accepted diagnostic pressure or exercise protocol. Due to the uncertainty of diagnostic criteria, it is necessary to perform a study measuring dynamic pressures in normal asymptomatic subjects. ","648":"Management of blunt splenic injury (BSI) in battlefield casualties is controversial. Splenectomy is the traditional treatment, as setting the conditions for selective non-operative management (SNOM) is difficult in the operational environment. On mature operations, it may be feasible to adopt a more conservative approach and manage the patient according to civilian protocols. The aim of this study was to document the contemporary practice of deployed military surgeons when dealing with BSI and to compare this against a matched cohort of civilian BSI patients. The Joint Theatre Trauma Registry held at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, Birmingham, was thoroughly examined to yield patients with BSI. The study encompassed a 55-month period ending September 2009. Data abstracted included patient demographics, injury epidemiology, grade of splenic injury, treatment and outcome. These data were compared with a registry database from a UK civilian major trauma centre. Of 1516 military trauma patients, 16 (1%) had a splenic injury, of which five were excluded either because of fatalities due to overwhelming injury or penetrating trauma. The remaining 11 had a blunt component. Median (IQR) injury severity score (ISS) was 17 (15-21). Nine underwent a splenectomy with median (IQR) ISS of 17 (12-18). Of this group, organ injury grades were documented in 10 patients (four Grade V injuries, three Grade IV and three Grade II). All patients survived surgery. There were no complications in survivors as a result of splenic conservation in the military group. Data from the civilian major trauma centre database showed 160 (2%) patients sustained a splenic injury, of which 131 (82%) had a blunt mechanism, 43\/160 (27%) and 9\/160 (6%) patients underwent splenectomy and angio-embolisation, respectively. Patients with BSI, an uncommon finding in combat casualties, are occasionally selected for conservative management, contrary to previous military surgical paradigms but in keeping with the civilian shift to SNOM. Guidelines to clarify the place of SNOM are required to assist surgical decision making on deployed operations.

Published ballistic tests using animal and artificial skin and muscle tissue surrogates also lack standardisation in methodology such that limited comparisons with that of human tissues can currently be made. Three masses of cylindrical NATO standardised fragment simulating projectiles (FSPs) were fired at 20% ballistic gelatin and the hind thighs of a killed goat. Threshold (V(th)) and V(50) velocities required for skin perforation and depth of penetration (DoP) into muscle were compared with gelatin. The intercept and gradient of the linear regression lines for DoP versus velocity were compared between gelatin and goat with significance defined as p&lt;0.05. V(50) goat skin perforation velocities for the 0.16, 0.49 and 1.10 g FSPs were 121.1, 103.7 and 97.8 m\/s, respectively. There was a significant difference in the V(50) required to perforate the gelatin surface compared with goat skin for the 0.16 and 0.49 g FSPs but not the 1.10 g. There was no statistical difference in the gradients for DoP versus velocity between animal and gelatin for either the 0.16 or 1.10 g FSPs. This study has produced data for skin perforation velocities and generated algorithms describing velocity versus predicted DoP into muscle for three standardised projectiles, which will be used to improve the fidelity of future injury models. 20% gelatin was demonstrated to accurately reproduce the retardation of the 1.10 g FSPs into goat muscle but the addition of a skin simulant will be required to accurately predict DoP for FSPs less than 1.10 g. ","654":"Extremity ballistic injury is unique and the literature intended to guide its management is commonly misinterpreted. In order to care for those injured in conflict and conduct appropriate research, clinicians must be able to identify key in vivo studies, understand their weaknesses and desist the propagation of miscited and misunderstood ballistic dogma.

In addition, the non-ballistic studies of limb injury, stabilisation and contamination that will form the basis from which future small animal extremity studies are constructed are presented. With an awareness of the legacy of military wound models and an insight into available generic models of extremity injury and contamination, research teams are well placed to optimise future military extremity injury management.","655":"Op HERRICK in Afghanistan remains the current focus of the British Armed Forces.

Associations with educational attainment and deprivation were also assessed. METHODS: Analysis of a survey into the health behaviours of 10 531 recruits in 1998\/1999. A follow-up 3 years later measured changes in behaviour. Correlation and multiple regression was used to investigate the relationship between smoking prevalence in each trade group and both educational attainment and deprivation, using Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 (IMD 2004) scores. RESULTS: Army recruits exhibited a significantly higher smoking prevalence (45%) than Royal Navy recruits (34%) and Royal Air Force (RAF) recruits (31%). There were marked differences between smoking levels amongst officer cadets (12%, 20% and 10% in the Navy, Army and RAF, respectively) and other rank trade groups (24-56%), with the exception of the Marines (13%). At follow up, smoking had generally increased, and in some parts of the infantry had risen to 66%. There was a clear correlation between smoking at enlistment and both educational attainment (correlation coefficient=0.7, p&lt;0.005) and deprivation score (correlation coefficient=0.8, p&lt;0.005).

Access to evidence based psychological therapies for treating common mental health problems such as depression may not be adequate at present. Behavioural Activation (BA) represents a National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommended, evidence-based treatment for depression. The aim of this review was to review the literature to determine how BA could work as a therapeutic approach for military personnel with depression. METHOD: Five specialty-specific electronic databases were searched using the key words 'behavioural activation', 'activity scheduling' and 'depression'. Emerging themes were drawn out of the literature using a long table approach to thematic analysis. RESULTS: Seven themes were identified: Clinical Effectiveness, Cultural Competence, Co-morbidity, Cost Effectiveness, Alternatives to Face-to-Face Therapy, Training and Patient Experience. CONCLUSIONS: Group based BA is a cost effective option that may build upon service personnel's cultural affinity to teamwork and peer support. Brief training workshops and supervision could be provided to military mental health nurses to deliver group based BA. However service delivery may also be enhanced by enabling some nurses to specialise as Cognitive Behavioural Psychotherapists.

In particular the sero-negative spondyloarthritides, which include ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease related arthritis and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis, are especially prevalent in the young male phenotype, which is common in the Armed Forces. It is estimated that there are more than 1500 patients in the Armed Forces with spondyloarthritis alone, based on the prevalence in the general population of approximately 1%. Inflammatory arthritides are eminently treatable, especially with the development and widespread use of biologic drugs such as anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF) therapy. The use of these drugs can deliver patients an exceptionally good outcome leading to symptom control and normal function in many cases. Initial concerns regarding safety and side effects of anti-TNF drugs have been allayed by the evidence provided from comprehensive national databases developed over the last 10 years. With early diagnosis and prompt treatment military patients can complete a full career including deployment with only minor limitations.

Along with this, the data recording itself is less than adequate, with acknowledged issues in classification of diarrhoeal disease within J97\/EPINATO categories. Two post-tour diarrhoeal disease questionnaire surveillance exercises were carried out at the end of Operation HERRICK 6 (H6) and 10 (H10), respectively.

Adherence to the recommended monthly supervision and the presence of an indate CS contract were audited on two separate occasions over 2 years by analysing the departmental electronic CS database. Compliance rates were found to be lower than the Defence guidelines, which are already modest in their expectations compared with IAPT CS standards.

A prospective clinical data base (iParrot, ByResults, Oxford, UK) was interrogated for consecutive patients undergoing shoulder stabilisation surgery at a single centre. The senior author-blinded to the outcome score-matched patients according to age, gender and diagnosis. Statistical analysis showed the data to be normally distributed and a paired samples t test was used to compare the two groups. 110 patients were required to provide a matched cohort of 40 in each group (70 male, 10 female subjects).

Previously, more than 99% of new British Gurkha recruits were already immune to HAV because of prior infection, but this may be declining due to improved living conditions in their countries of origin. Acute HAV infections have occurred in Gurkha soldiers serving in Afghanistan, which made them unfit for duty for 2-3 months. In one case, early serological diagnosis was impeded by IgM results against both HAV and HEV that were caused by cross-reactivity or persistence from a previous infection. These cases have led to a policy change whereby all Gurkha recruits are now tested for previous HAV infection and if negative they are offered vaccination. Meanwhile, HEV infection remains a significant threat in Nepal and Afghanistan with low levels of background immunity and no commercially available vaccine. ","688":"Genitourinary injuries as a result of current warfare may be severe and result in significant long term morbidity. There is no high quality evidence to guide management and the logistics involved require the development of bespoke management strategies. The multidisciplinary Genitourinary Working Group (Trauma) has the remit of leading this service, primarily addressing the management of casualties in the medical evacuation chain of the Defence Medical Services of the UK. The recommendations made are based mainly upon expert opinion and are intended to provide guidance to the deploying surgeon and the teams that manage these casualties thereafter.","689":"Injuries sustained from Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) can have a devastating impact on bodily integrity; physical injuries can be severe and include traumatic amputation of limbs, pelvic fracture, abdominal trauma, extremity fragmentation wounds and genital trauma. Soldiers suffering from genital trauma can experience overwhelming emotions and adjusting to their injuries is a process that occurs over time, that some find easier than others. This paper explores current practice and identifies guidelines for psychological interventions within this arena. Relevant associated literature has been reviewed to identify the long-term consequences of genital trauma and to ascertain best practice in supporting this patient population. Current practices within the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) and the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) Headley Court have been explored. There is little published literature in this area. Therefore, in respect of guiding treatment of this patient population, related research on the psychological consequences of prostate and penile cancer, limb amputation, acquired infertility and acquired disability has been used as a base to inform interventions. Current practices at RCDM and DMRC have been found to support interventions within related areas. There is no published evidence base to guide psychological interventions for genital trauma. Professional multidisciplinary intervention will potentially be beneficial in establishing the long-term needs of this patient population, together with qualitative research exploring the experience of soldiers suffering genital trauma. ","690":"There is little data in the literature on the reconstruction of combat related lower genitourinary trauma. Published reports document patterns of injury, which is useful for epidemiological analysis of military trauma, but very few describe the reconstructive management. We aim to describe a systematic multidisciplinary approach to planning the challenging reconstruction of the severely injured male perineum.","691":"Blast injury to the external genitalia is associated with considerable morbidity, including the risk of primary hypogonadism due to insufficient testosterone. It is of the utmost importance that, prior to any testosterone replacement being commenced, serious consideration is given to sperm retrieval. The clinical and biochemical picture of hypogonadism allows a relatively straightforward diagnosis in most cases although it is important to be alert to the possibility of hypogonadism in the context of partial testicular tissue preservation. It is also prudent to consider the possibility of secondary hypogonadism especially in patients with chronic pain or those on opiate medication. Therapeutic options for testosterone replacement are diverse but relatively simple. This article aims to give guidance to the non-specialist in the consideration, diagnosis, and treatment of hypogonadism, with particular reference to blast injury of the external genitalia.","692":"Improvised explosive device (IED) yields in Afghanistan have increased resulting in more proximal injuries. The injury severity score (ISS) is an anatomic aggregate score of the three most severely injured anatomical areas but does not accurately predict severity in IED related pelvi-perineal trauma patients. A scoring system based on abbreviated injury score (AIS) was developed to reflect the severity of these injuries in order to better understand risk factors, develop a tool for future audit and improve performance. Using standard AIS descriptors, injury scales were constructed for the pelvis (1, minor to 6, maximal). The perineum was divided into anterior and posterior zones as relevant to injury patterns and blast direction with each soft tissue structure being allocated a score from its own severity scale. A cumulative score, from 1 to 36 for soft tissue, or a maximum of 42 if a pelvic fracture was involved, was created for all structures injured in the anterior and posterior zones. Using this new scoring system, 77% of patients survived with a pelvi-perineal trauma score (PPTS) below 5. There was a significant increase in mortality, number of pelvic fractures and amputations with increase in score when comparing the first group (score 1-5) to the second group (score 6-10). For scores between 6 and 16 survival was 42% and 22% for scores between 17 and 21. In our cohort of 62 survivors, 1 patient with an IED related pelvi-perineal injury had a 'theoretically un-survivable' maximal ISS of 75 and survived, whereas there were no survivors with a PPTS greater than 22 but this group had no-one with an ISS of 75 suggesting ISS is not an accurate reflection of the true severity of pelvi-perineal blast injury. This scoring system is the initial part of a more complex logistic regression model that will contribute towards a unique trauma scoring system to aid surgical teams in predicting fluid requirements and operative timelines. In austere environments, it may also help to prevent futile resuscitations. Better correlation between measurement of severity and outcome would aid performance improvement monitoring. In the longer term it will also allow benchmarking of current survival rates and comparisons in the future. ","693":"Major pelvic ring fracture (PRF) due to blunt trauma results in lower urinary tract injury (LUTI) in up to 10% of cases. Significant comorbidity may result and this is particularly the case for unrecognised injury. The increase in military injuries due to improvised explosive devices in recent conflicts has revealed a complex injury cohort. The incidence of pelvic fracture related LUTI in these casualties is up to three times higher than that seen in civilian patients with pelvic fracture. A complete understanding of LUTI following pelvic fracture is still lacking. Complex fractures of the anterior pelvic arch are associated with LUTI and initial management is largely conservative. In battlefield injuries, the combination of the blast wave, penetrating fragment and bodily displacement results in open pelvic fracture combined with gross perineal and pelvic soft-tissue destruction and traumatic femoral amputations. These are some of the most challenging injuries that any surgical team will manage and life saving measures are the priority. There are established pathways for the management of LUTI following blunt trauma related pelvic fracture. Military injuries are more complex and require a significantly different approach. This paper outlines the developments in the understanding and management of pelvic fracture-related LUTI, focussing primarily on injury mechanisms and early management. Recent military surgical experience is discussed, highlighting the significant differences to civilian practice.","694":"The signature injury of the Afghanistan campaign has, amongst other things, included an increased incidence of destructive anorectal injury. There is no significant body of evidence about this type of injury on which to base management strategies. This review examines the historical military data, later civilian reports, many of which have challenged the military dogmas of Vietnam, and the spartan contemporaneous military data which does not particularly address pelviperineal blast injury. There is no evidence to support a move away from the doctrine of the four D's (diversion, distal washout, drainage and direct repair), but sound surgical judgement remains the mainstay of managing these challenging and highly morbid injuries.","695":"The external genitalia are routinely included in the 'CT-Traumagram' at the Role 3 hospital in Afghanistan. Although the radiologist may have the opportunity to diagnose clinically undetected genital injury, little emphasis has been placed on the CT appearances of the external genitalia after Improvised Explosive Device related injury. A prospective observational study was carried out on casualties admitted during 1 month in 2011. Genital findings on CT were correlated with clinical operative findings. One hundred and twenty-eight casualties were admitted of which 12 (9%) had genital injury. 17 testes were exposed to blast injury-5\/17 (29%) were unharmed, one was dislocated, two were lost, one had a testicular haematoma and 8\/17 (47%) were disrupted and underwent salvage. The CT findings-loss of the definition of the tunica albuginea and intra-testicular contrast blushing correlated with testicular disruption in all cases. The single dislocated testis and the two cases where there were no testes remaining after injury were all evident on CT. The CT appearance of the external genitalia following trauma are unfamiliar. However, despite the small numbers and clear limitations, the results suggest that CT has an important role to play in the diagnosis of significant genital trauma. Ultrasound assessment should be considered if there is persisting uncertainty. 'CT-Traumagram' provides rapid, whole body information in casualties exposed to blast injury and this should be exploited in its entirety by the trauma team. Abnormal genital findings on contrast CT should alert radiologists and surgeons to the possibility of significant genital trauma. ","696":"Patterns of survivable injury after combat injury have changed during recent years as wounding mechanisms have altered, ballistic protection has improved and the military chain of trauma care has evolved. Combat casualties now survive injuries that would have been fatal in previous wars and service personnel can be left with injuries that have significantly detrimental effects on their quality of life. Severe, destructive injuries to the external genitalia are rarely life-threatening, but can be profoundly life altering and the immediate management of these injuries deserves special scrutiny. The general principles of haemorrhage control, wound debridement, urinary diversion, and organ preservation should be observed. An up-to-date review of the management of these relative rare injuries is based on recent, albeit scanty literature and the experiences of managing casualties in the medical evacuation chain of the United Kingdom Defence Medical Services. The rationale behind the current emphasis on post-injury fertility preservation is also discussed.","697":"In response to an Urgent Operational Requirement, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) investigated, designed, developed, trialled and subsequently fielded a Tiered Pelvic Protection System to service personnel deployed on Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan. An Urgent Statement of User Requirement (USUR) was drafted in order to equip service personnel with protection for the groin, perineum, buttocks and upper thigh areas from the effects of buried Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Injuries to the groin and pelvic area from buried IEDs can have severe physiological and psychological impact; therefore the aim of the pelvic protection was to reduce the number and severity of such injuries and to improve the outcome, both in terms of quality of life of the survivors and increase the chances of survival. The aim of this paper is to outline some of the research and development that contributed to the design(s) of the Tiered Pelvic Protection System; describe the components of, and report the medical success of, the Tiered Pelvic Protection System.","698":"The anatomy of the perineum and pelvis is complex. Those outside the specialist fields of colorectal surgery, urology and gynaecological surgery often have a less-than-complete understanding of the anatomical details of this region. The recent increase in complicated pelvic and perineal injuries caused by the detonation of Improvised Explosive Devices has brought into sharp focus, the importance of this area of surgical anatomy. The following article describes, in a systematic and detailed manner, the anatomy of the urogenital and anal regions of the perineum. The terminology in relation to the fascial layers and structures encountered in the perineum is elucidated. In addition, the surgical anatomy of the scrotum and its contents and the ligamentous support of the penis are described, with clear illustrations throughout. It is intended that this article will go some way towards clarifying the anatomy underlying the surgical management of complex perineal\/pelvic injuries, and benefit both the specialist and non-specialist military surgeon.","699":"Energetic materials are widely used in civilian and military applications, such as quarrying and mining, flares, and in munitions. Recent conflicts have involved the widespread use of improvised explosive devices to attack military, civilians and infrastructure. This article gives a basic overview of explosive technology and the underlying physical processes that produce the injuries encountered. In particular aspects relevant to primary and secondary injuries are discussed.","700":"Recent military operations have resulted in a small but significant number of military personnel suffering severe perineal injuries. In association with lower limb amputation and pelvic fracture, this complex is described as the 'signature injury' of the current conflict in Afghanistan. There are significant consequences of surviving severe perineal injury but the experience of managing these casualties is limited. This article gives an overview of the processes developed to meet these challenges and introduces a series of articles which examine the subject in finer detail.","701":"","702":"Whilst on operations, British military medical staff strive to provide high quality medical care to deployed soldiers. The application of UK Health Care Governance principles, particularly Clinical Professional Development (CPD), is especially challenging on operations. This article highlights some of the difficulties faced and the solutions generated to facilitate good CPD of Combat Medical Technicians (CMTs) deployed to Afghanistan on Operation HERRICK 13. The article describes the opportunities for CMTs to develop their skills in the assessment and management of trauma and primary health complaints. It also describes the difficulties in capturing this development especially when the supervision of CMTs was limited, with variable communication modalities and within the current limitations of the CMT portfolio. Solutions described include the use of individual reflective practice, face-to-face supervision and assessment by Medical Officers, Significant Event Reports, the mandatory After Action Review Process, and the development of formal standardised CMT CPD. This included refresher training after return from leave, Senior Medical Officer (SMO) weekly lectures and the SMO weekly report. Finally, the future of CMT CPD is raised and it is hoped that this article will stimulate debate into how to approach these challenges and refine these processes further.","703":"To describe a successful medical engagement during counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan, and to demonstrate that a full audit cycle can be used in this environment to support improvements to local healthcare delivery. In the district of Nad-e-Ali, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, the management of children under five years of age (under-5s) who presented with diarrhoea to a Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) Basic Health Centre was audited. Staff then attended a training course on the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) in Kandahar. After further medical engagement to reinforce this training, the audit was repeated. A lack of knowledge of the Afghan government's MoPH guidelines during the initial audit resulted in 90% of under-5s with acute diarrhoea being given unnecessary antibiotics and none receiving zinc as recommended. Following the training course and on-going engagement, there was a 67% reduction in the number of under-5s prescribed antibiotics and a 74% increase in the number who received zinc. Opportunities for successful medical engagement during operations are limited but this example demonstrates that in conjunction with host nation facilities, sustainable improvements in healthcare are possible. Secondly, it shows that use of the audit cycle can provide objective evidence that may help encourage local staff to improve their standards of patient care. ","704":"The number of battle casualties generated during war is far outnumbered by non-battle casualties. Each year the current conflict in Afghanistan sees hundreds of service personnel medically evacuated direct from the front line to the care of their home units' primary care facility. To date these casualties remain undiscovered by medical research. This is the first study to look at the care pathway of primary care casualties from Operation HERRICK using information from the Defence Patient Tracking System (DPTS). Information relating to all casualties from Afghanistan discharged at the airhead between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 was collected from the DPTS. Common conditions were identified and information relating to the follow up care extracted to provide an overview of the care pathway. 387 aeromedical evacuations were identified as primary care casualties. The three commonest conditions were musculoskeletal (183 cases), mental health (29) and noise-induced hearing loss (26). 205 (53%) were not seen outside of primary care for the tracked condition. 166 (81%) of those that remained under primary care had two or less consultations during the time period of the study. The mean time frame between the 1st and 2nd consultation was 5.4 weeks. A significant number of aeromedical evacuations from Afghanistan are for primary care casualties. The DPTS can be used to provide a basic overview of the care pathway of repatriated personnel. Little contact with the medical services would appear to occur for these types of casualties. There is a significant gap in military medical research looking at primary care casualties repatriated from operations. ","705":"To describe the cases of cold injury sustained during the most recent winter operational tour of Afghanistan, Op HERRICK 15. Retrospective review of all notified British military cases of cold injury sustained between 1 Oct 11 and 30 Mar 12 recorded by UK Medical Group Environmental Health Team. 14 patients with 13 Non-freezing Cold Injuries (NFCI) and two hypothermic injuries were identified. Five patients were of African ethnic decent. Eight out of 13 NFCI patients had probably suffered a previous injury, injuries were sustained from December until February and 9\/13 NFCI patients had periods of static duties implicated in the injury mechanism. Eight patients were able to remain in operational theatre on restricted duties whilst 6\/14 were evacuated home after sustaining their injuries. Although awareness and equipment have improved, cold injuries remain an important cause of Disease and Non Battle Injury on current operations within the British Military. Cases of cold injury are probably under reported and often stem from situations where risk would seem predicable. It is hoped this article will assist in enabling greater understanding of contemporary operational cold injuries and continuing the development of preventative strategies. ","706":"The trekking ascent to Point Lenana (4,985m) on Mount Kenya is a popular objective for soldiers on adventurous training in Kenya. The standard route previously taken has been the Naro Moru route which involves an ascent rate far in excess of that recommended to avoid altitude illness. This article describes the case of a British soldier who developed high altitude cerebral oedema during an ascent of Point Lenana via the Naro Moro route. Recommendations to reduce the risk of altitude illness on Mount Kenya include alternative and more gradual routes of ascent. Early symptom recognition and descent are vital to prevent clinical deterioration.","707":"To identify the dermatological conditions affecting British troops in Afghanistan, understand how they are treated and identify potential areas for improvement. Data was collected from the Defence Analytical Services and Advice agency and the Operational Emergency Department Attendance Register via the Disease and Non Battle Injury working group. Additional data was collected from J4 - Medical Permanent Joint Headquarters. Treatment information from Clinical Guidelines on Operations (CGOs), Medics' protocols, and primary care module composition was reviewed. Dermatological conditions accounted for 1 in 5 attendances to a Role 1 Medical Treatment Facility during the study period. They were consistently in the top five reasons for working days lost, and had a comparatively high hospital admission rate (0.3\/1000 Population at Risk (PAR)\/month) and a repatriation rate similar to other medical specialties such as respiratory and neurology (0.1\/1000 PAR\/month). Treatment appeared to be adequate based on declining return attendance numbers, although CGOs were found to lack dermatological protocols and medic protocols were eight years old and not specific to the current operational requirements. Although treatments are working for dermatological conditions, areas for optimisation of health care have been identified, such as updating medic protocols to include campaign specific information and latest guidelines in the CGOs. Pre-deployment dermatologist-devised treatment plans and tele-consults may also help keep soldiers with pre-existing skin complaints in theatre. ","708":"Species of the Opuntia or prickly pear genus of cacti are endemic to the British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS) training area in Alberta, Canada. They are known to provoke a dermatitis reaction in harvesters of the cacti fruit. It's spines are frequently an uncomfortable nuisance to unwary soldiers exercising in BATUS. We report two cases of particularly debilitating adverse skin reactions to the cacti spines that occurred during the 2010 Exercise Prairie Thunder season.","709":"In Afghanistan zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania major has been less widely reported than anthroponotic CL due to L. tropica. However, an outbreak of zoonotic CL occurred amongst a group of British soldiers at a military camp near Mazar-e-Sharif in the Balkh province of northern Afghanistan in 2004. A study was performed to assess the epidemiology, clinical features, parasitology results, treatment outcomes and environmental health measures associated with this incident. Twenty (17%) of 120 soldiers developed CL due to L. major and the risk of infection increased with the proximity of their accommodation to an area of recently cleared scrub, where many wild rodents were observed. Most cases had features of local dissemination, including secondary lesions from the pseudo-Koebner phenomenon, sporotrichoid lymphatic spread, lymphadenopathy and satellite papules or milia formation around healing lesions. Several cases responded poorly to fluconazole and low dose (10 mg\/kg) sodium stibogluconate, which were considered suitable treatments at the time. Environmental health measures at the military camp were found to be deficient. Zoonotic CL due to L. major is a significant threat for foreign troops based in Balkh, Afghanistan and may present with unusually severe clinical features and be resistant to previously recommended treatments. ","710":"Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by Leishmania protozoa and occurs as a spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from various forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) to mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) and visceral leishmaniasis (VL). CL in Afghanistan is either zoonotic (ZCL) due to L. major or anthroponotic (ACL) due to L. tropica and there has been a prolonged epidemic of ACL in eastern Afghanistan since 1987. However, there have been remarkably few reports of CL due to L. tropica amongst foreign troops serving in Afghanistan since 2001. We describe two such cases in Royal Marines deployed to Oruzgan Province in Afghanistan from 2008-9. These patients illustrate important issues regarding the clinical features, referral, diagnosis, treatment and epidemiology of CL amongst foreign troops in Afghanistan. This disease has the potential to cause significant disruption to military personnel and units and so requires efficient management in order to maintain operational effectiveness.","711":"Kenya is one of the British Army's main training areas outside of the UK and the flora and fauna present the physicians with several challenges. A 22 year old infantry soldier presented with a vesicular, linear painful rash across his chest caused by the chemical excreted from the Staphylinid or rove beetle, known locally as the Nairobi fly. Treatment included topical antibiotic and steroid creams to good effect. This report highlights the recognition, treatment and complications of the Nairobi Fly.","712":"Troops deploying to remote and hostile environments are exposed to numerous threats to their health and wellbeing. Medical care is provided by dedicated but often inexperienced young doctors, nurses and medics. This audit looks at the quality of medical records that are available to these deployed clinicians and the quality of their record keeping against nationally set guidance for the Summary Care Record (SCR) and Out of Hours record keeping. The data was collected from consecutive GP and nurse medical consultations at Camp Bastion Primary Health Care Centre during Op HERRICK 14. Only 21.7% of personnel had an imported medical record from the UK and only 1% had a summary fitting the guidance for the SCR. Additionally the quality of record keeping for consultations did not conform to standards set by the Royal College of General Practitioners 'Out of Hours Clinical Audit Tool'. The low numbers and poor quality of imported medical records into Op HERRICK 14 alongwith the inexperience of clinicians in keeping medical records compliant with relevant standards is of primary importance in the context of patient safety on operations. This audit highlights a number of areas of potential concern for the Defence Medical Services and areas for enhancement of pre-deployment training. ","713":"There are currently over 9000 British soldiers serving in Afghanistan. The Defence Medical Services provide primary health care to soldiers at forward locations using Regimental Medical Officers (RMOs) and General Duties Medical Officers (GDMOs). If required, GDMOs can refer patients to senior colleagues. Currently, little is known about the reasons for referrals by GDMOs. This study aims to identify the main factors affecting why GDMOs refer from forward locations. Nine GDMOs, who deployed on Operation HERRICK 13, were invited to join the study. They maintained a log of their referrals for two 14 day periods, one in each half of their tour. In addition, a semi-structured interview was performed with each GDMO in order to elicit the common themes surrounding referrals. The mean referral rate was 0.9 referrals\/GDMO\/week. The main reasons for referral were dental problems, musculoskeletal injuries, abdominal pain of unknown cause, and ano-genital problems. Factors that influenced referrals included availability of forwardly projected services (dentist and physiotherapist), manpower availability at the locations, the availability of flights (affected by weather, enemy action, and schedule of routine flights), and the timing of the tour in relation to leave. Referrals from GDMOs were due to doctor inexperience in the treatment of a particular condition, lack of access to investigations and the potential for deterioration in a location without adequate support. The referral decision process was affected by the patient's importance with regards to the mission, the weather and access to safe transportation. The introduction of clinical guidelines for common conditions in conjunction with minor alterations to GDMO training could help reduce referrals from Role 1, preserving manpower, reducing costs, and minimising risk to evacuation aircraft. ","714":"Royal Navy General Duties Medical Officers (RN GDMOs) are employed in land operations in Afghanistan in much the same way as British Army GDMOs.

Despite frequent deployments and exercises to countries where venomous snakes are endemic there are few reported cases of British Army personnel being bitten. Clinical Guidelines for Operations includes direction on the treatment of snakebite, including the application of pressure immobilisation. This article reviews the history and development of pressure immobilisation, the optimum equipment and the efficacy of training in order to inform future guidelines. It is the conclusion of this review that pressure immobilisation should be advocated in all snakebites where the snake species is not known. In addition guidelines should advocate the use of Sam splints and Emergency Bandages in the application of pressure immobilisation.","716":"In response to increasing awareness of the need to improve Post Graduate Medical Officers training in the use of analgesics when on Operations and exercises, a new \"Pain Day\" format has been realised and included in the Post Graduate Medical Officers Course.

Qualitative data collected included anecdotal experiences with analgesia administration which provides evidence to support a change in training. Doctors have the capability to provide good analgesic care but lack the confidence and experience to do it effectively. Improved analgesia training is required for deploying Role 1 MOs.

This study examines the quality of care given at Role 1 and the psychological impact on clinical personnel of the application of current pre-hospital trauma management guidelines. Data was collected through 17 digitally recorded semi-structured interviews with healthcare clinicians deployed in Role 1 medical facilities on OP HERRICK 14 following major medical incidents. Interview transcripts were subjected to content analysis based on a modified grounded theory approach. Triage was found to be done poorly with individuals treating patients as they were found rather than by identifying clinical priorities. Pain management was not always achieved. Fluid replacement was hampered with difficulty in obtaining parenteral access. Subsequently fluids were sometimes given in excess of protocols. Clinical documentation was not always completed even after a patient had been evacuated. Some interesting elements were noted, such as post incident reports being used as a reflective process which may be self-developmental and help clinicians deal psychologically with the incident. Clinical personnel carry out their duties, irrespective of personal injury or threats to their safety. However their performance may be tapered under such stress. Human factors training prior to deployment may help to ensure adherence to BATLS protocols despite the complexities of the battle space. The data identified a number of factors that affected clinicians ability to provide a high standard of casualty care. The general perception of this research cohort was that despite all the obstacles, the level of trauma care was of a high nature. However, the study provides pointers to a number of areas for future exploration where patient care was not BATLS protocol compliant.

Thirty two SMEs completed the questionnaire (68% response rate), comprising 25 medical officers (20 in clinical appointments; five in command and staff appointments), six nurses and one medical support officer. Results of the entire review were collated as a cross-Defence Lines of Development analysis, separating the specific experience of 1 Medical Regiment's Hybrid Foundation Training (HFT), Mission Specific Training (MST) and deployment cycle from the analysis gained from questionnaire studies, SME consultation and documentary evidence. The review generated 77 recommendations and 38 sub-recommendations. The top six messages of the review were (1) To balance the expressed desire to increase the ratio of trained Team Medics with the reality of generating credible instructors with clinical experience; (2) To recognise that inadequate experience for Combat Medical Technicians in Primary Healthcare in the Firm Base undermines their operational preparedness; (3) To recognise that Current Regimental Aid Post (RAP) at contingency without power lacks the rudimentary infrastructure of a modern Medical Treatment Facility; (4) To recognise that inappropriate deployment of personnel with chronic disease or acutely limiting conditions is a consistent trend for 20 years that highlights continuing system weaknesses in applying protective medical grading; (5) To accept that General Practitioner manning requires re-evaluating as an Operational Pinch Point, reviewing all options to maintain operational effectiveness including, but not focusing on, incentives; and (6) To recognise that a best practice template for Role 1 Healthcare Governance has been created that must endure.

Modern civilian trauma centres may manage these injuries with a combination of external pelvic fixation, extra-peritoneal packing and\/or selective angiography; however, military patterns of wounding are different and deployed medical facilities may be resource constrained. We report two successful instances of pelvic packing using chitosan impregnated gauze (Celox) when conventional surgical attempts at vascular control had failed. We conclude that pelvic packing should be considered early in patients with military pelvic trauma and major haemorrhage, as part of damage control surgery and that Celox gauze may be a useful adjunct. In our cases, the Celox gauze was easily removed after 24-48 hours without significant bowel adhesions and did not leave a residual phelgmon (of exudate or gel) that may predispose to infection.","732":"Annual hearing tests are compulsory in the British Armed Forces.

After two years of specialist audiological investigations she was diagnosed with non-organic hearing loss; further interrogation of her social circumstances suggested potential psychosocial triggers. This diagnosis should be considered early in military primary care in those with objective hearing loss on audiogram where there has been no exposure to significant noise.","733":"This case report describes a case of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome causing unilateral ischaemic claudication symptoms in an otherwise healthy soldier. The condition is rare but is an important cause of exercise related leg pain; untreated it can progress to structural arterial damage requiring reconstruction.

A retrospective review of military inpatient eye injuries, in one military region, population 250,000 soldiers, between January 2006 and December 2010. There were 709 eye injury patients (759 eyes) during the 5-year period with an incidence of inpatient eye injuries of 57 per 100,000 person-years. The mean age of patients was 24 years, the vast majority male. The majority of eye injuries occurred during recreational time (62%), with the commonest causing being violence (46%). The immediate post-injury vision acuity of 48% of eyes was &gt; 6\/12; 93% of cases had mechanical ocular injuries and 7% had non-mechanical ocular injuries. 71% of patients were sent to an evacuation hospital within 24 hours and 75% had surgery within 24 hours of injury. The majority of cases (97%) were hospitalized for one visit. On discharge, there was a statistically significant improvement in visual outcomes with 85% of eyes achieving &gt; 6\/12. Eye injuries secondary to violence were a frequent occurrence amongst young male PLA members, particularly during recreational time. Most injuries were not sight-threatening, with the majority of patients achieving an excellent visual outcome. ","735":"Plasmodium knowlesi is a zoonosis and is now recognised as the fifth commonly occurring form of human malaria. It is endemic in South East Asia, including some areas previously declared malaria free or at low risk for malaria. The epidemiology of the disease is very different to other forms of malaria which are determined by transmission by anthrophilic mosquitoes from human reservoirs. In contrast Plasmodium knowlesi malaria has a monkey reservoir and disease is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that normally feed on animals. People become accidentally infected when they enter the ranges of the vector mosquitoes and animal hosts. Improved and novel diagnostic methods have indicated that human disease is much more common than previously thought. Although the greatest disease burden falls on local populations living in endemic areas, visitors entering such zones are also at risk. The changing nature of tourism with deep jungle expeditions being more heavily marketed, and short visits to endemic zones now common, mean that new populations are increasingly recognised as being at risk. One such group are military personnel undergoing jungle training or deployed on Operations. The potential for severe disease in areas previously considered at low risk for malaria means that risk assessment needs to be reviewed, coupled with communication strategies to address prevention of a zoonotic form of the disease. The role of chemoprophylaxis in some specific groups may need to be considered.","736":"The purpose of this study was to investigate risk factors for occupational accidents and the relationship between perceived and actual risk of occupational accidents in Greek soldiers. A case-control study was conducted of military personnel in Evros county in Greece. Cases (n = 250) were defined as enlisted personnel having had an accident at work and the control series (n = 300) comprised of a simple random sample, stratified by age from the army population. Conscripted soldiers (OR = 3.8, 2.21 to 6.58, p &lt; 0.001) and professional soldiers (OR = 2.2, 1.28-3.75, p = 0.004) had higher frequency of occurrence of accidents in comparison to army officers. The degree of risk perception due to electrical hazards (OR = 2.8, 1.81-4.18, p &lt; 0.001), lighting (OR = 2.6, 1.74-3.97, p &lt; 0.001), falls (OR = 2.9, 1.61-5.13, p &lt; 0.001) and inadequate safety signs (OR = 3.3, 1.99-5.49, p &lt; 0.001) were associated with increased occurrence of accident. Regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between the accident and the age, time of service in the present unit, specialty, level of education, years of service and the overall military training. This study highlights the increased likelihood of occupational accidents among military personnel with lower rank and lower level of education, less working experience (fewer years of service) and less military training (conscripted and professional soldiers). The existence of occupational accidents in the workplace, civilian or military, creates the need for the adoption of policies for the protection of workers and the organization of occupational preventive services. ","737":"The combatant soldier on the battlefield remains protected from any claim in negligence by the doctrine of combat immunity for any negligent act or omission they may make when fighting. In other words, the combatant soldier does not owe a fellow soldier a duty of care on the battlefield, as the duty of care is non-justiciable. However, the non-combatant Military Healthcare Professional, although sometimes operating in the same hostile circumstances as the fighting soldier, is unlikely to benefit from combat immunity for any clinical negligence on the battlefield. This is because they continue to owe their patient a duty of care, although this has not been tested in the courts. This paper considers if any military healthcare professional could ever benefit from combat immunity, which is unlikely due to their non-combatant status. Instead, this paper suggests that a modified form of immunity; namely, Military Healthcare Battlefield Immunity could be a new, unique and viable doctrine, however, this could only be granted in rare circumstances and to a much lesser degree than combat immunity.","738":"To assess the burden and spectrum of ophthalmic disorders among army personnel at the 82 Division of the Nigerian Army, Enugu, South Eastern Nigeria. A population-based screening survey in July 2010 in the 82nd Division, Nigerian Army. Data on participants' sociodemographics, past medical and ophthalmic history, and findings on ophthalmic examination and refraction were noted according to a defined protocol and analysed statistically using p &lt; 0.05 as the level of significance. There were 254 participants (223 males, p &lt; 0.05) with a mean age of 36.2 + 9.7 SD years (range 19 -63 years). The prevalence of ophthalmic disorders in the study cohort was 34.6%. These were mainly refractive abnormalities (22.0%) and anterior segment disorders (13.8%). The refractive abnormalities comprised myopia (51.8%), hypermetropia (28.6%) and astigmatism (16.1%). The prevalence of ophthalmic disorder among army personnel at the 82nd Division, Enugu, is comparatively high. Spherical refractive error and anterior segment disorders are the commonest ophthalmic disorders. These have implications for needs-based and cost-effective provision of eye care services to this military formation and probably to the rest of the Nigerian Army as well. To generate broad-based comparative data, future multi-centre surveys are warranted. ","739":"Evidence of the prevalence of renal pathology in military populations is rare, probably as a result of a traditionally cautious military medical attitude that limits applicants with evidence of renal disease joining the Armed Forces and the continued service of military personnel who develop this later. The aim of this paper is to provide the first comprehensive review of renal diseases in a British military population. An archive of out-patient consultations, discharge summaries and renal biopsies between 1985 and 2011 was reviewed. Cases were classified according to diagnosis providing a frequency distribution over this 26-year period. Serum creatinine concentration and demographic data permitted retrospective calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at presentation and follow-up. Calculation of an annualised rate of deterioration of eGFR (ml\/min\/1.73 m2\/y) was undertaken when there were at least four follow-up values. In those cases where there was a statistically significant negative correlation with time, the probability of deterioration of renal function according to diagnosis was calculated. Where numbers of patients with a given diagnosis were sufficient for statistical purposes, correlations were also attempted between initial eGFR and both initial mean arterial pressure (MAP) and initial proteinuria. The most frequent condition was IgA nephropathy, present in 115\/346 (33%) of cases. Follow-up data permitted analysis of change in eGFR in 50 of these and 11 (22%) deteriorated. In this condition, there were statistically significant negative correlations between initial eGFR and MAP (r = -0.35, p = 0.0008) and proteinuria (r = -0.4, p = 0.0006). Other conditions showing deterioration despite therapeutic interventions included adult polycystic kidney disease (15\/2 2 = 68%) and membranous nephropathy (4\/ 7 = 57%). Altogether, 8\/13 (61%) conditions included cases where eGFR deteriorated and this was present in 40\/161 (25%) individual cases. Cases of renal disease are discovered de novo in serving military personnel and, despite interventions to maintain renal function, a significant proportion deteriorate supporting the traditionally restrictive policy concerning applicants with evidence of renal disease.

Valve replacement is invariably undertaken in Q fever endocarditis due to the degree of valvular damage and concerns about eradicating the organism, Coxiella burnetii. Our unique case allowed valve repair since pre-existing myxomatous degeneration and subsequent posterior mitral valve leaflet prolapse resulted in significant excess valve tissue, allowing quadrangular resection of the damaged and perforated P2 portion of this leaflet. Follow-up at four years (including three years of antibiotic treatment) has confirmed excellent valve repair, with no echocardiographic, clinical or microbiological evidence of recurrence. We are only the second group to describe valve repair in a patient with chronic Q fever endocarditis. Valve repair is preferable to valve replacement for Q fever endocarditis, if technically possible.","748":"The British Armed Forces of the 21st century are trained and operate worldwide, often in places where rabies control is poor and prevalence may be high. Currently rabies is not a routine vaccination for all service personnel. Awareness of the risk of rabies, action to take post potential exposure, prompt access to clear management advice and reliable supplies of Rabies Immunoglobulin and Rabies Vaccination are critical. We describe the management of a recent case of animal bite in Kenya and discuss current recommendations.","749":"To determine how Injury Severity Score (ISS) and mortality relate to height fallen, and to determine other predictors of mortality including intent and body region injured. A pre-hospital retrospective, observational database study was conducted. Injured or deceased patients following a fall from height (FFH), aged 16 or over, attended to by London Helicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS), between Jan 2008 to July 2009 were included in the study. In addition to the database, HEMS mission 'run sheets' provided further information. 117 (91 males and 26 females) patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 37 years (range 16 - 85). 34\/117 (29%) died. The mean ISS was 28.6 (median 17) and the mean height fallen 9.9m (3rd floor). In the group that died the mean height was 16.7m (5th floor). Height fallen was found to be a significant predictor of mortality (p &lt; 0.001), as were injuries to the chest and\/or head (p &lt; 0.05). In patients with head and chest injuries, a 50% mortality rate was estimated to occur at falls from 10.5m, compared to 22.4m in those without injuries to head or chest. Deliberate falls were more common amongst females than males (chi-squared test, p = 0.001), were associated with greater ISS (Mann Whitney test, p &lt; 0.001) and were more likely to result in death (chi-squared test, p &lt; 0.001). Height fallen correlates with ISS and is a significant predictor of death. Chest and\/or head injuries significantly increased the likelihood of death following a FFH. This information may enhance triage criteria applied to tasking of emergency response vehicles, and strategies in injury prevention. Other potential predictors of mortality were not found to be significant. ","750":"In the United Kingdom, approximately eight million peripheral cannulations are performed each year. Intravenous cannulae are made from either polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) or polyurethane. Polyurethane has a lower incidence of thrombophlebitis, however the physical characteristics of polyurethane may make the cannulae difficult to use at higher ambient temperatures. This effect maybe of importance to those involved in cannulation in extreme environments and especially for military doctors deployed in current theatres of operations. In a randomised single blinded study we investigated the different characteristics of Teflon and polyurethane cannulae (Vasofix Safety Cannulae, B Braun) at three different temperatures (-10 degrees C, 21 degrees C and 40 degrees C). There is no statistically significant difference in the ease or speed of cannulation of either polyurethane or Teflon safety cannulae in extremes of temperature. This study provides evidence that performance of polyurethane safety cannulae are not impaired by temperature extremes. ","751":"There are certain characteristics of the culture and environment in the Armed Forces that may be conducive to bullying. In this article we examine the cultural and environmental factors that may encourage such behaviour and those that act as deterrents for victims to come forward. We will look at the scope of this problem within the UK Armed Forces specifically, before more generally considering the psychological impact of bullying. There appears to be an overall downward trend in bullying within the UK Armed Forces and a positive increase in complaints as more victims step forward. We conclude by highlighting some areas for further development.","752":"The aim of military adventurous training (AT) is \"to develop, through authorised challenging pursuits and within an outdoor environment, leadership and the qualities necessary to enhance the performance of military personnel during peace and war\". An increasing amount of effort is being applied by all three services to increase participation in AT to achieve these, largely immeasurable, aims. Existing guidance to Commanding Officers dictates that, where possible, 20% of a unit strength should undertake some form of AT annually with 5% taking part in an overseas expedition. In a speech in 2008 Alan Johnson, the then Secretary of State for Health, acknowledged that for Armed Forces medical personnel 'just as important as clinical skills are issues such as leadership, communication, adaptability and teamwork.\" Controlled exposure to risk, discomfort and personal hardship is a common theme for both AT activities and military deployments. Both General Medical Council competencies for all doctors and the Royal College of Anaesthetists military module include elements which can effectively be taught and developed through training in an outdoors environment. These skills include communication skills, leadership, risk assessment and interdisciplinary working. In this review the value of AT in training doctors to develop those attributes is examined.","753":"No one has ever walked the 500 Km Skeleton Coast of Namibia totally unsupported. Fourteen explorers overcame this by carrying, along with all their other equipment, hand-held pumps to desalinate sea water on a daily basis to produce sufficient potable water. This paper highlights the changes in body mass, waist circumference and body fat in the group on this unique 20 day expedition. Eight males (mean (SD)) 42.3 (9.7) years, height 1.741 (0.043) m, weight 78.7 (8.6) kg, body mass index (BMI) 24.8 (2.0) kg\/m(2)) and six females (mean (SD) 40.0 (5.3) years, height 1.628 (0.043) m, weight 63.2 (5.5) kg, BMI 23.8 (1.8) kg\/m(2)) undertook the expedition. Average pack weight at the start of the expedition for the men was 32.5 kg, and 26.5 kg for the women. On most days, the team walked for 8 - 10 hours on varying terrain then pumped water for a further 4 hours. Measurements taken included height, body mass, waist circumference and skin-fold thickness at four regions of the body, and were taken before, during and at the end of the expedition. The approximate daily calorific intake for each team member was 2400 - 3000 kcal. Significant decreases in mean body mass (p &lt; 0.001, d=0.50) and mean BMI (p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.67) were observed after the 20 day trek compared to baseline values. Mean waist circumference decreased during the expedition (p &lt; 0.001, d = 0.67). There were significant reductions in all measures of skinfold thicknesses and overall percentage body fat at Day 13 (p &lt; 0.001, d = 1.19) and Day 21 (p &lt; 0.001, d = 1.98) in comparison to baseline values All participants lost significant amounts of both body mass and body fat, with body fat reducing by over 30%. ","754":"To describe spinal fracture patterns presenting to deployed medical facilities during recent military operations. Retrospective analysis of the United Kingdom Centre for Defence Imaging Computed Tomography database, 2005-2009. Fractures are classified, mechanism noted and associated injuries recorded. Statistical analysis is by Fisher's Exact test. 128 fractures in 57 casualties are analysed. Ballistic (79%) and non-ballistic mechanisms contribute to vertebral fracture at all regions of the spinal column in patients treated at deployed medical facilities. There is a high incidence of lumbar spine fractures, which are more likely to be due to explosion than gunshot wounding (p &lt; 0.05). Two thirds of thoracolumbar spine fractures caused by explosive devices are unstable and are mainly burst-fractures in configuration. 60% of spinal fracture patients had concomitant injuries. There is a strong relationship between spinal fractures caused by explosions and lower limb fractures. Injuries to the spine caused by explosive devices account for greater numbers, greater associated morbidity and increasing complexity than other means of spinal injury managed in contemporary warfare. With the predominance of explosive injury in current conflict, this work provides the first detail of an evolving injury mechanism with implications for injury mitigation research. ","755":"Ballistic cervical injury has become a significant source of both morbidity and mortality for the deployed UK soldier. The aim of this paper was to document a case series of ballistic cervical wounds to describe the pattern of these injuries and relate them to outcome. The records of all UK service personnel sustaining wounds to the neck in Iraq or Afghanistan between 01 August 2004 and 01 January 2008 were analysed following identification by the Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Blunt or thermal injuries were excluded. The records of 75\/76 service personnel sustaining penetrating cervical injury during this period were available for analysis. 56\/75 (75%) were due to explosive fragmentation and the remainder due to gunshot wounds (GSW). 33\/75 (44%) of soldiers sustained vascular injury, 32\/75 (43%) injury to the spine or spinal cord, 29\/75 (39%) injury to the larynx or trachea and 11\/75 (15%) injury to the pharynx or oesophagus. 14\/75 (19%) patients in this series underwent surgery in a hospital facility for treatment of potentially life threatening cervical injuries, with a survival rate after surgery of 12\/14 (86%). The overall mortality from this series of battlefield penetrating neck injury was 63%. Penetrating cervical ballistic injury is a significant source of injury to deployed UK service personnel, predominantly due to neurovascular damage. Neck collars if worn would likely prevent many of the injuries in this case series but such protection is uncomfortable and may interfere with common military tasks. Newer methods of protecting the neck should be investigated that will be acceptable to the deployed UK soldier. ","756":"The liver is one of the commonest intra-abdominal organs injured worldwide in blunt and penetrating trauma and its management has evolved significantly in the last 30 years. Mandatory laparotomy has been replaced by an acceptance that for most blunt hepatic trauma, a selective non-operative approach is safe and effective with a failure rate ie the need to proceed to delayed laparotomy of approximately 10%. There is a markedly lower rate of complications in those that are managed non-operatively. Adjuncts to this conservative regimen such as angioembolisation and delayed laparoscopy to treat biliary peritonitis increase the chances of avoiding laparotomy. This belief in non-operative management has also been transferred to some degree to penetrating liver trauma, where there is a gradual accumulation of evidence to support this non-operative approach in a carefully selected group of patients. This article examines the evidence supporting the selective non-operative management of both blunt and penetrating liver trauma and describes the outcomes and complications.","757":"Damage Control Resuscitation and Damage Control Surgery (DCR-DCS) is an approach to managing severely injured patients according to their physiological needs, in order to optimise outcome. Key to delivering DCR-DCS is effective communication between members of the clinical team and in particular between the surgeon and anaesthetist, in order to sequence and prioritise interventions. Although the requirement for effective communication is self-evident, the principles to achieving this can be forgotten and sub-optimal when unexpected problems arise at critical points during management of challenging cases. A system is described which builds on the 'World Health Organisation (WHO) safer surgery checklist' and formalises certain stages of communication in order to assure the effective passage of key points. We have identified 3 distinct phases: (i) The Command Huddle, once the patient has been assessed in the Emergency room; (ii) The Snap Brief, once the patient has arrived in the Operating Room but before the start of surgery; and (iii) The Sit-Reps, every 10 minutes for the entire theatre team to maintain situational awareness and allow effective anticipation and planning.","758":"","759":"","760":"","761":"","762":"","763":"","764":"","765":"","766":"The Haywood Medical Society met in June 2011 to discuss issues surrounding the preparedness of both civilian and military emergency services to deal with a CBRN threat.","767":"We report the uncommon occurrence of a complete brachial artery transection following simple posterior dislocation of the elbow, successfully managed by cephalic vein interposition grafting.

Thirty five (n = 35) male Irish Defence Forces personnel, divided into training (n = 20) and control (n = 15) subgroups, completed tests of military aptitude (Kim's games, judging distance, fire order, map reading, weapon assembly) and neuropsychological function (Symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), Trail making test, Stroop test and grooved pegboard test) pre- and post-intervention. The repeated measures study design sought to account for any learning effect. Participants also completed a 10km route march, a two mile run and three by 20m shuttle run tests at both time points to quantify changes in fitness variables. The training sub-group significantly (P &lt; 0.001) improved mean 20m shuttle-run distance and consequently estimated VO2 max pre- to post-intervention (49.8 +\/- 1.0 vs. 52.4 +\/- 0.9 mL x kg x min(-1)). Two mile run time was not significantly improved. Mean %HRmax during the 10km route march was significantly higher in both training (P &lt; 0.001) and control (P &lt; 0.01) sub-groups post-intervention (71 +\/- 1 and 83 +\/- 1%) compared to pre-intervention (65 +\/- 1 and 77 +\/- 1%). However, the training sub-group conducted the route march at a significantly faster speed on the second occasion. Military training significantly improved performance in 3\/18 neuropsychological test components and 2\/12 military skills test components. Training significantly improved ability to estimate both short (error; 36 +\/- 6 vs. 12 +\/- 1%) and intermediate (error; 72 +\/- 12 vs. 11 +\/- 3%) distances post-intervention.

In 2007 an audit showed poor pre-injury AMC compliance and a prescription rate of 50% amongst those casualties evacuated to Role 4. We re-audited the post-deployment AMC prescribing practice for casualties from Afghanistan for the 2008 and half of the 2009 malaria season. Using the Role 4 prescribing information and communication system (PICS), a retrospective AMC search for Proguanil, Chloroquine, Doxycycline, Mefloquine and Malarone was performed on these casualties. Only five out of 305 (1.64%) inpatients were prescribed appropriate post-deployment AMC medication. Awareness of the need to prescribe AMC following evacuation remains poor, and may be improved by recording AMC compliance in field medical records and modifying the PICS software.","771":"Recent military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in the treatment of children in British Medical facilities. In order to determine how care for children may develop in the future, it is necessary to understand the current situation. The aim of this article is to examine the pattern of paediatric trauma on recent operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Data was requested from the Joint Theatre Trauma Registry, held at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, on all trauma calls for patients aged under 16 between the dates 21\/3\/03 and 31\/8\/09. Data included age, gender, theatre of operation, injury mechanism and type, trauma scores and destination of the child. 176 children were identified with 16.5% from Iraq and 83.5% from Afghanistan. The overall survival rate was 88.6% with survival rates in Iraq of 89.7% and in Afghanistan of 88.4%. Males accounted for 66.5% of admissions and the commonest age group was age 6-8 years. In 59.1% of total admissions the mechanism of injury was related to explosives. This differed between theatres with explosive injury causing 27.6% of admissions in Iraq and 63.5% in Afghanistan. Injury Severity Scores (ISS) showed equal numbers of minor and severe injuries with fewer moderately injured patients. The median ISS of all data was nine. The median ISS from Iraq was 16 and the median ISS from Afghanistan was nine. The treatment of children in British medical facilities whilst deployed on operations is likely to continue. An assessment of the injury patterns of paediatric patients on current deployments allows development of training and an understanding of logistic requirements. Data collection will also need to be adapted to meet the needs of paediatric patients. These remain issues that are being addressed by the Defence Medical Services. ","772":"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an important health risk factor for military personnel deployed in modern warfare. In World War I this condition (then known as shell shock or 'neurasthenia') was such a problem that 'forward psychiatry' was begun by French doctors in 1915. Some British doctors tried general anaesthesia as a treatment (ether and chloroform), while others preferred application of electricity. Four British 'forward psychiatric units' were set up in 1917. Hospitals for shell shocked soldiers were also established in Britain, including (for officers) Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh; patients diagnosed to have more serious psychiatric conditions were transferred to the Royal Edinburgh Asylum. Towards the end of 1918 anaesthetic and electrical treatments of shell shock were gradually displaced by modified Freudian methods psychodynamic intervention. The efficacy of 'forward psychiatry' was controversial. In 1922 the War Office produced a report on shell shock with recommendations for prevention of war neurosis. However, when World War II broke out in 1939, this seemed to have been ignored. The term 'combat fatigue' was introduced as breakdown rates became alarming, and then the value of pre-selection was recognised. At the Maudsley Hospital in London in 1940 barbiturate abreaction was advocated for quick relief from severe anxiety and hysteria, using i.v. anaesthetics: Somnifaine, paraldehyde, Sodium Amytal. 'Pentothal narcosis' and 'narco-analysis' were adopted by British and American military psychiatrists. However, by 1945 medical thinking gradually settled on the same approaches that had seemed to be effective in 1918. The term PTSD was introduced in 1980. In the UK the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for management (2005) recommend trauma-focussed Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and consideration of antidepressants.","773":"This paper considers the strategic aspects of medical support to military operations as delivered through multi-national collaboration. The military medical services are in essence a people organisation; the purpose of the organisation is primarily to support the people engaged in military operations, and also the people providing healthcare to them. Increasingly, supporting the latter also includes preparation for the ethical dilemmas that they will face. Providing health advice and healthcare on operations is now usually undertaken on a multinational basis, in order to generate sufficient medical capacity to meet the requirement with assets of the appropriate (and NATO mandated) capability. This will be an enduring feature, particularly in light of increasing costs of providing high quality healthcare and the operational and logistic challenges of delivering this capability in adverse environments, and in the context of medical personnel being a limited resource. The key to overcoming the challenges, often the result of the \"people issues\" such as cultural differences, is to recognise the value that the inherent diversity of multinational healthcare provision brings. The benefit is realised through sharing best practice, and the lessons from challenges met, as well as through burden sharing, and to understand that challenges are most commonly the result of misunderstandings, such as those inherent in language differences. The advice for those bringing a multinational team together includes considering the implications of culture (noting differences in national and military perspectives, and in medical processes such as clinical governance), to ensure effective communication, and to utilise feedback to confirm understanding. It is important not to prejudge or denigrate others. Share information and knowledge, provide positive reinforcement when things go well, and recognise that there will inevitably be challenges and use these as an opportunity to learn. Above all, the personal touch builds a culture within the multinational team that transcends national culture; celebrating success breeds success and thus optimal outcome for patients.","774":"There is a high prevalence of Lower Back Pain (LBP) within military populations. Physiotherapeutic management has a primary role for patient care, but there is a need to establish the most effective management. Civilian physiotherapists provide the majority of clinical provision throughout the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Programme for British Armed Forces personnel. To date no study has been carried out looking at their perceptions and beliefs with regards to management of non-specific LBP and the potential impact this had on the delivery of rehabilitation across Defence. This mixed methods exploratory study aimed to explore the potential complexities surrounding the decision making process with regards to management of non-specific LBP using semi-structured interviews with 14 MOD civilian physiotherapists. All interviews were transcribed verbatim. The transcribed data was then subjected to a categorical content analysis. The analysis of the interview data revealed four interrelated themes that influence civilian physiotherapists in their management of back pain in military personnel: the military environment, integration of military procedures, physiotherapist treatment approach and communication. This paper highlights the value civilian physiotherapists place on experience when managing non-specific LBP. This experience however was gained through 'patient mileage' rather than integration of best evidence into practice. Several problems were identified in patient management including specific types of patients and their expectations and the importance of the right communication between Health Care Professionals, but also with patients.

In Afghanistan the survival rate is 97.0% for Danish wounded who were alive on arrival at UK R3 Hospital. British data from Afghanistan are compared to the Danish figures and there is no significant difference. We found an increase in injuries and deaths caused by mines\/IEDs from 33% in 2006 to 72.7% in 2009 of all weapon effects causes. The more offensive war fighting posture of the Danish forces in Afghanistan has resulted in greater numbers of casualties. The study also indicates that the great majority of fatalities occur almost immediately at the point of injury. Most of the wounded survive, and a large of number of them are only lightly injured with a partial incapacity level of less than five percent. Haemostatic's and active employment of tourniquets, improved first aid training and training of medics, better evacuation methods including optimised in-flight diagnostics and treatment (including blood transfusion) by Medical Emergency Response Teams, Damage Control Surgery as well as access to quicker diagnostic methods have increased survivability.","776":"","777":"","778":"Perineal trauma resulting from the adaptive use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has become an increasingly common problem during current operational conflicts in Afghanistan. Control of haemorrhage from the perineum and high amputations is a particular challenge due to the bony anatomy, rich pelvic vascular supply and the difficulty in achieving haemostasis by direct pressure. In this article, the authors describe a potential pre-hospital solution for controlling haemorrhage from perineal and high amputation injuries.","779":"","780":"","781":"","782":"","783":"","784":"This article presents the proceedings of a symposium on medical ethics held at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in October 2010.

Obese military personnel who adhere to a strict training and diet regime may potentially achieve and maintain significant weight loss. They may however face physical problems such as excess skin folds causing discomfort, difficulty in uniform fitting, personal hygiene, interference with full physical activities and psychological issues such as body image dissatisfaction, low self esteem and difficulty in social acceptance. We present a case report of a highly motivated military conscript who achieved and maintained significant weight loss but had physical defects following Massive Weight Loss. Body contouring surgery was successfully utilised to correct his physical defects and allowed him to return to full physical duties.","786":"The current conflict in Afghanistan is characterised by significant injuries resulting from the use of Improvised Explosive Devices. Increasing survivability from battlefield injury, escalating musculoskeletal ballistic trauma and the use of blast weaponry combine to produce an injury profile which defines contemporary combat casualty care. Such complex multi-system trauma challenges current wound care rationale. Ballistic injury of the perineum, often associated with proximal femoral injury and significant tissue loss, raises particular management difficulties. These cases demand an individualised, flexible approach due both to the extent of their wounds, logistical issues with positioning and often limited surgical approaches. Routine positioning and approaches around the pelvis may not be available to the surgical team due to presence of external fixators and tenuous skin bridges. The availability of donor skin to cover soft tissue defects is limited and as such, approaches to wounds with minimal additional tissue trauma are of particular use. We describe the benefits of endoscopic techniques and equipment in the evaluation and management of such an injury.","787":"Fragment embolisation following vascular injury is uncommon. The case of a 31 year old soldier, who sustained a penetrating fragment injury to the neck with distal arterial embolisation, is presented and the discussion illustrates both the importance of expedient assessment and management of cervical vascular injuries and of thorough correlation of clinical and radiological findings to avoid missed emboli.","788":"The coordination of the Military, Diplomatic and Economic\/Development levers of power, the so-called \"hard\" and \"soft\" powers, to bring about the strategic aims of governments, supported by Non-Governmental Organisations and international organisations, is commonly known as the Comprehensive Approach (CA).

The Personal Interfaced Hearing Protection (PIHP) system was procured as an Urgent Operational Requirement primarily to provide a connection to the Personal Role Radio. Through its custom- mould design it was also expected to act as Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) against NIHL in a method that had not been possible previously. The aim of this paper was to evaluate user opinion of the four current methods of hearing protection including PIHP. 108 service personnel serving in a Forward Operating Base in Afghanistan were questioned anonymously using a paper-based questionnaire. The response rate was 78%, reflecting the difficulties in anonymous data collection in an environment such as this. PIHP was perceived to be more practical for use on the ranges or patrolling than the standard methods of hearing protection. Although only 4% were routinely wearing PIHP on patrol, this was related to understandable reluctance in wearing a new system that had only been issued immediately prior to this deployment. Early design problems highlighted by our study, such as changes in the design of the ear-piece to improve retention, have already been implemented. Compliance will be improved through a dedicated educational programme to explain its relevance. Despite the logistical difficulties in providing custom- made ear moulds, the PIHP system must be delivered to all service personnel early in their career so they are confident in its use long before operational deployment. Future research is required to ascertain the effectiveness of PIHP as a method of PPE in reducing the incidence of NIHL.","792":"Throughout the history of warfare, changes in weaponry have produced changes in the nature of war injury. The 16th century saw the introduction of firearms in conventional warfare, bringing the destructive power of weaponry to new and unseen heights with a dramatic increase in the severity and complexity of battle injuries. Destructive gunshot wounding associated with embedded foreign material often led to sepsis and demanded the more radical treatment of amputation. Over the past 500 years innumerable developments have taken place in anaesthesia, asepsis, transfusion therapy and resuscitation, antibiotic therapy, vascular surgery and wound management. Medical services have had to adapt in order to cope with the changing volume and changing nature of battle casualties resulting from modern weaponry. Despite the progress made, amputation is still a commonly performed operation following traumatic limb injury. In those cases where the decision to amputate is not so clearly and distinctly defined, history has shown that prevention of infection requires aggressive primary surgery and removal of all devitalised tissue. This paper examines the history of amputation in the management of the battlefield casualty suffering limb injury, beginning in the 16th century and continuing into present day.","793":"Definitive laparotomy (DL), with completion of all surgical tasks at first laparotomy has traditionally been the basis of surgical care of severe abdominal trauma. Damage control surgery (DCS) with a goal of physiological normalisation achieved with termination of operation before completion of anatomical reconstruction, has recently found favour in management of civilian trauma. This study aims to characterise the contemporary UK military surgeon's approach to abdominal injury. A retrospective analysis was performed on British service personnel who underwent a laparotomy for intestinal injury at UK forward hospitals from November 2003 to March 2008 as identified from the Joint Theatre Trauma Registry. Patient demographics, mechanism and pattern of injury and clinical outcomes were recorded. Surgical procedures at first and subsequent laparotomy were evaluated by an expert panel. 22 patients with intestinal injury underwent laparotomy and survived to be repatriated; all patients subsequently survived to hospital discharge. Mechanism of injury was GSW in seven and blast in 13. At primary laparotomy, as defined by the operating surgeon, 15\/22 underwent DL and 7\/22 underwent DCS. Mean Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 19 for DL patients compared to 29 for DCS patients (p = 0.021). Of the 15 patients undergoing DL nine had primary repair (suture or resection\/ anastomosis), one of which subsequently leaked. Unplanned re-look was required in 4\/15 of the DL cases. This review examines the activity of British military surgeons over a time period where damage control laparotomy has been introduced into regular practice. It is performed at a ratio of approximately 1:2 to DL and appears to be reserved, in accordance with military surgical doctrine, for the more severely injured patients. There is a high rate of unplanned relook procedures for DL suggesting DCS may still be underused by military surgeons. Optimal methods of selection and implementation of DCS after battle injury to the abdomen remain unclear. ","794":"The UK Defence Medical Services has developed a Massive Transfusion Protocol (MTP) that forms part of the initial Damage Control Resuscitation process for severely injured combat casualties. The key objectives of this retrospective review of MTP recipients are to document the survival rates, level of critical care support required and the blood components transfused as part of the Massive Transfusion Protocol in Afghanistan during 2009. In addition to providing a measure of our current effectiveness it should also provide a reference point for future reviews as the MTP continues to evolve. This was a collaborative project involving the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine and the Critical Care Department, University Hospitals Birmingham. It was limited to UK military personnel who were injured in 2009 and received massive transfusions (defined as the transfusion of 10 or more units of packed red blood cells over a 24-hour period) at Camp Bastion Role 3 Medical Facility, Afghanistan. During the 12-month period, 59 personnel received massive transfusions. 51 (86%) personnel survived to be discharged from hospital in the UK. 48 (92%) personnel required ventilatory support for a median of 3 (2-8) days. The longest period of ventilation was 40 days; 29 (55%) personnel required vasopressor support and eight personnel (15%) required renal replacement therapy. The median total transfusion of blood components was 45 (28.5-62) units. There were seven transfusions of more than 100 units. Five of the personnel in this group (including the recipient of a 237-unit transfusion) survived to be discharged from University Hospitals Birmingham. On average, 1.21 (SD 0.28) units of packed red blood cells were transfused for every unit of fresh frozen plasma. The use of the current MTP was associated with a high rate of survival. Survivors require a continuity of critical care with a median demand for 3 days. The early use of plasma and platelets can be successfully delivered in the battlefield despite operational and logistic constraints. ","795":"","796":"","797":"Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) cause 60% of all UK fatalities in the current campaign in Afghanistan. Shorter evacuation timelines now deliver patients at the edge of the physiological envelope of survivability meaning that the available time period for haemorrhage control and initial wound surgery is short--often no more than 75 minutes. The concepts and practise of 'right turn resuscitation', damage control general and orthopaedic surgery, on-table 'ITU' pause\/catch-up and then further resuscitative surgery are commonplace. In Helmand in 2011, multiple team operating is now the norm on these casualties with up to seven surgeons and three anaesthetists simultaneously involved in the operative care of one patient. This usually involves one consultant orthopaedic surgeon and trainee per lower limb, a plastic surgeon on the upper limb or faceleyes and two general surgeons obtaining proximal vascular control or in-cavity haemorrhage control. A combined meeting in 2010 of the Lower Limb and Torso Trauma Working Groups of the Academic Department of Military Surgery and Trauma produced 25 clear, didactic statements to provide advice to the consultant team. The fundamental message is that bleeding is always a surgical problem. Some adjuncts are available; pressure (direct and indirect), compressive bandaging, haemostatic dressings and tourniquets. However, only formal surgical control, by whatever means is definitive. Early proximal control is mandatory: in all cases, rapidly obtain the most distally appropriate proximal control above the zone of injury.","798":"Contemporary combat casualty care has never been more sophisticated or effective, which is matched by an unprecedented level of clinical complexity. The management of this complexity has demanded the evolution of a more direct clinical leadership model in the field hospital: the Deployed Medical Director (DMD). The DMD has a central co-ordinating role in reducing the friction generated by individuals' unfamiliarity in a rapidly developing clinical environment that has diverged from the NHS; in cementing interoperability within a multinational medical treatment facility working at high intensity; and in maintaining and developing the highest clinical standards within the deployed trauma system. This article describes the evolution of the DMD role and illustrates the challenges through a series of vignettes. Particular emphasis is given to the organisational risk that the role carries through necessary ethical choices, the requirement to integrate multi-national cultural differences and the challenge of dealing with interpersonal frictions amongst senior staff.","799":"The role of nutritional support in critical illness is well established. This article reviews the nutritional management of military trauma patients in the deployed setting, which poses special challenges for the surgeon and intensivist. There is little direct evidence relating to the nutritional management of trauma patients in general, and military trauma patients in particular, but much of the evidence accrued in the civilian and non-trauma critical care setting can be extrapolated to military practice. There is strong consensus that feeding should be commenced as soon possible after injury. Enteral nutrition should be used in preference to parenteral nutrition whenever possible. If available, supplemental parenteral feeding can be considered if enteral delivery is insufficient. Gastrointestinal anastomoses and repairs, including those in the upper gastrointestinal tract, are not a contraindication to early enteral feeding. Intragastric delivery is more physiological and usually more convenient than postpyloric feeding, and thus the preferred route for the initiation of nutritional support. Feeding gastrostomies or jejunostomies should not be used for short-term nutritional support. Enteral feeding of patients with an open abdomen does not delay closure and may reduce the incidence of pneumonia, and enteral nutrition should be continued for scheduled relook surgery not involving hollow viscera or airway. Glutamine supplementation may improve outcome in trauma patients, but fish-oil containing feeds, while showing some promise, should be reserved for subgroups of patients with ARDS.","800":"There remains a significant paediatric workload through the military hospital in Camp Bastion. In this paper the authors review and discuss particular problems with resuscitation, investigation, anaesthetic and surgical issues in dealing with children suffering from ballistic injuries. Personal experience and recent papers are used for a qualitative analysis of difficult decisions in the management of paediatric ballistic trauma. Key questions are answered in separate paragraphs for each specialty. The information described in this paper should assist any deployed physician deal with paediatric casualties particularly if they are unaccustomed to paediatric patients in their normal practice.","801":"Testing and difficult decision-making is a sine qua non of surgical practice on military operations. Better pre-hospital care protocols, reduced evacuation timelines and increased scrutiny of outcome have rightfully emphasised the requirement of surgeons to \"get it right, first time and every time\" when treating patients.

There are many considerations to be made, including local and systemic patient factors, other wounded personnel and logistical constraints. Attempts have been made previously to form objective scoring criteria so as to remove possible subjectivity in this decision-making process. Furthermore, paediatric patients present their own particular dilemmas. This paper examines these various matters and, with contemporaneous evidence, presents recommendations for management.","803":"In this article the process of operating room resuscitation - commonly known as Right Turn Resuscitation (RTR) when conducted in the medical treatment facility at Camp Bastion - is described. The place of RTR within the concepts of damage control resuscitation and surgery is discussed along with activation criteria and protocols.

Key issues in current practice and organisation are discussed, with particular attention to areas where civilian and military practice differs. Possible future improvements are explored.","808":"Massive Transfusion is a part of Damage Control Resuscitation. The aim of transfusion therapy is to restore oxygen delivery to poorly perfused tissues and to treat the acute coagulopathy of trauma. The severity and complexity of modern injuries have led to the use of swift, protocol-driven care with the use of'Shock Packs' and management of metabolic complications. The proactive treatment of the coagulopathy has been termed Haemostatic Resuscitation. The delivery of this transfusion capability has required an increasingly sophisticated logistic and laboratory response. New operational capabilities have included cold chain solutions; laboratory management information systems; platelet apheresis and ROTEM. This investment in the massive transfusion capability has delivered rapid resuscitation. It has also enabled clinicians to direct individualised transfusion support following initial resuscitation i.e. goal directed therapy. Future technical solutions should further support the prehospital delivery of transfusion while addressing the logistic tail. However, the key to success is the knowledge and skills of frontline staff to deliver safe and appropriate blood transfusion.","809":"The resuscitation of severely injured patients has evolved during the last decade. Patients are now surviving injuries that previously were thought to be unsurvivable.

Research presented at scientific meetings is an important source of such evidence, informing clinical decision making both on military operations and in home nation health care systems. The aim of this study is to review the levels of evidence presented at the Combined Services Orthopaedic Society (CSOS) and two other related scientific meetings. Retrospective review of abstracts presented at the annual scientific meetings of the CSOS, Society of Military Orthopaedic Surgeons (SOMOS) and the British Trauma Society (BTS). Basic science studies, animal studies, cadaveric studies, surveys and guest lectures were excluded. Research abstracts were categorised according to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's (CEBM) hierarchy of evidence. Statistical comparison was performed to investigate differences in evidence levels presented at each scientific meeting and between each year of the CSOS meeting. 596 abstracts met the inclusion criteria for this study (179 CSOS, 173 SOMOS, 244 BTS). Level IV evidence accounted for the majority of presented abstracts at each meeting (72.6% CSOS, 69.4% SOMOS, 68.9% BTS). Level I evidence was uncommon at each meeting (6.1% CSOS, 5.2% SOMOS, 2.9% BTS). There was no statistical difference in the evidence levels presented at the three scientific meetings. The proportion of comparative clinical studies (Levels I-III) presented at military or trauma societies' scientific meetings reflects the difficulty of performing research in emergency surgery. This is further exacerbated in the military environment where operational commitments and delivery of care take priority. However, the future value of comparative clinical research in battlefield healthcare could have an enduring legacy that shapes trauma care for many decades. ","821":"Recently published case reports, coupled with a large observational study of 1017 deployed servicemen to Iraq (January 2009), has highlighted the issue and potential concerns regarding the unregulated use of dietary and exercise supplements within the British military. Consequently, an exploratory pilot study was undertaken to assess whether the findings of the previous Iraq study were applicable to current deployed British servicemen in Afghanistan. This was a voluntary questionnaire-based study targeted at individuals attending a health promotion fair in Camp Bastion, Afghanistan in June 2010. From 150 questionnaires handed out there were 87 completed questionnaires (58% return). The mean age was 28.0 (SD 7.1; range of 18-50 years) with 89.7% being male. From the total of 87 persons 46.0% were self-declared current smokers with 37.9% admitting to drinking &gt;6 caffeinated drinks per day. Forty nine persons (56.3%) admitted to a history of supplement use with 35 (40.2% compared with 32.0% in 2009 in Iraq) declaring current use. The average duration of supplement use among current users was 3.0 (2.0-9.0) months. The main sources of supplement supply were via local NAAFI purchase (57.1%), internet purchase (40.0%) and via their local chemist (2.9%). The main types of supplement used were proteins\/amino acids (85.7%), creatine (34.3%), chromium (31.4%), stimulants (17.1%), hydroxycut (5.7%), and testosterone boosters (1.2%) with no persons admitting to the use of ephedra or anabolic steroids. A significant proportion of the British servicemen employed on operations in Afghanistan who were sampled, admitted to current dietary and exercise supplement use whilst on deployment. The results of this small study suggest that their use on operations may be increasing. Smoking rates and caffeine consumption, on deployment, remain high in the British military. A larger detailed study with greater representation among soldiers deployed to forward operating bases would be helpful to fully appreciate the scale of supplement use. ","822":"Flea bites can cause irritating symptoms, secondary infections, and may potentiate the spread of vector-borne disease. Flea infestation and bites may also cause significant psychological distress, and can reduce the morale and fighting fitness of deployed military personnel. The problem of flea infestation was highlighted during Op HERRICK 12 in two 'front line' Check Points (CPs) where the entire population of soldiers suffered from multiple symptoms due to flea infestation and bites. Several attempts at infestation control initially succeeded but later lead to recurrence. Such failure was due to the incomplete killing of all stages of the flea life cycle, and due to constraints on education, training, communication, and resupply in the isolated and austere environment of the CPs. A dedicated operation (designated Op Insecticide) was put into action in order to eradicate the problem and return the affected troops back to full fighting fitness. Op Insecticide was thorough, systematic and sustainable, and lead to an eradication of the flea infestation problem at the affected CPs.","823":"This historical account, based on a survey of 250 medical articles written during and immediately after World War II, reviews the immediate treatment of frostbite in the American and German ground troops in Europe from 1941 to 1945.

Because the German patients' injuries were more severe than those of the American soldiers and because neither Army carried out strict clinical trials nor prolonged follow-ups, it is impossible to judge what treatment was superior.","824":"The purpose of this study was to examine knee valgus in drop landings during three different footwear conditions and to examine the ground reaction forces exhibited during the drop landing in the three different footwear conditions. Sixteen male and female Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) university undergraduate cadets (21 +\/- 3 yrs, 79 +\/- 12 kg, and 172 +\/- 10 cm) volunteered to participate in the study. Kinematic data were collected while participants performed drop landings in three conditions: bare feet, tennis shoes, and issued military boots. Significant differences among footwear for ground reaction forces (bare feet: 1646 +\/- 359%, tennis shoe: 1880 +\/- 379%, boot: 1833 +\/- 438%; p &lt; 0.05) were found, while there was no significant difference in knee valgus among footwear. Though footwear conditions did not affect knee valgus, they did affect ground reaction forces. Participants in this study had yet to receive any military training on how to land properly from a specified height. Further research should be completed to analyze the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity during different landing strategies implemented by trained military personnel in order to better understand injury mechanisms of drop landings in this population. It is likely that injury prevention landing techniques would be beneficial if these were employed by the military and not just in the sporting community. ","825":"This paper describes the key themes in presentations to the Emergency Department (ED) of the UK Field Hospital throughout the three-year period of April 2006 to April 2009 (Op HERRICK 4-9). Electronic ED attendance records held in the Operational Emergency Department Attendance Register (OpEDAR) were analysed with validation by Defence Analytical Services Agency and commentary by ADMEM clinical staff. This paper discusses absolute numbers of emergency department attendances ofwhich there were 11,158 recorded over the studyperiod. It does not compare them to personnel at risk or operational tempo. Ofthese attendances, 59.7% (n=6666) were U.K. military. Explosive injuries (15.2%, n=1699), particularly Improvised Explosive Devices, increased throughout the period as did gunshotwounds (7.3%, n=809). Battle injuries represented 23.3% (n=2,602) attendances and had a fatality rate of 10.9%. 38.8% (n=4327) of attendances were non-battle injuries and had a fatality rate of 0.4%. There were no fatalities in the 34.1% (n=3,800) attendances for disease. 315 fatalities were recorded (this figure relates to all attendances - not just UK personnel) with 90.2% (n=284) due to battle injuries. 59.4% (n=187) were due to explosives and 28.9% (n=91) due to gunshot wounds. Over the period, the hospital's workload was characterised by an increase in explosive and gunshot injuries. In this role, the hospital met its obligation of responding to traumatic battle injury in support of fighting power and morale. Equally, the hospital faced a high proportion of attendances for non-battle injury and illness, and by patients from the local population. Extrapolation of data enables accurate medical planning and pre-deployment training and facilitates preparation for current operations.

The impacts in terms of both short-term and long-term consequences require modern militaries to develop and instigate a duty of care for its personnel, which informs the military's 'cradle to the grave' approach in addressing alcohol consumption and other risky health behaviours (e.g. smoking, driving, sex, drugs, obesity, etc.). Thus, in recent years there have been numerous studies that have either focused on, or included, measures of alcohol consumption among various military populations. Therefore, a synthesis of this research is warranted in order to provide a contemporary understanding of this topic. This review addresses the military research regarding alcohol consumption. It reviews the methodological issues associated with the breadth of research, as well as commenting on a range of factors that need to be considered when interpreting and comparing the different research studies; for example, (1) when comparing findings across military to civilian and pan-military populations, (2) deployment-related research, (3) military groups at risk, and (4) the impact on readiness, operational effectiveness and force sustainability.","839":"A study is made to determine the prevalence of smoking and its variation over time in a group of Spanish military personnel (MP) under stressful conditions. A questionnaire specifically designed for this study was administered to the entire MP contingent assigned to Banghis province (Afghanistan) between July and October 2009. A descriptive analysis was made (p &lt; 0.05, 95%CI). The study sample comprised 254 MP (males 239; mean age 32 years (SD 9)). A total of 39.8% (95%CI; 33.7 - 45.8) were smokers, while 3.1% (95%CI; 1.0 - 5.3%) were former smokers. Regarding smoking habit before and at the end of deployment, one-half (50.5%) of the smokers declared that they smoked the same as before, 20.8% more than before, and 18.8% less than before. In turn, 5.9% of the smokers claimed to have started to smoke in the course of deployment, while 4% of the former smokers declared that they had quit smoking. The MP who quit smoking were younger than those who began to smoke (24 +\/- 5 vs 39 +\/- 9 years, p = 0.038). Moreover, the heavy smokers (&gt; or = 15 cigarettes\/day) reduced tobacco consumption, while the less heavy smokers increased the habit (p &lt; 0.0001). The prevalence of daily smokers is high among MP. The majority of smokers smoke the same at the end of deployment. Those who quit smoking during the mission are significantly younger than those who begin to smoke. In turn, heavy smokers reduced their habit, while less heavy smokers increased smoking. ","840":"Medical Force Protection (MFP) is important in keeping service personnel \"fit to fight.\" It is particularly important for overseas deployment, where personnel are exposed to a range of infectious diseases. We report a full audit cycle assessing compliance with medical force protection measures, on an exercise in Belize. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to personnel four weeks after returning from an Infantry Overseas Training Exercise (OTX) in Belize in two successive years (OTX 1 &amp; 2). Compliance with physical MFP measures (mosquito nets, insecticide soak of kit and personal insect repellent usage) was excellent on both exercises. Antimalarial chemoprophylaxis compliance with a regime of weekly chloroquine and daily proguanil was poor (30%) during OTX 1. Revision of the regime to weekly chloroquine alone following review of antimalarial policies increased compliance on OTX 2 to 67%. Simplification of dosage regimes, consistency of information provided between different medical briefs and emphasis of the threat from malaria in Belize significantly improved compliance with antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. ","841":"Undifferentiated febrile illnesses have been a threat to British expeditionary forces ever since the Crusades. The infections responsible were identified during the Colonial Era, both World Wars and smaller conflicts since, but nearly all remain a significant threat today. Undiagnosed febrile illnesses have occurred amongst British troops in Helmand, Afghanistan since 2006 and so a fever study was performed to identify them. From May to October 2008, all undifferentiated fever cases seen at the British field hospital in Helmand, Afghanistan were assessed using a standard protocol. Demographic details, clinical features and laboratory results were recorded and paired serum samples were sent for testing at the UK Special Pathogens Reference Unit (SPRU). Over 6 months, there were 26 cases of\"Helmand Fever\" assessed and 23 diagnoses were made of which 12 (52%) were sandfly fever, 6 (26%) were acute Qfever and 5 (22%) were rickettsial infections. Four cases had co-infections and 7 cases were not diagnosed (mostly due to inadequate samples). The clinical features and laboratory results available at the British field hospital did not allow these diseases to be distinguished from each other. The exact type of rickettsial infection could not be identified at SPRU. These cases probably represent the \"tip of an iceberg\" for British and Allied forces. More resources for diagnostic facilities and follow-up of patients are required to improve the management and surveillance of \"Helmand Fever\" cases; until then doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 2 weeks should be given to all troops who present with an undifferentiated febrile illness in Helmand, Afghanistan. Patients with acute Q fever should be followed-up for at least 2 years to exclude chronic Q fever. Prevention of these diseases requires a better understanding of their epidemiology, but prophylaxis with doxycycline and possibly Q fever vaccine should be considered. ","842":"To record and discuss patient morbidity treated in a Forward Operating Base in Afghanistan and explore who delivers the care. Prospective case series of all patients presenting to the Regimental Aid Post during a summer tour of Afghanistan. 1903 episodes of care were delivered over a 6-month period in 2009. Afghan patients represented 32.8% of all cases seen. The majority of cases were related to primary care. The most common types of presentations were dermatological, other general medical conditions, other injuries and disorders of the digestive tract. Combat Medical Technicians (CMT) were able to deal with 47% of all cases using the CMT protocols. Primary care in forward areas involves patients from a spectrum of backgrounds with multiple morbidities and diagnoses. Consideration should be given for further research into the area of the consultation at the front line to aid patient care. Combat Medical Technicians were able to treat nearly 50% of all cases by themselves but this left a significant number where the assistance of a Medical Officer was required. Consideration should be given for further research into preparation of Combat Medical Technicians for autonomous working at the front line.

Military liver trauma is more often ballistic in nature and almost always requiring operative intervention. This article reviews established and evolving surgical techniques in the operative management of liver trauma.","844":"","845":"In the late 18th Century wound debridement consisted of incision of skin and deep fascia to release the swelling associated with ballistic injury, however extremity war wounds were more usually managed non-operatively or by amputation. During the First World War debridement was redefined to include excision of all non-viable and foreign material. In the modern era it has been proposed that wounds contain a zone of injured tissue which is not obviously non-viable at the initial debridement. Debridement which preserves this tissue has been described as marginal debridement. Wounds sustained in close proximity to explosions have an extensive zone of injury. Preservation of traumatised tissue may be beneficial in terms of limb salvage and limb reconstruction. Equally the complexity and contamination of these wounds, as well as the physiological frailty of the casualty, may make complete debridement in one sitting an unachievable goal. Where traumatised tissue has been left during debridement it must be reassessed at around 48 hours in order to reduce the risk of infection. Evacuation timelines and logistic infrastructure currently support serial marginal debridement but in future conflicts this may not be the case.","846":"","847":"'Exped 2010', a climbing and trekking expedition to the Everest region of Nepal, marked the 150th anniversary of the Army Cadet Force, during October 2010. A team of 20 cadets aged 14-18 years together with a combination of adults, mountain leaders and the expedition doctor, completed the trek to Everest Base Camp with a small number summiting Island Peak. The junior team, consisting of younger members aged 14-16 years, were limited to sleeping at a maximum altitude of 4240m but nevertheless, achieved a trekking altitude of 5000m. Over the three week period, there were a number of challenges for the expedition doctor--integrating into the team, finding time to rest and acclimatise along with the others whilst dealing with over 35 consultations, numerous cases of traveller's diarrhoea, several helicopter evacuations and also managing cases of altitude illness both within the group and for several foreign trekkers along the way.","848":"The Himalayan Rescue Association's (HRA) clinic in Pheriche, Nepal (4243m) is one of a number of high altitude medical posts where demands for services are increasing. Every year international doctors see over 1000 patients, assisting local people with basic health needs and providing emergency care for trekkers with both altitude-related and general illnesses and injuries. This article describes the work of the voluntary clinic and some of the challenges it faces.","849":"Systemic arterial pressure rises on acute exposure to high altitude and changes in blood pressure (BP) and endothelial function may be important in the pathogenesis of clinical syndromes occurring at high altitude. Arterial BP, stiffness (SI) and tone (RI) were studied over 11 days in 17 subjects (three having mild hypertension) ascending to 3,450m and 4,770m using a non-invasive, finger photoplethysmography technique. At 3,450m BP rose from mean 131\/75 mmHg (SD 23\/12) to 145\/86 (23\/12) and was maintained at this level (p &lt; 0.001). SI did not change significantly from 8.5 m\/sec (2.5) to 9.7 (3.2). RI fell during the first day at 3,450m from 74.4% (7.9) to 70.5% (13.8) (NS p &gt; 0.05) and to 69.9% (12.0) (p &lt; 0.02) at 4,770m but then reverted to baseline. Changes in SI and RI did not relate to changes in blood pressure. Changes in both arterial stiffness and tone were similar in those who developed AMS compared with those who did not. Baseline SI tended to be higher in the three subjects with hypertension 11.1m\/sec (SD 2.7)) compared with the normotensives 8.3 m\/sec (SD 2.7) (NS) and baseline RI lower 74.7% (7.0) compared with the normotensives 76.5% (8.5) (NS). Changes in SI and RI at altitude in the hypertensive subjects were similar to the non-hypertensive subjects. We conclude that acute exposure temporarily affected endothelial function as measured by a change in vascular tone but this did not predict the development of AMS. The rise in arterial BP was not related to changes in arterial stiffness or tone. ","850":"Several studies have shown deterioration in colour vision at altitudes above 3,000m. These studies have been conducted in photopic (bright daylight) conditions, whereas many military operations take place in mesopic (dim light) conditions. Data suggests that the tritan colour vision axis (blue cones, TA) are more susceptible to hypoxic insult than protan axis (red cones, PA). The objective of this study was to examine colour vision at high altitude, in mesopic conditions, and using a novel method of assessment to discriminate between the tritan and protan axis. We examined 42 eyes (21 subjects, mean age 44, range 22-71), at sea level and within 12-36 hours of exposure to 3300m. This was done in a darkened room, with refractive error correction. Colour vision was studied using ChromaTest, a software programme that analyzes colour contrast threshold (CCT) of both TA and PA. We planned to repeat CCT measurement at 4,392m, but technology failure prevented this. Non-parametric paired data was examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. There was found to be no change to either the PA (p = 0.409) or the TA (p = 0.871) upon ascent. Within the PA 16 eyes had a lower CCT at high altitude, whilst 26 were higher. In the TA 20 eyes had a lower CCT and 22 were higher. At sea level, mean CCT for PA was 4.21 (SD 2.29) TA was 7.06 (SD 1.77). At 3,300m mean CCT for PA was 4.36 (SD 2.86) and TA was 6.93 (SD 2.39). This experiment revealed no changes to colour vision with exposure to 3,300m. This may be below the threshold altitude for cone dysfunction, alternatively colour vision deterioration may be less significant in mesopic conditions. ","851":"This review presents a selection of sources from the UK and around the world that have reported on both incidents and accidents in the mountains. Common themes are extracted to illustrate the circumstances under which accidents, injuries and fatalities occur and the underlying factors that have contributed to incidents in the first place. There is an attempt to dispel some 'myths' surrounding accidents in mountain based activities. The purpose of highlighting these issues is to allow those undertaking them to understand where the greatest risks lie. This enables the individual, team leaders, rescue services and those involved in the overall management of wilderness areas to plan accordingly, with the aim of reducing injuries and deaths.","852":"Acute exposure to altitude principally encompasses aviation and space activities. These environments can be associated with very acute changes in pressure, oxygenation and temperature due to rates and magnitude of ascent that are not experienced in more chronic exposure such as mountaineering. The four key physiological challenges during acute exposure to altitude are: hypoxia (and hyperventilation), gas volume changes, decompression sickness and cold. The brief nature of aviation exposure to altitude provides little opportunity for acclimatisation, leading to markedly different effects when an individual is exposed to the same altitude acutely compared with an acclimatised individual climbing an 8000m (26 347ft) peak. Challenges such as hypobaric decompression sickness are not considered a hazard for chronic altitude exposure but are routine considerations for those flying to high altitude. Protective systems are essential for aircrew and passengers to survive and function during acute exposure to altitude.","853":"Non-freezing cold injury (NFCI) is the Cinderella of thermal injuries and is a clinical syndrome that occurs when tissues are exposed to cold temperatures close to freezing point for sustained periods. NFCI is insidious in onset, often difficult to recognize and problematic to treat, and yet the condition accounts for significant morbidity in both military and civilians who work in cold conditions. Consequently recognition of those at risk, limiting their exposure and the appropriate and timely use of suitable protective equipment are essential steps in trying to reduce the impact of the condition. This review addresses the issues surrounding NFCI.","854":"Frostbite is a thermal injury that can occur when temperatures drop low enough for tissue to freeze. On rewarming the tissues, an inflammatory process develops which is often associated with tissue loss. The extent of the tissue loss reflects the severity of the cold exposure and includes factors such as temperature, duration, wind chill, altitude, and systemic hypothermia. This review discusses the epidemiology, the pathophysiological processes involved, and the clinical management of frostbite injuries. Practical advice is given on both the field and hospital management and how to seek expert advice from remote situations. The review also discusses newer developments in frostbite treatment such as intra-vascular thrombolysis and adjunctive treatments such as the use of intravenous vasodilators.","855":"High altitude pulmonary oedema (HAPE) is an important and preventable cause of death at high altitudes. However, little is known about the global incidence of HAPE, in part because most cases occur in remote environments where no records are kept. Furthermore, despite international efforts to achieve consensus, there is wide disparity in the diagnostic criteria in clinical and research use. We have reviewed the literature on the incidence and epidemiology of HAPE. There is broad agreement between studies that HAPE incidence at 2500m is around 0.01%, and increases to 1.9% at 3600m and 2.5-5% at 4300m. Risk factors for HAPE include rate of ascent, intensity of exercise and absolute altitude attained, although an individual pre-disposition to developing the condition is also well described and suggests an underlying genetic susceptibility. It is increasingly recognised that clinically-detectable HAPE is an extreme of a continuous spectrum of excess pulmonary fluid accumulation, which has been demonstrated in asymptomatic individuals. There is a continued need to ensure awareness of the diagnosis and treatment of HAPE among visitors to high altitude. It is likely that HAPE is preventable in all cases by progressive acclimatisation, and we advocate a pragmatic \"golden rules\" approach. Our understanding of the epidemiology and underlying genetic susceptibility to HAPE may be advanced if susceptible individuals register with the International HAPE Database: http:\/\/www.altitude.org\/hape.php. HAPE has direct relevance to military training and operations and is likely to be the leading cause of death at high altitude.","856":"In the mountain environment sudden cardiac death (SCD) has been shown to be responsible for the deaths of up to 52% of downhill skiers and 30% of hikers. The majority of SCD's are precipitated by a ventricular arrhythmia. Although most are likely to result from structural abnormalities associated with conditions such as ischaemic heart disease, a small but significant number may be due to abnormalities in ion channel activity, commonly known as, \"channelopathies\". Channelopathies have the potential to lengthen the time between ventricular depolarisation and repolarisation that can result in prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) and episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) and eventually, ventricular fibrillation. This review examines the factors that prolong the QTc interval in the mountain environment and outlines a practical framework for preventing the life threatening arrhythmias that are associated with this condition.","857":"Palpitations at high altitude have been experienced, but seldom recorded, for centuries. The hypoxia, sympathetic activation and alkalosis of altitude predispose to cardiac ischaemia and arrhythmia. Indeed, sudden cardiac death is responsible for 30% of all deaths during mountain sports at altitude. This article reviews the literature to date on the evidence for cardiac arrhythmias at altitude.","858":"Increased ultraviolet light exposure and hypoxia at altitude along with the body's physiological adaptation to altitude can lead to problems with the visual system. The problems that occur can be at the time of the exposure or delayed. The article provides an overview of the ways which the different components of the visual system can be affected following such exposure.","859":"For the military doctor, an understanding of the metabolic effects of high altitude (HA) exposure is highly relevant. This review examines the acute metabolic challenge and subsequent changes in nutritional homeostasis that occur when troops deploy rapidly to HA. Key factors that impact on metabolism include the hypoxic-hypobaric environment, physical exercise and diet. Expected metabolic changes include augmentation of basal metabolic rate (BMR), decreased availability of oxygen in peripheral metabolic tissues, reduction in VO2 max, increased glucose dependency and lactate accumulation during exercise. The metabolic demands of exercise at HA are crucial. Equivalent activity requires greater effort and more energy than it does at sea level. Soldiers working at HA show high energy expenditure and this may exceed energy intake significantly. Energy intake at HA is affected adversely by reduced availability, reduced appetite and changes in endocrine parameters. Energy imbalance and loss of body water result in weight loss, which is extremely common at HA. Loss of fat predominates over loss of fat-free mass. This state resembles starvation and the preferential primary fuel source shifts from carbohydrate towards fat, reducing performance efficiency. However, these adverse effects can be mitigated by increasing energy intake in association with a high carbohydrate ration. Commanders must ensure that individuals are motivated, educated, strongly encouraged and empowered to meet their energy needs in order to maximise mission-effectiveness.","860":"Hypobaric hypoxia is associated with an increase in erythropoesis and an increased thrombotic risk. This is true of long haul air travel, mountaineering expeditions and longer stays at altitude. Studies looking at clotting on mountaineering expeditions are further complicated by the effects of exercise, plasma volume changes and the catecholamine response to hypoxia. This review examines the evidence for changes in clotting factors and functional clotting at altitude and considers the implications of altitude travel for those with pre-existing medical conditions.","861":"The acute acclimatization to high altitude is underpinned by a diuresis (and to a lesser extent a natriuresis) that facilitates a reduction in plasma volume. This allows a haemoconcentration to occur that increases the oxygen carrying capacity of a given volume of blood, a vital effect in the presence of a reduced partial pressure of oxygen. This critical acclimatization process is orchestrated by the endocrine system. This review will present the key evidence regarding the changes in several important hormones that affect this process.","862":"The changes in respiratory physiology that occur with increasing altitude are driven by the fall in the partial pressure of oxygen that occurs with decreasing barometric pressure. At altitude, respiratory system changes occur which impact on each step of the oxygen cascade that occurs within the body. These changes are pivotal to the process of acclimatisation to altitude. The study of human respiratory physiology at altitude has the potential to produce research that will be translational to disease states characterised by hypoxaemia.","863":"The role of the cardiovascular system is to deliver oxygenated blood to the tissues and remove metabolic effluent. It is clear that this complex system will have to adapt to maintain oxygen deliver in the profound hypoxia of high altitude. The literature on the adaptation of both the systemic and pulmonary circulations to high altitude is reviewed.","864":"","865":"Edgar Pask died in 1966 at the age of 53. He was the Professor of Anaesthesia in Newcastle upon Tyne, and a quiet and unassuming man. But during the Second World War he had been involved in a number of dangerous and remarkable experiments; these included investigating the effects of acute hypoxia related to high altitude parachute descents, resuscitation techniques and the effectiveness of lifejackets.","866":"Science and mountain exploration are closely linked throughout history. A large array of studies of varying complexity have been performed in conditions of hypobaric hypoxia, some on field studies, some in hypobaric chambers. The military has contributed greatly to this body of evidence both through operations in high altitude regions of the world, hypobaric chamber studies and through field studies as part of adventurous training expeditions. The hope is that by investigating hypoxia in fit participants in field or chamber studies insights may be gained into the adaptation to hypoxia during critical illness and novel approaches for treatment developed. Field studies in the mountains are challenging to design and undertake and need to balance practicalities (e.g. limited power supply) with scientific objectives. This article examines the history and rationale for high altitude research and discusses the challenges of organising a field study.","867":"","868":"The early development of the U.K. Role 4 pain service has already been described. This article will describe developments up to October 2010, and present the results of projects used in assessing the effect of this service.","869":"As epidurals are now used for pain relief on deployment a survey was conducted to look at the current epidural practice of U.K. military anaesthetists. The aim was to identify any potential issues with regard to equipment and training to allow future development ofpre-deployment training. An Internet based survey was carriedout. All military anaesthetistswere sent an e-mail containing a link to the survey and the results of those who responded were analysed. A total of 49 surveys were completed. 78% of respondents carried out epidurals more than once a month, in a wide range of specialities. There was considerable variation in methods of securing epidurals and in drug choice amongst respondents. The results of this survey show that whilst epidurals are commonly carried out amongst military anaesthetists during their U.K. practice, there is significant variation within the practice. Areas have been identified for development of educational courses, for example methods of securing epidurals, and these have already been acted upon. ","870":"Timely and appropriate access to the vascular circulation is critical in the management of 21st century battlefield trauma. It allows the administration of emergency drugs, analgesics and rapid replacement of blood volume. Methods used to gain access can include; the cannulation of peripheral and central veins, venous cut-down and intraosseus devices. This article reviews the current literature on the benefits and complications of each vascular access method. We conclude that intraosseus devices are best for quick access to the circulation, with central venous access via the subclavian route for large volume resuscitation and low complication rates. Military clinicians involved with the care of trauma patients either in Role 2 and 3 or as part of the medical emergency response team (MERT), must have the skill set to use these vascular access techniques by incorporating them into their core medical training.","871":"The Triservice Anaesthetic Apparatus was designed around 30 years ago as a robust and highly portable anaesthesia delivery system for medical support to airborne operations and it has been the core anaesthesia system for the Defence Medical Services since then. Over this period there have been a number of equipment changes but issues remain which are in part mitigated by recent training developments. This article reviews these changes and developments and considers the future of this equipment.","872":"The medical facility at Camp Bastion continues to evolve as a consequence of the increased throughput of battlefield trauma patients. There is a requirement for rapid and accurate diagnosis of haemodynamic instability and continued haemodynamic monitoring throughout the peri-operative period. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) has been used for this purpose in the arena of cardiac anaesthesia since the mid 1980s. It is being introduced to other peri-operative settings where severe haemodynamic instability is expected. The old proverb: 'There are none so blind as those who cannot see' (Jeremiah 5:21) is applicable to this topic, in that TOE is proven to be a rapid, portable, safe and effective tool in the assessment of the haemodynamically unstable patient. This paper explores the application of TOE for the assessment of the major causes of haemodynamic instability in the trauma population.","873":"Simulation in healthcare has come a long way since it's beginnings in the 1960s. Not only has the sophistication of simulator design increased, but the educational concepts of simulation have become much clearer. One particularly important area is that of non-technical skills (NTS) which has been developed from similar concepts in the aviation and nuclear industries. NTS models have been developed for anaesthetists and more recently for surgeons too. This has clear value for surgical team working and the recently developed Military Operational Surgical Training (MOST) course uses simulation and NTS to improve such team working. The scope for simulation in Defence medicine and anaesthesia does not stop here. Uses of simulation include pre-deployment training of hospital teams as well as Medical Emergency Response Team (MERT) and Critical Care Air Support Team (CCAST) staff. Future projects include developing Role 1 pre-deployment training. There is enormous scope for development in this important growth area of education and training.","874":"This paper briefly touches on the problem of dealing with the severely injured child requiring massive transfusion and produces a guide on the management of this based on the current Surgeon General's Operational Policy Letter. There are no known UK guidelines on massive transfusion in trauma in the paediatric population although many specialist centres have guidance for dealing with cases in theatre during elective surgery. It is hoped that these guidelines will be used by deployed military anaesthetists to aid in their management of these difficult cases, not normally seen in the U.K.","875":"Anaesthetists in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) are currently dealing with casualties who have an increased prevalence of injuries due to blast, fragmentation and gunshot wounds. Despite guidelines already existing for unanticipated difficult tracheal intubation these have been designed for a civilian population and might not be relevant for the anticipated difficult airway experienced in the deployed field hospital. In order to establish an overview of current practice, three methods of investigation were undertaken; a literature review, a survey of DMS Anaesthetists and a search of the UKJoint Theatre Trauma Database. Results are discussed in terms of anatomical site, bleeding in the airway, facial distortion, patient positioning and an anaesthetic approach. There are certain key principles that should be considered in all cases and these are considered. Potential pitfalls are discussed and our initial proposed guidelines for use in the deployed field hospital are presented.","876":"","877":"This descriptive paper focuses on the sequence of events that occur during the admission and ongoing management of the Military Polytrauma patient to Critical Care, Area B, Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB). It is intended to inform new clinical staff, the wider DMS, and potentially other NHS intensive care units which may be called upon to manage such patients during a military surge or following a U.K. domestic major incident.","878":"The primary brain insult that occurs at the time of head injury, is determined by the degree of neuronal damage or death and so cannot be influenced by further treatment. The focus of immediate and ongoing care from the point of wounding to intensive care management at Role 4 should be to reduce or prevent any secondary brain injury. The interventions and triage decisions must be reassessed at every stage of the process, but should focus on appropriate airway management, maintenance of oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels and maintenance of adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. Early identification of raised intracranial pressure and appropriate surgical intervention are imperative. Concurrent injuries must also be managed appropriately. Attention to detail at every stage of the evacuation chain should allow the head-injured patient the best chance of recovery.","879":"The combination of trauma and poisoning is a situation likely to be faced by a deployed force at some point. This article provides practical advice on how to deal with poisoned patients without deviating from the concept of damage control resuscitation. The constraints of limited diagnostics, both at the scene and clinically, and lack of antidotal therapy are fundamental to the practice of clinical toxicology. Some of the specific therapies such as atropine and oximes were not evaluated prior to their introduction and there are few randomised controlled trials of poisoned patients. Most of the diagnoses will be made on clinical grounds and most of the therapy will be supportive; this article aims to reassure military anaesthetists in the process of dealing with the poisoned trauma patient.","880":"This paper describes the author's experience of the paediatric patient load on the U.K. medical services in Afghanistan. Over a 3 month period there was a mean of 2.9 paediatric trauma admissions per week, mean age was 6.8 years with gunshot wound or explosive injury being the mechanisms of injury in 77% of the trauma admissions. Overall these children represented 10.8% of the surgical workload. Some of the issues of paediatric anaesthesia in this environment are discussed including paediatric equipment, resuscitation for paediatric massive haemorrhage and regional anaesthesia. The need to formally recognise the problem in training and equipping deployed medical personnel to deal with this challenge is examined.","881":"Pneumorrhachis or intraspinal air is an increasingly encountered phenomenon in the management of severe trauma. The case of a 23-year-old soldier, who sustained a gunshot wound to the chest, is presented and the subsequent discussion illustrates that while often benign this phenomenon may indicate serious occult injury.","882":"Injury following ballistic trauma is the most prevalent indication for providing organ system support within an ICU in the field. Following damage control surgery, postoperative ventilatory support may be required, but multiple factors may influence the indications for and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. Ballistic trauma and surgery may trigger the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and are important causative factors in the development of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, their pathophysiological effect on the respiratory system is unpredictable and variable. Invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with numerous complications and the return to spontaneous ventilation has many physiological benefits. Following trauma, shorter periods of ICU sedation-amnesia and a protocol for early weaning and extubation, may minimize complications and have a beneficial effect on their psychological recovery. In the presence of stable respiratory function, appropriate analgesia and favourable operational and transfer criteria, we believe that the prompt restoration of spontaneous ventilation and early tracheal extubation should be a clinical objective for casualties within the field ICU.","883":"The contribution of anaesthesia to the care of injured military personnel at Role 4 is described with particular emphasis on the working relationship between the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine and the civilian department of anaesthesia. The implications for operating theatre activity are discussed.","884":"Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) and target-controlled infusion (TCI) of anaesthesia are techniques that have benefited from recent advances in microprocessor technology and drug design. Though dependant on technology, they offer significant clinical benefits and logistic advantages. Manipulation of complex data derived from population pharmacokinetics has enabled greater understanding of drug handling models, thus enabling individual patient titration of anaesthesia. This has also informed manual techniques of intravenous anaesthesia. These approaches constitute a useful and logical alternative in the field, both in austere circumstances as well as the more established deployed setting. The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of potent intravenous anaesthesia agents in the complex combat trauma patient require continued examination.","885":"The purpose of this systematic review is to investigate current evidence for analgesic use in the prehospital environment using expert military and civilian opinion to determine the important clinical questions. There was a high degree of agreement that pain should be no worse than mild, that pain relief be rapid (within 10 minutes), that patients should respond to verbal stimuli and not require ventilatory support, and that major adverse events should be avoided. Twenty-one studies provided information about 6212 patients; the majority reported most of the outcomes of interest. With opioids 60-70% of patients still had pain levels above 30\/100 mm on a Visual Analogue Scale after 10 minutes, falling to about 30% by 30-40 minutes. Fascia iliaca blocks demonstrated some efficacy for femoral fractures. No patient on opioids required ventilatory support; two required naloxone; sedation was rare. Cardiovascular instability was uncommon. Main adverse events were dizziness or giddiness, and pruritus with opioids. There was little evidence regarding the prehospital use ofketamine.","886":"This review presents the history of pre-hospital anaesthesia, it's evidence base, required training and examines current arguments focusing on best practice such as who should undertake the procedure and how identifying appropriate patients, utilizing new techniques and drugs may benefit the Pre-hospital practitioner in optimum delivery of this important procedure.","887":"","888":"","889":"","890":"","891":"","892":"Swimming-Induced Pulmonary Oedema (SIPE) has been described in military combat swimmers in both the US and Israeli Navies. The pathophysiology is explained by the immersion in cold water, and its effects on central vascular volume. SIPE has been hypothesized to be caused by pulmonary capillary stress failure (PCSF) due to elevations in pulmonary capillary transmural pressure. This leads to mechanical impairment and leakage of blood cells and proteins from capillaries. Patients with SIPE can present with pronounced dyspnoea, cough, hypoxemia and profuse frothy haemoptysis. Physical examination and chest X-rays usually show evidence of pulmonary oedema. The treatment of choice is to recognize the symptoms, get the patient out of the water and follow with close observation for emergent problems. Soldiers prone to acquire SIPE should be identified as this medical condition has a high degree of recurrence. The awareness of the symptoms of SIPE will increase appropriate diagnosis and therefore inform treatment.","893":"Spinal manipulative therapy performed by chiropractors is increasingly common in the United Kingdom. Spinal epidural haematoma is a rare complication of such physical therapy but when identified represents a neurological emergency. We describe the case of a 64 year-old man who presented with a dense hemiplegia due to a spinal epidural haematoma following cervical spine manipulation performed for acute neck pain. The clinical features and surgical management of the case are discussed and we stress the importance of recognition of chiropractic manipulation as a potential cause of neurological sequelae and discuss the potential pitfalls of such therapy as it becomes more widespread.","894":"For military forces, the control of infectious acute gastroenteritis constitutes an old, constant and unsolved concern. Recent epidemiological studies suggest that the common bacterial causes are being overtaken by viruses. Norviruses are the most alarming group and norovirus outbreaks in military forces are regularly reported. Illness is generally mild and characterised by acute vomiting and diarrhoea, which lasts for a few days on average, but may be severe and potentially life-threatening in subjects who are already dehydrated due to daily activity. Moreover, outbreaks may diminish operational effectiveness. Prevention of norovirus infection currently relies on strict application of personal and collective hygiene rules including isolation of the cases, to the greatest possible extent. Although noroviruses are frequently mentioned as the cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks in troops deployed overseas, laboratory diagnosis is rarely done. So their real burden in military forces remains unclear and further epidemiological studies are required to determine the full impact of norovirus gastroenteritis on troops.","895":"Using previously validated methods, 16 anaesthetised large white pigs were exposed to phosgene (target inhaled dose 0.3 mg kg(-1)), established on mechanical ventilation and randomised to treatment with either nebulised furosemide (4 ml of 10 mg x ml(-1) solution) or saline control. Treatments were given at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16 and 20 hours post phosgene exposure; the animals were monitored to 24 hours following phosgene exposure. Furosemide treatment had no effect on survival, and had a deleterious effect on PaO2: FiO2 ratio between 19 and 24 hours. All other measures investigated were unaffected by treatment. Nebulised furosemide treatment following phosgene induced acute lung injury does not improve survival and worsens PaO2: FiO2 ratio. Nebulised furosemide should be avoided following phosgene exposure. ","896":"Compartment syndrome of the foot is a rare complication of injury to the foot. Treatment by decompression of the compartments is debatable. The debate surrounding decompression stems from the rarity of the condition, the lack of consensus regarding the anatomy of the foot compartments and whether to accept the inevitable contractures by not decompressing. The aim of this paper is two fold; firstly to sample current military orthopaedic experience and secondly establish if there exists a consensus of opinion in how and if to perform fasciotomy of the foot thereby providing guidance to other clinicians. A questionnaire was sent to 10 DMS orthopaedic consultants to identify their experience with foot compartment syndrome and performing foot fasciotomies. Five had performed a foot fasciotomy (average 2, range 1-6) over an average of 6.2 years as consultant and an average of 7.3 months deployed. Most commonly two dorsal and a medial incision were used to decompress the foot. One surgeon advocated not decompressing the foot and accepting the subsequent contractures, DMS clinicians need to remain vigilant to compartment syndrome of the foot and especially in cases of crush or blast injury or of multiple fractures. If diagnosed or even if an impending compartment syndrome is suspected then, in line with the current weight of expert opinion, the foot should be decompressed and the deployed orthopaedic surgeon should be capable of performing it. Evidence concerning their battlefield use is limited. Extensive UK military trials are ongoing and the results of which are expected to clarify questions regarding complication rate and efficacy. ","897":"To study the additional effect of a pneumatic leg brace with standard rehabilitation for the treatment of medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) in recruits. In a single blinded randomized study, 15 recruits (age 17-22) followed a rehabilitation programme consisting of leg exercises and a graded running programme. Recruits performed daily exercises and ran three times a week. The running programme consisted of 6 consecutive phases. One group was, after randomization, additionally provided with a pneumatic leg brace. Follow-up was provided every other week. Days to completing the running programme was the primary outcome measure, the Sports Activity Rating Scale (SARS) score and satisfaction with the treatment were secondary outcome measures. In total 14 recruits completed the rehabilitation programme. No differences were found in the number of days until phase six of the running schedule was finished between the brace and the control group (Brace 58.8 +\/- 27.7 (mean +\/- SD) vs Non-Brace 57.9 +\/- 26.2 (mean +\/- SD, p = 0.57). Also no differences were found in the SARS scores between the groups. Overall satisfaction with the treatment was 6.4 +\/- 1.1 (mean +\/- SD) on a 1-10 scale for the brace group and 7.1 +\/- 0.7 (mean +\/- SD) for the control group (p = 0.06). Comfort of the brace was assessed as 4.8 +\/- 1.3 (mean +\/- SD) on a 1-10 scale. No additional large effect of the pneumatic leg brace could be found in recruits and wearing of the brace was not feasible, since the wearing comfort was low. ","898":"The use of bedside ultrasound to localise pleural effusions has gained in popularity in recent years. We investigated whether or not junior doctors could accurately identify thoracic anatomical structures and localise pleural effusions using bedside ultrasound. Junior doctors were instructed by a consultant chest physician in the theory and practice of using ultrasound to localise pleural effusions, and then instructed in the method of inserting a Seldinger chest drain. Juniors were instructed to record a scan picture, including labelling of relevant structures. We then conducted a review of 52 images, noting indications, complications and the grade of doctor performing the scan. A consultant radiologist reviewed the scan pictures to confirm that the anatomy was correctly identified. Fifty out of 52 images (96%) were of diagnostic quality, with the anatomy correctly identified. The complication rate from chest drain insertion was 3.85%. With instruction, junior doctors can competently utilise basic chest ultrasound, obtain useful images, identify relevant thoracic anatomy and insert chest drains by the Seldinger technique with a low rate of complications. We suggest thoracic ultrasound should be more widely taught to junior doctors. ","899":"To determine the strength of evidence supporting the battlefield use of Continual Peripheral Nerve Blocks (CPNBs). Publication review identifying 380 potentially relevant papers. CPNBs have been well trialled and are used routinely in civilian hospitals. The procedure is not without acute and chronic complications related to agents used, catheters themselves and infection risks. These techniques are being used increasingly in military field hospitals to manage pain, however research concerning their use on the battlefield is limited and further trials are required to confidently conclude efficacy. CPNBs are just one component within military medicine of a rapidly evolving polymodal system of pain management. Common combat wounds, namely traumatic amputations, are compatible with this technique, however current evidence concerning their battlefield use is limited. Extensive UK military trials are ongoing and the results of which are expected to clarify questions regarding complication rate and efficacy.

Slipping a second 3 mm pin into the same clamp hole as the first allows the 5 mm clamp to bite securely on a 3 mm pin. This enables construction of an external fixator frame utilising 3 mm and 5 mm pins, as required to span the elbow, wrist and ankle. This extends the capabilities of the 5 mm clamp and reduces the need for extra materiel such as sets containing damps to connect 3 mm pins to standard size rods.","905":"","906":"Doctors have long since assisted the Command on operations and in providing day to day bespoke medical care to the UK Armed Forces. Doctors and the Command work along different models that confer different obligations and priorities. For doctors the patient and their wellbeing is of primary importance and for the Command, the Unit as a whole with its military goals are of primary concern. Most of the time these two models work in harmony. However occasionally disagreement can arise. This article examines the models guiding their respective practice in order to understand the underpinnings of these disagreements, and offers some discussion of the issues, particularly as they pertain to the deployed environment. Finally, some recommendations are made to equip doctors and the Command to contain any disagreements.","907":"There are various formal peer review schemes to assess the quality of primary care practices and several special approval and re-approval programmes exist for General Practitioner (GP) trainers and primary care training practices. The Defence Postgraduate Medical Deanery (DPMD) has its own General Practice Education Committee (GPEC) approval and re-approval programme. Part of this programme is related to the New Membership of the Royal College of Practitioners (nMRCGP). There is limited published information related to GP trainer exchanges as a means of peer review and as such as preparation for GPEC in the British Forces. This paper provides a review of a GP trainer exchange involving a visit of a GP trainer from British Forces Germany (BFG) to the practices of Dhekelia and Ay Nik on Cyprus in January 2010. It concludes that a GP trainer exchange is cost neutral and may be a valuable experience for both the host and visiting GP trainer, the local GP trainers' group, the practice teams and above all, for the GP trainee.","908":"","909":"Post-deployment mental health problems are a source of potential concern for health professionals and politicians in military forces in the world; the UK Armed Forces are no exception.

The study recommended a unitary command structure, with more central control based upon a model of a main headquarters and seven regions. The change has been largely successful and has been subject to external scrutiny. Areas still to be developed include improving information management and benchmarking standards against the NHS, improvements in practice management, plus developments in occupational health and the nursing cadres. The forthcoming Strategic Defence and Security Review and other ongoing studies are likely to have a profound influence on how the current Army Primary Health Care Service develops.","913":"","914":"Cardiac disease remains a significant threat to both local and deployed military populations.

Over 90% of the 500,000 annual new cases occur in only five countries: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sudan and North-Eastern Brazil, but the disease remains endemic in Southern Europe. We report a case of visceral leishmaniasis in an immunocompetent serviceman after a seven-day stay in the Marseilles region of South-Eastern France. This case is intended to alert clinicians to the possibility of visceral leishmaniasis in patients who develop a febrile illness after returning from travel in Southern European countries.","916":"As the pressure mounts to supply more ground forces in Afghanistan, the Defence Medical Services (DMS) are directly supporting surge activity through ensuring the provision of deployable personnel. Delivery of this goal requires a change in the practice, focus and resources of the DMS. Identification, treatment and rehabilitation of injured service personnel is a priority in improving the pool of personnel available for deployment on Operations. This paper details the drivers, process and potential benefits of aligning Multi-Disciplinary Injury Assessment Clinic's activity with a unit's formation readiness cycle, to more appropriately and proactively manage injured service personnel to improve both the quality and quantity of Force Generation.","917":"Infectious diseases affecting British troops are mostly due to gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, but these are usually minor in severity, easy to manage and short in duration. To assess the importance of infections that are more severe, difficult to manage or longer in duration, it is necessary to look at military cases that are evacuated or otherwise referred to the UK Role 4 (definitive care) medical facility for infectious diseases. Case notes from military infectious disease patients seen at Birmingham Heartlands Hospital in 2005-2009 were reviewed to extract data on demographics, origin of infection, diagnostic categories, exact diagnoses, type and duration of care, time off duty, quality of care and costs incurred. Over a 4-year period, 138 cases were referred, 131 (95%) were male and 98 (71%) were from the Army. The origin of infection was Afghanistan in 52 (38%) and Belize in 19 (14%). From 131 patients (95%) that attended, 59 (45%) had dermatological illnesses and 38 (29%) had undifferentiated febrile illnesses. Diagnoses included 35 (27%) with cutaneous leishmaniasis and 21 (16%) with \"Helmand Fever\" due to sandfly fever, acute Q fever or rickettsial infection. For 51 in-patients, the median (range) length of stay was 3 (1-17) days and time off duty was 20 (5-127) days. For 80 out-patients, the median (range) number of attendances was 1 (1-23) and time off duty was 22 (1-228) days. All cases were seen promptly (within 7 days for in-patients and 28 days for out-patients), but only 59 (45%) had appropriate letters sent to the referring medical officer and none had F Med 85 notifications of infectious disease submitted. Aeromedical evacuation costs could not be calculated, but UK hospital care cost approximately pound 78 000 per year. Dermatological infections and undifferentiated febrile illnesses that require management at a UK Role 4 facility are important causes of disease non-battle injury. Prospective collection of this data in the future will be a valuable asset. ","918":"To determine the number of medical emergency response team (MERT) patients undergoing advanced airway management in the peri-evacuation phase and to determine the indications for airway interventions undertaken in flight. This was a retrospective study. Data was collected from patient report and mission debrief forms completed after each MERT mission during Operation HERRICK 10 (April-October 2009). All patients that received advanced airway interventions before or during evacuation were identified. MERTs were involved in the primary transfer of 534 patients during the period studied, 56 (10.5%) underwent advanced airway management, of which 31 (5.8% of total) were initiated by the MERT in the peri-evacuation phase. Twenty five cases (4.7%) underwent advanced airway management by other pre-hospital providers prior to MERT arrival. Of the 31 advanced airway interventions undertaken in-flight, cardiac arrest was the primary indication in only nine cases. The figure of 56 patients requiring advanced airway management is at the higher end of the range expected from the study of historical military data. This may reflect the doctrine of \"intelligent tasking\", that is sending this physician-led team to the most seriously injured casualties. ","919":"The recent 90 year anniversary of the end of the First World War is an opportune time to reconsider the important role of the Royal Army Medical Corps in this conflict. One area which has been neglected is the role of the Royal Army Medical Corps in responding to infectious diseases and to understand this properly it is important to consider the development of bacteriology, sanitation science and allied research in the British Army up to the Great War. The context of the home front is also central, with the British population from 1880-1914 increasingly benefiting from improved public sanitation and the new science of bacteriology. Historians acknowledge that the British campaign in the Crimea in the 1850s was pursued with inadequate medical provision and as a result, the Army suffered severely from infectious diseases. Limited changes were introduced after the Crimean War, such as the establishment of the Army Medical School, with its high quality instruction in military hygiene and later bacteriology. Army medics also led the way in various branches of scientific research, through research in the colonies. As compared with the continental powers, however, the application of bacteriology and sanitation to field craft in the British Army was delayed. It took the experiences of the South African and Russo-Japanese Wars for the importance of these sciences to be recognised by the Army as a whole. These subjects began to form part of the education of army Medical Officers, but training was basic and few trainees had specialised in bacteriology by 1914. In spite of these limitations, the Royal Army Medical Corps responded well to the demands placed upon it by World War One, recruiting civilian bacteriologists to its ranks, developing technological innovations such as mobile bacteriological laboratories for them to work in, forming a sanitation service and fostering medical research.","920":"Trauma is a leading cause of death in children. Life support courses have been developed to reduce the mortality and morbidity of children suffering trauma; differences in anatomy and physiology may produce different injury patterns to adults when children are exposed to trauma, challenging the care providers. A retrospective analysis of all paediatric patients transported by the helicopter-borne MERT between 01 May 2006 and 31 December 2007 in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. 78 children were brought in over the study period by the MERT team representing 7.3% of MERT casualties and 2.2% of the total seen in the Emergency Department. Breakdown by demographics, triage category, mechanism of injury, and treatment is given. A significant number of paediatric patients are treated by the deployed pre-hospital team. All military pre-hospital care providers should gain training and experience in the care of the seriously injured child prior to deployment. ","921":"Thoracic wounding has been a relatively common presentation of military wounds throughout modern conflict. When civilian casualties are included the incidence has remained constant at around 10%, although the frequency and severity of wounds to combatants has been altered by modern body armour. Whilst thoracic injury has a high initial mortality on the battlefield, those surviving to reach hospital frequently have injuries that only require simple management. In addition to penetrating ballistic injury, blunt chest trauma frequently occurs on operations as a result of road traffic collisions or tertiary blast injury. The physiological impact of thoracic wounds, however, is often great and survivors often require intensive care management and, where available, complex strategies to ensure oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal. This review examines the incidence and patterns of thoracic trauma and looks at therapeutic options for managing these complex cases.","922":"Traumatic diaphragmatic injury is a not uncommon accompaniment to blunt or penetrating trauma to the abdomen or thorax; it may present acutely with haemodynamic and respiratory compromise and be associated with significant injury to other organs or may not be diagnosed at the initial trauma at all and present later as a diaphragmatic hernia.

During the period 05 August 2006 to 21 December 2006, 288 operations were performed on 259 patients and comprised 393 individually quantifiable procedures. 98% of these operations were to treat acute injuries. Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons were involved in 24% of operations. 63% of procedures done at these operations involved upper or lower limbs, 19% the head and neck and 18% involved the torso. An analysis of emergency admissions in November 2006 showed that most occurred between 18.00 and midnight. Although theatre timetabling made provision for this, whenever possible, elective surgery was scheduled for the following morning when emergency injury admissions were at their lowest.","927":"Severe facial wounds frequently result from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) as the face is still vulnerable despite advances in personal protection of soldiers. In contrast to the poor outcomes with civilian maxillofacial trauma management methods initially employed by the US Army for maxillofacial wounds from IEDs, advances in wound management methods for such injuries by the US Army have resulted in significant improvements in appearance and function.

The aim of this paper is to describe the surgical techniques used in the modern management of devastating ocular trauma including selected case examples managed by British military maxillofacial surgeons deployed to Afghanistan.","932":"","933":"Intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome are increasingly recognised as causes of serious morbidity and mortality in critically injured patients, particularly those with significant burns. Identification of at risk patients, routine monitoring of intra-abdominal pressures and appropriate, early treatment may reduce the incidence and complication rate of abdominal compartment syndrome and so improve outcomes in critically injured personnel. We present the case of an American Marine injured in an explosion while on patrol in Afghanistan, who despite the absence of significant intraabdominal injury, went on to develop abdominal compartment syndrome and required decompressive laparotomy.","934":"Colonoscopy is a generally safe test whose use is rapidly increasing; complications are unusual and the accepted rate of perforation after diagnostic colonoscopy is between 1 in 800-1500 cases.

A brief questionnaire was distributed to Departments of Community Mental Health to be disseminated to their mental health clients to measure their responses. 282 responses from mental health clients were collected over a 30 day period regarding the impact that military uniform makes to the therapeutic relationship with the clinician. 63% (n = 178) regarded uniform as negatively influencing their relationship with the clinician, 37% (n = 104) responded that it did not. 39% (n = 111) believed rank to be a barrier, whereas 61% (n = 171) did not believe it affected the relationship. The majority of military mental health clients regard the wearing of uniform as negative to the therapeutic relationship and a significant minority have similar feelings about rank. Military mental health practitioners should consider the impact of these results on the therapeutic relationship with military patients. ","936":"To critically evaluate the predisposing factors and symptomatology that resulted in serving officers and soldiers requiring a Mental Health (MH) assessment. 317 regular Army personnel who required a formal MH assessment completed a survey that detailed the predisposing factors and symptoms leading to the referral. SPSSv10 was used for data management and analysis of the data by descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Three quarter presented with at least two predisposing factors, the commonest being family issues (42%), relationship problems (40%) and general military stress (39%). Up to half of young male Soldiers required a MH assessment as a result of wanting to leave the Army, and were positively associated with self harming ideology. Female soldiers are significantly over represented. No-one reported feeling isolated. The majority of personnel accessing the Army MH Services present with multi-factorial problems and symptoms that should result in colleagues being aware of their distress, and every effort must be made to support these soldiers within unit lines. That no one reported feeling isolated, challenges the perception that soldiers with MH problems are stigmatised. In those young male soldiers who wish to leave the Army there are indicators that significant periods of notice to leave can have a negative impact on MH. It is unclear why females are more likely to require support. If the emerging themes noted in this study are addressed, and the lessons learnt encapsulated within a predictive theoretical model, then the result could be an improvement in operational capability through the early return of Army personnel and Officers to full duty. ","937":"Simulation in Healthcare is gaining popularity worldwide. Recently it has been decided that there should be a simulation component to pre-deployment training for doctors destined for Role 1. Little is known about the challenges, workload, case mix and non-technical issues that face medical personnel working out of a Forward Operating Base. To examine this further, a workshop was convened with subject matter experts and simulation trainers. Common themes identified were concerning pre-deployment issues, team working, evaluation prior to transfer, equipment, communication and specific clinical issues. Six scenarios were developed over the course of the day that included desired learning objectives in form of technical and nontechnical skills. There are many aspects of team resource management or non-technical skills already researched that can be transferred directly into a Role 1 healthcare setting. Simulation offers the chance to provide training in a safe and controlled environment and can potentially ensure specific defined learning outcomes are achieved.

Detail of whether the issues were raised for information only, or required action to be taken was recorded, as was the outcome of this action. A wide range of clinical and non-clinical issues (J1-J8), were identified. 23% (47) of the 207 issues were raised for information only. 77% (160) issues required action to be taken. 109 were dosed within 3 weeks. 23 took more than 3 weeks to close. Eight weeks after the study period 28 issues were still being actively resolved. 85% of JTCCC teleconferences had full participation from both theatres. Technical difficulties and\/or the treatment of casualties prevented the participation of one or both theatres on 9 occasions. JTCCC supports deployed clinicians and enables rapid resolution of issues affecting combat casualty care. It is limited by its focus on UK casualties only.

Presentation can be vague and highly variable but usually includes back pain and fever. Whilst predisposing factors, such as trauma and diabetes can often be identified a pathogenic organism may not be identified in up to a half of all cases leading to significant delay in both accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. Precise spinal imaging is essential and includes plain X-ray, CT and preferably MRI. The treatment of PSI can be conservative (including antibiotics); however, spinal surgery may be required for the complications in up to 50% of cases, with varying degrees of success. We present a challenging case of PSI encountered in a locally-employed 42-year-old Bangladeshi civilian working in Iraq. Despite obvious resource limitations available within a Role 2 Field Hospital, clinical suspicion coupled with repeat spinal CT was pivotal in obtaining the diagnosis. The patient was repatriated to Bangladesh for MRI and definitive surgical treatment.","949":"We describe the case of a 32-year-old soldier who presented with acute organic psychosis during an operational tour to Iraq.

The Academic Department of Military Emergency Medicine at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham maintains an electronic database with derails on all attendances to the emergency departments deployed on Operations. This Operational Emergency Department Attendance Register (OpEDAR) was searched for all patients with medical classification of Ophthalmology over a 52 month period between 1 March 2003 and 30 June 2007. During this period 30,195 patients were seen in the ED on Operation Telic and are available for analysis. Patients with ophthalmic complaints account for 5.3% of all presentations to the ED and rank as the 7th most common reason for attendance. This paper identifies patterns of injury to enable future planning of equipment tables and identifies the need for prevention of injury wherever possible.

This study aimed to establish the point prevalence of dietary and exercise supplement usage in British soldiers on Op TELIC during January 2009. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of British military personnel located at the Contingency Operating Base (COB), in Basra, was performed during the sixth week of Op TELIC 13. From 1544 questionnaires (target population) issued, a total of 1017 (65.9%) completed questionnaires were evaluated. The mean population age was 29.5 years (range 18-58) of which 87.4% were male. 417\/1017 persons (41.0%) admitted to a history of supplement use of which 32.0% were current users and 9.4% were previous users. Of these current users, 66.0% started taking them on their current deployment. The most commonly taken supplements were whey protein (18.8%), amino acids (17.9%), and creatine (13.2%). There were 14 persons (1.4%) who admitted to current use of anabolic steroids. The most-frequently given reasons for taking supplements were either to 'increase muscle bulk' (40.4%) or to aid training and recovery (20.8%). This is the first study to investigate the use of exogenous nutritional supplements within the British Military and has identified their widespread use during operational deployment. The use of anabolic steroids is particularly worrying, given both their illegality and their well-recognised and deleterious health effects. There is a need for greater awareness and education regarding potential benefits and dangers of supplement use in order to maximise any potential benefits and minimise clinical risk. ","952":"There was a significant risk of malaria in the area to which military personnel were deployed during the Iraq War. In this paper we investigated attitudes towards anti malarial tablets, health and the reporting of military hazards during deployment. A cross sectional study of military personnel deployed to Iraq between 2003 and 2006 was performed. A mixed methods model of analysis, with quantitative analysis of reported concerns regarding anti-malarial tablets, health and environmental exposures was undertaken with a qualitative analysis of responses to a free text question inviting comments on concerns regarding the prophylaxis. Individuals who reported concerns were more likely to report multiple physical symptoms, common mental health problems, side effects to NAPS tablets and anthrax vaccination and exposures during deployment to military hazards (odds ratios: 1.17-3.10). The majority did not voice concerns regarding malarial prophylaxis, in those that did however, strong themes of unease regarding safety and trust emerged. We found evidence of a link between reporting concerns about anti malarial tablets and reporting worse health and increased exposure to military hazards. We hypothesise that this relationship is mediated by negative affect. ","953":"The abdominal viscera are among the most vulnerable organs of the body to penetrating trauma. Proper management of such trauma in war victims at the first-line hospital where these victims are first seen is of paramount importance. We reviewed medical records of war victims suffering small bowel and colorectal injuries treated at first, second and third-line hospitals during the Iraq-Iran War (1980-88) to assess surgical outcomes. The medical records of 496 Iranian war victims suffering penetrating gastrointestinal (GI) injuries treated at first, second and third-line (tertiary) hospitals, a total of 19 centres, were reviewed. Laparotomy had been performed at the 1st line hospitals for all patients who had an acute abdomen, whose wounds violated the peritoneum or whose abdominal radiographs showed air or shrapnel in the abdominal cavity. Stable patients were transferred from first-line to second-line or from second line to tertiary hospitals postoperatively. The treatments, complications and patient outcomes were documented and analyzed. There were 496 patients; 145, 220 and 131 victims underwent laparotomy for GI injuries at first, second and third-line hospitals respectively. The small intestine and colon respectively were the most prevalent abdominal organs damaged. Those first treated for GI injuries at front-line hospitals (145 victims) had more serious conditions and could not be transferred prior to surgery and presented a higher prevalence of complications and mortality. Overall mortality from GI surgery was 3.6% (18 patients). Eleven patients (7.5%) whose first GI operation was performed at frontline hospitals and 7 patients (3.2%) who underwent their first surgical operation at second-line hospitals died. The most common reason for these deaths was complications relating to the gastrointestinal operation such as anastomotic leak. Six missed injuries were seen at the frontline and one at second line hospitals. There were no deaths at the 3rd line hospitals. Penetrating abdominal injuries were common in Iranian victims of war often causing multiple organ injuries. The colon and small intestine were the more commonly injured organs and carried the most postoperative complications. Mortality at 1st line hospitals was more than double that of 2nd line hospitals; the complication rate was also greater as was the number of missed injuries. Adherence to the standard surgical protocols, prompt evaluation, proper triage and management are factors which may lower patient morbidity and complications. ","954":"This article describes the non-operative management of five patients with ballistic abdominal solid organ injuries in a role 2E medical treatment facility. The selective non-operative management of ballistic abdominal solid organ injury is an accepted management strategy in high-volume civilian trauma centres, and appears to be equally safe and effective in the deployed military setting.","955":"Rapid developments of capability seen in the contemporary operating environment are a constant during any period of conflict. The Second World War is littered with numerous examples of adapting systems developed following the First World War and making them more suitable for a more mobile, modern form of warfare. The East African campaign during 1941 saw a number of developments to an accepted field medical system. Established as a neat, linear structure from point of wounding through to hospital care, it was adapted to support a battle waged in a complex environment. The Battle of Keren, in Eritrea, was the decisive battle of the East African campaign, and is a remarkable example of rapidly exploiting success, with Commonwealth forces taking full advantage of Italian reluctance to become decisively engaged. To maximize success, support to the fighting echelon had to be, at least, as agile and able to adapt to circumstances presented resulting in the first significant land success of the war. It provided a vehicle for the Army Medical Services and Indian Army Medical Corps to develop a system of treatment and evacuation in an extremely challenging situation, a system that continues to have relevance today.","956":"Penetrating and blunt force mechanisms frequently result in thoracic trauma. Thoracic injuries cover the spectrum from trivial to lethal, and more than half are associated with head, abdomen or extremity trauma. Fortunately over eighty percent of injuries can be managed non-operatively utilizing tube thoracostomy, appropriate analgesia and aggressive respiratory therapy. Patients requiring emergency thoracotomy are either in shock or have life threatening injuries and, as expected, have significant mortality and morbidity. Injury to the thorax directly accounts for approximately 25% of trauma related mortality and is a contributing factor in another 25%. Early mortality results from haemorrhage, catastrophic injury or associated head or abdominal trauma. Not unexpectedly, late deaths are related to sepsis and organ failure. Blunt injury to the thorax most commonly results from motor vehicle collisions, with motorcycle accidents, pedestrians struck and falls next in frequency. Stab wound and gunshot wounds comprise the vast majority of penetrating injuries. In general the mortality from penetrating injury is higher and related to vascular injury and shock. Mortality from blunt trauma often results from abdominal and, especially, head injury. Rapid assessment and interventions, such as tube thoracostomy and airway control, can be life saving. The patient's haemodynamic status drives early treatment, often necessitating emergency surgery. Detailed imaging studies are reserved for haemodynamically stable patients. The evaluation and treatment of specific thoracic injuries will be discussed, as well as some general principles in treating thoracic trauma.","957":"","958":"The Institute of Surgical Research is the U.S. Army's lead research laboratory for improving the care of combat casualties. The Institute follows a rigorous process for analyzing patterns of injury and the burden of disease to determine where research can be conducted in order to positively impact care. These analyses led the ISR to focus research on: preventing death from bleeding; developing improved pain control techniques; developing improved vital signs analysis techniques; improving the treatment of extremity injuries; preventing burn injuries on the battlefield; and improving critical care for combat casualties. This process has resulted in numerous improvements in care on the battlefield. Highlights include development, fielding, and efficiency testing of tourniquets and improved dressings for bleeding control. Significant progress has also been made in the resuscitation of combat casualties using blood products instead of crystalloid or colloid solutions. Improvements in pain control include assessments of the effect of perioperative anaesthetics on the development of post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]. Novelvital signs analyses have been successful in identifying promising techniques which may improve the medic's ability to accurately triage patients. Current research in extremity injuries has focused on optimizing the use of negative pressure wound therapy for contaminated wounds. Burn research has focused on improving personnel protective equipment and implementing continuous renal replacement therapy. This research program is soldier focused and addresses care from self aid and buddy aid through all echelons of care. Many of these advances have been adopted in civilian medical centres as well, benefiting not only the military trauma patient, but also the civilian trauma patient.","959":"","960":"","961":"Infection is an important consideration in war wounds. Improvements in survival and use of increasingly broad-spectrum antibiotics have led to new challenges with novel pathogens and conventional pathogens with multiple drug resistance patterns.. learnt in conflicts centuries ago. The cornerstone remains early, appropriate and repeated surgery. Antimicrobial agents contribute a very minor part to overall patient outcome, but prudent use of antibiotics and good infection control is essential to prevent establishment and spread of hospital-acquired infections. Research in progress will provide an evidence base for antibiotic and infection control policies and baseline data for research into novel wound management strategies.","962":"","963":"","964":"","965":"Haemodynamically unstable patients with mechanically unstable pelvic ring injuries continue to present a challenge to all personnel involved. Road traffic accidents remain a significant cause of soldier morbidity and mortality in peacetime and in war. These pelvic ring disruptions are markers of high-energy transfer injuries and are associated with fatal exsanguinating haemorrhage. Identifying the ring injury and the source of bleeding remains a complex challenge. Early control of instability, both haemodynamic and mechanical is likely to produce the best results. Dealing with these issues in the military environment adds additional stress to this volatile situation. Multidisciplinary practice guidelines have been shown to reduce mortality and should be adopted by all establishments treating these causalities. A well-rehearsed &lt;C&gt;ABC approach with a proactive approach to dot protection and promotion is ideal.","966":"","967":"","968":"There has been a significant increase in the incidence of head, face and neck (HFN) injuries in the 21st century in comparison to that experienced in the previous century. In the majority of HFN injuries the primary cause of death is secondary to airway compromise and with the exception of severe neck wounds haemorrhage is an unusual cause of death. Emergency cricothyroidotomy and semi- elective tracheostomy are skills that should be taught to deploying surgeons. There are now significantly increased numbers of potentially salvageable HFN injuries resulting from new and effective armour that protects the torso and abdomen. Equivalent armour to protect the neck and face is not yet effective and requires development. We describe the current epidemiology and management of battlefield head, face and neck trauma.","969":"The improvised explosive device (IED), in all its forms, has become the most significant threat to troops operating in Afghanistan and Iraq. These devices range from rudimentary home made explosives to sophisticated weapon systems containing high-grade explosives. Within this broad definition they may be classified as roadside explosives and blast mines, explosive formed pojectile (EFP) devices and suicide bombings. Each of these groups causeinjury through a number of different mechanisms and can result in vastly different injury profiles. The \"Global War on Terror\" has meant that incidents which were previously exclusively seen in conflict areas, can occur anywhere, and clinicians who are involved in emergency trauma care may be required to manage casualties from similar terrorist attacks. An understanding of the types of devices and their pathophysiological effects is necessary to allow proper planning of mass casualty events and to allow appropriate management of the complex poly-trauma casualties they invariably cause. The aim of this review article is to firstly describe the physics and injury profile from these different devices and secondly to present the current clinical evidence that underpins their medical management.","970":"Since World War II, more vehicles have been lost to land mines than all other threats combined. Anti-vehicular (AV) mines are capable of disabling a heavy vehicle, or completely destroying a lighter vehicle. The most common form of AV mine is the blast mine, which uses a large amount of explosive to directly damage the target. In a conventional military setting, landmines are used as a defensive force-multiplier and to restrict the movements of the opposing force. They are relatively cheap to purchase and easy to acquire, hence landmines are also potent weapons in the insurgents' armamentarium. The stand-offnature of its design has allowed insurgents to cause significant injuries to security forces in current conflicts with little personal risk. As a result, AV mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have become the most common cause of death and injury to Coalition and local security forces operating in Iraq and Afghanistan. Detonation of an AV mine causes an explosive, exothermic reaction which results in the formation of a shockwave followed by a rapid expansion of gases. The shockwave is mainly reflected by the soillair interface and fractures the soil cap overthe mine. The detonation products then vent through the voids in the soil, resulting in a hollow inverse cone which consists of the detonation gases surrounded by the soil ejecta. It is the combination of the detonation products and soil ejecta that interact with the target vehicle and cause injury to the vehicle occupants. A number of different strategies are required to mitigate the blast effects of an explosion. Primary blast effects can be reduced by increasing the standoff distance between the seat of the explosion and the crew compartment. Enhancement of armour on the base of the vehicle, as well as improvements in personal protection can prevent penetration of fragments. Mitigating tertiary effects can be achieved by altering the vehicle geometry and structure, increasing vehicle mass, as well as developing new strategies to reduce the transfer of the impulse through the vehicle to the occupants. Protection from thermal injury can be provided by incorporating fire resistant materials into the vehicle and in personal clothing. The challenge for the vehicle designer is the incorporation of these protective measures within an operationally effective platform.","971":"There are no published studies directly addressing the issue of what is an acceptable timeline from point of wounding to surgical intervention within the military context. The proximal threshold has previously been determined by personal opinion, tactical, logistic and practical imperatives rather than by clinical demands. The aim of this paper is to review all relevant military and civilian studies where timelines have been quoted and to reach a number of unambiguous consensus statements to state the perceived ideal upper limits from point of wounding to holistic and realistic surgical care in modern war. An injured casualty should be transferred to an appropriate surgeon in an appropriate facility in as short a time from wounding as practical. It is clear that the best trauma surgery is performed in large, well resourced, well-supplied, air-conditioned hospitals. Current advances aimed to stretch timelines from wounding to surgical intervention are exciting and hold potential but remain scientifically unproven and are currently without any firm evidence base. Further critical research is therefore necessary. The effect of pre-hospital haemostatic resuscitation, provided by the enhanced Medical Emergency Response Team (MERTe) on patient outcome and effective timelines is currently unknown and unproven: it does have intuitive medical merit. There is also a very significant moral and morale component. MERTe serves two main functions; reduction in time from point of wounding to advanced \/ haemostatic resuscitation and provision of in-flight diagnostics. Continuation of in-flight resuscitation then allows physician-led decision making on critically unstable casualties. This allows either an expedited straight move from the HLS direct to the operating theatre or direct transfer to a regional neurosurgical centre. To prevent avoidable death,our unequivocal conclusion is that there must be an upper limit of 2 hours from wounding to surgical intervention (surgical haemorrhage control) for all casualties.","972":"The nature of conflict is evolving, with current warfare being associated with an initial \"shock and awe\" phase followed by protracted periods ofcounter-insurgency and peace support missions. As conflict has changed, so have the munitions deployed and the resulting patterns of injury. Improvised Explosive Devices have become the preferred weapon of the insurgent and the resultant explosive and fragmentation injuries are the hallmark of modern military wounding. These injuries pose a significant challenge to deployed medical forces, requiring a well-defined, seamless approach from injury to rehabilitation. Traditionally, military medical services demonstrate a poor 'institutional memory' in the maintenance of combat surgical skills. Numerous publications detail the re-learning of key tenets of war surgery by generations of surgeons deploying onto the field of battle. While the maintenance of military surgical capability in trained surgeons may be addressed through combat surgical courses, concern exists as to the generic competency of those currently in training and their ability to deal with the burden of injury associated with modern conflict. The training of junior doctors in the United Kingdom and further afield is in a state of flux. New curriculum development, streamlined and run-through training programmes have combined with the legal requirements of the European Working Time Directive to produce a training landscape almost unrecognisable with that of previous years. This article investigates the development of current military wounding patterns and modern surgical training programmes. It describes processes already in place to address the unique training needs of military surgeons and proposes a framework for enabling appropriate training opportunities in the future.","973":"","974":"","975":"","976":"","977":"","978":"","979":"The advent of Modernising Medical Careers has meant that many more junior doctors are coming into contact with general surgical patients either as part of Foundation Year 2 or Core Training rotation or during the course of cross covering other specialities due to the hours constraints of the European Working Time Directive. These scenarios are all common general surgical cases that such a junior doctor may be expected to manage.","980":"Haemorrhagic shock from traumatic injuries is now often treated using a damage control resuscitation strategy that transfuses packed red blood cells, plasma and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio, early use of activated recombinant factor VII and transfusion of fresh whole blood. These therapies are aimed at promoting thrombosis in injured vessels. Such patients are at high risk for thrombotic complications and thromboprophylaxis is necessary, but frequently impossible to use in the early phase of care. We describe the case of an Afghan civilian worker who suffered a vertical shear pelvic fracture with massive bleeding in a pedestrian\/truck collision that was treated with a damage control resuscitation strategy, and who later suffered a severe pulmonary embolus. The potential use of a temporary inferior vena cava [IVC] filters is discussed. Care providers and policy makers must recognize that the increased use of prothrombotic strategies of resuscitation will likely increase the incidence of thrombotic complications in the high risk population of severely injured patients in combat support hospitals. Monitoring the incidence of these complications and development of strategies for prevention and treatment are required to avoid undermining the positive outcomes of damage control resuscitation. These strategies could include supplying combat support hospitals with the equipment and training necessary for placement of temporary IVC filters under fluoroscopic guidance. ","981":"Musculoskeletal infections caused by Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) secreting Stapylococcus aureus in children and adolescents have previously been reported. We report the first adult case in a 26 year-old British Army soldier who presented with a S. aureus septic arthritis. He was treated by surgical washout and antibiotics and discharged but was readmitted five months later with an ipsilateral femoral osteomyelitis requiring debridement. The causative S. aureus grown from tissue biopsy taken at time of surgery was found to encode the PVL gene. Whilst there is evidence that soldiers in Iraq have a greater rate of S. aureus colonisation on their skin, the proportion that encode the PVL gene is similar to that observed in the UK. Soldiers are however, subject to the known risk factors that increase vulnerability to PVL secreting S. aureus infection. Military clinicians need to be aware of PVL secreting S. aureus and have a low threshold for requesting specific testing in aggressive musculoskeletal S. aureus infections.","982":"To examine the context of suicidal behaviour among soldiers in the United Kingdom and identify factors that could reduce the risk of such behaviour. A series of in-depth interviews with service providers involved in treating soldiers following deliberate self harm. Their responses were compared with those of a small sub-sample of soldiers who presented to Army medical services following self harm. We interviewed 21 service providers with a range of experience and professional backgrounds and 10 soldiers. Service providers told us that the rarity of suicide among soldiers together with lower levels of mental illness amongst those who end their lives made suicide prevention in the Army a difficult task. However they highlighted concerns about recruitment and retention of young soldiers, and stated that stigmatisation of mental illness in the Army sometimes prevented those with suicidal ideation seeking help. They also highlighted the role of alcohol use in precipitating self-harm. Soldiers who had self-harmed told us that they struggled to balance the demands of work and family life and described harming themselves impulsively often while intoxicated with alcohol. Soldiers look to sources of support outside the Army, and see commanding officers, rather than healthcare professionals, as helping resolve their problems. Neither service providers nor soldiers mentioned helplines and other 'independent' sources of confidential advice and support which are available to soldiers serving with the British Army. Our findings highlight problems associated with efforts to reduce suicide among soldiers but suggest that these should focus continuing to try to reduce stigmatisation of mental distress and specifically on the role of commanding officers. Greater efforts should also be made to publicise existing sources of help and reduce levels of alcohol misuse. ","983":"It has been stated that the application of a pre-hospital tourniquet could prevent 7% of combat deaths, however their widespread use has been questioned due to the potential risk from prolonged ischaemia. We reviewed members of the UK Armed Forces who sustained severe limb-threatening injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan, and performed a matched cohort study based on the presence or absence of pre-hospital tourniquet application. When a pre-hospital tourniquet had been applied, 19\/22 patients had a least one complication compared to 15\/22 where no tourniquet had been applied [p = 0.13]. There were 10 limbs with at least one major complication in the pre-hospital tourniquet group but only four in the group with no tourniquet [p = 0.045]. The significant difference in the incidence of major complications is a concern, particularly as the difference was mainly due to a deep infection rate of 32% vs. 4.5%. Although a number of variables could have influenced these small groups, such as choice of fracture fixation implant and method and timing of wound closure, the use of a matched cohort study design with a statistical significance level of p &lt; 0.05, suggests the use of a pre-hospital tourniquet as a factor. Although the use of pre-hospital tourniquets cannot be decried as a result of this study, the need to continually prospectively review their use to determine their risk\/benefit ratio remains.","984":"","985":"Penetrating limb injuries are common during conflict, and in many there will be an associated fracture. Treatment of ballistic femoral fractures would usually be with by intramedullary nail; however, within the resource-constrained environment during conflict this is rarely possible. This report illustrates what can be achieved at a Role 2 facility to provide skeletal traction with the equipment and skills available. We discuss the history of skeletal traction and its use in ballistic femoral fractures, and believe that skeletal traction is still a valuable technique that we shouldn't ignore. Military surgeons should be able to use skeletal traction to manage ballistic femoral fractures in the spartan environment of a deployed forward hospital.","986":"Chronic instability of the acromiocavicular joint is relatively common and normally occurs following a fall onto the point of the shoulder. Reconstruction of the joint [Weaver-Dunn procedure] using the coracoacromial ligament is often required in service personnel, and a number of methods to augment this repair have been used. Many of these operative methods require a second operation to remove the metalwork, and in addition can be associated with a failure rate of up to 30%. The 'Surgilig' was originally designed for use in the revision of failed Weaver-Dunn procedures. However this study evaluates its use in the primary operation, reinforcing the autologous graft, in an attempt to reduce the failurerate. We prospectively followed up the Modified Weaver Dunn procedures using Surgilig. The post-operative x-rays were reviewed at six weeks, three months and then six months to assess the radiological success of the procedure. Our patients were discharged at six months. We have performed this procedure in 11 patients. One of the 11 patients was excluded from the study as the Surgilig graft was used in addition to a hook plate. The remaining ten patients have all reached the six-month post-operative time with no incidence of radiological failure of the graft. After six months they were discharged from clinic follow-up asthe coracoacromial graft had sufficient strength to no longer rely on the augment for mechanical stability of the joint. All 10 patients had a good clinical and radiological result. One patient even had inadvertent stress\/ weight-bearing x-rays taken at six weeks, with no discernable detrimental effect to outcome. Although a small study, these initial results for primary fixation of acromioclavicular joint disruption with Surgilig are extremely encouraging. The results suggest that Surgilig should continue to be used in its current role. As patient numbers increase, a follow-up study to evaluate these preliminary findings should be conducted. ","987":"It is understood that penetrating cardiac trauma is a highly lethal injury and those surviving to hospital have an overall mortality approaching 80%. Reported mortality figures vary widely and are extremely dependent on mechanism of wounding, cardiac chambers involved and possibly the presence of cardiac tamponade. Despite significant advances in prehospital care, operative techniques, and intensive care management, the mortality has not changed over several decades. This article will review the anatomic regions of concern for a cardiac injury, clinical presentation, and physical findings. The need for an expeditious evaluation and modalities available including, plain radiographs, sub-xiphoid window, and echocardiography will be considered. Options for surgical exposure, technical details of repairing cardiac injuries, and special circumstances such as injury adjacent to a coronary artery and intra-cardiac shunts are discussed in detail. Outcome data and future directions in managing this challenging injury are also examined.","988":"The objectives of this paper are to lay out for wider discussion the potential advantages and disadvantages of active military units providing medical care for the local population through ad hoc clinics (MEDCAPS). The literature on this subject has been reviewed and the personal experience of MEDCAPS by the author and other doctors in Helmand Province 2007\/8 is presented. Although in the published literature, MEDCAPS are almost universally regarded as being good for relations between the military and civilians, the reality on the ground is that they potentially risk the lives of both staff and patients. and may actually contribute little in terms of relieving suffering, or improving relations between military and civilians. The conclusion of this paper is that MEDCAPs at best have a very limited and specific role, but that there will remain a strong desire from staff on the ground to initiate them.","989":"The evacuation of injured patients by air has been going on in one form or another for nearly 100 years. This paper presents some of the history behind Aeromedical Evacuation (AE), the current situation and looks to the future of this vital component in the chain of care from point of wounding to rehabilitation.","990":"A chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) event would require a critical care response from point of exposure to definitive hospital management. Critical care staff should be aware of the potential agents and possible hazard they present to responders. The treatment of CBRN casualties should reflect the conventional incident and casualty management paradigms with additional safety and treatment considerations. Specific agents may require specific airway and respiratory considerations including surrogate ventilation strategies. All critical care staff training should include CBRN awareness and personal protective equipment training. Some staff may benefit from additional training including the recognition and investigation of CBRN casualties as well as their treatment and the equipment available. Critical care departments should also contingency plans for CBRN events including surge capacity.","991":"Our recent experience of paediatric critical care during UK military operations in Afghanistan is discussed alongside consideration of the background to the paediatric critical care service on deployment.

Some desirable future developments will be suggested.","992":"Burn casualties will inevitably occur in the military environment during both conflict and peacetime. The number and type of casualties will vary on the nature of warfare and the type of troops deployed. New preventative measures have decreased the number and severity of burns found on the battlefield however with new weapon systems casualties suffering from thermal injuries are still to be expected in modern warfare. Over the last 4 decades great advances have been made in the treatment of thermal injuries. These advances are reviewed here with emphasis on those that can be accomplished in the Role 3 facility by non-specialist clinicians. It is beyond the scope of this review to produce didactic treatment protocols but it is hoped that in the near future Clinical Guidelines for Operations will soon reflect these. Where advances have occurred that can not be mirrored in the field hospital early evacuation to specialist facilities back at Role 4 facilities should be a priority.","993":"The majority of neurological admissions to military Intensive Care will be for Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). These injuries will be either penetrating from fragmentation or missiles or blunt due to blast or impact. Intensive Care management of TBI is focused on the prevention of secondary brain injury due to insults such as hypoxia, hypotension and low Cerebral Perfusion Pressure. This management is based largely on comprehensive evidence based guidelines produced by the Brain Trauma Foundation. The most significant dilemma faced by UK military intensivists is whether we should be measuring Intracranial Pressure in patient with severe TBI in the deployed setting; and if so what technique should be used.","994":"Patients who require critical care for internal medical conditions make up a small but significant proportion of those requiring evacuation to the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, UK. Infectious, autoimmune, neurologic, cardiac and respiratory conditions are all represented. Conditions which preclude military service and which one would not necessarily expect to see in a military hospital are still prevalent in civilian contractors and host nation personnel. With some 250,000 British military personnel based in the UK and overseas individual presentations of rare conditions occur regularly. This article discusses the ITU management of some key conditions. Whilst trauma makes up the majority of the workload in a field Intensive Care Unit, medical admissions happen not infrequently. This article describes some of the most common medical causes for admission and treatment is considered.","995":"Trauma management involves good prehospital, emergency, surgical, anaesthetic and intensive care decision-making. Optimal outcome depends on keeping abreast of the latest thinking in an ever-changing and increasingly technology-rich environment. The intensive care unit needs to represented as early as possible in the damage-control resuscitation phase. Improved trauma system care has resulted in an increasing number of multiply injured military patients surviving their initial trauma. These patients require intensive care and are at risk from sepsis and multiple organ failure. Attention to detail is important, preservation of organ function, infection control and nutrition to maintain muscle strength allowing normal metabolic function to return. Multiply injured patients often require lengthy periods of mechanical ventilation and a variety of therapeutic interventions may have to be considered during management of the disease process. As we are now seeing more survivors in the military trauma system the focus now needs to be morbidity reduction in order for these survivors to be best prepared for their rehabilitation phase of care.","996":"The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) Guidelines collate the evidence for managing sepsis. Most of the interventions suggested by the SSC guidelines are very relevant to military critical care, including rapid microbiologic investigation, early antibiotic administration and many aspects of early goal directed therapy. Other interventions may be more difficult to provide in remote theatres of operation where resources may be limited. This article discusses the application of the SSC guidelines to deployed military hospitals, with suggestions as to which interventions are feasible, and which may not be indicated.","997":"Scoring systems for both trauma and intensive care patients have been widely used since the 1960's. This article will introduce several scoring systems currently in use and discuss their potential use for military ICU patients.","998":"The limited capacity and resources of a Field Hospital Intensive Care Unit may necessitate the triage or prioritisation of critically ill patients requiring admission. The use of critical care resources by members of the local population in certain Areas of Operation, who can not be discharged or transferred to equivalent care in their local health service, impacts significantly on bed occupancy. Therefore available resources must be distributed efficiently and equitably with decisions guided by the principles of advocacy for the patient. Patients must be admitted only on the concept of potential benefit and reasonable chance of recovery, which would not be available elsewhere. Discriminating between seriously ill patients before admission and decision making regarding withdrawal of care is very difficult. Senior clinicians working regularly in a critical care setting demonstrate a better level of discrimination in assessing outcome of seriously ill patients and are best placed to make decisions regarding admission, continuation and withdrawal of treatment.","999":"","1000":"Intensive Care Medicine (ICM) is no longer the exclusive preserve of anaesthetists as both emergency medicine and general medicine trainees now also train in this increasingly important speciality.

Using previously validated methods, 12 anaesthetised large white pigs were exposed to phosgene (Ct 1978 +\/- 8 mg min m(-3)), established on mechanical ventilation and randomised to treatment with either nebulised salbutamol (2.5 mg per dose) or saline control. Treatments were given 1, 5, 9, 13, 17 and 21 hours following phosgene exposure. The animals were followed to 24 hours following phosgene exposure. Salbutamol treatment had no effect on mortality and had a deleterious effect on arterial oxygenation, shunt fraction and heart rate. There was a reduction in the number of neutrophils from 24.0% +\/- 4.4 to 12.17% +\/- 2.1 (p &lt; 0.05) in bronchoalveolar lavage, with some small decreases in inflammatory mediators in bronchoalveolar lavage but not in plasma. Nebulised salbutamol treatment following phosgene induced acute lung injury does not improve survival, and worsens various physiological parameters including arterial oxygen partial pressure and shunt fraction. Salbutamol treatment reduces neutrophil influx into the lung. Its sole use following phosgene exposure is not recommended.

A thirty member panel was selected primarily from the UK Defence Medical Services but also included contributors from other NATO members and civilian practice. The study was carried out in two rounds and achieved consensus on a range of statements relating to fluid resuscitation. Key recommendations are grouped by category. Statements reaching consensus included the use of adult intraosseous access, limited hypotensive resuscitation and goal directed therapy in trauma patients. Consensus was not achieved with respect to the selection of non-oxygen carrying synthetic colloids. The study provides a broad review of current practice and adds to previous consensus publications on fluid resuscitation.","1004":"The mechanism of injury on the modern battlefield results in a pattern of wounding which is associated with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Nociceptive pain is managed using the WHO Analgesic Ladder but neuropathic pain requires the use of co-analgesic drugs, e.g. antidepressants and anticonvulsants. This study was designed to determine the incidence of neuropathic pain within military casualties with limb injuries. From May to November 2007, 50 casualties were interviewed and assessed using the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Scale (LANSS) over consecutive weeks. During the first week post injury, 30% of casualties had a LANSS pain score &gt; 12, suggesting a neuropathic element to their pain. The early detection (using LANSS) and management of neuropathic pain using robust protocols represent the most effective strategy to address this significant problem.","1005":"Emergency thoracotomy is a dramatic and controversial intervention which may be life saving after major torso trauma.

Alfred Keogh was such a man. He possessed strong principles and the courage to convert a nineteenth-century attitude to the health of an army into the modern vision of Army Health we have today. Keogh was plucked from obscurity in India and plunged into a war, the outcome of which was never certain. The reputation of the Army had been tarnished by a government who had done next to nothing to prepare it for modern war or ameliorate the condition of the common soldier and the Boer War exposed the extent of that neglect to a shocked public. Ultimately the humiliation of the Army prompted radical reforms which converted a metaphorically red-coated army into a fighting force fit for the twentieth-century. During this time Keogh led the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) through a very painful rebirth. His meteoric rise from Major to Lt. General in a little less than five years was matched only by his vision of the future and the dynamic effect he had in effecting change.

In this period 762 casualties of all categories were evacuated to International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) field hospital facilities under the direction of Operations and medical staff of NATO Regional Command (South) (RC-S). The criterion for the audit was the time taken from notification in the RC-S Combined Joint Operations Centre (CJOC) until the helicopter landed (\"Wheels Down\") at the destination field hospital's helicopter landing site. The standard to be met was 90 minutes for all \"9-liner\" Category A (URGENT) and Category B (URGENT - surgical) cases (in hospital within 2 hours of wounding) allowing for time from injury to first notification in the CJOC, and time from landing to transfer to the Emergency Department (30 minutes together) at the designated destination hospital. Those that did not meet this target were assessed in order to review their outcome and to identify means for improving performance. Analysis of evacuation times for all missions each month from May to July revealed that three quarters of A and B category missions met the 90 minute target. No adverse outcome resulted from those which did not meet this target, reasons for which included distance (more than 30 minutes flying time each way), delay in securing a hostile landing site, delay in obtaining sufficient information, incorrect categorization of the casualty's priority, and on one occasion, an overmatch of assets available at that time. No casualties died who were recoverable. Comparison with data from the two previous RC-S rotations (prior to 1 May 07) showed an improvement in mean response time, but little change in median response on the rotation of RC-S staff on 1 May 07. The major change that had occurred on this rotation was to move the medical operations staff into the CJOC. The convergence of median and mean at this time indicates a reduction in \"outliers\", providing evidence that collocation of medical and operations staff improves incident response and should be the \"default setting\" in deployed tactical formation headquarters. Regular audit of MEDEVAC response should be routine for Medical Operations staff, in order to ensure the optimal casualty care pathway from point of wounding to field hospital.

A two stage study using a questionnaire to identify smokers in a British Army infantry battalion of 560 soldiers based in the United Kingdom with either a low or high intention to quit smoking, followed by semi-structured interviews of a purposive sample of 18 respondents. 31.3% of soldiers were current smokers. In addition to recognised barriers to stopping smoking, the interview data revealed structural and cultural barriers, some of which are unique to the Army. Structural barriers included an increased opportunity to smoke in terms of time, place, and cost. Cultural barriers included peer pressure, the smoking norm, and a lack of discouragement from the 'regimental family'. These barriers to stopping smoking often arise from established British Army values and standards. For example, the need for punctuality requires early arrival at destinations, which in turn, provides an increased time opportunity to smoke. Other attitudes that the Army wishes to encourage, such as building teamwork and interdependence, can also be enhanced through smoking. Whilst the numerous, previously identified barriers to stopping smoking exist within and outside the armed forces, specific additional barriers arise from the structure and culture of the Army. Changes in the structure of daily life within the Army may reduce the barriers to stop smoking. Army clinicians also play an important part in soldiers' stopping smoking and an increased understanding of the specific barriers to stopping smoking may help them to support soldiers more effectively.

In military personnel, FNSF represents one of the more severe complications of training, which can result in medical discharge. Clinical examination findings are often non-specific and plain radiography may be inconclusive--leading to missed or late diagnosis of FNSF This paper highlights the significance of FNSFs in military personnel and alerts physicians to the potential diagnosis.

The medical records, plain radiographs, bone scans and MRIs of the recruits were retrospectively reviewed. Of 250 stress fractures 20 were of the femoral neck; representing 8% of all stress fractures and an overall FNSF rate of 12 in 10,000 military recruits. FNSFs were most prevalent amongst Parachute Regiment recruits (1 in 250, p &lt; 0.05). Onset of symptoms was most commonly between weeks 13-16 of training. The majority (17\/20, 85%) of FNSFs were undisplaced, these were all treated conservatively. Three FNSFs were displaced on presentation and were treated surgically. Overall, the medical discharge rate was 40% (8\/20). FNSFs are uncommon and the diagnosis remains a challenge to clinicians and requires a high index of suspicion in these young athletic individuals. In such individuals early referral for MRI is recommended, to aid prompt diagnosis and treatment and to prevent more serious sequelae.","1090":"Audit of hospital practice in remote areas and military practice indicates that it is possible to provide a high degree of patient safety with the advantages of care close to home in a small hospital with less than 100 beds.

A retrospective review of all shoulder stabilisations performed on military personnel, by a single surgeon, between August 2004 and August 2005 at a district general hospital serving both military and civilian population was undertaken. The presentation, clinical and operative findings were noted and compared in the groups treated by arthroscopic or open stabilisation. Using our protocol 39 shoulder stabilisations were performed in military personnel. Of the shoulders, 25 (64%) underwent arthroscopic and 14 (36%) underwent open stabilisation. The indication for surgery was more than 2 episodes of shoulder dislocation. Open surgery was found to be more common in those who had their first dislocation at a younger age. Bilateral shoulder laxity was the most common indication to choose the open method. Both open and arthroscopic stabilisation gave good results in the high demand military population.

Although the reasons for DNA within the general population are well documented, little is known about this behaviour amongst people serving in the armed forces. In this paper we report the findings of a questionnaire-based study investigating the reasons why military personnel fail to keep hospital appointments. A postal questionnaire asking questions about the reasons for not attending the appointment and how they perceived the condition for which treatment had been sought, were sent to 167 military patients known to have missed appointments in either a hospital outpatient department or regional rehabilitation unit. 162 controls, who attended appointments, were also sent a questionnaire asking them about factors leading to their appointment and how they perceived the condition that they attended the appointment for. Illness perception was measured using a previously validated Illness perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). The controls were matched by rank, gender and corps. The overall response rate was 51.5%, with 46% response in the DNA group and 55% in the controls. A previous history of hospital DNA (though not DNA in primary care) and attempting to change the appointment date were associated with DNA (p = 0.01). Those who received a reminder about the appointment were less likely to DNA (p &lt; or = 0.001). Although patients who perceived their condition to be less important were more likely to fail to attend their appointment (p = 0.01), illness perception as measured on the IPQ-R, was not associated with appointment attendance. The most frequent reasons cited for missed appointments were due to administrative problems, with many (38%) respondents being simply unaware that they had an appointment at all or believing that they had cancelled it (14%). Forgetting the appointment (8%) or mixing up the date (21%) were also cited by respondents as reasons for not attending. Only 11% of respondents gave reasons that were specific to a military population, most frequently being on exercise at the time of their appointment. Demographic differences such as age and gender, and practical factors such as appointment day, distance travelled, method of appointment notification, or type of hospital were not found to be associated with attendance. The most common reasons for not attending appointments were due to administrative error and an inability amongst patients to recall the correct date of the appointment. Whilst efforts to improve attendance through various reminder systems have been found to be effective in the short term at least, improvements in the efficiency of appointment administration is likely to generate a reduction in DNA and in turn will reduce the wastage of resources. ","1095":"Practitioners providing pre-hospital care during civilian practice and on military operations may be required to perform airway management and tracheal intubation at floor level. It has been shown that intubation using the Airtraq laryngoscope is easier to learn than standard Macintosh laryngoscopy. We hypothesised that the Airtraq would be easier to use and have shorter intubation times than Macintosh intubation. Sixty volunteers attending a medical conference with no prior Airtraq experience, who were skilled in pre-hospital Macintosh intubation, were recruited. Each was required to intubate an anatomically correct manikin at floor level using a Macintosh and Airtraq laryngoscope. The Airtraq was found to be superior in ease of use (VAS 30 mm, P &lt; 0.001), had a shorter total intubation time (19.4seconds) and a higher intubation success rate (P = 0.012) than the Macintosh laryngoscope (VAS 50 mm, 20.4 seconds). Rotating the tracheal tube 90 degrees anticlockwise during loading into the guiding channel, made the Airtraq intubation easier (VAS 30 mm, P = 0.001) and faster (19.4 seconds, P &lt; 0.001) than with standard orientation of the tube (VAS 40 mm, 25.3 seconds). Airtraq intubation may prove to be easier than Macintosh intubation, when utilised in the clinical pre-hospital setting, though randomised controlled clinical trials are required to confirm this.","1096":"Although thankfully rare,heat related illness has significant implications for the effective fighting force available to commanders. This is especially pertinent in the current theatres of operations, as previously soldiers have not routinely been subjected to the rigors of operating in hot climates. In addition to Iraq and Afghanistan, various training exercises are undertaken throughout the world where extreme temperatures may be encountered. Individual medical officers may be faced with heat casualties remote from all but the most basic facilities or the number of heat casualties may overwhelm limited resources. We present a simple treatment algorithm that has been used successfully in the treatment of mass heat casualties.","1097":"The deployment of 16 Air Assault Brigade to Helmand Province, Afghanistan in April-October 2006 was supported by a two -surgeon Field Surgical Team (FST) embedded within a 25 bed medical facility. We report the summative operative experience of the FST in order to analyse workload, case-mix and outline future training requirements. Within this period, 138 patients underwent 255 theatre episodes and 322 surgical procedures. 106 of the 138 patients requiring surgery were battle-injured. Surgical procedures undertaken involved wound excision (95), major amputation (9), laparotomy (9), application of external-fixation\/skeletal traction (6), thoracotomy (4), plaster application (6), dural repair (2), and one tracheostomy with 13 other procedures. Procedures undertaken at subsequent surgery included delayed primary closure (65), split skin graft (7), wound excision (5), tendon repair (3) and 32 others. Complications included two patients with delayed reactionary haemorrhage\/ post-surgical bleeding requiring re-operation. There was one in-hospital death. Thirty-two patients underwent surgery to treat disease or non-battle injury (DNBI), including 9 patients with major burns who required 26 procedures for burn excision and primary skin grafting. Many of the operations required the deployed team to operate outside of their normal NHS comfort zone. The experiences and lessons learnt and re-learnt by this surgical team should be part of our institutional memory.","1098":"Traditionally, suspected basal skull fractures have been considered a relative contra-indication to inserting a nasogastric tube (NGT). In patients with basal skull fractures the Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol recommends that an orogastric tube (OGT) be inserted rather than a nasogastric tube (NGT). This article reviews the available literature. We conclude that in patients with suspected or confirmed basal skull fractures numerous case reports confirm that nasogastric tube insertion may lead to intracranial placement which, although the causal relationship is unclear, is associated with patient death.","1099":"","1100":"","1101":"For the majority service in the Armed Forces is beneficial and, in the main, military veterans have successful lives. However, a minority have a bleaker outlook as a result of on-going ill health and social exclusion. Whilst the media focuses on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, in reality the most frequent mental health problems for veterans are alcohol problems, depression and anxiety disorders. These difficulties are difficult to manage as veterans, particularly those who are unwell, demonstrate a reticence to seek help for mental health problems. Another issue is that many veterans are now reserve personnel who have been found to be at greater risk of developing mental health problems than their regular counterparts. Steps to improve the knowledge and expertise of primary care services about veteran's mental health issues and increasing the availability of treatment options are important and are underway.","1102":"In recent years there has been an explosion in the publicity surrounding hostage taking. There have been many well-publicized hostage, prisoner of war and politically motivated incarcerations. Increasingly hostages are being paraded on television and sometimes even films of executions posted on the Internet. Hostage taking has usually occurred in countries where there has been political strife and war, especially, in recent years, in Iraq and Afghanistan, most recently involving British Royal Navy Personnel in Iran and a British journalist in Palestine. The aim of this paper is to review the adult literature regarding hostage taking with a view to highlighting the most likely psychiatric disorders that can develop during such an experience. This will aid planning and implementation of hostage rehabilitation and family reintegration post release. This paper will help build insight into the experiences and potential clinical presentations of those held hostage under conditions of torture and threat of death. It presents a framework of needs allowing the planning of rehabilitation including how to manage the family and the media. Further specific research is needed in order to assess the full needs of those released from prolonged incarceration held under threat of death. This will allow better planning for, and delivery of, rehabilitation of those released.

Given the current very considerable operational tempo being experienced by the majority of the UK Armed Forces, it is perhaps not surprising that TRiM has been in use in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Although TRiM originated from within the Royal Marines, it is now widely used in both the Royal Navy and Army; there are also plans to introduce it into specific components of the Royal Air Force such as for the RAF Regiment.

Concern has been raised about the impact of current operations upon the mental health of Service personnel. Using data gathered from deployed Field Mental Health Teams, a random sample of UK based non-deployed Community Mental Health Teams and services dedicated to mobilising, de-mobilising and to de-mobilised Reserve Forces, this paper explores the current mental health burden for UK Forces. At present, operationally related psychological disorders do not appear to be a substantial concern for Regular Forces, although for the minority that suffer such problems they are both distressing and of occupational relevance. Proportionately there are more mobilised Reserve Forces seeking help for mental health problems than Regular Forces on operations, but the overall burden that they currently place upon the Defence Mental Health Services is small. There is at present no evidence of an epidemic of mental health problems amongst either Regular or Reserve Forces veterans of the Op TELIC deployment, however, this may change in the future given the evolving nature and fluctuating intensity of operational activity.","1110":"Whilst there may be some individuals who genuinely enjoy combat, for most troops it represents many emotional challenges, such as, overcoming fear and being witness to death, suffering and mutilation, as well as having to tolerate extremes of physical discomfort. At present we lack sufficiently valid and reliable methods of screening out those personnel particularly vulnerable to adverse reactions to these challenges. The authorities should aim to provide good training, an appreciative milieu, and a working climate in which those with genuine psychopathology feel confident to admit this, without censure and stigma, and to have access to evidence-based treatments. We should also remember that military life offers much to many men and women, and that surviving physically and psychologically the unavoidable brutalities of combat can often leave a legacy of positive outcomes. We must avoid becoming preoccupied with risk and psychopathology.","1111":"","1112":"This case is of an 8-year-old child who had a cardiac arrest and an Emergency Department thoracotomy (EDT) following a penetrating fragmentation injury to the chest.

Injury patterns to limbs are such that the conventional sites for venous cannulation may be unsuitable. The EZ-IO (Vidacare, San Antonio) system is one of a number of novel products designed for intraosseous (IO) access in adults or children. In three months of combat casualty care in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, the UK Defence Medical Services used EZ-IO for emergency vascular access on 26 patients (16 adults; 10 children). 23\/26 patients had IO access obtained in the emergency department; 3\/26 had pre-hospital IO access within a tactically flying helicopter. A total of 32 needles were inserted, with 97% effective function. IO needles were used to administer fluid (crystalloid, packed red cells and fresh frozen plasma) and drugs (analgesics, cardiac arrest drugs, antibiotics, drugs for both rapid sequence induction and maintenance of anaesthesia). No complication of infection was noted, but pain was observed in responsive patients with the pain of infusion exceeding that of the underlying injuries in 3 cases.","1114":"To determine the prevalence of tourniquet use in combat trauma, the contribution to lives saved and the complications of their use in this environment. All casualties treated at UK field hospital facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan and meeting criteria for entry into UK Joint Theatre Trauma Registry (JTTR) from 04 Feb 03 to 30 Sep 07. Cases were identified from UK JTTR. Casualties from Permanent Joint Overseas Bases (PJOBs) were excluded. ISS, NISS, TRISS and ASCOT were calculated automatically within JTTR from AIS 2005 (Military) codes. 1375 patients met UK JTTR entry criteria for the period specified (excluding PJOBs). 70\/1375 patients (5.1%) were treated with one or more tourniquets (total 107 tourniquet applications). 61\/70 (87%) survived their injuries. 17\/70 (24%) patients had 2 or more tourniquets applied. 64\/70 patients received a tourniquet after April 2006, when tourniquets were introduced as an individual first aid item. 43\/70 (61%) patients were UK military. ISS and TRISS are poorly representative of injury severity and outcome for combat trauma involving isolated multiple limb injuries and cannot be used to discriminate whether a tourniquet is life-saving. The presence of severe isolated limb injuries, profound hypovolaemic shock and the requirement for massive transfusion reasonably identifies a cohort where the use of one or more tourniquets pre-hospital to control external bleeding can be said to be life-saving.

Recent UK, Palestinian and Israeli data suggests that nine out of every ten injured soldiers that die do so within minutes of wounding from insurvivable, unsalvagable trauma. Having the surgeon on the battlefield with the soldier has been shown to make no difference to these survival rates. Early definitive airway control using rapid sequence induction and intubation is of benefit to the head and airway injured. Once this airway is secured, these early survivors may be transported for up to 2 hours receiving intensive care level treatment: Hypotensive resuscitation with blood transfusion, administration of adjunctive clotting factors, hypothermia mitigation, administration of antibiotics, analgesics, novel haemostatics, splintage, FAST scanning can all be performed in flight. The second peak of death comes from truncal bleeding and CNS injury. Those with truncal (or junctional) bleeding require significant surgical, logistic and haemostatic support. Those with CNS injury require CT scanning and specialized neurosurgical care. These subgroups do best in large well-resourced hospital units which have the infrastructure, blood, climate control, knowledge and staffing levels to deal with them. Stopping elsewhere en-route to these larger centres is of uncertain benefit. Our resources must be optimised to save the many that could be saved, rather than dispersed for the few who will not. Wounded soldiers need to be undergoing surgery in the operating theatres of these large centres within three hours of wounding.","1123":"To determine the optimal composition o f the pre-hospital medical response team (MERT) and the value of pre-hospital critical care interventions in a military setting, and specifically to determine both the benefit of including a doctor in the pre-hospital response team and the relevance of the time and distance to definitive care. A comprehensive review of the literature incorporating a range of electronic search engines and hand searches of key journals. There was no level 1 evidence on which to base conclusions. The 15 most relevant articles were analysed in detail. There was one randomized controlled trial (level 2 evidence) that supports the inclusion of a doctor on MERT. Several cohort studies were identified that analysed the benefits of specific critical care interventions in the pre-hospital setting. A doctor with critical care skills deployed on the MERT is associated with improved survival in victims of major trauma. Specific critical care interventions including emergency endotracheal intubation and ventilation, and intercostal drainage are associated with improved survival and functional recovery in certain patients.

Delineated risk factors are restricted to negro origins, previous cold injury, moderate but not heavy smoking and the possession of blood group O. No attention has been directed to the possibility that abnormal blood constituents could feasibly predispose to the development of local cold injury. This study considers this possibility and investigates the potential contribution of certain components of the circulating blood which might do so. Three groups of soldiers from two of the battalions who served during the war in the Falklands Islands in 1982 were investigated. The risk factors which were sought included the presence or absence of asymptomatic cryoglobulinaemia, abnormal total protein, albumin, individual gamma globulin or complement C3 or C4 levels, plasma hyperviscosity or evidence of chronic alcoholism manifesting as high haemoglobin, PCV, RBC, MCV or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). No cases of cryoglobulinaemia were isolated and there was no haematological evidence to suggest that any of those men who had developed cold injury, one year before this study was performed, had abnormal circulating proteins, plasma hyperviscosity or indicators of alcohol abuse. Individual blood groups were not incriminated as a predisposing factor although the small numbers of negroes in this series fared badly. Although this investigation has excluded a range of potential risk factors which could contribute to the development of cold injury, the problem persists. Two areas of further study are needed: the first involves research into the production of better protective clothing in the form of effective cold weather boots and gloves and the second requires the delineation of those dietary and ethnic factors which allow certain communities to adapt successfully to the cold.

The factors compared are those thought to affect rates seen in these past wars. The factors highlighted are psychiatric screening of evacuees, presence of psychiatric personnel in line units, intensity of combat and use of elite units. Factors also mentioned are presence of possible occult psychiatric casualties such as frostbite and malaria, amount of indirect fire and the offensive or defensive nature of the combat. A unique aspect of the Falklands War examined is the exclusive use of hospital ships to treat psychiatric casualties and the impact of the Geneva Convention rules regarding hospital ships on the classic treatment principles of proximity and expectancy. The types and numbers of various diagnoses are also presented. The British Campaign in the Falklands produced a remarkably low rate of psychiatric casualties. When viewed in light of American experience in recent wars, this low rate represents a concentration of optimal factors leading to healthy function in combat.

In both locations approximately 40% of teeth that caused problems had been symptomatic before and 13 -16% had untreated decay. This study suggests that soldiers experience a lower incidence of symptoms related to third molars when in Iraq compared to Northern Ireland (P &lt; 0.033) possibly due to pre-deployment treatment. If ideal pre-deployment screening of third molars was carried out and National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines applied 38% of the Operation Telic group of patient's problems could have been prevented.

All of us have encountered malingerers in the course of our work but the extent and array to which they extend in their attempts is greatly surpassed by the tales of effort and guile reported by Gavin. Fit, content men have always been at the centre of the military capability and in the forces of the present day the driving concerns to discharge oneself from the army or navy are no longer quite as pressing. However, medical officers should always be alert to the art of feigning.

About 50% of combat deaths are due to fatal bleeding. The aim of this analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven, Novo Nordisk A\/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) when used to treat trauma-related blood loss. Forty-five patients aged 5-81 years (mean age 30.5 years) received rFVIIa (mean dose 73.6 microg\/kg) for the management of trauma-related bleeding. Trauma was classified as blunt (n = 42) or penetrating (n = 3). The primary outcome measure was reduction of transfusion requirements; improvements in coagulation status post-rFVIIa were also noted. Haemostatic efficacy was achieved in 43\/45 (95.6%) patients following rFVIIa administration, and transfusion requirements (defined as median units of packed red blood cells administered in the 24-hour period following rFVIIa administration) were reduced from 10 to 3 units (P &lt; 0.001). Coagulation status also showed improvement (median values for activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time decreased from 43 to 37 s [P &lt; 0.001] and from 19 to 12 s [P = 0.026], respectively). No safety concerns were raised by the available data. As this analysis has several limitations that are unavoidable when using global registries to collect and analyse data, our findings are not conclusive. However, these preliminary observations especially in those patients who underwent very early rFVIIa treatment offer further support for the use of rFVIIa in trauma. ","1195":"The paper provides a review of one year of military Mental Health (MH) hospital admissions. This includes an exploration into demographic trends, differences in clinical opinion and how information gained is used to improve the service and ensure appropriate, cost effective care in the optimum environment. The sample group is entitled military MH hospital admissions from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006. Data was collected on questionnaires with SPSS used for the management and analysis of the quantitative data, with the information exposed to descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. There were 344 admissions. The paper contains a detailed review of a number of variables. Depression was the most common diagnosis resulting in 112 (33%) hospital admissions and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder accounted for 23 (7%). There were statistically significant differences that may be attributable to gender with more women admitted with depression and more men with alcohol related disorders. The average length of stay was 21 days, with 48% of patients discharged within 3 weeks. 45% of all returns included significant events reporting that highlighted written evidence of good and poor practice. This study is part of an extensive monitoring programme of military MH hospital admissions. Depression is the most common MH problem leading to hospital admission. The results indicate that Service-personnel have access to a highly responsive service that provides brief assessment and treatment within a safe therapeutic environment. 45% of returns included significant event information that resulted in policy changes, leading to improved patient care and a better interface with the NHS. Bench-marking, both internally between military Departments of Community Mental Health and externally have improved visibility and self awareness leading to better GP induction programmes, PHC educational seminars and the establishment of MH web-pages. The Armed Forces need an effective MH service that is accessible, readily available, non-stigmatised and which positively advocates a duty of care. The results highlight the importance of further studies regarding depression to ensure that the Armed Forces are in a better position to maximise the use of MH resources. ","1196":"This study analyzes the effect of outsourcing healthcare on career soldiers in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in different settings, so as to develop a model for predicting per capita medical costs Demographic information and data on healthcare utilization and costs were gathered from three computerized billing database systems: The IDF Medical Corps; a civilian hospital; and a healthcare fund, providing services to 3,746; 3,971; and 6,400 career soldiers, respectively. Visits to primary care physicians and specialists, laboratory and imaging exams, number of sick-leave days, and hospitalization days, were totaled for men and women separately for each type of clinic. A uniform cost was assigned to each type of treatment to create an average annual per capita cost for medical services of career soldiers. Significantly more visits were recorded to primary care physician and to specialists, as well as imaging examinations by Leumit Healthcare Services (LHS), than visits and tests in hospitals or in military clinics (p &lt; 0.001). The number of referrals to emergency rooms and sick-leave days were lowest in the LHS as compared to the hospital and military clinics (p &lt; 0.001). The medical cost per capita\/year was lowest in LHS as well. Outsourcing primary care for career soldiers to a civilian healthcare fund represents a major cost effective change, lowest consumption and lower cost of medical care.

A prospective study of patients presenting to the physiotherapy department at the British Military Hospital (BMH) Shaibah, Iraq was undertaken from July 2006 - September 2006. Patients with a condition amenable to local steroid injection and who had not improved with conservative therapy were considered for the study. They then underwent local injection with steroid and local anaesthetic. During this period 12 patients were identified that fitted the criteria for local steroid injection. This represented 7% (12\/179) of patients who were seen by the physiotherapy department in either an in or out-patient setting. All patients were injected with local anaesthetic and steroid injection with a single dose of intravenous antibiotic as antimicrobial cover. 10\/12 (83.3%) were able to return to their unit within this theatre of operation. The only complication was one case of post injection flare of pain, which settled after 48 hours. The use of local steroid injection, as an adjunct to physical therapy, can enable service personnel to remain in the theatre of operations. These patients may have otherwise required aero medical evacuation. We consider the use of a local steroid injection to be a safe and effective intervention in certain patients where conservative measures alone do not work. This study highlights the safety of using steroid injections in an operational field hospital setting. Further large scale studies may help corroborate this conclusion. ","1213":"In order to train medical personnel properly for future international missions the Lithuanian Armed Forces decided to adopt BATLS\/BARTS as a basic course for military pre-hospital trauma care. This decision was based upon the increasing Lithuanian participation in international missions as a part of multinational units. Another important reason was the personal experience of the course concept acquired in Sweden in 2001 by five Lithuanian medical officers. Similar to the way BATLS\/BARTS was introduced in Sweden, a regular Swedish course (as given in Sweden for own units prior to international missions) was given in Lithuania. The faculty consisted of three experienced instructors from Sweden, and the two Lithuanian medical officers who had previously taken the BATLS course and the BATLS instructor course in Sweden. Two BATLS\/BARTS courses have been given in Kaunas, Lithuania. A total number of eight medical officers, nine military nurses, five medics, three civilian doctors and four medical students have taken the course. Some of these (four medical officers, two military nurses and two medics) have later been deployed to Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo, where the Lithuanian units have been collaborating with British, Danish, Polish and Czech-Slovakian units. As international missions become multinational, it is essential there is full confidence in the level of training and preparedness among all units working together. One way to achieve this is through bi- or multinational training as described in this paper. ","1214":"The aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of degenerative change in the Achilles tendons of currently asymptomatic individuals and correlate it with their degree of physical activity. We recruited 126 healthy subjects, mean age 33.1, range 20 - 50 (78 males and 48 females). Their levels of physical activity were assessed by a questionnaire and scored using the Allied Dunbar Fitness Survey criteria, modified to exclude non-weight bearing activity. One investigator, who was blinded to the activity levels, ultrasound scanned all 252 tendons. Tendons were examined for evidence of hypoechoic regions, localised fusiform thickening, and the cross-sectional diameter of each was measured. Overall 59% (149) of tendons had ultrasound evidence of hypoechoic regions. In 50 tendons (in 31 patients) there was a history of previous Achilles pain and 84% of these had hypoechoic regions. Thirty three percent of subjects in the lowest quartile of activity had evidence of hypoechoic regions compared to 72.6% in the most active quartile (Pearson Chi2 p &lt; 0.01). Only 5.6% of all Achilles tendons had ultrasound evidence of localised fusiform thickening, with none in the inactive group compared to 6.4% in the very active group (Pearson Chi2 p = 0.03). Degenerative changes, identified by ultrasound, are common in the Achilles tendon and are often asymptomatic. There is a direct relationship between these changes and levels of current and lifetime activity. The natural history of asymptomatic chronic Achilles tendinosis and their relationship to future pain or tendon pathology is unknown. ","1215":"Damage Control Surgery (DCS) is a three-phase team-based approach to maximal injury penetrating abdominal trauma. In Phase I, the hypothermic, coagulopathic, acidotic, hypotensive casualty undergoes a proactively planned one-hour time limited laparotomy by an appropriately trained surgical trauma team. In phase II physiological stabilization takes place in the Intensive Care Unit. In phase III--definitive repair occurs. DCS is extremely resource intensive but will save lives on the battlefield. A military DCS patient will perioperatively require fourteen units of blood and seven units of fresh frozen plasma--half the blood stock of a light-scaled FST. Two DCS patients will in one day, exhaust this FSTs oxygen supply. We know that hypothermic patients with an iliac vascular injury (initial core temp &lt; 34 degrees C) suffer four-fold increases in their mortality, yet we cannot heat our tents above 20 degrees C during a mild British winter. Our primary casualty retrieval is excessively slow. A simple casevac request has to go to too much 'middle-management' before a flight decision is made. In Vietnam, wounded soldiers arrived in hospital within twenty-five minutes of injury. In Iraq in 2005, that figure is over one hundred and ten minutes. We use support or anti-tank helicopters that are re-roled on an adhoc basis for the critical care and transport of our sickest patients. We still do not have a dedicated all-weather military helicopter evacuation fleet despite significant evidence that intensive care unit level military evacuation is safe and eminently achievable in both in the primary and secondary care setting.

The diagnostic gold standard is microscopy of blood, lymph node aspirates or CSF. The disease is invariably fatal, if not treated. There are over 300 000 new cases of sleeping sickness each year, and approximately 100,000 deaths. We describe a British soldier who acquired trypanosomiasis in Malawi. He gave no history of a painful insect bite but presented with classical early signs of sleeping sickness (a primary chancre, regional lymphadenopathy, circinate erythema and a cyclical fever pattern). His condition worsened in the next week and trypanosomes were observed in a blood sample. He was aeromedically evacuated to Johannesburg, where Stage One Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense infection was confirmed; he also had renal and liver failure, pancytopenia and heart block. He was treated with intravenous suramin. He recovered fully over the next 5 months. Medical officers deploying to eastern and southeastern Africa must be familiar with the common presenting signs and symptoms of T b rhodesiense sleeping sickness, and should have access to a reliable local microscopy service at all times. Confirmed sleeping sickness requires immediate transfer to a tertiary diagnostic and treatment centre, where suramin (for T b rhodesiense infection) or pentamidine (for T b gambiense) and also melarsoprol (for Stage Two disease) must be immediately available.

It discusses the limitations within current MOD heat illness guidance and makes general recommendations for future deployments. Whilst it was seen that the perception of risk by senior Commanders and the pre-deployment preparation was correct, the extreme temperatures seen, averaging 46 degrees C, still resulted in a heat illness rate of 50\/1000 during the first 10-14 days of deployment.","1226":"","1227":"Confirming airway patency and the presence of breathing has significant limitations when both the casualty and medical personnel are in NBC category 4R. In casualties with limited signs of breathing, IPE may adversely affect the efficiency of clinical assessment, and when the triage sieve is used this could result in the misdiagnosis of death. This manuscript describes and evaluates the Respirator-Glove (RG) method, of assessing airway patency and breathing in NBC category 4R. A medical examination glove was fitted over the primary speech module of the S10 NBC respirator of a volunteer casualty dressed in 4R. Two groups were studied; the first used an intact glove the second used a glove minus one finger. Breathing patterns A, B and C, representing normal breathing, hypoventilation and apnoea respectively, were randomly performed by the casualty for 15 seconds. A blinded observer recorded the glove inflation and movement and using these signs determined if breathing was present. All of the randomly performed breathing pattern simulations were correctly identified in both groups, with glove inflation only occurring during exhalation. In the perforated glove group, the large expiratory air leak through the hole limited the development of continuous positive airway pressure and the respirator seal was maintained. In the non-perforated glove group the respirator seal was compromised. No difficulty was encountered attaching the gloves to the respirator speech module. As an aid to clinical examination, the Respirator-Glove (RG) method provides a reproducible visual assessment of airway patency and spontaneous ventilation in unconscious 4R casualties. It can be utilised at any point in the evacuation chain, may improve the identification of T1 casualties and could reduce the risk of death being misdiagnosed. The efficiency of clinical assessment in 4R will improve by introducing the RG method into CBRN medical training programmes.

Infective complications are common, particularly in the austere environment encountered in war. We present the management and early outcome of these injuries with reference to the mechanism of injury and bony injury. Data on ballistic fractures was collected prospectively during the 'war-fighting' phase of the 2003 Gulf Conflict, between 19th March and 20th May. Fractures were scored using the Red Cross Fracture classification and early outcome analysed. Thirty-nine patients, with 50 ballistic fractures, were treated by British military surgeons. Patients were predominantly Iraqi (90%) and 50 per cent of ballistic fractures were caused by bullets. Seventeen upper limb fractures and 33 lower limb fractures were sustained. There were seven traumatic amputations, and a further 2 limbs were amputated primarily. Methods of primary stabilisation for the remaining 41 fractures were: external fixation (22%), POP (14.5%), K-wires (14.5%) traction (10%), and no stabilisation (39%). Seven individuals were evacuated early after primary surgery, hence 43 ballistic fractures were available for follow-up. 13\/43 (30%) of wounds became infected, 5\/43 (11.5%) were deep infections necessitating surgical drainage. There were 4 late amputations (9.5%), 3 of which had initially been managed by external fixation. Infection occurred significantly more often in gunshot fractures (10\/21, 48%), wounds closed primarily against the principles of war surgery (415, 80%) and intra-articular fractures (3\/3, 100%) (p=0.022, 0.024 and 0.023 respectively). Differing methods of stabilisation had no bearing on the rate of postoperative infection. Ballistic fractures remain a challenge for trauma surgeons in times of war and still have a poor prognosis.

The case notes were examined and data collected on indication for surgery, complications, follow-up and outcome. Thirteen consecutive patients were identified, mean age of 44 years. Indications for surgery were chronic anal fissure, fistulous disease and post surgical deformity or stenosis of the anal canal. Median follow-up was 37 months (25-84). In 9 patients the flaps healed within 4 weeks. In the remaining 4 patients the flaps healed by secondary intention over a median of 14 weeks (8-20). Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (3 donor site separation and 2 flap retraction). Two patients developed recurrence of their original disorder. Eleven patients have relief of pre-operative symptoms with fully healed flaps. This procedure is simple, easy to construct and robust.

The RAMC during the First World War was a Corps led by some able officers such as Sir Arthur Sloggett in France and Sir Alfred Keogh in London. Sir Douglas Haig was in overall command, his leadership style impacting on the RAMC. There were problems in filling the ranks of the Corps, both before the conflict, as well as well as during the War, and a significant number of civilian medical practitioners were recruited to the RAMC. Shortages were only really addressed when the Americans joined the conflict. TRAINING OF CIVILIAN MOS: The great need for MOs meant that there was little time for formal training of civilian MOs and many felt unsuited for war work. This was recognised by the authorities, who gradually set up centres of instruction. The workhorse of the organisation was the Regimental Medical Officer, who had an important role in disease prevention and the conservation of manpower, in a type of conflict (trench) that required a ready supply of personnel. Although an important role, some doctors found the job frustrating. During the War, the RAMC managed to improvise an efficient system for handling casualties, the aim to give speedy treatment and to return the men to the front in the shortest possible time. The RAMC during the GreatWar was a highly structured and efficient organisation, geared towards maximising its available manpower, important in trench warfare.

Particular emphasis is placed on the relationship of alcohol intake to these injuries, their distribution and subsequent management. A review of the literature is conducted. The human bite is a leisure time injury of the young single male in the North East. It has been shown that there is a clear link to alcohol and in particular weekend drinking. Prompt operative intervention and wounds located at the head and neck have been shown to be associated with a decreased risk of subsequent infection, which reflects findings in the earlier literature. Fifteen cases were infected. One was the result of a postoperative complication. The remainder were infected on admission. The majority of infected cases were upper limb bites and were associated with a delayed presentation.","1249":"It has been recognised for some time that a terrorist incident was threatened in the U.K. and it has been noted previously in the JRAMC that the locations for terrorist atrocities are likely to be more diverse than previously experienced. July 7th 2005 witnessed the first terrorist suicide bombing on the U.K. mainland, targeting the public transport system in London. These attacks were unprecedented in both scale and intensity but they were anticipated in London. However there were clear difficulties, relating to multiple sites, their location underground and early problems with communication (2). This article highlights some of the experiences and learning points of the Intensive Care Medicine Service at the Royal London Hospital (RLH) in the wake of the July 7th bombings. The RLH was the single biggest receiver of casualties (195); seven of whom were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. The Defence Medical Services have tri-service representation (both regular and reserve) at the RLH in Emergency Medicine and Pre-hospital Care, Surgical Services and Intensive Care Medicine.","1250":"With the break up of the Warsaw Pact and changing global relations, current military deployments are becoming smaller and more expeditionary (e.g. Afghanistan, East Timor and Sierra Leone). During the Cold War, the use of weapons of mass effect was highly likely to have been seen on the battlefield. Ironically, the proliferation of CBRN agents and the knowledge of their application, as well as the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, have lead to the targeting of civilian populations by extremist groups. One of the benefits of military clinicians embedded in NHS hospital trusts, as well as a strong reservist cadre, is a greater understanding of the implications and management of asymmetric attacks against the U.K. The experience and skills of military clinicians may be of benefit to NHS trusts while this type of threat exists. Military clinicians are also likely to benefit from the experience that they get in certain NHS posts that provide skills that are readily transferable to military medicine. The events of 7th July highlighted the dynamic use of deployable medical resources and a rapid return to normal service provision. This type of 'Health Resilience' can only be achieved with a combination of effective emergency planning, on scene clinical risk management and clinical leadership.","1251":"","1252":"Through the DMCC and similar comprehensive training, Military and NGO personnel can prepare for deployment with a greater understanding of the issues that will confront them whilst there.

The triservice apparatus remains the system of choice for delivering volatile anaesthetic agents to patients in areas without the infrastructure to supply an endless quantity of medical gases, the planned isolated or battle conditions of Boultons scenarios. The TSA's portability, robust design and versatility have stood the test of time. By reviewing intravenous agents the author has attempted to find an evidence base for the most appropriate agent for a non anaesthetic trained doctor finding his or herself called on to provide emergency anaesthesia in the field. The most useful drug is ketamine which has the advantage of cardiovascular stability, preservation of airway reflexes, ease of administration via different routes and versatility for providing analgesia, sedation or general anaesthesia.","1254":"","1255":"","1256":"","1257":"","1258":"","1259":"Hypothermia is a multi-system disorder that significantly increases morbidity and mortality in the injured patient.

Each AASG was comprised of a four-table resuscitation facility, a two table FST and a twin-bedded ITU facility. An A+E Consultant and nurse, an experienced radiographer and laboratory technician with two further RGNs and CMTs provided resuscitation support. Each FST had an orthopaedic and a general surgeon, two anaesthetists and eight operating department practitioners. Further equipment consisted of a Polymobil 111 X-ray unit, a Sonosite 180 ultrasound scanner and an ISTAT gas, haematocrit and electrolyte analyser. 100 units of mixed blood were carried by each AASG. Fifty-one surgical procedures were performed on thirty one patients. Twenty one of these patients were Iraqi prisoners of war or civilians. Seventeen wound debridements, five amputations, five laparotomies, four insertions of Denham pins with Thomas splintage for femoral fracture, three external fixations and one axillary artery repair formed the basis of the major cases undertaken. The first field use of activated factor VII by the British Army was successful in the resuscitation of a patient with exsanguinating haemorrhage after an open-book (APC-III) pelvic fracture and a ruptured intrapelvic haematoma. The other cases included eleven manipulations under anaesthetic\/application of plaster and four finger terminalisations. Forward military surgery has a continued role to play on the modern fast moving battlefield. 16 Close Support Medical Regiment normally supports 16 Air Assault Brigade with its remit for expeditionary operations and SF support. Its experience on Op Telic should influence planning for future deployment.","1269":"Cervical spine fractures and dislocations are uncommon injuries that can have serious neurological consequences. These injuries require adequate stabilisation to prevent further spinal cord injury during transfer between hospitals. Evacuation often requires a combination of road ambulance, helicopter and fixed wing aircraft from military hospitals. This paper outlines the neck injuries sustained during Op Telic and discusses the need for Halo vests to be available at Role 3. The MND(SE) Hospital databases were used to identify all casualties admitted with either a \"Cervical\" or \"Neck\" injury. The databases covered the period from 24 March 2003 until 15 April 2004. The diagnoses were categorised into minor and serious cervical spine injuries. We defined a serious cervical spine injury as either a fracture or dislocation. We looked at the discharge letters of all casualties evacuated to a Role 4 hospital to confirm whether the casualties had serious cervical spine injuries. Forty seven casualties were admitted and all were British except three, two Iraqi civilians and one US soldier. Thirty three casualties were returned to their unit for duty, or discharged at the airhead on return to the UK. Fourteen casualties required hospital treatment. There were five serious cervical spine injuries over the study period which included one Hangman's fracture of C2, one flexion compression injury of C5, one flexion compression injury of C7, one unifacetal dislocation and one bifacetal dislocation. Five casualties were treated at MND(SE) Hospital for serious injuries to the cervical spine. Two patients were transferred without Halo stabilisation after failing to obtain halos in Iraq. One casualty was kept until a Halo was flown out from the UK. All unstable cervical spine fractures should be stabilised with a Halo Vest prior to transfer from Role 3. Halo Rings and Vests should be available at Role 3 facilities. ","1270":"","1271":"SLAP (superior labrum anterior and posterior) lesions are a recognised cause of shoulder pain and instability. They can occur following a direct blow, biceps traction and compression injuries, and are commonly seen in overhead athletes. Military personnel are physically active and often subjected to trauma. We assessed the incidence of SLAP lesions within a military population presenting with shoulder symptoms. A retrospective review, of all shoulder arthroscopies performed by a single surgeon between June 2003 and December 2004 at a district general hospital serving both a military and civilian population, was undertaken. The presentation and incidence of SLAP lesions were recorded for both military and civilian patients. One hundred and seventy eight arthroscopies were performed on 70 (39.3%) military and 108 (60.7%) civilian patients. The average age was 42.3 (range 17-75), 50 females and 128 males were included. Indications for arthroscopy included pain (75.3%), instability (15.7%), pain and instability (7.9%), or \"other symptoms\" (1.1%). 39 SLAP lesions (22%) were found and grouped according to the Snyder classification--20.5% type 1, 69.3% type 2, 5.1% type 3, 5.1% type 4. Patients with a history of trauma or symptoms of instability were more likely to have a SLAP lesion (p&lt;0.0001). The incidence of SLAP lesions in the military patients was 38.6% compared to 11.1% in civilian patients (p&lt;0.0001). After allowing for the increased incidence of trauma and instability in the military, SLAP lesions were still more common in the military patients (p&lt;0.001). There is a higher than average incidence of SLAP lesions in military patients compared to civilian patients. They tend to present with a history of trauma, as well as symptoms of pain and instability. Given the high incidence in military personnel, this diagnosis should be considered in military patients presenting with shoulder symptoms, and there should be a low threshold for shoulder arthroscopy. ","1272":"Health and morbidity reporting has been an important feature of the historical assessment of military campaigns from times of antiquity. Most of these reports have concentrated on hospital admission rates and mortality. In 1994 the British Army introduced a primary care health surveillance reporting system called J94. This provided the first opportunity for the systematic capture and analysis of morbidity data that allowed the identification of disease trends and the audit of remedial action. In parallel with the developments made by the military in the field of health surveillance, a number of initiatives in the NHS tried to develop real time surveillance systems with differing degrees of success. This paper reviews the developments made by military and civilian programs, identifies the problems that have been faced, areas where success has been achieved and the issues that will have to be considered as we prepare for the introduction of the next generation of IT based medical information systems into the military.","1273":"","1274":"","1275":"","1276":"","1277":"","1278":"","1279":"","1280":"","1281":"To examine the profile of medical morbidity and the role of the physician in modern conflict. Retrospective survey of admission records at a British Military Field Hospital on operational duty in Southern Iraq. 62.5% of 4870 admissions to the Field Hospital in Shaibah during the first 12 months of military operations in Iraq were under the care of physicians. Of these 1531 (31.4%) were due to diarrhoea and vomiting (D&amp;V) and 764 (15.7%) due to heat illness. The incidence of heat illness rose with ambient temperature, but soldiers were more likely to be admitted with heat illness shortly after arrival in theatre than when fully acclimatised. There was also a steady flow of admissions with a broad spectrum of medical pathology requiring the clinical skills of a general physician. A general physician is a necessary part of the clinical team in modern conflict. The incidence of D&amp;V and of heat illness on military operations remains high. Planners for any operation in tropical climates should take this into consideration and put preventative measures into place early. ","1282":"To assess referrals to a Field Hospital Mental Health Team (FMHT), assign a diagnosis, provide appropriate treatment, and decide whether suitable for safe return to unit in theatre (RTU), or evacuation home on psychiatric grounds (evac). All documented referrals to the FMHT of 202 Field Hospital during the Op Telic 1 study period of 17 March (day 1) to 23 July 2003 (day 129) were included. Data were collected on rank, gender, diagnosis, outcome (whether RTU or evac), and whether TA before mobilisation. Diagnosis was assigned by ICD-10 criteria. The FMHT documented 170 cases, 12 of whom were seen twice and one on three occasions, resulting in 184 referrals, all of whom were British. The commonest diagnosis was adjustment reaction (F43), accounting for 68% of all cases (n = 116). These were divided between chiefly theatre-related (n = 77) or chiefly home-related (n = 39) reactions. The majority (94%) of these cases were RTU. Referrals where the diagnosis was a Depressive disorder (F32, n = 23) or Intentional self-harm (by sharp object, X78, n = 7) were evacuated. Outcome was similar for Regular and TA personnel, with on average 72% of cases RTU. The majority of cases seen were ORs, reflecting their numbers in theatre. Only 14 NCOs and 14 officers were referred. Thirteen of the latter were TA before mobilisation. Gender was not associated with outcome, or TA status, but was associated with rank, in that significantly more female officers were referred. The FMHT role tasks emerged as (a) psychiatric triage and treatment, (b) psychological support of hospital staff, and (c) welfare and pastoral care liaison. The utility of the psychiatric management model employed, built upon previous military medical doctrines, was tested in a modern theatre of conflict, and seemed to prove its worth. ","1283":"Fracture of the clavicle is a common traumatic injury and comprises 4% of all fractures in adults. Amongst these, midshaft injuries account for the majority and medial fractures are uncommon. Whilst segmental fractures have been reported in the literature, concurrent lateral and medial injuries are very rare. These injuries are, therefore, susceptible to being missed, due to failure to look for a second injury after the initial diagnosis, and difficult X-ray interpretation around the area of the medial clavicle. The nature of segmental fractures can pose a difficult management problem for numerous reasons, and initial operative fixation is usually indicated. Early diagnosis is therefore imperative, and as such, clinical examination is essential even if an obvious mid or lateral shaft fracture is seen on X-ray. This unusual case of combined lateral and medial fractures was initially missed and the presentation and management is discussed.","1284":"The management of head injured patients has recently been reviewed with the development of civilian guidelines for best practice. These are common injuries which often have significant sequelae for patients and costs for health care providers. Evolving civilian standards of care have implications for military medicine which is often practised in challenging environments. Considerable planning and resources are necessary to meet these standards in an operational environment. The current standards and the problems of applying them in an operational theatre are discussed.","1285":"To review external fixation in the management of war injuries. We prospectively followed up 15 external fixators (14 patients) applied in the management of war injuries. All these patients were treated at 202 Field Hospital during the 2003 Gulf Conflict. Of the 15 fixators, 13 (86.7%) required early revision or removal due to complications of the injury or the fixator. Instability was a problem with 10 fixators (67%), pin loosening was noted with 5 fixators (33%) involving twelve pins, and a significant pin track infection developed at 14 pin sites (3 fixators - 20%), which failed to resolve despite intravenous antibiotics. This study demonstrates a very high early complication rate of external fixation in the management of military injuries and cautions against its universal acceptance. If used, consideration must be given to the optimum time of frame application, whether at the time of initial debridement or at a later operation, and the optimal frame design, which will depend on the specific bone and fracture pattern. Pin site care must also be considered, particularly with the restrictions imposed by the military environment.

A prospective study of trained British soldiers, with symptomatic low back pain, referred to the Colchester Garrison Sports Injury and Rehabilitation Centre over a four year period. The study demonstrates that 928 (17.8%) of the 5214 referrals were for new cases of low back pain. The incidence of low back pain in female soldiers is higher than their male counterparts with an odds ratio of 3.17 (95% CI 2.31 - 4.35) There was a highly significant cross gender difference in low back pain caused by activities in the followining categories: military physical traininong (OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.70 - 4.02), work or occupation (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.56 - 3.87) and off-duty pursuits (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.72 - 4.72). There was no cross gender difference in low back pain caused by sport, road traffic accidents or activities pre-dating military service. Female soldiers are significantly more likely to suffer low back pain as a result of physical military training, their occupation, or off-duty activities. Sporting activities do not cause low back pain in women to a greater extent than men By demonstrating the scale of the problem and by determining of the cause of injury, it should now be possible to propose methods of effective intervention to reduce injury, implement those interventions and audit effectiveness.

Retrospective analysis of discharge summaries and hospital notes of all service personnel admitted to BMH Shaibah due to RTA, from August 2003 to January 2004. Results During the study there were 315 reported RTA, 3 fatalities, and 47 inpatient admissions. 87% of admissions were male; in 32% of cases the vehicle had rolled and 28% of individuals admitted had been ejected from the vehicle. 85% of individuals had not been wearing their seatbelts and none of the ejected individuals had been restrained. 92% of those ejected were travelling in the rear of the Land Rover. Of those ejected, 38% suffered more than one type of injury, and 62% suffered a fracture, (accounting for 50% of all fractures admitted). 34% of admissions had sustained a fracture, and were evacuated to the UK. These figures correlate well with previous evidence showing the likelihood of serious injury is increased by more than 300% if the patient is ejected. Those travelling in the rear of a Land Rover would appear to be in the most dangerous position. Seatbelts are the single most effective means of reducing fatal and non-fatal injuries in motor vehicle accidents. Standing orders states that seatbelt use mandatory, but compliance is poor. This may be due to misconceptions on the relative dangers faced by soldiers in Iraq. Education and enforcement needs to be more effective if the Army is to reduce the number and seriousness of injuries attributable to RTA.

A retrospective analysis of entries into the attendance register and clinical notes from the Emergency Department of 34 Field Hospital. Forty five eye casualties were seen in the Emergency Department of 34 Field Hospital and they accounted for 2.0% of all attendances (n=2292). Of these, eye injuries were the commonest (58.7%), whilst the diagnosis of conjunctivitis was the most frequent non-traumatic presentation. A total of 6 casualties required transfer rearwards to a specialist UK facility. Of all eye casualties seen, 6 were of non-coalition status. Eye patients account for a significant proportion of the total number of casualties seen during the warfighting stage; only 25% of eye injuries can return to active duty, compared with 85% of all surviving wounded. Importantly, even minor eye injuries or infections can rapidly incapacitate personnel and if untreated cause permanent severe visual loss.

Haematological, biochemical and clinical data were gathered prospectively and patients allocated to diagnostic categories on the basis of the combination of clinical findings and investigations. Four basic types of heat-related illness could be distinguished: (1) excessive salt loss with hyponatraemic dehydration, (2) hypokalaemic alkalosis with low serum bicarbonate, (3) haemodilution associated with excessive water intake in stressed individuals, and (4) loss of normal thermoregulation, characterised by high core temperature and paradoxical cessation of sweating. Most of the patients fell clearly into a single distinct category, but there was a degree of overlap. Reduction of extracellular fluid volume was a common central mechanism. Common provoking factors identified were: gastrointestinal upset, history of previous heat intolerance (35%) environmental temperatures exceeding 45 degrees C, short period of acclimatisation (55%), travel, sleep loss, hard physical work especially if directly preceded by a period of sleep, work in confined humid spaces (45%), and lack of additional salt intake. When several of these factors were present together admission rate over one 24-hour period reached 3% of persons at risk per day. Patients are often more ill than they appear. To reduce the incidence of heat illness during future operations the following measures are proposed: 1. Avoidance of physical exertion during the heat of the day for the first 7-10 days. 2. Progressive gentle exercise in the early morning or late evening over the same period. 3. Increase in daily salt intake to 15-20gm for the first 2-3 weeks. 4.

Recruits underwent the 12-week phase 1 training program. Cases of AKP were captured through self-presentation of pain at a primary care medical centre. All recruits medical records were reviewed on leaving training and any other lower limb injuries were recorded for comparison with the AKP group. Training outcomes in terms of medical discharges (MD) and discharges as of right (DAOR) i.e, voluntary discharge, were recorded along with training days lost (TDL) and whether a recruit had been held back in training (BS). 8.75% (95% CI: 6.93-10.57) of recruits reported to the medical centre with AKP. Of these more than half were referred to see a GP and the majority were from patients with no previous history of AKP (91%, 95% CI: 85.2-97.5). The median TDL per AKP case was 3 days (IQR: 3-5 days).

Located very close to the front line during the period of combat hostilities, it was potentially going to deal with relatively fewer battle-injured extremities. A retrospective review of battle casualties admitted to the hospital was carried out based on casualty records and operating theatre logbooks. Data was collected for the period between the 26th March and the 8th May, focusing on casualties who had surgery for battle-injured extremities during the conflict. Sixty eight (55%) of the 124 casualties who underwent surgery did so for battle injuries to extremities. 139 (58%) of all operating theatre episodes and 189 (53%) of all surgical procedures undertaken were for battle-injured extremities. Fourteen major limb amputations were carried out from a total of 87 battle-injured limbs that had surgery, giving an amputation rate of sixteen percent (14\/87). The experience at 34 Field Hospital confirms that extremity injuries do confer a high surgical workload in war.

The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of the disease are discussed.","1328":"Currently, in the UK military, and particularly in the Army, a significant number of personnel are regularly discharged on the grounds of being assessed as \"Temperamentally Unsuitable (TU) for military duties\", under Queen's Regulations (QRs): (Army) 9.414 and 9.434 (1). In the last two years (2001--2003), preliminary figures suggest that approximately 700 serving personnel were recommended for discharge under this category by only four psychiatrists in the south of England. The regulations governing TU have been in existence and essentially unchanged since their development long before the 1960s albeit subject to parliamentary quinquennial review. The Army General and Administrative Instructions (AGAI) (2) standards also remain unchanged over this period. This paper raises questions about the current validity and relevance of existing TU concepts and regulations with suggestions as to what is being proposed in the context of changing roles, technology and advances in the modern armed forces.","1329":"A cohort study was undertaken to determine the source of an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness affecting a number of military personnel at ITC, Brecon during the period 19--30 March 2004. Of 105 soldiers on a field training exercise over the period 15--19 March 2004, 36 subsequently developed symptoms. Nine patients had Campylobacter sp identified in their stool. Water was provided from a single source. This water was used for washing, shaving, drinking and the preparation of rations. Although not statistically significant, epidemiological investigation suggests that the water may have been the vehicle of infection.","1330":"To raise awareness within the Defence Medical Services regarding the potential effect of post-alcohol impairment \/ alcohol hangover. Literature relating to post-alcohol impairment \/ alcohol hangover, and the evidence for impairment is reviewed, with discussion relating to UK Armed Forces. The evidence for performance impairment during alcohol hangover is not conclusive. Until further evidence is available policy should acknowledge the potential for impaired functioning, particularly the morning after a heavy drinking session, and even when blood alcohol has returned to zero. Recommendations for clinical practice and areas for further research are presented. ","1331":"This 3 year retrospective observational study aims to determine the diagnoses causing medical downgrading in a high readiness Royal Marine Commando unit, and to direct future investment to reduce numbers downgraded. Medical and administrative records were used to ascertain diagnoses, aetiology, time downgraded, and whether men returned to full duties. 4.4% of unit strength was lost through medical downgrading. 43% was due to soft tissue lower limb injuries, of which 41% was due to anterior knee pain syndrome. Low back pain accounts for 24% of the total. Median length of downgrading episodes was 3 months (range 1-40 months). Low back pain and lower limb soft tissue related episodes were longer (median 9 months p= 0.001, and 10 months p=0.003 respectively). Fractures (median 2 months p &lt; 0.001) and general surgical problems (median 2 months p=0.013) were shorter than the overall mean. Orthopaedic conditions related to overuse had longer periods of downgrading (median 6 months) compared to trauma (median 3 months p = 0.01). 9.3% of completed episodes of downgrading resulted in a medical discharge and 1.9% in a permanently reduced medical category. Conditions that respond rapidly to secondary care interventions have shorter episodes of downgrading compared to overuse conditions. Therefore, prevention and improved rehabilitation facilities are likely to be more effective than further secondary care investment in reducing medical downgrading. More timely use of permanent medical downgrading and medical discharge could reduce temporary downgrading by 20%. ","1332":"The management of casualties involved at the scene of a RoadTraffic Collision or Accident (RTC or RTA) is hazardous, challenging and resource intensive. Some pre-hospital care providers work in locations where there is little or no support and where they act as both the rescuer and the medical carer. This paper tries to break down the management of the extrication into key areas in order to suggest how the rescue can, where necessary, be managed with only a small amount of simple equipment.","1333":"The decisions required for the provision of an appropriate medical response to a radiological or nuclear incident range from the traditional major incident response through to a compromised response due to a catastrophic event. A summary of the most likely clinical findings in the first 12-24 hours is given in Table 4. From these findings, appropriate management based upon the needs and available resources can be planned. This includes triage for surgery and the use of the expectant (T4) triage category.","1334":"In situations with relatively small numbers of patients with pulmonary blast injury aggressive modern intensive care treatment may allow a return to normal function. The additional effects of radiation poisoning are more difficult to factor in, but new treatments such as colony stimulating factors may improve the outlook for a group with moderate to severe radiation exposure who would previously have died of infection or haemorrhage.","1335":"Nuclear weapons have both blast injury and radiation effects on the gut. The successful management of survivors requires a combined medical and surgical approach, and is likely to need at least 5 - 6 weeks of in-patient therapy for gastrointestinal radiation syndrome. It should be remembered that the haemopoietic syndrome is an invariable companion. The chance of survival for people with acute radiation syndrome decreases with increasing radiation dose. Most people who do not recover from ARS will die within a few weeks of exposure. The cause of death in most cases is the destruction of the bone marrow, which results in infections and internal bleeding. For the survivors, the recovery process may last from several weeks up to 2 years. Long-term survivors face an increased solid cancer risk of approximately 47% per sievert.","1336":"","1337":"","1338":"The initial management of any irradiated casualty is the early identification of the possibility of a significant exposure through dose prediction and recognition of prodromal symptoms. Subsequent management is aimed at supporting the effected systems until there is recovery. Where there is haematological failure, transplantation (bone marrow \/ stem cell) is possible although limited value in a mass casualty scenario. The provision of gold standard therapy within the field is unlikely to occur and early medical evacuation to an Echelon \/ Role 4 facility with specialist services will be required. Within the field, early assessment using the above systems of classification could be achieved at Echelon \/ Role 3 and may be enhanced with the establishment of Radiation Assessment Units. These would select casualties that could benefit from the advanced therapies.

As a relatively young examination it still suffers from a lack of associated study material and a formal syllabus. The emergence of a specific membership examination such as MFAEM represents the growth in stature of A&amp;E as a speciality in its own right. As the examination becomes more popular and growing numbers of doctors apply there will be a similar expansion of study material and available resources. MRCSEd(A&amp;E) remains a solid alternative and eligibility for this examination is similar to MFAEM part B. However, success at a relevant part one is required before sitting this. The MFAEM part A is more balanced and relevant primary examination for A&amp;E trainees but if one is interested in dual accreditation or has a specific interest in another speciality then sitting the MRCP, MRCS or FRCA may be more appropriate before approaching the MFAEM part B or MRCSEd(A&amp;E).","1344":"","1345":"Anaesthesia, like all other medical specialities continues to advance, with improvements in the agents used and techniques employed in order to minimise adverse effects to the patient.

This article describes the activities and findings from a FMHT deployed alongside a General Support Medical Regiment covering the divisional rear area. The rate of psychiatric casualties was much lower than anticipated, but the expected bias towards less experienced personnel and reservists was noted. The article covers all stages of the operation from pre-deployment training, reception, staging and onward integration, operations, redeployment and homecoming, describing the core activities of the FMHT at each stage.","1348":"This paper reports the surgical experience of a UK reserve field surgical hospital during military operations in Iraq during March and April 2003. Particular reference is given to the integration of the surgical specialities, consultant led and multidisciplinary teamworking in the treatment of military and civilian casualties from all sources and of all causes. METHODS All surgical workload data was collected prospectively for the warfighting (Phase One) and specialist referral (Phase Two) phases of the operation. Standard military and Red Cross protocols were used for all injuries and microbiology studies were undertaken for penetrating ballistic injuries. Operations were classified by anatomical region; upper or lower limb; head and neck; thoracic; abdominal, including genitourinary; ophthalmic; and burns, and by whether they were primary; secondary planned or secondary unplanned. A wide range of patterns of wounding arising from combat and non-combat related military and civilian trauma and burns were seen and treated. 323 operations were performed. There were 116 operations in phase one and 207 operations in phase two. There were 160 primary procedures (new patients), 146 secondary planned and 17 unplanned procedures (range one to eight procedures per patient). Close integration of general, orthopaedic, plastic, maxillofacial, ophthalmic and neurological surgeons and general and ITU anaesthetists allowed the delivery of a range of specialist treatment to a heterogenous patient population, including children as young as 6 months and a lady in the advanced stages of pregnancy. Patterns of wounding in casualties surviving to reach specialist field hospital care were similar to those reported in other high intensity conflicts. A consultant led, multidisciplinary approach with field intensive care facilities allowed combined, staged and safe surgery for complex, multi-organ and multi-limb trauma in an austere environment.

He was evacuated to the closest Role 2+ medical facility. Within 2 days he had developed bruising and a haematoma at the bite site. An improvised measure of clotting status, the bleeding time, was employed, showing that his blood was severely anticoagulated. He was transferred to the Field Hospital where coagulation screen revealed a DIC picture. He required 5 units of cryoprecipitate and 2 doses of antivenom. This case report demonstrates the need for prompt evacuation to a Role 3 facility in such cases, whether symptomatic or not.","1350":"To undertake a tri-Service questionnaire survey to examine the commanders' understanding of, and attitudes to, stress and stress-related problems. A questionnaire was designed to elicit information on: Personal experience of stress and stress-related problems; Stress education; Pre-deployments briefings; and Post-incident stress debriefing. A total of 9,020 questionnaires were distributed between the three Services based on their proportional manning contribution to the Armed Forces as a whole. The population sampled ranged in rank from Corporal\/Leading Rate up to, and including, Colonel\/Captain RN\/Group Captain (ranks below Leading Rate\/ Corporal were excluded because of their lack of command experience). The overall response rate was 55.8%. The study was carried out between September and December 2001 (i.e. pre-OP TELIC). Chronic work-based stressors were seen as most stressful when compared with family and health stressors. Most respondents accepted that stress and stress-related problems exist, but were reluctant to disclose their own stress-related problems or seek help for fear that it might be detrimental both personally and professionally. There was found to be little support from peers or commanders. Little stress training was provided during recruit training, there were gaps in pre-deployment briefings and little in the way of post-deployment stress support. Some of the more negative findings could have implications in terms of seeking help for stress-related problems at an early stage, which is counter-productive to the military's genuine attempts to foster the psychological welfare of its employees. Some concerns could be alleviated by better and more timely stress education, preferably early on in a commander's career, so that positive attitudes to stress and stress-related problems can be formed and any negative attitudes changed, thereby bringing about a change in organisational culture in relation to stress. Some of the study's concerns were addressed by the Operational Health Strategic Surveillance Committee which advised on operational health aspects of OP TELIC.

The machine's light and rugged design make it suitable for military deployment and they have been successfully used on deployments in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. Ultrasound is widely accepted in the diagnosis of abdominal and thoracic trauma, however, little work exists on its use in extremity trauma. Although the diagnosis of fractures usually relies on X-ray this may not be readily available at Role 1 or 2.

There was judged to be a real threat that chemical weapons, especially nerve agents, and certain biological weapons would be used. Coalition countries attempted to reduce the effects by the use of medical countermeasures. Since the Gulf conflict a series of medico legal problems from this policy have arisen; some of which have formed the basis of claims against MOD. In this paper I shall review how consent to treatment may have been modified in the military operational context and by the interface with military law. I shall look at the issues of clinical negligence and how duty of care may be affected. In the next article I shall look at relevant employment law; briefly review how medicines regulatory provision applies to medical countermeasures, whether they were properly licensed and whether in any case this applied to the Ministry of Defence in the context of deployment to the Gulf War.","1361":"This paper reviews the efficacy of six different methods of removal of foreign bodies from the nose.

A three month retrospective study of telephone consultations by nurses at the MRS Sennelager showed that telephone consultation greatly contributes to \"out of hours\" medical care. The outcome of telephone consultations made out of hours revealed that in 70% of telephone calls the advice given enables the patient to stay at home. Twenty eight percent of patient contact out of hours was by telephone.","1363":"Night vision goggles have become an essential component of military aviation. They provide superior visual capability over unaided night vision, but there are several inherent limitations associated with human factors and systems limitations. This study used a questionnaire survey of Army helicopter aircrew to investigate the incidence of human factors problems which continued after NVG use, with particular reference to visual problems and neck discomfort. It also looked at hardware interaction problems, such as cockpit lighting, and other aspects of NVG use, such as training and aircrew concerns. The issues are described and analysed, and areas of concern, which may have bearings on operational effectiveness and\/or safety, have been highlighted.","1364":"The bomb in Omagh on the 15th August 1998 was responsible for the largest loss of life of any single terrorist incident in the whole of the \"Troubles\" in Northern Ireland. However, the medical response to this tragedy provided an excellent opportunity for the civilian and military agencies to work together. As a consequence of this a number of lessons were drawn which are presented in the paper. Whatever the outcome of the peace process these lessons will have an important role in the future, since history would suggest that there is little possibility of the terrorist threat ever completely.","1365":"In the years after Operation Desert Storm and Operation Granby, some 4-8% of veterans of the conflict began to report symptoms of illness. Common complaints included fatigue, impaired cognition, joint pain, sleep disturbances, and chest pains. Between 1992 and 1994 in the USA, and later in the UK, governments set up medical assessment programmes to define the scope of the problem in qualitative and quantitative terms. Initial efforts moved to extensive epidemiological assessment and a search for causative mechanisms of what became termed \"Gulf War Syndrome\". Eventually significant sums of money were invested in medical and investigative research in an attempt to relate symptoms to causes. This paper presents the historical background and context to the problem of Gulf and war related illnesses, summarises the findings of relevant epidemiological studies and discusses some of the hypotheses that have been generated to explain the clusters of symptoms reported by veterans. Finally, the current UK research programme and its underlying rationale is presented. The aim is to provide an overview of the current position and assist in the interpretation of a diagnostically difficult area.","1366":"Any major incident will test the organisational and medical skills of those involved. The best response can only be achieved with good planning and preparation, and the adoption of a structured approach to the scene.

Where is the onward destination and are they expecting the casualty. (Check). Is the destination suitable for the casualty and the aircraft type? (Check). What level of training is required to transfer the casualty? (Cbt Med Tech\/RGN\/MO). Are the appropriate aeromed stretchers and harnesses available? (If not get them). Are all the casualty's documentation and X-rays available for transportation with the casualty? (Check). Does the casualty require a secure airway, intravenous access or fluid resuscitation prior to or during flight? (Ideally, the casualty must be as stable as possible prior to flight). Are all i.v. lines taped and secure. (Check them). Is there sufficient oxygen supply on board for the casualty's(ies) needs to complete the journey and cope with delays? This especially applies if the ventilator is air or oxygen driven. Has the electrical medical equipment required for transportation been cleared for use on the aircraft? (Talk to the aircrew). This equipment may be necessary for in-flight monitoring. Even simple tasks such as counting a pulse rate using the carotid artery, may be impossible in a vibrating airframe. How is the casualty going to be positioned on board the aircraft and does the escort have access? (Find out). If the flight is tactical and at night, the air-crew may be using night vision goggles, can any light be used in the cabin?

One hundred and eleven men attended with a mean age of 62 (range 37-81) years. Information obtained was analysed to determine whether clinical diagnoses and symptoms reported had any relationship to chemical exposures. The diagnoses were not unusual for UK nationals with a mean age of 62 years. The majority of volunteers went to Porton Down in the 1950s and then had a mean age of 19. The mean time between volunteers attending Porton Down and coming to MAP was 42 years. We found no correlation between chemical exposures and later development of established diagnoses, a latent period of 30 years.

For each patient, the pre-hospital practitioner should make individual treatment decisions based on the history and examination, the ECG findings, the facilities and diagnostic equipment available and the transfer time to the nearest appropriate hospital. Patients with acute ischaemic chest pain should have oxygen, aspirin, nitrates and opioid analgesia. A 12 lead ECG should be performed within 5 minutes of initial assessment. If the ECG reveals ST-segment elevation or presumed new LBBB, this signifies acute myocardial infarction and in most cases immediate reperfusion therapy should be considered. The evidence of benefit in terms of mortality and morbidity following prompt anti-platelet and fibrinolytic therapy in such cases is unequivable. Pre-hospital fibrinolysis is now well established and should be undertaken in patients with acute infarction on clinical and ECG grounds if the transfer to hospital is likely to exceed 30 minutes and it is less than 12 hours since the onset of pain. Patients with no ECG evidence of infarction may still be at considerable risk and should still be conveyed to the nearest appropriate medical facility.

It has been shown to improve the outcome after ballistic fractures of the femur, but recently there have been moves to abandon this device in favour of more modern splints such as the Sager splint. This is predominately due to the ease of use and smaller size of newer devices, which makes them more suitable for the pre-hospital environment.

Real-time electronic record maintained of all cases presenting to 22 and 33 Field Hospitals judged to be inappropriately deployed. 50 sequential cases were analysed. 34% were downgraded prior to deployment. Of those who were P2 FE, 85% were judged to have required protection from deployment by down-grading. 20% of all cases had a history of chronic asthma, and of the asthmatics 60% (6\/10) were not downgraded. 18% of all cases were deployed while waiting for secondary care investigation or review that should have ensured protection from deployment. No patient had an existing \"FT\" (forward temperate) or \"LT\" (lines of communication temperate) grading: but in four cases it was predictable that the patient's underlying condition would be adversely affected by deployment to a desert environment. In 5 cases it was identified that the inappropriate deployment could be attributed to clinical management within the civilian sector, with a consequent failure to institute the necessary downgrading process. Review of the medical grading process is needed to protect those soldiers who are awaiting outpatient opinion or definitive diagnosis from investigation, and to provide an employability grading that matches a soldier's fitness for operational role.

Of the 1399 records included, 1033 (74%) required care from a physician, whereas 366 (26%) were treated by surgeons. However, of patients returning to duty in theatre (total 985), 884 (90%) had been treated by physicians and 101 had been treated by surgeons. Notably, only 23 (2%) of these had undergone a surgical procedure. Experience in Oman suggests that the lessons of history in respect of casualties in times of conflict are both unlearned and being repeated.

Twelve (39%) men were under the age of thirty years at the time of their vasectomy, with a mean time to reversal of 4.4 years. Nineteen (61%) were over the age of thirty years at time of the vasectomy and their mean time to reversal was 7.2 years. Where recorded, the reason for requesting a reversal was a change in partner in 90% of men. Men who had their vasectomies before reaching the age of thirty were more likely to undergo reversal in a significantly shorter period of time when compared to those over thirty years. The disseminated criteria for vasectomy should be adhered to and appropriate preoperative counselling by surgeons may be useful.","1404":"Parachuting, be it static line or skydiving, places enormous stresses on the human spine. It is, therefore, important to determine the prevalence and severity of degenerative changes in the lumbar spine of subjects who practice this sport activity. Seventy four parachuting instructors, mean age 33 years and with an average of 410 static line and skydiving jumps, were included in the study. Past radiographs were examined and compared to current anterolateral and lateral views of the lumbar spine, in order to determine the prevalence of degenerative changes and document possible progression. Doubtful radiographic changes in the lumbar spine were identified in 47.4 percent of the parachuting instructors, mild degeneration in 9.6 percent, moderate degenerative disease in 10.9 percent and severe radiographic changes in 5.5 percent. Schmorll nodes were found in 8.1 percent of the subjects. Traction spurs--osteophytes were identified in 6.8 percent. The degenerative changes correlated with age and the number of jumps. Spondylolysis of L5-S1 and L3-L4 segments were observed in 12.2 and 1.4 percent respectively. Progressive spondylolisthesis was found in 2 subjects. No correlation was found between the severity of radiographic changes and either the prevalence and the severity of low back pain. The present findings provide a rational for considering repeated sheer stress as an etiology of degenerative changes in the spinal cord, and as a possible contributing factor to the pathogenesis of spondylolysis. Further study has to be done comparing parachuting instructors to a non-parachuting group, or equivalent physically active individuals, in order to assess the effect of sport-background on the development of degenerative changes.","1405":"Crush Syndrome remains rare in European practice. It is however common in areas of civil disorder and where the normal structures of society have given way to civil war or natural disaster. Western Doctors are becoming increasingly involved in such situations and there is no reason to believe that instances due to more conventional causes, such as collapse in the elderly or road traffic accidents will cease. For all these reasons it is important that clinicians who deal infrequently with crush syndrome have access to appropriate guidelines. This consensus report seeks to provide such advice.","1406":"There are many new methods to treat varicose veins being tried and tested around the world, many using patented techniques. They would appear to demonstrate many of the features a military surgeon might deem beneficial for treating a service population, a rapid return to duties amongst them. There are some significant drawbacks. All of these modalities need to offer long-term evidence of efficacy to demonstrate advantage over current standard. The endovenous therapies utilise expensive equipment that limit their introduction and provide a potential for novel complications as well as novel therapy. Modified sclerotherapy as described here has many advantages; it is incredibly cheap, minimally invasive and easily repeatable--in fact planned re-intervention is used in some protocols. Until long-term results are available, it would seem premature to recommend any of these new treatments for use in service personnel with primary varicose veins. Military vascular surgeons will await these results with interest, as the service population would have much to gain from a modality that reliably treats the veins and ensures a swift return to service.","1407":"","1408":"This is the fourth in a series of papers that review the evolution of the military casualty evacuation during the 20th Century. The previous three papers have looked at the British Army system. This paper looks at the organisation of army medical services from the United States, Israel, Russia and Croatia and compares these with the British Army system reported in the previous papers. All national army medical services have evolved organisations to reduce the time lag between injury and surgery for their wounded. The paper will show that there are some fundamental differences in the organisation of medical units to achieve this aim. Helicopters are almost universally used for the evacuation of seriously ill casualties when this is practicable.","1409":"","1410":"","1411":"Organising a clinical trial is a major undertaking involving a lot of hard work before during and after the study takes place and such trials are one endeavour where there are no short cuts. Cutting corners in an effort to save time, money or effort is usually quite obvious to the assiduous journal reader who will rubbish the conclusions and tarnish one's reputation for scientific validity. By taking time to carefully think through each stage and possible eventuality of ones plans it is possible to avoid many of the stumbling blocks that interfere with the conduct of a successful trial.

Terrorist actions such as the Tokyo subway incident in 1995, coupled with the persistent use of agents such as sulphur mustard and Sarin by the Iraqi regime over the last 20 years in the Iran\/Iraq war and against the Kurds of Northern Iraq, make it easy to think that chemical weapons are a new phenomenon. This paper reminds us that many chemical agents were developed during WWI; indeed the first use of a chemical agent was the release of chlorine gas--a choking agent--by the Germans over the battlefields of Ypres in 1915. Porton Down remains at the very heart of chemicals and biological weapons research, albeit in a purely defensive capacity; few of the old buildings remain and the idyllic lifestyle in the Officer's Mess at Idmiston Manor has long since disappeared. These recollections provide a fascinating insight into scientific research at the time of World War I.","1415":"","1416":"Peacetime assault-related injuries amongst soldiers are common.

The use of biological agents provides a new set of challenges to professional caregivers, emergency personnel and Governments. These agents are generally not readily identified through the senses, have delayed effects and have the power to generate fear and panic. They are also intended to demonstrate that Governments and other organisations are not able to protect their citizens and members. What evidence there is suggests bioterrorist incidents have the potential to create higher levels of psychopathology than physical injury. Therefore, the authorities must identify and rehearse suitable methods of psychoprophylaxis and intervention.","1418":"Viral hepatitis is one of the most common infectious diseases and over the years the jaundice associated with it has been known by many names. Several viruses are now known to cause hepatitis in humans, but sixty years ago, these viruses were unknown. In the years before and during the Second World War, there emerged a significant understanding of the clinical and epidemiological nature of the disease due to the dedicated efforts of doctors and scientists around the world. By the end of the war years, the discrete entities of Hepatitis A and B had been identified and preventative measures were proving to be effective. However, the bane of viral hepatitis was far from being resolved.","1419":"","1420":"Medical Officers are often called to review violent or disturbed soldiers in barracks or in their homes.

It is true that those who have been through a recognised training scheme should pass and failure reflects upon the scheme as well as the candidate, but the consequences of failure are high and fall directly only upon the candidate. Thorough preparation will immensely improve the chances of passing first time and finishing the critical topic reviews well in advance is thoroughly recommended (it would be ideal to do one each year during the first four years of training and then choose the best two for the examination). This will leave time to go through the management books and as many short clinical questions books as possible, those designed for MRCP are especially helpful. While the amount of reading for the critical appraisal section is relatively short it is essential to practice appraising papers and those previously used are most appropriate for this.

Errors in the entry medical assessments for TA personnel were also identified in nearly half (44%) of records examined. Possible solutions are identified through improved education of examining medical officers and by increasing the pre-deployment time available to obtain specialist referrals. A case is also made for having improved access to previous medical information, both to improve the quality of the pre-deployment medical screening and to ensure appropriate continuity of care for deployed TA personnel.","1464":"Radio-opaque markers in penetrating trauma are useful in both the clinical evaluation of the injuries and in the permanent record of the location of the wounds.

We recount the properties of depleted uranium, its military uses and the situations in which personnel may be exposed. Following a review of scientific literature, the health effects of depleted and natural uranium exposure are described and the major outcomes of research into Gulf Veterans' Illnesses are summarised. We conclude that, although there is the potential for uranium exposures to cause renal damage or lung cancer, the risk of harm following depleted uranium exposure in military settings seems to be low. We advise on the management of casualties exposed to depleted uranium and suggest control measures that may be appropriate to protect personnel who provide casualty care.","1471":"","1472":"","1473":"","1474":"This is the first in a series of papers which describe the evolution of the British casualty evacuation system in the 20th Century.

Early ventilation and differentiation of haemorrhagic from neurogenic shock are the key elements of pre-hospital resuscitation specific to spinal injuries. Falls from a significant height, high-impact speed road accidents, blast injuries, direct blunt or penetrating injuries near the spine and other high energy injuries should all be regarded as high risk for spinal injury but clinical examination should determine whether the patient requires full, limited or no spinal immobilisation. Although there is little conclusive evidence in the literature that supports pre-hospital clinical clearance of the spine, the similarities between pre-hospital immobilisation decisions and in-hospital radiography decisions are such that it is likely that clinical clearance will be effective for selected patients. This decision can be made at the scene provided the patient has no evidence of: Altered level of consciousness or mental status Intoxication Neurological symptoms or signs A distracting painful injury (e.g. chest injuries, long bone fracture) Midline spinal pain or tenderness. Where there is evidence to support spinal immobilisation, then the full range of devices and techniques should be considered. In the remote or operational environment where pre-hospital times are prolonged, full immobilisation, analgesia and re-assessment may allow localisation of the injury and a reduction in the degree of immobilisation. Common reasons for missing significant spinal injuries include failing to consider the possibility of spinal injuries in patients who are either unconscious, intoxicated or uncooperative (54,55). The application of the decision rule discussed here will ensure that no clinically significant spinal injuries are missed in pre-hospital care.","1481":"Prevent secondary injury by: Preventing hypoxia, hypercarbia and hypovolaemia.

A pellet had passed completely through the globe but the retina remained attached, and it was decided to manage the case conservatively. Two retained foreign bodies were extruded spontaneously some months after the injury when suture removal and delayed cataract surgery led to a virtually perfect visual outcome. The patient has had no further complications at least three years after initial injury. The management of this civilian case illustrates some basic concepts in treating ballistic eye injuries that may be applicable in a military setting.","1484":"Current pre-hospital trauma triage systems are based mainly on physiological parameters, but in compensated shock injury severity may not be immediately obvious, as the physiological parameters remain normal for some time. Serum lactate, measured in hospital, is known to be a predictor of injury severity and outcome. The technology for easy field lactate measurement has recently become available. We found that capillary lactate is elevated in trauma patients in the early phase of the response to injury. There is a moderate correlation (R2 = 0.44) between early lactate levels and injury severity, in patients who might otherwise be difficult to triage.","1485":"","1486":"Recent changes in the law and in patients' expectations have necessitated alterations to the way doctors maintain the medical confidentiality of their patients.

A ten-member, multiprofessional smoking cessation working group met five times between October 2000 and July 2001 to develop targeted smoking cessation guidelines for use by military health professionals in the clinical setting. The guidelines were based on the best available scientific evidence at that time, mainly systematic review of controlled trials, and individual randomised trials. The agreed military guidelines on smoking cessation were promulgated in July 2001. Three tiers of support were defined. Military health professionals have a key role as nonsmoking models and advocates, and should be trained to use 'brief intervention' at every clinical encounter with a military smoker. 'Intermediate support' (defined as a specialist service delivered by military health professionals who have undergone specific training and continuation training) is to be available at local level. The most heavily addicted military smokers will require referral to civilian smoking cessation clinics. Effective technologies for use at any one of the three levels of care are: nicotine skin patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges and bupropion. These are the first ever clinical guidelines for military use which meet accepted modern quality criteria. Informal monitoring of the uptake of these guidelines between July 2001 to December 2001 suggests that they have been well received by military health professionals. An audit of their impact on smoking patterns within the UK Armed Forces will commence in 2002. The guidelines will be updated 5-yearly, or sooner.

Forty one consecutive patients with 43 mandibular angle fractures were identified. Thirty eight fractures were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with miniplates and 5 by intermaxillary fixation (IMF). Fractures treated with miniplates were reduced under direct vision to give an anatomical reduction without using temporary intermaxillary fixation. The shortened operative time together with the prompt administration of intravenous antibiotics following injury and rapid treatment of fractures after admission resulted in a low complication rate of 7.3% of patients requiring a subsequent surgical procedure. Although IMF has an important role to play in the general treatment of facial fractures, we suggest that there is a place for single miniplate fracture fixation without the use of temporary IMF when treating simple angle fractures. As this technique is quick and has a low complication rate its use in military situations should be considered.","1491":"","1492":"","1493":"","1494":"","1495":"","1496":"","1497":"","1498":"Pre-hospital immediate care for seriously injured children is rarely required, but when it is, the response must be prompt and effective. The key to an effective and confident approach to injured children lies in understanding the age related anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children.

Two major types of abdominal injury may be present in war, blunt and penetrating. In either case, early surgery is essential. With blunt injuries, a high index of suspicion is required. Diagnosis in the early stages may be very difficult. Serial examination is required; even then, evacuate early. Aids to diagnosis include: DPL, FAST, CT Casualties with penetrating injuries must be given the highest priority for evacuation and surgical evaluation. Penetrating injury to the loin, back, buttocks, lower chest and thighs, should raise suspicion of intra-abdominal injury. Management of abdominal injury follows normal BATLS protocol and includes: Primary survey: Remember the A B C D E routine. Resuscitation: This involves: Continued oxygenation Appropriate therapy for hypovolaemic shock (refer to Chapter 5) Continued monitoring of response by assessment of vital signs, aided by additional parameters such as pulse oxymetry and blood gas analysis, when available. Placement of nasogastric tube and bladder catheter. Secondary survey: Following stabilization, but not before, you may proceed to full assessment of the mechanism and location of injury.

This has improved greatly over several decades as a result of battle experience. This article highlights the value of civilian gunshot experience and its possible use in the military setting. The standard principles of rectal examination, followed by proctosigmoidoscopy after initial resuscitation, remain unchanged. Thereafter, the surgical decisions are made at laparotomy. Rectal injuries commonly have other injuries in association which must also be dealt with. In the stable patient rectal repair may be possible. Where repair is hazardous due to extensive injury (rectum or adjacent structures), the well-proven protective colostomy is used. A loop colostomy with or without distal closure is effective and is used to protect most injuries; possible exceptions being injuries dealt with early, in which there is minimal contamination and repair is easy. Presacral drainage can generally be reserved for severely destructive wounds or those in which repair has not been done. Rectal washout remains an option in patients with inspissated faeces. The basic military surgical principles remain valid, their extent and degree of implementation depending on the anatomical location of injury, degree of damage and any delay in presentation to surgery.","1506":"The speed and altitude at which modern military aircraft operate are such that escape can only be achieved by some means of forcibly propelling the aircrew clear of the aircraft. The most common method of doing this is by use of an ejection seat. The use of such seats, whilst generally life saving, exposes aircrew to forces that may be at the limits of human tolerance. Each phase of the ejection sequence is associated with characteristic injury patterns and of particular concern is the occurrence of spinal compression fractures, which are caused by the upward acceleration of the ejection seat. Thorough investigation of aircrew who eject is necessary and magnetic resonance imaging of the spines of these aircrew is now becoming mandatory. Aircrew who sustain stable anterior wedge compression fractures usually require no invasive treatment, but are prevented from flying aircraft fitted with ejection seats for 3-4 months.","1507":"To evaluate the Sonosite 180 handheld ultrasound in the diagnosis of haemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma.

Many of the historical arguments used for and against the practice remain valid today. Indeed, any form of discussion on the subject often provokes emotive responses, both from members of the medical profession and the general public. For this reason alone, the issue will continue to be debated at all levels of society. There are, however, other factors that ensure euthanasia will remain a subject of major controversy within medical, legal and governmental bodies. Firstly, the act of euthanasia itself is illegal, yet in its passive form occurs on a daily basis in many of our hospitals (1). Secondly, medical advances have made it possible to artificially prolong the life of an increasing number of patients far beyond what was possible only a few years ago. Furthermore, we must all contend with the reality that financial constraints are an important consideration in modern health care provision. Finally, there is an ethical difficulty in interpreting the concept of a patient's right, or autonomy, versus the rights and duty of a doctor. Before attempting to answer the questions posed by these issues, it is important to have some accurate definitions of both euthanasia and of the concept of morality. According to the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics, the precise definition of euthanasia is \"a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering\" (2). The term can be further divided into voluntary and involuntary euthanasia. The former is said to occur if a competent patient makes an informed request for a life terminating event and the latter can be used if a patient does not give informed and specific consent for such treatment. It is the occurrence of involuntary euthanasia which forms one of the main arguments against legalisation. This is discussed in greater detail below. Euthanasia is frequently separated into active and passive forms. A number of authors consider these terms to be misleading and unhelpful. They are, however, used in the literature and in discussion and consequently should be understood. Active euthanasia takes place if deliberate steps are taken to end a patient's life; this would include administration of potassium containing compounds to induce cardiac arrest, a practice that is illegal in this country. Passive euthanasia is the withholding of treatments necessary for the continuance of life. Whether the administration of increasingly necessary, albeit toxic doses of opioid analgesia is regarded as active or passive euthanasia is a matter of moral interpretation, but in order to pacify doctors' consciences, it is usually regarded as a passive measure. Many people, therefore, regard it as an acceptable facet of good professional practice.","1515":"","1516":"","1517":"","1518":"Case reports are often seen as a relatively easy way of getting published. Despite this, much wasted time and effort on the part of authors, reviewers and editors might be saved if intending authors followed some simple guidelines before committing themselves to paper. The rejection rate for case reports is extremely high. There are two main reasons for this: inappropriate case selection and inadequate attention to detail in case preparation.

Pre-hospital anaesthesia is a highly skilled technique that requires considerable training and experience.

As part of a wider programme to enhance the health surveillance capabilities of the Defence Medical Services, a project was undertaken to assess the collection and retention of data for exposure assessment in the United Kingdom's Armed Forces. The systems investigated include those for health, safety and environment policy, personnel and pay, medical records, environmental and occupational monitoring and historical records. It was found that the use of many systems for exposure assessment would be hampered by inconsistencies in the data collected, poor accessibility and linkage, and variability in the retention of the data. This paper highlights some of the problems that limit the usefulness of the record systems for exposure assessment and summarizes the principal recommendations made for enhancing the systems to better facilitate health surveillance.","1527":"This study, a retrospective review of the orthopaedic outpatient work from a multinational hospital in Bosnia, further confirms the dangers of sport on an operational tour.

Diseases prevalent included typhus, tuberculosis, nutritional and infective diarrhoea, severe malnutrition and starvation, and others. Despite huge obstacles including the ongoing war effort, shortages of supplies, and limited numbers of workers, a relief operation was rapidly organized to control the typhus epidemic and salvage as many inmates as possible. The 10,000 emaciated corpses which had been lying all over the camp were collected and buried in mass graves. Inmates were disinfected with D.D.T., scrubbed in a \"human laundry,\" and evacuated from the typhus-ridden Horror Camp (Camp 1) to a hospital organized in the barracks of the Panzer Training School (Camp 2). Feeding of the inmates was carefully regulated, and some basic medical treatment organized. The relief operation was performed by British Army units, detachments of the British Red Cross, British and Belgian medical students, and other volunteers including those from among the less debilitated inmates. Although 13,000 inmates died after the liberation despite the relief operation, thousands of others were rescued.","1530":"To bring military medical problems concerning malaria to the attention of the Defence Medical Services.

The use of qualified OH nurses based at GP group practices and providing a visiting service to units would rectify this balance as this would enable workplace assessments to be carried out on a regular basis, enhance the ability to carry out occupational health assessments and facilitate health surveillance data collection.

The risks during combat are well recognised, but the handling of fuel, oil, munitions and other hot or flammable materials during peacetime deployment and training also imposes an inherent risk of accidental burn injury. Over the last hundred years, the burn threat in combat has ranged from nuclear weapons to small shoulder-launched missiles. Materials such as napalm and white phosphorus plainly present a risk of burn, but the threat extends to encompass personnel in vehicles attacked by anti-armour weapons, large missiles, fuel-air explosives and detonations\/conflagrations on weapons platforms such as ships. Large numbers of burn casualties were caused at Pearl Harbor, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Vietnam, during the Arab\/Israeli Wars and in the Falkland Islands conflict. The threat from burns is unlikely to diminish, indeed new developments in weapons seek to exploit the vulnerability of the serviceman and servicewoman to burns. Clothing can be a barrier to some types of burn--both inherently in the properties of the material, but also by trapping air between clothing layers. Conversely, ignition of the clothing may exacerbate a burn. There is hearsay that burnt clothing products within a wound may complicate the clinical management, or that materials that melt (thermoplastic materials) should not be worn if there is a burn threat. This paper explores the incidence of burn injury, the mechanisms of heat transfer to bare skin and skin covered by materials, and the published evidence for the complication of wound management by materials. Even light-weight combat clothing can offer significant protection to skin from short duration flash burns; the most vulnerable areas are the parts of the body not covered--face and hands. Multilayered combat clothing can offer significant protection for short periods from engulfment by flames; lightweight tropical wear with few layers offers little protection. Under high heat loads in the laboratory, combat clothing can ignite, but there is little evidence that clothing ignition is a common occurrence in military burn casualties. Thermoplastic materials have many benefits in civil and military clothing. There is little objective evidence that they exacerbate burns, or complicate burn management. Their use in military clothing must be based on objective evidence, not hearsay.","1562":"Behind Armour Blunt Trauma (BABT) is the non-penetrating injury resulting from the rapid deformation of armours covering the body. The deformation of the surface of an armour in contact with the body wall arises from the impact of a bullet or other projectile on its front face. The deformation is part of the retardation and energy absorbing process that captures the projectile. In extreme circumstances, the BABT may result in death, even though the projectile has not perforated the armour. An escalation of the available energy of bullets and the desire of armour designers to minimise the weight and bulk of personal armour systems will increase the risk of BABT in military and security forces personnel. In order to develop materials that can be interposed between the armour and the body wall to attenuate the transfer of energy into the body, it is essential that the mechanism of BABT is known. There is a great deal of activity within UK and NATO to unravel the interactions; the mechanism is likely to be a combination of stress (pressure) waves generated by the rapid initial motion of the rear of the armour, and shear deformation to viscera produced by gross deflection of the body wall. Physical and computer model systems are under development to characterise the biophysical processes and provide performance targets for materials to be placed between armours and the body wall in order to attenuate the injuries (trauma attenuating backings-TABs). The patho-physiological consequences of BABT are being clarified by research, but the injuries will have some of the features of blunt chest trauma observed in road traffic accidents and other forms of civilian blunt impact injury. The injuries also have characteristics of primary blast injury. An overview diagnosis and treatment is described.","1563":"Over the last decade a large number of weapon systems have appeared that use blast as their primary damage mechanism. This is a notable trend; until recently very few warheads relied on blast as their primary output. Most warheads in service use explosives to drive metal such as fragments and shaped charge jets to engage targets. New technologies are now being integrated into warheads that claim to have enhanced blast performance. Blast weapons could have been designed to fill a gap in capability; they are generally used for the attack of 'soft' targets including personnel, both in the open and within protective structures. With the increased number and range of these weapons, it is likely that UK forces will have to face them in future conflicts. This paper briefly describes fuel-air explosive blast weapons and reviews a range of enhanced blast weapons that have been developed recently. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the reasons why enhanced blast technologies may be proliferating and how this could affect the Defence Medical Services.","1564":"","1565":"This paper reviews new and emerging weapons systems targeted directly or indirectly against personnel. It distinguishes emerging technologies that may form the basis of usable weapons in the next 10 years, from the speculations and aspirations of weapons designers, and identifies six groups of weapons systems which will present significant new or changing threats to UK forces. The article combines this information with knowledge of biophysical interactions and clinical effects, to identify possible consequences for the DMS in terms of types, patterns and numbers of casualties. Ballistic threats will continue to be the most common casualty-producing mechanism for servicemen in any environment.","1566":"Penetrating trauma is on the increase as a result of interpersonal violence throughout the world. It is essential that military surgeons are familiar with such injuries and trained not only in the principles of their management, but also have first-hand operative experience before deployment in the field of conflict. More often than not, this experience is to be gained in the civilian urban setting in countries such as South Africa and the USA. The article addresses the first requirement--the principles of management--and outlines basic measures to enable those unfamiliar with penetrating wounds of the torso to make a reasonable and directed approach to dealing with these patients. It does not attempt to give definitive advice on specific injuries. It is organised according to anatomical regions, but emphasises that this is only in order to put shape to the article; penetrating injuries frequently having no respect for anatomical boundaries. Particular attention is drawn to difficult areas such as mediastinal injuries, and to modern concepts of 'damage control' surgery and the 'abdominal compartment syndrome'. The emphasis throughout is on how to get out of trouble and where particular danger spots may be anticipated. Reference will be made to the differences that may be expected within the military environment as opposed to the civilian setting, where rapid and (usually) safe evacuation to a well-equipped secure facility may not be possible. The article aims to raise the awareness of those involved in the care of patients with penetrating wounds of the torso that a methodical approach with a practised team of experienced individuals can salvage injuries which at first sight may seem terrifying or hopeless.","1567":null,"1568":"Military surgical doctrine has traditionally taught that all ballistic wounds should be formally managed by surgical intervention. There is now, however, both experimental and clinical evidence supporting the nonoperative treatment of selected small fragment wounds. Low energy-transfer wounds affecting the soft tissues, without neuro-vascular compromise and with stable fracture patterns, may be suitable for early antibiotic treatment. The management of ballistic wounds to the gastrointestinal tract requires surgical intervention but, advances in the treatment of these wounds, especially those involving the colon, may allow more effective treatment with a reduced morbidity.","1569":"","1570":"The paper defines and describes blast waves, their interaction with a structure and its subsequent response. Explosions generate blast waves, which need not be due to explosives. A blast wave consists of two parts: a shock wave and a blast wind. The paper explains how shock waves are formed and their basic properties. The physics of blast waves is non-linear and therefore non-intuitive. To understand how an explosion generates a blast wave a numerical modelling computer code, called a hydrocode has to be employed. This is briefly explained and the cAst Eulerian hydrocode is used to illustrate the formation and propagation of the blast wave generated by a 1 kg sphere of TNT explosive detonated 1 m above the ground. The paper concludes with a discussion of the response of a structure to a blast wave and shows that this response is governed by the structures natural frequency of vibration compared to the duration of the blast wave. The basic concepts introduced are illustrated in a second simulation that introduces two structures into the blast field of the TNT charge.","1571":"","1572":"","1573":"","1574":"","1575":"We enjoyed a very low level of DNBI during our deployment and no soldier had to be returned to the UK on medical grounds.

This may be because the operation is thought to be traumatic with a risk of epistaxis and periorbital haematoma. Since 1992 rhinoplasty surgery at St George's hospital has been routinely performed on a planned day case basis. The hospital records of 97 patients were examined of which 17 patients (18%) underwent planned admission and 12 (12%) unplanned admission. No patients were re-admitted to hospital after discharge. With the advances in day case surgical practice within the UK we consider that the practice of day case rhinoplasty is likely to have its place. Such surgery should ideally be performed in a dedicated day case unit and provision for admission overnight should be available.","1583":"Military service requires individuals who are free from ill-health and who are physically and mentally robust, and throughout history those who have become unfit for service have been discharged on medical grounds. This paper uses published historical records to examine trends in the rate of discharge for six key conditions for the period 1861-1998 and to draw conclusions. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and syphilis were a major problem together with ill-defined conditions such as \"disordered action of the heart\". By the mid-20th century, psychiatric and gastrointestinal disorders had become the principal causes of medical discharge, whereas in the late 20th century, the majority of discharges resulted from injuries and musculoskeletal disorders. The pattern of conditions leading to medical discharge from the Army tends to mirror conditions which are prevalent at that time in the civilian population.","1584":"246 surgical operations were performed in a UK Field Hospital over an eight month period during Op AGRICOLA in 1999. Whilst there were many injuries caused by military weaponry, non-conflict related injuries were also common. Sixteen laparotomies were performed, nine for mine and gunshot injuries, seven were for 'peacetime' causes. Four extremity external fixators were applied--three after high energy transfer fragment wounds to bone and one after a road traffic accident. One pelvic external fixator was applied. Six limbs were amputated, three in one child. Eight split-skin grafts and three local flaps were performed. Wound debridements (including delayed primary suture), of which half were due to fragment and bullet wounds to non-vital structures, were the most common operation performed. Of the 246 consecutive operations analysed, 91 were performed solely by the orthopaedic surgeon. There were 29 combined cases where one surgeon actively assisted the other. 146 operations were performed on local civilians. A consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a consultant general surgeon along with experienced anaesthetic and operating theatre staff remains the combination best suited to provide medical support to future military operations of this kind.","1585":"We audited a total of 1233 patients scheduled for elective cataract extraction or trabeculectomy using peri-bulbar anaesthesia. A bolus of propofol provided sedation to cover insertion of the block. During an initial two-year period we collected data on the amount of propofol used to sedate 481 patients. Multiple linear regression analysis was then used to obtain an equation to link the dose used to age and weight in those who were adequately sedated. The dose of propofol in milligrams was calculated as 56 + 0.25 x weight (kg) - 0.53 x age (yrs). We subsequently assessed the effectiveness of this formula at abolishing recall of the injections whilst not compromising the airway on a further 752 patients. This simple regime was effective at abolishing recall of the block in 78.6% of the patients studied and avoids the cost and logistic implications of more complicated drug delivery systems. Use of the formula does not significantly alter the incidence of recall compared to sedation provided by an experienced ophthalmic anaesthetist. We hope it will provide a guide for more junior anaesthetists to obtain the satisfactory sedation level that comes with experience.","1586":"To determine the outcome of anthrax immunisation. Adverse reactions (occurrence, nature, severity and incapacity) and immune responses to a voluntary programme of anthrax immunisation at 0, 3, 6, and 24 weeks were monitored by questionnaire and voluntary blood sampling in 129 members, including 24 immunised 7 years previously (immunes), of a military field hospital alerted for possible deployment. Follow-up was complete in 85%. Ninety-eight (76%) received the first anthrax immunisation. Uptake was greater (p = 0.015) in immunes. Initial prevalence of adverse reaction was 63%. Subsequent uptake and adverse reaction dwindled significantly (p &lt; 0.001). Only 28 (22%) were immunised at 24 weeks. Proportions reporting adverse reactions following the initial immunisation were greater in immunes (p = 0.046) and officers (p = 0.02). There was no significant (p = 0.36) correlation between uptake of immunisation and prevalence of adverse reaction. Antecedent adverse reaction did not reduce the proportion of participants accepting immunisation subsequently. The nature of adverse reactions (47% local, 24% systemic and 27% both) and severity were the same throughout. Forty-five percent of adverse reactions caused incapacity. Seventy-four percent of these had pain in the injected arm (+\/- systemic symptoms) which prevented lifting or driving for 48 hours in 63%. Immune responses were greater in immunes. It was concluded that anthrax immunisation results in a higher than expected prevalence of adverse reaction with initial incapacity of military significance affecting 18%. Greater immune responses may increase adverse reaction but this does not affect acceptance of anthrax immunisation. Poor completion rates necessitate development of a new anthrax immunisation strategy.

Laparotomy for major trauma involves dissipation of heat and massive blood loss requiring replacement. The result is a vicious cycle of hypothermia, acidosis and coagulopathy leading to death from an irreversible physiological insult (62). The damage control concept places surgery as an integral part of the resuscitative process, rather than an end in itself, and recognises that outcomes after major trauma are determined by the physiological limits of the patient, rather than by efforts of anatomical restoration by the surgeon.

Two study groups comprising of civilian and Armed Forces families were identified from livebirths delivered between 1 January-30 June 1996 within the Northallerton Health district which includes Catterick Garrison and RAF Leeming. The participants were the parents of babies delivered at a District General Hospital, comprising of 436 civilian and 162 Armed Forces families. A new classification method was successfully used to assign Registrar General's social classification to Armed Forces personnel. Comparison of the two study groups showed a significant difference in social class distribution (p = 0.0001). This study has devised a new method for classifying occupations within the Armed Forces to categories of social class thus permitting comparison with Registrar General's classification. ","1600":"Snoring is a common problem, which may have widespread medical and social implications. This is particularly true in the setting of the armed forces where snoring may have significant effects in terms of personal performance, social interaction and security. This paper discusses the general management of snoring in the military environment and in particular the clinical effectiveness of one surgical procedure, uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. In this study, the procedure proves to be an effective surgical option in the management of snoring.","1601":"The Unified Emergency Care System (UECS) provides an integrated system of medical support from point of injury to the time a casualty is handed over to specialist care within hospital. It enables personnel at all skill levels to deliver life-saving support to casualties with a broad range of acute injuries and illness. The UECS facilitates standardised training with each level building upon the previous, yet it retains an inherent flexibility to adapt to specific operational and service requirements.","1602":"Several different imaging techniques are available for evaluating the rotator cuff and biceps tendon. The common disorders of impingement, rotator cuff tears and biceps tendonitis are discussed along with the role which the various imaging modalities can play in establishing their diagnosis. Plain radiographs can be helpful particularly with a history of trauma but give limited information on the soft tissues. Ultrasound is a useful and inexpensive means of assessing the rotator cuff and biceps tendon but has a number of limitations and varying reports on its accuracy. Computed tomography (CT) is most helpful in the evaluation of shoulder trauma but gives limited information on the soft tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an accurate imaging modality for evaluating the rotator cuff and biceps tendon, allowing visualisation of the soft tissues and the adjacent bony structures.","1603":"This paper describes the use of the J97 Health Surveillance System to monitor the effects of exposure to atmospheric pollution on the health of the Army population in Brunei. It shows that the J97 Health Surveillance tool is adaptable and can be used to rapidly set up a population-based health surveillance system.","1604":"We present an advanced battlefield analgesia protocol that is designed to provide the maximum benefit for the greatest number of patients using the minimum of resources. During the development we considered logistics, drug pharmacology and safety, aetiology of the pain and the experience of the expected administrator. Analgesia is only considered after the \"ABCD\" criteria of the Primary Survey have been satisfied. The analgesics administered range from enteral nonopioids through to intravenous opioids based dynamically upon the Visual Analogue Score (VAS). We suggest this protocol could be used by healthcare workers who may not have been trained in acute pain management but are called to administer analgesia to the serviceman in pain.","1605":"","1606":"","1607":"","1608":"The history of laparotomy for penetrating abdominal wounds is reviewed from its origins in the sixteenth century to the large series from World War II. It is shown that the mass casualties of World War I allowed the management of organ specific injuries to be studied. This review concentrates upon one of the most contentious topics in war surgery-the management of colonic wounds, and suggests that post-war surgical practice may have been influenced too strongly by experiences from the pre-Penicillin era.","1609":"Synchronous genital tract neoplasms constitute a more common clinical problem than would be generally expected. This case focuses on mixed mullerian tumours and postulates a mechanism for an increased incidence found associated with synchronous genital tract neoplasms.","1610":"","1611":"The South Africans are keen to adopt the Major Incident Medical Management and Support course, developed in the UK. South Africa can provide an excellent training ground for military personnel in the triage, resuscitation and surgical management of the patient with penetrating trauma. Johannesburg General Hospital has a high quality training system under the direction of Dr Ken Boffard. The nearby Baragwaneth Hospital is the closest to military surgical practice one can probably get in a civilian setting. There is an unprecedented opportunity for clinical skills training, and a wealth of research opportunities.","1612":"One hundred years ago, apart from the treatment of war injuries, the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea was the dominant preoccupation of the deployed military doctor. Since, then our understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of enteric disease has developed exponentially and our armamentarium for the treatment of enteric diseases has expanded considerably. However, diarrhoea continues to be the dominant military medical concern in deployed units. Here, we examine the evidence for this, discuss the reasons why and critically evaluate current modes of prevention and treatment that are now available to the military medical officer.","1613":"Anterior knee pain syndrome is a common condition in the military population. Current management is moving away from surgery as the most effective treatment, towards prolonged specific physiotherapy to recondition the extensor mechanism, especially the Vastus Medialis Obliquus (VMO) component of the quadriceps.","1614":"As part of the Cochrane Collaboration's international research endeavour, the authors carried out a handsearch of the RAMC Journal from 1948 to 1998, searching for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs). Ten trials were identified, of which 6 were RCTs and 4 were CCTs. The first trial was published in 1967. Four of the 10 identified trials were in the field of respiratory medicine, and 2 were in obstetrics and gynaecology. Of the 10 trials, only 3 had been found through a rigorous interrogation of Medline. The 7 newly identified trials were reported to the UK Cochrane Centre, and summary details of these trials were entered into Medline for use by clinicians and investigators in the future.","1615":"This Hepatitis A seroprevalence study aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of Hepatitis A vaccination for Gurkha soldiers. One hundred and sixty Gurkha recruits had serum analysed for Hepatitis A IgG. One hundred and fifty nine (99.4%) were IgG positive. Continuing to vaccinate Gurkha soldiers against Hepatitis A will confer little benefit and is not cost effective.","1616":"This paper examines the requirement for health surveillance systems for military forces. Military health surveillance is the routine systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of standardised, population based data for the purpose of characterising and countering threats to the military population's health, well-being and performance. The components of a health surveillance system should enable concurrent or retrospective analysis of health effects in military personnel using a cohort study design. Military hazards include trauma, infection, toxic effects, radiation, psychological stress and ergonomic stress. Variations in distribution of the hazard, distribution of the population, fragility of the cohort, and the variation in the duration and magnitude of exposure complicate definition of the exposed cohort. The measurement of biological effect is complicated by limits in knowledge about the relationship between exposure to the hazard and effect. A biological model that explains detection, causality, pathological process and health effect should support this knowledge. Lastly the definition of health effect needs to consider the difference between clinical activity rates and true measures of health outcome. The UK has a number of health surveillance systems including sentinel reporting, a population-based primary care reporting system and measures of medical discharge and death. The US Army is developing IT-based surveillance systems to link hazard, personnel and medical databases. The paper suggests a conceptual model for such a system in the UK military.","1617":"Tissue glues are in widespread use in Accident &amp; Emergency departments, and are simple to use. Results of closure of uncomplicated wounds using glue are comparable to traditional methods such as suture, 'sterile strips'. There are certain times in the field situation where evacuation of a casualty with a simple laceration could be impossible. These circumstances could be suitable for an individual suitably trained to effect wound closure using a tissue glue. This study simply set out to establish whether it was possible to train an infantry soldier how and when to close a wound using a tissue glue. A short period of instruction was followed by a practical session using wound simulators. It was found that the theoretical concepts and practical skills required to successfully glue a simulated wound were readily acquired by infantry soldiers, irrespective of their previous level of first aid training. The authors suggest that this concept should be pursued with the aim of field trials of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives being carried out.","1618":"The military and some civilian rescue agencies have a requirement for portable ventilators in the anaesthetic, resuscitation and pre-hospital environment. This paper describes two new portable ventilators specifically designed to satisfy the military requirement for lightweight, robust and versatile equipment which can also be used in a contaminated environment.","1619":"conservative approach to splenic trauma has been practised in many countries. Haemodynamically stable patients who have been carefully assessed clinically and radiographically may safely be treated non-operatively. In those patients who require surgery the spleen may be preserved by splenorrhaphy or partial splenectomy. This approach has been practised at our hospital and we present our experience over seven years to show that expectant treatment of splenic injury following trauma is safe.","1620":"Emergency medicine is increasingly compartmentalised. The Unified Emergency Care System (UECS) requires the user to consider every option for emergency care for each patient, in a logical manner that transcends these artificial compartments and recognises the relative priority of concomitant medical, surgical, environmental and toxicological problems. The system is presented as a series of icons, allowing considerations to be made at a glance. Drop shadows refer the user to detailed management protocols for specific conditions. The system follows the logical sequence of quick history, quick look, primary survey with resuscitation and secondary survey. Established management principles of airway-breathing-circulation-disability (ABCD) are incorporated. The complexity of the management algorithms increases from first aider through medic, paramedic, and primary care physician to emergency physician. The stepwise care facilitates seamless immediate medical care between providers, teamwork, and the development of a structured series of training programmes.","1621":"First aid training for the trained soldier has been modified to incorporate the best available current clinical evidence and clinical experience. This annual training requirement will be achieved in one day and is introduced as Individual Training Directive (Army) 3 (ITD(A) 3) on 1 April 1999. With the exception of a short introductory video, the course is entirely taught and assessed on practical models. ITD(A) 3 teaches a systematic approach to every incident and to each injured soldier. This is presented in a robust, waterproof pocket aide memoire of Battlefield First Aid Drills, which is an individual issue item. The soldier must start with the MASTER DRILL to control the incident, and will then follow the INJURED SOLDIER DRILL to identify and treat life-threatening injuries. The best available clinical experience has resulted in the replacement of the three-sided dressing with the Asherman Chest Seal for open pneumothorax, and the introduction of a simple physiology based triage system. The best available clinical evidence has led to the removal of basic life support in the context of a soldier with no vital signs on the battlefield. It is retained as an 'add on' package for peace and peace-keeping environments.","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"","1626":"","1627":"Helicopter Casevac in the British Army is examined in the context of published work in the area and the perspective of the Army Air Corps (AAC) experience. The system by which a casualty on the ground becomes a Casevac is explored, from tasking by the medical services, through to acceptance and launch by the Air Corps. The problems involved are discussed and some potential answers suggested, the aim being to produce a safer system for patients, pilots and medics.","1628":"","1629":"We report a short case series of 5 servicemen who had sustained closed clavicular fractures, 4 of whom presented to our clinic with a painful non-union, and 1 required primary fixation for tenting of the skin. Our treatment consisted of open reduction and internal fixation of these non-unions. This resulted in all these men returning to duties with painfree shoulder girdles within 6 months. A complication in these cases was one of a prominent plate which rubbed on straps and required removal of the plate after union had occurred resulting once again in a painfree shoulder girdle and a return to full duties. We advocate early orthopaedic referral in cases of painful clavicular non-union and where appropriate, open reduction and internal fixation with the expectation of an early return to full duties with a pain free shoulder girdle.","1630":"Over the period 15\/16 April 1998 a commemorative dinner and study period was held to recognise the role of the medical services in the management of the victims of the Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp. Having been presented with a framework for planning medical support to these situations, one of the London medical students at Belsen in 1945 related his own experience at this unprecedented and horrific scene. Following this, the lessons that may be drawn were examined, the key factor being the need to create order out of chaos. The system used by the military for analysing what has to be achieved in a given situation, and the deductions that can be made from the prevailing factors, called the Estimate Process, emerged as a model for planning the medical contribution to disaster relief.","1631":"","1632":"Based on comparison between data obtained on medical discharges from the Army due to asthma for 1985 and for 1994-1995, this study shows that the current Army policy on asthma and recruiting is effective but could be improved. Plans aimed at improving the current screening programme are introduced.","1633":"An epidemiological review was carried out of all known cases of malaria involving British soldiers between 1982-1996. Hospital records of 213 confirmed cases of malaria were obtained from the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA). More than half of the infections (52%) occurred as a result of military training in Kenya and 74% of these were due to Plasmodium falciparum which is potentially life-threatening. Mefloquine has been used as chemoprophylaxis by the British Army in Kenya since 1993 and the implications of this are discussed. There were no deaths in the series but malaria nevertheless remains a serious threat to the health of the British Soldier. The importance of adherence to chemoprophylaxis and of simple bite avoidance measures must continue to be emphasised.","1634":"The middle turbinate is often carefully preserved at Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS). However there is no clear understanding of its importance and its presence may prevent good access to the middle meatus to the detriment of the surgical result. In addition its bulk may cause symptoms of nasal obstruction and prevent paranasal sinus drainage. Adhesions and stenosis have been reported at the middle meatus following its preservation. We undertook a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients all of whom underwent resection of the anterior half of the middle turbinate at the time of Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery. The patients were asked to complete a symptom score sheet before and ten weeks after surgery. The parameters considered were nasal obstruction, nasal congestion, discharge, facial pain and headache. Non parametric analysis of the results indicated a significant improvement in all patient symptom scores and no postoperative complications were noted. We conclude that partial resection of the middle turbinate is a useful modification of accepted endoscopic sinus surgery techniques.","1635":"This paper looks at the concept of the indigenous healer and draws on experiences of those closely involved with the progress of one soldier who, after feeling unwell, believed he was destined to become a shaman. Initially treated by Western methods, which failed to resolve his situation, he returned to Nepal to consult with the local traditional healers. He spent six weeks in Nepal and was seen by three different types of local shamans. Upon his return to Britain he claimed to be free of symptoms and returned to his normal military duties.","1636":"This paper measures the prevalence of psychological symptoms in two British Infantry battalions, 36 months after being involved in peace keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia during November 1992-April 1993. Those deployed had a high level of post traumatic stress disorder (16%) compared to (9%) in the control group. However, there was a high level of probable psychiatric disorder in both the Bosnia and control group of around 25%. The possible explanations for these findings are discussed.","1637":"On Thursday 8 January 1998, a Czech Hip helicopter with 21 personnel on board crashed in Bos Krupa, northwest Bosnia, resulting in one of the largest mass casualty incidents involving peacekeepers in Bosnia since conflict broke out there in 1992. Seventeen patients were airlifted from the scene to the British Hospital Squadron in Sipovo, central Bosnia for resuscitation and initial treatment. The next day, six severely injured patients underwent aeromedical evacuation to the Central Military Hospital in Prague. The role of the British Defence Medical Services in this incident was documented in the first article of this two part series. This second article highlights the role of the Czech medical services following aeromedical evacuation of these six patients, and closes the audit trial by documenting the patients' progress and final outcome in Prague.","1638":"","1639":"","1640":"The Boer War acted as a catalyst for military reform, including reform of the Army Medical Services (AMS). The subsequent medical debate was centred on the value of sanitation as a provision for war.

Prior to a visit to her grandparents in Ethiopia, she received 250 mg chloroquine weekly as a prophylaxis against malaria. Three weeks thereafter, she developed sharply demarcated depigmented areas on the face, especially in the periorbital area. On returning home to Norway the medication was discontinued, and after a few weeks the first signs of repigmentation were noticed. Eight months after cessation of therapy, almost complete repigmentation had been achieved. Complete repigmentation was observed one year after the cessation of chloroquine-therapy.","1642":"Two portable battery powered pulse oximeters were tested on Joint Services expeditions to the Sahara Desert and the Andes mountains. Their ability to measure changes in pulse, oxygen saturation of arterial haemoglobin (SaO2), their durability, ease of use, power systems and ancillary equipment were therefore evaluated in two extreme conditions. Although durable, easy to use and with good monitoring equipment, the batteries failed in extreme cold and the integral printer was too fragile for field use.","1643":"The features and mechanism of Acute Acoustic Trauma (AAT) together with available treatments are discussed and the current guidelines in use by the Bundeswehr are also presented.","1644":"During 1995 the incidence of training related injuries to cadets at RMAS increased markedly. This paper quantifies the numbers placed on the Y List and removed from training, and those medically discharged. The main identified causes were drill, weight carriage, endurance training and lack of sleep. The training programme was modified including alterations in footwear, length and timing of physical periods and a reduction in weight carriage. Following these changes there was a highly significant fall in Y Listing from January 1996 and subsequent medical discharge.","1645":"The management of 131 civilians with war injuries, treated at the Department of Surgery, Pozega County Hospital, during the 1991-1995 period is presented. The majority of 55 (42%) of patients were injured at the front line. There were 75 (57.3%) of patients with explosive injuries 67 (51.2%) involved the extremities, while 29 (22.1%) involved the head. Seven (5.3%) patients died. Amputation of part of an extremity was required in five (3.8%) patients.","1646":"There is concern that the helmet display unit (HDU) used by AH-64 Apache helicopter pilots might contribute to facial injury in a crash. The US Army accident database was searched for HDU-related injuries in survivable Apache accidents 1985-1995. Four aviators in three crashes sustained HDU-related injury. These involved three periorbital contusions and two minor eye injuries. There were no sequelae. This equates to an incidence of 0.57 injured individuals per 100,000 flying hours or 8.0 injured aviators per 100 survivable Class A-C accidents in which the HDU was worn. Applying these data to the projected UK Army Apache flying hour programme suggests that one HDU-related injury might be encountered approximately every 10.1 years. This estimate should be interpreted with caution. Serious injury remains a possibility due to the proximity of the HDU to the eye and face.","1647":"Hydatid disease of the liver is highly prevalent in oriental countries including Turkey, in which their population live mostly in rural areas. The outcome of surgical methods used in the management of a cystic cavity in patients with hepatic hydatid disease was evaluated. Three hundred and forty consecutive patients who presented to Department of General Surgery between 1988 and 1996 with hepatic hydatid disease were reviewed retrospectively. In the first group surgical methods without drainage such as cystectomy (n = 11), capitonnage (n = 55), omentoplasty (n = 91) and capitonnage + omentoplasty (n = 53), in the second group surgery with drainage such as external drainage (n = 74), internal drainage (n = 7), and combined methods (n = 21) were applied. Symptoms, physical findings, types of surgical management, complication rate, hospitalisation period, mortality and recurrence rates were evaluated. Complication rate, average hospitalisation period, recurrence and mortality rates were 12.5%, 9.5 days, 9.9% and 0% respectively in patients without drainage and 63.7%, 26.5 days, 12.7% and 0.9% respectively in patients with drainage. It is concluded that surgical treatment of hydatid disease of the liver without drainage decreases postoperative complication rate and average hospitalisation period, and drainage or nondrainage of cystic cavity has no effect on recurrence.","1648":"We monitored outpatient waiting times at UK military hospitals over an 18-month period (September 1996-March 1998). The highest mean waiting times for Consultant appointment were in urology (19 weeks) and orthopaedics (18 weeks). The lowest mean waiting times were in psychiatry (3 weeks), ENT surgery (5 weeks) and rheumatology (6 weeks). Waiting times for surgical specialties were around 50% higher than for medical specialties. The inter-hospital variability in waiting times was 260%. Military waiting list initiatives were introduced in 4 key specialties, but the majority of these initiatives only had a temporary impact in reducing outpatient waiting times. Waiting times reflect the accessibility of a hospital's services, and are a crude but easily measured indicator of one aspect of patient care. With a military population base, outpatient waiting times should be reduced to the lowest practicable level. The keys to achieving a long-term reduction in waiting times are proper staffing levels and the efficient management of clinics.","1649":"In January 1998 a telemedicine link was established between the Hospital Squadron (from 22 Field Hospital) in Sipovo, Bosnia and the Royal Hospital Haslar, United Kingdom (UK). This link uses a high resolution digital camera, laptop computer, satellite telephone and a landline to obtain specialist opinions in radiology, dermatology, plastic surgery, orthopaedics, urology, ophthalmology, pathology and maxillo-facial surgery. This is the Defence Medical Services' first such link from an operational scenario. As such, this pilot study provides a useful testbed to enable clinicians in the three services to gain experience in this developing field, and to help determine the military applications of telemedicine.","1650":"","1651":"","1652":"The controlled application of CISD in the Armed Services is of value. In a varied Army career covering service with both regular and specialist units, there are instances where in retrospect the opportunity to discuss an incident in a CISD environment or the receipt of a general health warning would have been welcomed and assisted the group (or the individual) concerned to return to operational effectiveness. Practical considerations aside a colleague and friend who has been closely involved with CISD in the Forces since its inception, cites a very good case for its defence. In the early 1990s, as part of a small team, he conducted a large number of emotionally charged debriefs with soldiers recently returned from an operational tour in Bosnia. Returning 2 years later he questioned them as to whether they thought the debriefs worthwhile. There was a mixed response but the most telling came from a hard-bitten individual who stated that regardless of the benefits at least it showed that the system cared. I can think of no better reason to support CISD and encourage its development.","1653":"","1654":"","1655":"A young adult was admitted to a casualty department with severe burns sustained in a motor vehicle fire.

Following particularly severe exercise, muscle enzyme levels can be extremely high and are occasionally associated with rhabdomyolysis. A case of rhabdomyolysis following a moderate degree of accustomed exercise in a fit young soldier is reported and discussed.","1657":"Although Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) is well recognised there are an increasing number of associations that are important in its study and to a lesser extent in clinical practice. For many there is controversy over whether there is a causal relationship or a confounding effect but of these presbyacusis is the most important. The PULHHEEMS assessment H3 is currently the first level of abnormal hearing. Between H2 and H3 there is a performance decrement and compensation is awarded at levels of NIHL less than H3. If the measurement of NIHL is to be used as a tool in the Army Hearing Conservation Program (AHCP) then the emphasis must be placed on the change from H1 to H2 and not from H2 to H3.","1658":"To investigate whether there was a difference in social characteristics in different garrison towns of the British Forces Germany and to ascertain whether the health visitor workload was different in these towns. Self completed questionnaires administered to mothers by health visitors on first contact after delivery of their baby, and prospective follow up by health visitors recording subsequent contacts for the first three months after birth. 97 mothers based in Bruggen, Fallingbostel and Rheindahlen who had just delivered their new-born baby. Response rates for Bruggen, Fallingbostel and Rheindahlen were 54.8%, 70.2% and 69.9% respectively. There was a significant difference between parents in Fallingbostel and Rheindahlen with higher levels of maternal smoking during pregnancy (p = 0.04), more fathers aged under 25 years (p = 0.004), lower paternal military rank (p = 0.003), and increased paternal absence of more than one month during the pregnancy (p = 0.001) in Fallingbostel. The characteristics in Bruggen were similar to those in Rheindahlen. The workload of the health visitors, was significantly increased in Fallingbostel in comparison to Rheindahlen (p = 0.003). The use of social characteristics as an assessment of need would allow appropriate targeted health promotion and education resulting in a reduction in the inequalities of health in the Armed Forces. ","1659":"The Health Service in British Forces Germany has been subject to considerable change over the last two years. This study shows that the level of satisfaction with the Primary and Community Services in one area has remained consistently high over a twelve month period, even given the large number of changes that have been made to the working practices within the medical centres. This study also reports the fact that nearly 85% of patients who had attended a German hospital were satisfied with the service that had been provided.","1660":"The Army's morbidity reporting system J95 was fashioned into a secondary care variant and a pilot study conducted in Multinational Division South West (MND SW) during Operation Resolute 2. Some codes were modified, in keeping with the concurrent primary care J95a amendment, which included separating 'Other Injury' event codes further into 'Sports Injuries' and 'Other Injuries'. The collection system encompassed both out-patient and in-patient data and appropriate disposal categories such as 'admit' and 'length of stay' were introduced. Participating units included the Hospital Squadron at Sipovo, the Hospital facility at Tomislavgrad and, via a liaison officer, UK admissions and referrals to the Force Hospital near Split. A four month period of compatible data was found. Over this period 1,410 personnel (42.2\/1,000\/month) first attended out-patients with 337 requiring subsequent attendances (10.1\/1000\/month) and there were 425 admissions (12.7\/1,000\/month) from an average force level of 8,340 personnel. Nearly half the patients seen (49%) had orthopaedic problems and this group provided over half of the admissions (54%) and the bed occupancy (53%). There was a sizeable out-patient work load for the physician (28%). The pilot study showed that a J95 surveillance mechanism in secondary care was possible and informative. It gave indications of the impact of morbidity on the medical services and could help shape medical manning for future operations. It would be possible to adopt such a system in both the peacetime setting and in an international operational setting--in keeping with its primary care partner. It is recommended that J95 secondary variant should be continued on operations.","1661":"As with increasing frequency the armies of NATO member states deploy on Operations Other Than War (OOTW), there is a requirement to define predictory variables of consumption of healthcare assets by type and geographical location of operations. This report presents the results of the analysis of the J95\/EPINATO database of operational and exercise deployments. Although the database is limited in size and scope results show a marked difference in rates of incidence of EVENTS and in the proportion of first attendances to working days lost, both in general and when analysed by deployment type. For instance Service Assisted or Protected Evacuations (SA\/PE) showed a relatively high incidence of first attendances and low incidence of working days lost for all reasons (or EVENTS) (214.5 per 1,000 personnel at risk per month-95% Confidence Interval-CI: 198.8 to 230.3 and 23.9 working days lost per 1,000 personnel at risk per month-95% CI 18.0 to 29.8). The reverse is true for Counter Insurgency (COIN) type operations (111.55 per 1,000 personnel at risk per month-95% CI: 110.9 to 112.2 and 161.25 working days lost per 1,000 personnel at risk per month 95% CI: 160.5 to 162.0). Other findings include highest attendance rates in exercise deployments for all reasons (264.7 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 261.2 to 268.1), highest hospitalisation rates in exercise and PSO deployments for all reasons (8.7 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 7.9 to 9.4 and 9.9 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 9.6 to 10.1) and the seasonal pattern, high incidence and low manpower impact (26.2 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 25.9 to 26.5 and 3.5 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 3.4 to 3.6) of dermatological consultations on all operational deployments (the lowest of the spectrum being in COIN operations). No relationship was found between incidence of consultations, working days lost, hospitalisations and distance of the deployment from the UK. Deployments to Africa show the highest incident of attendances and working days lost for all reasons (530.7 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 524.2 to 537.3 and 106.5 per 1,000 personnel per month 95% CI: 102.5 to 110.6). The variability in epidemiological profiles in this analysis demonstrates the dangers of exclusive reliance on synthetic classifications of reasons for attendances such as the traditional DNBI breakdown and on point estimates of incidence. As the database expands, further analysis will become possible.","1662":"Many recent operations have highlighted the problem of hazard exposure in troops. This is a difficult area since it depends upon both post-deployment and possibly mid-deployment health surveillance and crosses the traditional limits of occupation and public health medicine. Health surveillance is itself a term which straddles occupational and public health medicine. For the military population at risk on operations, a combined approach is required incorporating the separate activities of needs and risk assessments. There is an existing vehicle to develop this approach using the new J95 methodology. Equally, a system of data access crossing medical and personnel records is necessary. The important requirement is that health surveillance is included in pre-deployment planning. Only by this method can adequate resources and significance be accorded to appropriate health surveillance strategies both during and following an operation as required.","1663":"On Thursday 8 January 1998, a Czech Hip helicopter with 21 personnel on board crashed shortly after take off from Bos Krupa, northwest Bosnia. Seventeen casualties (including six with severe injuries) were airlifted from the scene for treatment at the British Hospital Squadron in Sipovo before aeromedical evacuation the next day to Prague, or discharge to their unit.

Its mode of action is becoming increasingly understood and attempts are being made for statistical evaluation to allow for Western medical acceptance. After attending a basic course in acupuncture, the author describes his first one hundred cases. The preponderance of military patients, chronicity of the presenting complaints and the promising results obtained, illustrates the potential use of such a simple technique in military general practice.","1675":"A modified version of the J95 morbidity reporting system, called J95a, was used in the Multinational Division South West (MND SW) during Operation Resolute 2. The broad scope of the 'Other Diseases' and 'Other Injuries' event codes were reduced, with codes being added for specific areas of interest which were 'ENT Problems', 'Sports Injuries' and 'Training Injuries'. Designated medical centres from all nations in the division reported on a monthly basis to HQ MND SW, enabling the morbidity profile to be monitored. The first attendance rates in MND SW were twice as high as those experienced by the whole of the British Army, though the rate of working days lost was only a third. Almost half (49%) of the working time lost in the division was due to injuries and orthopaedic problems. The disease and injury distribution showed considerable differences compared to the SHAPE planning figures, with the disease rates experienced being between half and two thirds of those predicted, whilst the injury rates experienced were between four and six times as high as those predicted. This evidence suggests that the planning figures need to be re-assessed for operations other than war. Further investigation into the aetiology of injuries causing loss of working time is recommended, particularly sports injuries and orthopaedic problems.","1676":"This paper describes the data obtained during the first 12 months of the morbidity surveillance system used, world-wide, by the British Army in operational and non-operational settings and the economic impact of such morbidity in terms of estimated working days lost. Analysis is provided on primary health care and dental morbidity, the surveillance of patients undergoing physiotherapy and those Service personnel cared for by the NHS. The surveillance of the latter population shows a high burden of morbidity which, previously, has never been quantified. The most frequent cause of attendance within primary health care is injuries (all causes) with an annual total of 77,254--a rate per 1,000 personnel per month of 51.92. This leads to an annual loss of manpower, in terms of estimated working days lost of 127,839--a rate per 1,000 personnel per month of 85.91. Army Training Regiments (ATRs-5 sites), Infantry Training Centres (ITCs-2 sites) and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) are grouped together as Selected Training Establishments (STEs) and show attendance rates higher than the mean for all causes. Summary results of Cochrane systematic reviews presenting up-to-date concise information on experimental evidence as to which preventive interventions should be used to diminish the notable impact of injuries on Army personnel are also given.","1677":"On the 7 October 1996 the Provisional Irish Republican Army launched a terrorist attack within Northern Ireland.

All may occur in men of military age, and may tax the patience of medical officers and patients whose capacity for full duty will be impaired. Diagnosis depends on identifying micro-organisms in CBP and white cells in CNBP in prostatic secretion (EPS) expressed by prostatic massage. In prostatodynia there are clinical features of prostatitis but no evidence of inflammation. Prostatic massage should be preceded by trans-rectal ultrasound which may show prostatitis and other pathology, and has simplified the investigation of these syndromes. Management includes a high fluid intake, regular bowels with a soft stool, regular prostatic drainage by ejaculation and limited alcohol intake. Antimicrobials are indicated for CBP and probably for CNBP, and need to be continued for at least three months in many cases. Other measures for treating CNBP are less well established. Prostatodynia is an ill defined syndrome which requires careful evaluation and patients may need psychiatric therapy.","1689":"We report our experience of the first fourteen months of a new head and neck surgical clinic established at a district general hospital.

The measurement of core temperature is a fundamental requirement for this research. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of an infra-red tympanic thermometer (IVAC Corecheck) for use in thermal physiological studies conducted outside the laboratory environment by comparing the right ear temperature by TM thermometer and the left ear external auditory meatus by thermistor. The slope of the regression line between the two measurements was 0.9967 with a correlation coefficient of 0.706 which is reasonable. The TM thermometer in general reads higher than the aural thermometer with a 95% confidence limit for agreement from +0.78 to -0.53 degrees C of the aural temperature. Thus this study demonstrated that the tympanic thermometer (IVAC Corecheck) is sufficiently reliable compared to the aural thermistor to justify field trials.","1691":"The Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) course is a 3 day course run by BASICS Education for the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, Royal College of Nursing and the NHS Ambulance Service.

We believe the courses to have a valuable role in the ongoing training of CMT is as well as medical and nursing officers. Furthermore, being nationally recognised qualifications we hope the courses will have a positive effect not only on personnel retainment but on recruitment. Demand for places has far exceeded availability and we believe will continue to do so as these courses are not only highly relevant to TA service but to civilian career progression. Furthermore, as the humanitarian role of the armed forces becomes more and more important the PHEC course will become increasingly relevant to regular army personnel not only during their service but also after leaving the forces.

About one in 40 (2.5%) of the consultations were for mental health problems; Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depressive disorder, and grief reaction were the most common disorders, followed by acute adjustment reaction and panic disorder. Most cases pre-dated deployment. The number of cases repatriated to the UK was 17, about 10% of the total number of patients repatriated from theatre in this period.","1702":"Twenty-seven thousand four hundred and eight adult males between 20 and 22 years of age who were otherwise healthy were examined to detect inguinal hernias. Eight hundred and eighty-five (3.2%) inguinal hernia cases were detected. These were 479 (54.1%) right inguinal hernias, 351 (39.7%) left inguinal hernias and 55 (6.2%) bilateral inguinal hernias. One hundred and eighty-five (20.9%) subjects reported first degree relatives and 147 (16.6%) subjects reported second degree relatives with inguinal hernias. It is concluded that these results may be a useful guide for future studies about the prevalence of inguinal hernias in the populations as a whole and suggest a familial predisposition.","1703":"A retrospective review of all British Army patients presenting to the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital with a diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease between 1977 and 1987 was performed, with a minimum follow-up of 7 years.

Details of casualty evacuations during 1995 and 1996 have been collated and analysed in order to provide information on casualty types, and the locations from which casualties have been evacuated, during this 2 year period. The data so obtained might be used to ensure the future provision of an appropriately equipped CASEVAC helicopter, or to highlight common causes of significant morbidity in British troops deployed to Belize.","1705":"A survey of the orthopaedic casualties evacuated (casevacs) to the Royal Hospital Haslar between November 1995 and April 1996 was performed. A total of 464 service persons and civilians were casevaced. Orthopaedic cases amounted to 55% of all evacuations. Of these, 54% were British Army personnel. Conditions necessitating casevac were classified as either acute, (occurring during the deployment), or chronic (where the condition was present prior to deployment). Of the acute cases, there was an even mix between bony and soft tissue injuries (STIs). Sporting activities were the commonest cause of injury. The condition had been present prior to deployment in 16% of cases. Half of these were considered to have been unfit for deployment. Strategies for prevention of unnecessary casevacs are discussed.","1706":"To establish the average time taken to treat a seriously wounded battle casualty at First and Second Line (Role 1 and Role 2) according to the British Army Casualty Treatment Regimes under simulated conditions, and, in doing so, to assess whether British medical facilities are capable of meeting the medical planning directives of the Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC).

The time taken to treat simulated seriously wounded casualties at Role 1, the RAP and at Role 2, the Field Ambulance Dressing Station (DS). The mean treatment time at Role 1 was 28 minutes and at Role 2 was 17 minutes. Within the (large) caveat of simulation, as presently configured, the Field Ambulance (DS) is well able to cope with the casualty load expected of it by ARRC medical planners but the RAP of the armoured Battle Group is not. ","1707":"The deployment of British Contingent (BRITCON) to United Nations Force in Rwanda (UNAMIR) on Operation GABRIEL in 1994, proved to be a successful deployment on humanitarian operations. Many of the lessons have been successfully incorporated into training, equipment and organisational structures since the deployment. Others require further work to develop and assimilate. The essential issue concerning principles of humanitarian relief doctrine, mission definition, understanding the Disaster-Development continuum, capability mix, spectrum of military utility and the importance of force maintenance were all highlighted by the Rwanda deployment. Implications for future humanitarian operations include a co-operative approach to pre-deployment training with the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) community. This will help to promote understanding between the 2 arms of the humanitarian effort and will exploit the strengths of both sides. Equally, the military medical services have to be fully aware of mission definition and its centrality to planning, execution and audit of performance.","1708":"","1709":"","1710":"We report the case of a 63 year old lady with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

The Combat Fitness Test (CFT) has been identified as an activity that has been associated with heat casualties. The aim of this study was to establish whether a heat stress limit could be set for acclimatised soldiers performing the CFT by measuring the group mean rises in core temperature whilst performing the CFT at various environmental temperatures. The study showed that CFTs should not be undertaken when the start or expected end Wet Bulb Globe Test (WBGT) is greater than 25 degrees C if the group mean rise in core temperature is not to exceed 0.6 degree C (95% CI 0.2 degree C to 1 degree C).","1712":"Operation Resolute is a peace enforcement mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which commenced on 20 December 1995. During Weeks 1-26 of the operation a total of 405 British personnel were repatriated on medical grounds, out of a mean force size of 9,299. We analysed these repatriations by clinical category and according to final destination. In addition we carried out a focused analysis of the 87 medical repatriations which occurred during May 1996. 77.5% of all the repatriations in the first 6 months of Operation Resolute were for surgical conditions, and 22.5% were medical. Eighty two per cent of British soldiers were repatriated to UK, and 18% to Germany. The mean weekly repatriation rate during this 6-month period was 1.7 per 1,000 force strength. Orthopaedic conditions were by far the greatest single cause of repatriation. During the month of May there was a total of 87 repatriations, of which 12 were due to disease. These showed no consistent pattern. Seventy five of the May repatriations were due to injury and of these 29% were caused by sport, 5% by road traffic accidents, 4% were eye injuries and one was due to burns; other occupational injuries accounted for a further 27% of the total. Twenty out of the 87 personnel repatriated in May had pre-existing medical conditions, but only 35% of these had been reviewed by their medical officer prior to deployment. Medical officers should be more diligent in carrying out pre-deployment fitness screening. The routine medical surveillance of deployed troops should be targeted towards occupational causes of injury, since these are preventable and account for terminal manpower losses.","1713":"This study presents epidemiological data on sports injuries in deployed British troops in Bosnia, during the first five months of Operation Resolute. A retrospective analysis was carried out of sports injuries seen in one practice in the divisional rear area during April 1996. They account for a significant morbidity in deployed troops and are a major cause of manpower wastage and of medical repatriations. The continuous monitoring of sports injury should be a central part of the epidemiological surveillance of deployed troops. Their occurrence during operations can be minimised by judicious restrictions on those sports, such as football, which are known to have an adverse injury profile.","1714":"The distribution of dermatological conditions has been studied in a total of 1822 consultations with British troops in a primary health care setting on Operation Resolute (Bosnia) between 1 January and 4 March 1996. Approximately one in eight (12%) of the consultations were for skin conditions; eczema was the most common complaint, but, taken as a whole, infections due to virus (excluding warts), fungus and bacteria made up 30%. The overall distribution of diseases was similar to that seen in British general practice.","1715":"During 18 months of the 1991\/92 war against Croatia, 4,545 injured were treated at the Department of Surgery of Osijek Clinical Hospital. Some, 2,544 (55.9%) sustained shell fragment injuries and 807 (17.8%) bullet injuries. Shell fragments lead to a higher number of polytraumatized patients than did bullets (6.8% versus 5.3%). The postoperative complication rate for fragment injury (5.8%) was significantly higher than that for bullet injury (4.1%). Mortality rate did not differ significantly (3.9% versus 4.5% respectively).","1716":"A study of primary health care was undertaken at Divulje Barracks, Split, during Operation Resolute, 1996. A total of 1581 patients were seen during weeks 3 to 10 of the operation (day \"13' to \"70'). The number of consultations was greater for the first half of this period than for the second, and there were two early epidemics, one of respiratory disease and the other of enteric disease. Occupational and road traffic accident injuries were more common in the first 6 weeks and then declined with time.","1717":"This paper describes routine sickness events occurring during Weeks 1-19 of Operation Resolute (Bosnia). The period covered is 20 December 1995 to 28 April 1996. Primary care data were collected and analysed through an HQ ARRC epidemiological surveillance system which encompassed all British personnel in theatre. There was a total of 17,054 primary care consultations in the British force, which at its peak in late January numbered 10,832 personnel. 11,472 of these consultations were due to disease (67% of the total) and 5568 to non-battle injury (32% of the total). The observed rate of sickness due to disease was close to the predicted rate, which was 1.35% of the force per day. The observed rate of sickness due to non-battle injury was between 6 and 10 times higher than the predicted rate of 0.05% of the force per day. There were only 14 primary care consultations due to battle injury.","1718":"The provisional IRA's ceasefire ended abruptly with the Canary Wharf bombing in London in February 1996. Hopes that violence would not return to Northern Ireland were shattered by the explosion of two car bombs in the headquarters of the British Army in Ulster in October 1996. The second bomb specifically targeted medical staff treating casualties from the first explosion.

In particular, the provision of timely and balanced resuscitation to the high intensity battle is an issue requiring an understanding of both the tactical and the clinical demands. The wholesale application of civilian techniques and approaches to trauma management is not possible given the austerity of the battlefield clinical environment. The commitment to excellence and quality of care implicit in modern mainstream practice is of continuing relevance to the battlefield. A doctrinal approach involving the definition of desired clinical outcome and the constraints of operational feasibility, is proposed. Specifically, the introduction of a triad approach to trauma management is offered. The triad comprises readily available Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support (BATLS) skills, Surgical Resuscitation deployed forward and the provision of Field Intensive Care. Such an approach would marry together the clinically ideal with the tactically.","1723":"Periconceptual dietary folic acid supplementation reduces the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs). Their use has been advocated by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO), the Consultant Advisor in Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology (O&amp;G), the Senior Consultant in O&amp;G British Forces in Germany (BFG) and by Medical Administration &amp; Technical Instruction (MA&amp;TI) in all NAAFI outlets. An audit of awareness of the recommendations and use of such supplements amongst pregnant women in BFG was performed over a 12 week period in BMH Rinteln. 16.6% (5\/6) and 17.6% (34\/193) of those with and without a history of a pregnancy affected by a NTD respectively had taken the correct dose before conception. Knowledge of and compliance with the recommendations is poor. An opportunity to positively influence health in a \"captive\" population is being lost.","1724":"The financial considerations of transfer candidates in the football league is such that a detailed medical examination as well as other investigations are required prior to a successful transfer. With this in mind the concern is raised that professional footballers may be exposed to excessive ionising radiation by undergoing unnecessary radiological imaging. Our study was conducted in order to assess the use of plain films in the assessment of transfer candidates in the premier league","1725":"Night vision goggles (NVGs) are becoming an increasingly important tool in military aviation. They provide superior visual capability over unaided night vision, but any reduction in goggle performance can have a serious effect on flight safety and operational effectiveness. This study shows that the use of the ANV 20\/20 focusing aid provides an effective method for aircrew to obtain a better visual capability than is currently obtained by focusing on distant features of the landscape or distant lights. Visual acuities using the current and proposed focusing methods were compared in 50 aircrew. The visual acuity showed an average improvement of 18% with the proposed method compared with the current method. This was found to be statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01). Using the current method of focusing there was a significant (p &lt; 0.01) difference in the visual acuity achieved between the right and left tubes\/eyes. Using the ANV 20\/20 there was no difference between tubes\/eyes. ANV 20\/20 was found to improve visual acuity when using NVG as well as enabling the user to achieve equal visual acuities with both eyes.","1726":"We describe 13 cases of soft tissue impingement in the ankle by localized synovial proliferation and scar tissue. A number of papers have described symptomatic improvement in sportsmen who have undergone resection of this tissue. We report the results of this procedure in Army personnel. Of the 13 patients, 8 had excellent or good results, while 5 had poor results. Two of the latter subsequently revealed another significant problem and were then excluded, thus 8 out of 11 patients had an excellent or good result. We therefore believe that this procedure is useful in the management of chronic ankle pain in Army personnel.","1727":"In the Rama mobile war hospital, intravenous (i.v.) anaesthesia was used in 78 patients undergoing surgical procedures lasting 4-25 min. Boluses of thiopentone (Group 1), propofol (Group 2), propofol + alfentanyl (Group 3), and ketamine + midazolam (Group 4) were used. Induction of anaesthesia, resulted in a mean blood pressure decreased about 15%. Apnoea of more than 20 sec was observed in Group 3, but no naloxone was required. Recovery was rapid enabling patients to maintain their own airway. The use therefore of titrated anaesthetics in war is considered acceptable.","1728":"There is a requirement for a basic approach to the provision of analgesia on the battlefield using the morphine autojet. Assuming there is cardiorespiratory stability and no contraindications to opioid therapy, morphine can be administered intramuscularly to a serviceman in pain on a 2 hourly basis provided that there are no adverse effects on the respiratory rate and degree of sedation. This proven simple approach in civilian practice has the potential to be incorporated into Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support (BATLS) and Combat Training Regimens (CTR).","1729":"A questionnaire study was carried out on 74 British Army patients who were awaiting aeromedical evacuation from the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. The study confirmed previous unpublished reports that 41% of patients were being repatriated for exacerbation of pre-existing disease. Of these, 78% had disease known to their medical officer, were considered to be outside limits for full fitness, according to accepted military standards, but had not been downgraded. Only 34% of these patients had been reviewed prior to deployment to assess their fitness. Assessment of fitness to deploy was in some cases based on inaccurate information about in theatre living and working conditions, and the medical support available. In conclusion it would appear that medical officers should be more diligent in downgrading unfit personnel to prevent their deployment on operations thereby reducing the burden on the medical evacuation chain. Medical officers need up-to-date information on operational areas in order to make appropriate decisions on fitness of personnel to deploy.","1730":"","1731":"","1732":"","1733":"Zieve's syndrome consists of transient haemolytic anaemic, jaundice, hyperlipidaemia and alcohol-induced liver disease.

Over a thousand questionnaires were returned (response rate 58%) and these showed that the prevalence of babies being placed in the prone position to sleep is now extremely low and the use of room thermometers to help control ambient temperature is widespread. However 29% of the mothers had smoked in pregnancy and 44% of households with a new-born baby had at least one parent who smoked. Additional health promotion activity aimed at reducing the prevalence of smoking in pregnancy and amongst the parents of new-born babies is recommended.","1737":"During 1993-1995 the health services in British Forces Germany were subjected to a market testing process by which the primary, community and acute health services for the British Servicemen and women, their families and attached civilian staff, a population of 70,000, were put out to competitive tender with the then current provider, the Defence Medical Services, as one tenderer for the contract. This paper outlines the methodology developed by the Health Alliance Community Services Review team in formulating a successful bid. It is considered that the process outlined could be of value to those involved in future market tests, commissioning projects or performance improvement programmes.","1738":"There has been a growing realisation that good resource planning requires effective measurement of surgical workload by good surgical audit. This paper examines the general surgical workload at the Army's tertiary referral centre, utilising the ratio of operative workload expressed as Intermediate Equivalents to total Service Equivalent Value of a Surgical team.

The limitations of \"number crunching\" when assessing the value of higher surgical training are discussed.","1739":"This paper presents an analysis of the reports of heat casualties to Medical Branch, United Kingdom Land Forces (UKLF) for the period 1986-1994. There was a marked reduction in reports for 1990-1993 compared to the remaining period studied. This may have been the result of improved prevention or under-reporting. This data has been compared to the reports of heat casualties occurring in Cyprus from 1990-1994. Forced marches and military runs were the primary activities causing heat casualties in UK compared to military exercises in Cyprus. There were many more severe casualties in UK than in Cyprus. If it is necessary to reduce the annual rate of heat casualties in the Army then changes in policy should be focused on the problem in UK. This should consider the generation of metabolic heat as the primary cause of heat illness as opposed to environmental factors. In overseas commands (eg Cyprus) the relative effects are reversed.","1740":"","1741":"","1742":"A group of British Military Hospitals was established between 1915 and 1918 along the estuary of the River Canche on the northern French coast.

They provide superior visual capability over unaided night vision, but any reduction in goggle performance can have a serious effect on flight safety and operational effectiveness. This study shows that the use of a standard adjustment procedure in a night vision goggle (NVG) test lane, with a resolution chart, provides an effective method for aircrew to obtain better visual capability than is currently obtained by focusing on distant features of the landscape. Visual acuity (VA) was measured for 20 aircrew representing all crew positions, after using both the current adjustment method and the proposed method for adjusting ANVIS NVGs. The average visual acuity showed an improvement from 6\/19 (s.d. = 3.9) with the current method to 6\/13 (s.d. = 2.8) with the proposed method. However, NVG test lanes cannot be used with goggles which have fixed infinity objective lenses eg Nite.","1749":"The introduction of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in the early 1980s has revolutionised airway management. Clinicians have shown the ease of LMA insertion compared to endotracheal intubation by unskilled personnel. Despite the lack of protection against aspiration of gastric contents, the LMA's ability to maintain the airway and oxygenation warrants its incorporation into military life support protocols and into an integrated respiratory support concept for conventional and NBC operations.","1750":"Units deployed on humanitarian aid may have little experience of the most appropriate interventions which can be expected to produce the most favourable population outcomes. Guidelines produced by UNICEF and the International Dispensary Association (IDA) can be used as a basis for planning. These guidelines were previously untested in Rwanda. This report focuses on iron and folate supplementation for pregnant women suggested by the IDA. The high levels of anaemia in pregnancy would suggest that supplementation is appropriate. However, before fully embracing the full set of recommendations, further field testing would be sensible.","1751":"","1752":"","1753":"","1754":"Foreign bodies found in the appendix have been reported many times. To date 254 occurrences have been documented. However, only 4 previously reported episodes involve teeth, dental restoration or dental equipment. We present a patient with a 6 month history of intermittent right iliac fossa pain following the ingestion of a gold inlay restoration, which was found at operation to be in the distal appendix. Previous reports suggest that symptoms from foreign bodies in the appendix occur in 73% of cases, and in 93% when the object is sharp. Therefore, appendicectomy is recommended when a foreign body is detected in the appendix, and particularly if it has sharp edges.","1755":"","1756":"A case is presented of meningococcal meningitis, without septicaemia, which was associated with a transient atrio-ventricular dissociation. The need for cardiac monitoring in similar cases is discussed.","1757":"Rhabdomyosarcoma arising in teratoma of the testis is an exceptionally rare occurrence. The rhabdomyosarcomatous element infers a less favourable prognosis and standard treatment regimes well recognised for the treatment of teratoma of the testis may not be effective.","1758":"This paper is the first part of a two part review of the published literature reporting the military experience of heat illness. It summarises current concepts of the mechanisms for the development of heat illness. The reports of heat illness in the military medical literature from pre-World War 1 to the end of World War 2 are discussed. The second part will consider reports from the end of the Second World War to the present day. Epidemiological evidence for the factors causing heat illness will be summarised and finally the current areas of uncertainty will be identified with proposals for future research.","1759":"","1760":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common form of malignancy, causing death after late presentation in two-thirds of cases. Early detection makes curative treatment likely. Faecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) detect some pre-symptomatic CRCs and their precursor lesions, adenomatous polyps. A trial showed reduced mortality in USA volunteers aged 50-80 with regular FOBTs; both this and the Nottingham population-based trial detected earlier-stage CRCs. Current US guidelines recommend annual digital rectal examination and FOBTs from age 40. FOBTs have been included in the USAF examination of aircrew for several years. Day-case colonoscopy, with appropriate biopsy-excision, is the first-choice follow-up investigation. This study aims to investigate the design of any programme to introduce FOBTs as part of the RAF's existing schedule of Periodic Medical Examinations (PMEs) and Screenings, and the age groups to be included, rather than the decision as to whether or not it should be commenced. The analysis therefore examines the cost per cancer detected. The information required to evaluate subsequent outcomes, such as cost per life-year saved, is not available for the RAF population so speculative extrapolation from other data is not attempted. Over a third of RAF personnel are under the age of 25, nearly three-quarters under 35 and over four-fifths under 40. Over a quarter of the 4 RAF CRC cases pa occur under age 40 and two-thirds under 50. The most cost-effective age at which to introduce FOBTs in the RAF is 40, regardless of the following parameters. Assuming FOBT sensitivity of 55% and positivity 5%, FOBT costing 23p and colonoscopy 175 pounds, starting FOBTs RAF-wide at age 40 would cost annually 35,968 pounds and 15,881 pounds per CRC case detected. The FOBT contribution to the costs is extremely small and the importance of maximising sensitivity and specificity very great. Hence dietary modification, and using a test or combination of tests with higher sensitivity and\/or lower false-positivity, even if much more expensive, would be highly cost-effective, reducing the above costs substantially. Counting as \"cases\" persons with adenomas reduces the cost per \"case\" detected by about 75%. A pilot study is proposed concerning the introduction on selected stations of FOBTs with RAF PMEs\/Screenings, from age 40, to determine: sensitivity and false-positivity rates for single and serial FOBTs, and the predictive value of positive tests, in RAF screenees; the annual cost; the costs per CRC case, and per CRC-plus-adenoma case, detected; possibly, an estimate of the cost per life-year saved; and, hence, whether the programme should be extended to all RAF personnel. FOB screening from age 40 would miss the quarter of RAF CRC cases which occur in personnel under 40. Identification is therefore recommended now of personnel at high risk for CRC, because of personal or family history, at all PMEs\/Screenings, regardless of age, with the subsequent offer of serial FOBTs annually and regular colonoscopy. 2 1\/2 yearly [corrected] FOBTs, done with PMEs\/Screenings and half-way through the 5 year interval, would detect almost as many CRCs as annual testing, missing only half as many as 5-yearly testing. This analysis provides information on the costs and consequences of various FOB screening strategies for the RAF and other Services. Similar principles can be applied to develop informed strategies for other screening.","1761":"The Army Medical Services are responsible for promoting health in the military workplace. A survey of the potential health risks in the workplace to British Army servicewomen who are pregnant, or who breastfeed, was carried out. It was found that there was a total of 30 major workplace hazards to pregnant or breastfeeding servicewomen, and that medical guidance in this area was lacking. A Medline literature search on these hazards, was compiled, and an overview of the nature and extent of the military problem, together with a brief policy recommendation applying to each hazard. Guidelines based on these recommendations were distributed to primary care and obstetric unit medical officers in all three Armed Services. It is intended that the guidelines will assist Service doctors in giving informed advice on the avoidance of military occupational risks to pregnancy and to lactation.","1762":"Eighty seven of 100 consecutive recruits referred for cardiac assessment of fitness to serve had heart murmurs. Seven of these were rejected as having significant cardiac disease. One with a diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would have been placed at considerable risk had he been exposed to the physical stress of military training. The remaining 6 rejected had conditions which could have been worsened by the stress of military training and\/or required intensive cardiac follow-up. These included 3 individuals with aortic regurgitation, 1 with atrial septal defect, 1 with ventricular septal defect combined with a small atrial septal defect and 1 with post rheumatic fever mitral regurgitation. Thirteen patients we assessed because of other cardiac problems including repaired congenital heart disease and hypertension. The rejection rate in this group was high at 10 out of 13. The majority of those referred (83\/100) were found to be fit for military service. Five of these required advice on antibiotic prophylaxis but the majority had totally unrestricted service. Although most recruits who present with cardiac \"problems\" will be fit for service, important and potentially fatal conditions can be detected. Therefore vigilance must be high amongst examining doctors and suspect individuals referred for appropriate assessment.","1763":"","1764":"Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) has been recognised for some time. In the military environment one group of personnel at risk are Army helicopter aircrew who are exposed to continuous noise levels of up to 100 dB(A) in flight. The evidence for the damaging effect of this occupational noise is reviewed and some of the difficulties in drawing conclusions are highlighted. The current protection offered for the Mk 4 helmet is discussed and the incorporation of Active Noise Reduction (ANR) is suggested as a likely way of ensuring that the in-flight noise exposure in Army aircrew is kept as low as possible.","1765":"A retrospective case-control study was undertaken of women with a history of a previous stillbirth or neonatal death, who subsequently delivered in BMH Rinteln. Their obstetric and neonatal outcome was compared to that of a control group of women of similar age and parity and its relationship to specific socio-economic factors assessed. Index patients had a worse obstetric and neonatal outcome. They were statistically significantly more likely to be admitted to hospital during their pregnancy (46% vs 26%), to have medical complications (58% vs 34%), to be delivered prematurely (16% vs 8%), and by Caesarean section (22% vs 9%). Their babies were more likely to have complications (28.8% vs 20.4%), to be of low birth weight (14% vs 7%), require intubation (11% vs 5%) and be admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) (13% vs 7%). Apart from small stature, no differences in socio-economic factors between the two groups could be identified. Index patients were four times more likely than controls to have their pregnancy terminated prematurely as a result of complications (6.7% vs 1.6%), but there was also a high level of obstetric intervention in the absence of clear medical indications. Although perinatal mortality was not statistically increased, the results were suspicious and it is concluded that these women should continue to be considered a high-risk group.","1766":"Asthma is a common condition. General Practitioners in the NHS now receive specific remuneration for running asthma disease management programmes.

In addition a questionnaire survey of patient knowledge and satisfaction was undertaken. The study identified several areas for improvement.","1767":"There are over 38,000 army cadets in the United Kingdom of whom about 20,000 attend a two week annual camp each summer. In response to criticisms from the medical staff attached to cadet units about the suitability of the routinely issued medical pack, a national questionnaire survey of all serving Army Cadet Force medical personnel has been performed, along with an analysis of patient attendances at annual camp between 1989 and 1992 in one East Midlands County Force. In particular the appropriateness of the Medical Treatment Pack Training Camp Large as currently issued to cadet units has been examined. The findings suggest that, on its own, the pack is unsuitable to treat about 40% of cadets who attend for medical treatment during annual camp; medical staff on average rate its suitability for cadets as very low. Moreover, there is objective evidence that most cadet units need to obtain extra medical supplies, particularly bronchodilators, modern antibiotics and modern dressings; many do so via private purchases from civilian sources. The study highlights a situation in urgent need of review.","1768":"Clinical and laboratory staff of the Army and RAF medical services at risk of acquiring infection with hepatitis B were immunised against the virus with a recombinant vaccine. Vaccine was administered in Service hospitals and medical centres located throughout the world. After a primary course of vaccine, 73% of personnel developed anti-HBs titres &gt; or = 100 IU\/L to hepatitis B surface antigen and were considered protected; 11% were non-responders (anti-HBs &lt; 10 IU\/l). A significantly higher proportion of females than males, and vaccinees under 40 years of age, produced a good response. Among those achieving a good response, antibody titres were higher in the younger age group and in females. After a fourth (booster) dose of vaccine, 87.2% of the poor responders and 37% non-responders, developed anti-HBs titres &gt; or = 100 IU\/L.","1769":"Exercise tests have been an integral part of the extended PULHHEEMS examination since its inception in 1983. In the first 10 years a total of 240 individuals have been examined and 180 (75%) have had normal exercise tests. Individuals with an abnormal test who wished further assessment (58) were subjected to an exercise thallium scan. Of these 36 were normal allowing reassurance of the individual. Of the 22 abnormal scans 15 were subjected to regular follow-up whilst 7 were sufficiently abnormal to merit angiography. Of the seven patients who had angiography one was normal, 3 had significant coronary artery disease and 3 had mitral valve prolapse.","1770":"","1771":"","1772":"","1773":"","1774":"","1775":"A case of acute respiratory distress syndrome in a 79-year-old man is presented in which the use of a BioSurge synchronous autotransfuser may be implicated.

We record a case of a dentist who presented 11 years ago with a radiation induced squamous cell carcinoma of the ring finger of his left hand with massive axillary lymphadenopathy. Repeated exposure of his hands to diagnostic dental irradiation in his surgery had lead 16 years previously to a troublesome radiodermatitis which had been mistakenly diagnosed and had itself been treated with radiotherapy without effect. Management by amputation of the distal phalanx of the ring finger, debulking of the axillary lymphadenopathy with adjunctive radiotherapy to the axilla and chemotherapy, have been successful in achieving a prolonged disease free interval and satisfactory hand function.","1777":"","1778":"","1779":"","1780":"","1781":"","1782":"","1783":"There are three main causes, often combined, of chronic osteomyelitis due to gunshot wounds. These are retained dead matter, cavities and osteitis and are often combined. If these causes are removed the infection subsides and healing can occur. The indication for operation is clinical--persistent suppuration--and not the X-ray appearances. The nature and extent of the operation can only be determined when the sinus is explored and the cause of the suppuration ascertained. The principles of the operation are: 1) To remove the cause. 2) To provide free drainage. 3) To provide suitable mechanical condition for healing, i.e. to facilitate the obliteration of resultant spaces. When these principles can be satisfactorily applied healing occurs, but the difficulty or impossibility of applying them in some cases results in failure to cure the condition. These difficulties are anatomical. Early removal of sequestra is of great importance in reducing the severity of chronic osteomyelitis and may even prevent it.","1784":"The two common forms of heat illness in the Services are heatstroke and heat exhaustion. Biochemical predisposing factors are considered for each. Susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia should be tested for in cases of heat stroke. The heterozygote status for cystic fibrosis should be established in cases of heat exhaustion.","1785":"Confidential inquiries into cases of cot death in British Forces Germany were introduced in 1990. The information which has been collected so far suggests that the current attention to the position in which a baby is placed in a cot, the prevention of overheating and the avoidance of cigarette smoke, is not misplaced. Despite the considerable reduction in the cot death rate which has occurred in British Forces Germany since 1990 it is recommended that confidential inquiries should be continued so that possible opportunities to further reduce the risks are not missed.","1786":"This paper presents a retrospective case control study of the General Practice consultation rates of 58 soldiers made voluntarily redundant. The redundees were compared over 140 days prior to the announcements of redundancy and 140 days after the announcements. No difference in consultation rates was found between the groups suggesting that voluntary redundancy in the Army has no effect on health and health seeking behaviour.","1787":"We report on the application to the BFG Health Services Market Testing (MT) study of the response to a users' questionnaire and panel discussions to determine in which priority and how services should be provided. The questionnaire served to inform lay and health care panel members on users' views on the relative importance of future health services and the way they will be provided. Based on the questionnaire results and data contained in the BAOR Report of Public Health for 1992\/93 the panel assigned the highest priorities to emergency services, followed by routine General Practitioner services and essential hospital services. The lowest ranking were non-essential hospital services, health care for children with special needs and provision of designated transport. There was a high consistency in views between the lay and health care members of the panel.","1788":"The fundi of 14 climbers were monitored on ascent to 6000 metres over a 15 day period in the Nepal Himalaya. A total of 4 climbers experienced symptomless haemorrhages. These haemorrhages were not secondary to changes in haemoglobin concentration, nor did they appear correlated to the use of acetazolamide. The risk of developing retinal haemorrhage was, however, significantly greater in the better acclimatized individuals. Possible reasons for this relationship are discussed.","1789":"The efficacy of taped imaginal exposure as a treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Reactions (PTSR) was assessed in eighteen consecutive outpatients, including Gulf War veterans. Detailed present-tense scripts of their personal traumatic experiences were prepared and in all but two cases audio-taped and listened to regularly. The severity of PTSR and standard questionnaire scores (including the IES, BDI, GHQ8 and the SCL 90) all showed statistically significant improvements post treatment and at three month follow-up. This case series confirms the potential efficacy of taped imaginal exposure in the treatment of full and partial forms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The simplicity of its administration and acceptability to the individual suggest that it is worthy of more thorough research.","1790":"Surgical exploration and immediate reconstruction with the median layer of the deep cervical fascia (MLDCF) was performed in 8 of 22 patients with exogenous war injuries of larynx and cervical trachea. A surgical technique of reconstruction with the median layer of the deep cervical fascia is described. The 7 surviving patients had good respiration without signs of stenosis of the larynx and\/or the trachea. Four had good and 3 satisfactory, phonation, and none had swallowing difficulties. Owing to the simplicity of the surgical approach, its size and biological properties, the median layer of deep cervical fascia proved itself to be a suitable material in the immediate reconstruction of exogenerous war injuries of the larynx and cervical trachea.","1791":"","1792":"","1793":"","1794":"","1795":"","1796":"Epidemic Meningococcal meningitis first made its definite appearance in Europe in the beginning of the nineteenth century.

It explains the respective roles of its three components: the National Societies, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). It highlights the ICRC's experience of war surgery and emphasises the relevance of this for the military medical services, especially for the training of military surgeons and anaesthetists.","1798":"Meckel's diverticulum is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastro-intestinal tract. It arises as a result of incomplete dissolution of the vitello-intestinal duct. Approximately 4% of patients with Meckel's diverticula develop complications, most commonly obstruction, gastro-intestinal bleeding and inflammation. We describe three unusual presentations of Meckel's diverticulum-perforation due to ingested foreign body, a smooth muscle neoplasm simulating an ovarian tumour, and a Littre's hernia.","1799":"We describe a case of anaerobic streptococcal myonecrosis as a rare complication after pilonidal sinus excision with primary closure.

With modern diagnostic technology, aneurysms can be identified at an earlier stage, providing the opportunity for intervention. This review outlines the case of a patient with a massive, leaking hepatic artery aneurysm and discusses the aetiology and management of these lesions.","1801":"","1802":"A study in 1980 revealed that 38% of aortograms performed in a series had been referred for inappropriate reasons and only 49% had been clearly indicated. Recommendations were made to reduce the number of inappropriate investigations. An audit has been carried out of the aortography referrals made in this unit recently. This has shown that, despite changes in the management of peripheral vascular disease in the intervening years, by following the recommendations made in the previous paper, the number of inappropriate aortograms has been reduced to a minimum. The recommendations are endorsed.","1803":"NATO war medical doctrine was applied in the war in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, due to rather specific martial and organizational circumstances, the doctrine had to be modified. sometimes substantially. A medical team from the war hospital in Livno, Bosnia and Herzegovina describes their work with respect to the four-echelon NATO doctrine. The team covered a relatively large and active battlefield, and treated 597 patients with 314 major surgical interventions. Due to the lack of surgeons and medical personnel in general, the second echelon concentrated on fast transportation, and the third echelon fulfilled the function of the fourth echelon, completing the surgical treatment except for 12 patients with head and spine injuries.","1804":"The possibility of using radiofrequency energy (RFE) to produce a sutureless anastomosis is attractive both to the military surgeon and on the grounds of cost and simplicity. To investigate this, fresh rabbit aorta was divided lengthways into 4 mm strips and apposed, intima-to-itima. A Valleylab Force 30 Electrosurgery machine supplied RFE at 500 kHz. The energy was applied using standard bipolar forceps and 121 attempts were made to weld the tissue. Seventy seven welds resulted of which 36 were able to withstand a distraction force of greater than 0.1N: the strongest weld was disrupted at 0.35N. Intact tissue withstood a distraction force of greater than 2N, whilst sutured joints disrupted at 0.97 N. It is concluded therefore that radiofrequency energy at 500 kHz does not satisfactorily weld vascular tissue.","1805":"Anecdotally expressed concern over the military\/civilian interface regarding infectious disease notification, and the current review of procedures in both civilian and military settings prompted this study. Its aim was to quantify knowledge of doctors involved in the provision of care to Army personnel and their dependants in the United Kingdom regarding infectious disease reporting and make recommendations to improve the process. A questionnaire was sent to all such military and civilian doctors in the Southern Military District of England. The group was no less knowledgeable than others studied previously. Differences were found in the knowledge of reporting procedures between civilian and military doctors, with military hospital doctors demonstrating particularly poor knowledge. It is recommended that specific instruction on all aspects of infectious disease reporting be given to doctors joining the Army and to civilian GPs involved in care of the Military.","1806":"The objective of this study was to report on a breakthrough of Plasmodium falciparum infection following a military exercise in central Kenya and the treatment regimens used. A series of case reports are presented from the three UK hospitals involved. Among 150 British soldiers who had been on exercises for five weeks in central Kenya, taking proguanil\/chloroquine anti-malarial prophylaxis, seven developed symptomatic falciparum malaria. Initial symptoms, which started between 2 and 10 days before their return to England, included faintness, sweating, shivering, diarrhoea, headache and myalgia. Diagnosis was delayed from between 5 and 13 days after the first symptom. One patient was severely ill with 50% parasitaemia: he required intensive care, exchange blood transfusion and haemofiltration for acute renal failure. Compliance with chemoprophylaxis was not measured and anti-mosquito measures were not generally practised. However, British Army policy was amended in June 1993 so that mefloquine will be used in future rather than proguanil\/chloroquine. It was concluded therefore that even in an educated and motivated population simple preventive measures are not observed. Chemoprophylactic compliance could be improved by changing to a simpler regime. Falciparum malaria is a medical emergency that requires urgent admission for confirmation of diagnosis, supportive and curative treatment. Its presence should be suspected in any ill traveller.","1807":"Military surgeons in a future conflict may face the problem of wounds contaminated with chemical warfare (CW) agents. No useful guidelines for this eventuality exist-nor any assessment of the specific CW risk to such casualties or to the surgical teams operating on them. The principal hazard to surgeons is direct contact with contaminated clothing in the wound. Practices are recommended to reduce this threat significantly. Thorough wound excision augmented by lavage with a specific proprietary hypochlorite solution will provide effective wound decontamination without producing unacceptable tissue damage. The vapour hazard at surgery is very low-respirators are unnecessary but goggles or glasses should be worn to prevent conjunctival splashes of potentially contaminated body fluids.","1808":"","1809":"","1810":"","1811":"","1812":"","1813":"A case of a 28 years old Caucasian woman is presented with acute tibial compartment of her left leg secondary to repeated self inflicted soft tissue injuries, together with literature review on Dermatitis Artefacta.","1814":"A case of a 19-year-old paratrooper with recurrent sacro-iliac abscess is presented, and literature reviewed.","1815":"Intravenous injection of the oral formulation of Temazepam is a common form of drug abuse. At the request of the Home Office, manufacturers have developed solid dose forms to replace the liquid filled capsules, but a number of cases of accidental intra-arterial injection of the new formulation have been reported, with varying management strategies advocated.

PEG has several advantages over surgical gastrostomy and should be considered the procedure of choice for long term enteral therapy in appropriate patients. At the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital (QEMH) between June 1992 and October 1993 thirteen percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies were successfully performed. Eight were performed in soldiers, seven of these were following major neurological trauma. The procedure is described and the literature is reviewed.","1818":"Ninety three cardiac catheterisations were carried out at St Thomas' Hospital on behalf of the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital in 1991. Fifty-nine (63.4%) of procedures resulted in the patient's being recommended for further intervention. Sixteen (20%) of the 79 patients, thought to have ischaemic heart disease, had normal coronary arteries, but on further analysis of this group none could reasonably have been excluded from further investigation with angiography. Fewer military patients than civilians were recommended for active intervention. This probably reflects the fact that most of the military patients were under 50 years old, had had a myocardial infarction or angina and therefore warranted catheterisation because of their young age.","1819":"In a prospective comparison of 70 servicemen undergoing inguinal hernia repair by either the Shouldice method or by laparoscopy, it was found that the laparoscopic operation took longer (mean 52.6 minutes compared to 28.4) and required a postoperative hospital stay as long as that following open operation. However the postoperative analgesia requirement was significantly less, and the patients undergoing laparoscopic herniorraphy were able to regain full fitness and to return to work earlier than those having a Shouldice repair. Despite the higher costs of the laparoscopic operation we believe that the earlier return to work makes this technique cost-effective.","1820":"Between 1989 and 1992, 92% of a sample of 2790 Service recruits aged between 17 and 35 years (mean age 19 years 7 months) were found not to be immune to infection by hepatitis A virus. The proportion of males with immunity was consistently greater than that for females. There was a significantly increased probability of immunity if individuals originated from Northern England, the Midlands and Scotland, in particular the suburbs. Among male recruits there were significantly increased probabilities of immunity associated with travel to Southern and Eastern Europe or to the Tropics, and for females with travel to North West Europe or to Southern and Eastern Europe.","1821":"Heat illness in the Armed Forces is an emotive issue. No specific service-wide system currently exists to monitor the incidence of heat illness. Within British Forces Cyprus medical policy guidelines for physical activity at various Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) readings were issued in 1988. A local system for reporting heat casualties was introduced in August 1989. This paper examined retrospectively the reports of heat illness casualties from August 1988 to December 1992 in Cyprus. There was a reduction in reported incidents causing heat casualties over the period studied from 18 incidents in 1990 to 8 in 1992. There was also a reduction in the maximum recorded WBGT reading for each incident. From these results it would seem that there may have been a reduction in preventable heat casualties attributable to commanders following the WBGT guidelines.","1822":"","1823":"","1824":"","1825":"Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) is a potentially severe problem for military exercises and operations and may present in a variety of ways as was the case on the \"Roof of Africa\" Expedition 1990.

Gradual acclimatization to increasing altitude will decrease the incidence of AMS, but pharmacological prophylaxis is recommended when time is short, acetazolamide being the drug of choice.","1826":"Small bowel stenosis due to blunt abdominal trauma is rare. This paper reports a Gurkha soldier who sustained apparently minor trauma in a flying accident and presented 11 weeks later with abdominal pain. After extensive investigations, a post-traumatic small bowel stricture was identified and excised.","1827":"A case of thoracic discitis secondary to a pyodermal skin condition known as 'Woodbury' rash is described.","1828":"In a four month period in 1992 at a small military wing of a civilian hospital three Meckel's Diverticulae were removed from patients suspected of having complications in their vermiform appendix. One of the diverticulae was inflamed and was the cause of the symptoms. The second was a symptomatic but it and the appendix showed transmural granulomatous inflammation caused by infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. The third also asymptomatic was found to contain carcinoid tumour. On investigation with urinary estimations of 5 Hydroxy Indole Acetic Acid there was no sign of residual carcinoid tumour in the patient. None of the patients has had complications from their surgery. Review of the literature shows that prophylactic excision of asymptomatic Meckel's Diverticulae to prevent possible complications is justified in persons under the age of 40 such as is the typical service population.","1829":"Hypertonic saline solutions have properties that may be advantageous for resuscitation. In both animal and human studies rapid improvements in cardiovascular status occur when hypertonic saline is administered to hypovolaemic subjects and the possible side effects of hypertonic solutions have not been shown to be of clinical importance. Hypertonic saline certainly has a potential role in resuscitation of hypovolaemic casulaties in the modern military setting.","1830":"A prospective study of 199 patients over a two year period, 1 Jun 90 to 31 May 92 at the Louise Margaret Maternity Wing, Cambridge Military Hospital, Aldershot was undertaken to audit the uptake of an offer of conservative management of prolonged pregnancy to women at 42 weeks gestation. The labour outcomes of patients opting for conservative or induction management plans were recorded and the increased workload introduced to the Ultrasound Unit measured. Of the 91\/199 (45.7%) patients who chose to be managed conservatively, 20 (22.0%) developed an abnormal result of a test of fetal surveillance, 16 (17.6%) were electively delivered because of an abnormal result. There were no significant differences in labour performance or neonatal outcome between those women opting for conservative management or induction of labour. 201 new ultrasound scans were booked, 129 were performed (0.4 scans\/week\/1000 deliveries).","1831":"Arthroscopy of the knee is an accepted and widely practised diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The role of arthroscopy in the elderly is examined in this study. The benefit of debridement in the control of symptoms in the degenerative knee even in this elderly population is demonstrated. Arthroscopy produced an improvement in 62.3% of patients and in those whose knees were being assessed for osteotomy or arthroplasty 55% have avoided further surgery.","1832":"Medical Support Troop Bravo (MST Bravo) provides third line medical support for the United Kingdom Battle Group currently deployed on operation Grapple 2 in Bosnia Herzegovina. Standing operating procedures for the initial assessment and resuscitation of all casualties are based on the protocols taught on Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) and Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support (BATLS) courses. These protocols dictate a period of initial assessment and resuscitation with the casualty immobilised in the supine position. Recent experience in casualty management at MST Bravo has identified inadvertent spinal movement taking place during removal of Combat Body Armour Lightweight (CBA) which might have detrimental effects for casualties with occult spinal injury. This has led to an appraisal of CBA removal and the identification of a drill for rapid, safe and reliable means of undressing without jeopardy to the integrity of the spine. The method is described.","1833":"The origins of aeromedical transport lie in the ferrying of wounded soldiers to hospital. This paper outlines the history of aeromedical evacuation and examines American military and civil experience.","1834":"This paper presents the results of an audit undertaken one year after the introduction of ENT day-case surgery at a military hospital. Day-case surgery was introduced to use spare operating time in order to reduce the ENT waiting list. One year after the introduction of day-case surgery there was no difference in the total operating time (267 vs 268 hours) compared to the previous year. There had been 67 more operations performed and the average number of completed weeks on the waiting list had fallen from 13.76 to 5.67 weeks. The administration of day-case surgery is discussed. The results of a survey of local general practitioners' awareness of day-case surgery is also presented.","1835":"A General Practitioner (GP) completed, fee earning, medical questionnaire was obtained for 444 potential Army recruits and compared with the examination findings of Army Careers Information Office Medical Officers (ACIO MOs), recorded on the FMed 1. It was found that 34 (8%) of the GPs reported a condition that precluded military service. Fourteen of those candidates denied the medical problem on their FMed 1 and remained undetected. Twenty candidates declared their condition but only 6 were rejected, 6 were referred for a specialist opinion and 8 were passed fit. This represents a 60% detection rate among declared problems and nil among concealed ones. If a GP questionnaire were available for all candidates and the same detection rate achieved, there would be a 1.8% increase in rejections at the pre-employment medical selection. The GP questionnaires would cost approximately L400,000 each year. There should however be a compensating reduction in individual requests for GP reports by the ACIO MOs and inappropriate specialist referrals. A drop of 1.8% in recruit medical discharges would save pounds 5,700,000 annually. This study recommends obtaining a GP medical questionnaire for all candidates applying to join the Army.","1836":"In spite of considerable progress in prevention, heat illness remains a significant occupational risk in the Services. A retrospective analysis of cases reported through the Defence Analytical Services Agency for the years 1981-91 shows higher numbers in the second part of this period, though this may be due to reporting differences. Overall, there was an average of 135 servicemen and women admitted to hospital each year for heat-related conditions though only 15.5 of them required sick leave for more than a week. Annual incidence was higher in the Army (73 per 100,000) than in the RN (14) and the RAF (5). Tri-service incidence was 42 per 100,000 for males and 11 for females. There were 11 deaths, all in the Army, but only 5 servicemen were discharged because of heat illness. Although the largest number of cases was reported from Great Britain, the incidence of cases in troops in Hong Kong and Cyprus was greater. In all locations, cases occurred in the coldest part of the year, but were commoner in the warmer months. Heat exhaustion (73.6%) seems more frequent than heat stroke (13%), but there are problems with definition and reporting. Current preventive measures are outlined and suggestions are made for more accurate monitoring of heat illness in the future. In the light of recent literature, recommendations are made for the grading and management of servicemen following heat illness.","1837":"","1838":"Attention is drawn to a possible deficiency in the folding pole canvas stretcher. Canvas tensioning and uniformity of support in the variety of stretcher where the canvas is attached by screws and metal strips was noted to be defective. High interface pressures were found on this type of stretcher, a problem not encountered in stretchers where the canvas tensioning is with regularly spaced tacks. Patients supported on the screw and strip variety may be at a higher risk of pressure necrosis.","1839":"A prospective study was undertaken to assess and monitor the effects of oil pollution in soldiers exposed in Kuwait in 1991 after Op Granby. One hundred and twenty five soldiers were monitored over a five month period by measurement of Forced Expiratory Volume (in one second) (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Although no demonstrable changes were observed, this study has gone some way to filling the gap in research in this environmentally sensitive field.","1840":"Between 1977 and 1988 144 patients with tumours of testicular origin were referred to the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital at Woolwich. 140 of these were malignant and all but two were treated and followed. Three of the malignant lesions appeared to be extragonadal. During the 12 year period staging has become increasingly accurate and treatment protocols have improved. These changes are reflected in this series. Ten deaths from tumour occurred (6.9%) but only one of these in the last three years of the study period despite an increasing case load at the time. The clinical presentation, treatment, and results of treatment are presented and the advances of treatment and improvement of prognosis discussed.","1841":"","1842":"","1843":"","1844":"","1845":"A case of appendicitis which resulted in portal pyaemia, hepatic and splenic abscesses, presumed portal vein thrombosis and subsequent portal hypertension is described. It confirms the merit of ultrasonic imaging in monitoring abscess resolution but questions the ability of the technique to recognise acute suppurative portal endophlebitis.","1846":"A 38 year old Caucasian lady presented with a history of vague ill health, raised ESR and prolonged P-R interval on ECG. These features became normal within a week. Contrary to the usual presentation, this patient developed fleeting arthritis, one of the major diagnostic features of rheumatic fever, towards the end of her illness. It is important to recognise such variants of rheumatic fever, even in retrospect, for the sake of giving penicillin prophylaxis to prevent cardiac morbidity.","1847":"Bilateral Testicular tumours are rare. A teratoma followed by a seminoma is one of the most uncommon forms of presentation. A case is described in a 29 year old soldier with a review of the literature and a discussion of the problems associated with diagnosis.","1848":"General Practitioners catering for Service families need to be aware of the multiple influences on patients consultation. The children who attend frequently are those who have already been ill and those that attend a nursery school. The mother is influential if she has had experience in looking after children, if she has had employment out of the home and if her formal education was poor. The psychological state of the mother has been shown to have an impact and to be linked to the childhood consultation rate. This psychological state could well be influenced by frequent life events such as moving house and absence from the home of the spouse.","1849":"Cardiac arrhythmias are a recognized cause of transient alteration of consciousness and unless suspected, a cardiac aetiology for apparent neurological symptoms may be overlooked. We retrospectively assessed the variation in the investigations of 122 patients who were referred to our hospital over a twelve month period for assessment of transient alteration of consciousness and we attempted to identify any factors which might have influenced the clinical outcome for these individuals. Eighteen patients were initially referred for cardiological opinion and 104 for neurological assessment. Sixty-one patients presented with syncope, 43 with seizures, and 18 with presyncope. A baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) was obtained in 104 (85%) and 65 (53%) were also subjected to a stress EEG. Cerebral dysrhythmia was documented in 14 patients. A standard electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded in only 71 (58%) and sinus bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 60\/min) was observed in 34. Twenty-four hour (Holter) ECGs were recorded in only 58 (48%). Ventricular pauses (at least 1.84 seconds) and\/or profound bradycardia (heart rate &lt; 40\/min) occurred during waking hours in 10 patients and were more likely to be detected in individuals who also exhibited bradycardia on standard ECG (8 patients) (p &lt; 0.05). After six months, 35 (29%) of the 122 patients still lacked a diagnosis and although cerebral dysrhythmia had been diagnosed with equal frequency in the bradycardia and non-bradycardia groups, 21 (62%) of those with bradycardia were still symptomatic compared with 11 (30%) of the non-bradycardia group (p &lt; 0.02). Our findings indicate that, at present, investigation of patients with transient altered consciousness lacks a coordinated approach and bradycardia may influence the diagnosis and morbidity of these individuals. We suggest that greater attention should be paid to possible cardiac causes of transient altered consciousness and that only under joint direction of a cardiologist and a neurologist can efficient and thorough investigation of these patients be realised.","1850":null,"1851":"Twenty-three patients (22 soldiers and 1 civilian) were admitted to the Cambridge Military Hospital between May 1990 and May 1992 with chronic inversion instability of an ankle and underwent Watson-Jones Tenodesis. A retrospective study was carried out to evaluate their results.","1852":"It is often considered that where nasal obstruction can be attributed to the presence of nasal polyps that the diagnostic process is at an end. The fact that the majority of simple nasal polyps are benign reinforces this view. Linked with this, the fact that the majority of serving soldiers are healthy, may lead the unwary into not suspecting some of the other types of nasal polyp.","1853":"Aedes albopictus is an important and widespread vector of dengue in many tropical countries. Its eggs and larvae are readily transported in commodities, such as old vehicle tyres, to many temperate regions, where it is able to survive and breed. It could thus become a serious health threat in Europe.","1854":"A method of comparing the quality of intestinal anastomoses performed in craft workshops is described. The equipment is readily available in any hospital, inexpensive and requires no technical construction. The apparatus accurately measures the intraluminal pressure at the first sign of anastomotic leak and a method of deriving the wall tension is explained. Calculation of wall tension at the point of failure allows comparison of anastomoses of different size. An instructor can therefore monitor the improvement of an individual trainee or rank a class according to the quality of their anastomoses.","1855":"The use of antibiotic impregnated beads has been shown to be a valuable adjunct in the prevention of infection in open fractures. The bead pouch technique employs these beads within the wound, producing high local levels of antibiotic in a moist environment. This effectively inhibits bacterial colonisation and wound infection whilst preventing desiccation of structures such as bone and tendons. This technique can be used to manage wounds until soft tissue cover is obtained, whether by delayed primary suture or by plastic surgical means. The potential use in acute military surgery includes the management of wounds associated with fractures, damage to tendons or neuro-vascular injury. In such cases delay in soft tissue cover may be clinically necessary or dictated by casualty evacuation to rearward surgical facilities. The bead pouch technique offers a means of managing the wound between initial wound surgery and soft tissue cover.","1856":"","1857":"Twenty-five patients suffering from chronic South American Trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) were clinically compared with matched controls. Four of the chagasic patients provided histories of mild sensory neuropathies and on clinical examination were found to have impaired light touch sensation, vibration sense and two point discrimination. Other conditions which could have caused this neurological impairment were excluded. This is the first study to provide evidence of a detectable clinical neuropathy in chronic Chagas disease. Although this was only a limited study carried out during a medical school elective, it correlates well with the preliminary, and as yet unpublished, findings of a much larger study being carried out in Buenos Aires by Professor R E P Sica.","1858":"The long term military careers of soldiers who had completed an in-patient alcohol treatment programme in 1983 were examined. Compared to a matched control group, soldiers who had received treatment served for a significantly shorter time post-treatment. Only 40% of the treatment group were discharged from the service on normal grounds. It is suggested that post-treatment career provides a useful outcome measure and indicates that even after extensive inpatient treatment, the results are poor.","1859":"","1860":"Cholera was first recorded in the Indian sub-continent in 1817 from where pandemics reached Europe via trade and pilgrim routes. Notwithstanding the numerous therapeutic methods prescribed, the virulence of cholera remained unabated.

The important early symptoms and signs of this life threatening infection, and the need for urgent treatment with aggressive surgical debridement and broad spectrum antibiotics, are emphasised in order to facilitate early recognition and prompt initiation of the appropriate therapy in future cases.","1865":"Combat stress reactions may present in many forms. This study presents three cases from the Gulf War which illustrate the diversity of presentation and demonstrate the ways in which the principles of the management of Combat Stress Reactions--Proximity, Immediacy and Expectancy--can be combined with specific individual therapies.","1866":"","1867":"Acetic acid was used topically at concentrations of between 0.5% and 5% to eliminate Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the burn wounds or soft tissue wounds of 16 patients. In-vitro studies indicated the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to acetic acid; all strains exhibited a minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 per cent. P. aeruginosa was eliminated from the wounds of 14 of the 16 patients within two weeks of treatment. Acetic acid was shown to be an inexpensive and efficient agent for the elimination of P. aeruginosa from burn and soft tissue wounds.","1868":"During the Gulf War a number of subjects presented with panic, hyperventilation, and inability to wear respirators when chemical alarms were sounded, despite a perceived real chemical threat. Twenty-five such sufferers were seen at the Psychiatric Department of 33 General (Surgical) Hospital. This paper considers the aetiology of such responses, describes a mode of treatment which can be used in the threat situation, and considers issues of future training.","1869":"","1870":"","1871":"We describe a case of malignant duodenocolic fistula in which after a radical resection of right hemicolectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy, the duodenal defect was reconstructed using a conduit of transposed ileum. This technique, not previously described, offers an alternative to 'duodenal patching', which allows only limited duodenal resection, or gastroenterostomy with its attendant side-effects such as dumping syndrome.","1872":"Non-medical prescribing is increasingly being seen as a cost effective option by both the government and paramedical professional bodies. The use of potentially dangerous preparations in a wide range of clinical settings is not without danger, as illustrated by this case of facial palsy associated with the use of a proprietary brand of wax softener in an ear with a perforated ear drum.","1873":"","1874":"","1875":"","1876":"","1877":"","1878":"","1879":"","1880":"A case of basal cell naevus syndrome is presented.

The importance of identifying this syndrome is discussed and its presentation in the Falkland Islands is reported.","1881":"'Nairobi Eye' is a condition caused by a blister beetle, Paederus eximius, found in Northern Kenya. It has not previously been described as a hazard for troops exercising in this area. Four cases are described. Recommended management is to wash the contact area initially with soap and water, and to treat subsequent lesions with flamazine.","1882":"Recurrent pyogenic meningitis is uncommon. Its aetiology is often associated with impaired host defence mechanisms. Two such examples are discussed. Case 1 resulted from an anatomical defect and Case 2 a defect of the complement system.","1883":"The tick responsible for Lyme disease is common in areas inhabited by deer. This should theoretically put military personnel at increased risk. A history of tick bite is uncommon and the characteristic skin rash often absent. Two examples of servicemen with neurological Lyme disease without cutaneous manifestations are discussed, and six other cases referred to the RAF Institute of Pathology and Tropical Medicine since 1987 briefly reviewed. Five of the cases contracted the disease in Germany and four were dependents. Lyme disease is under-recognised and under-reported, so that the scale of the problem cannot be determined. It is recommended that wooded areas inhabited by deer should not be frequented without adequate clothing, particularly in the early summer months when tick activity is at its greatest.","1884":"","1885":"","1886":"","1887":"","1888":"Brucellosis (also known as Malta, Mediterranean or Undulant Fever) has aptly been nicknamed the Corps Disease because of the major role played by the Royal Army Medical Corps in elucidating its nature and discovering its mode of spread, thus leading to its prevention and eradication. This history of brucellosis, incorporating a complete bibliography of all references to the disease in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps from 1903 to 1992, documents the fascinating story of this association.","1889":"A case is presented of tension pneumothorax associated with intercostal tube drainage. Complications of intercostal tube drainage are reviewed.","1890":"We describe the case of a 23 year old male who presented with a history of intermittent pyrexia associated with apparent episodic loss of consciousness. During these events, thermometers placed in the rectum and axillae supported the elevated oral temperature readings.

All patients were male, alcohol was the aetiological factor in 90%, the mean age at diagnosis was 30 and the commonest mode of presentation was with recurrent painful episodes of pancreatitis. Endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency occurred in a quarter and a third of patients respectively and one third required surgical intervention.","1893":"Many studies have drawn attention to deficiencies in the management of major trauma, both in the UK and elsewhere. One area that has received little attention is the documentation of such cases in the Emergency Room. When outcome may be sub-optimal, documentation assumes greater importance if advances are to be made in the organisation of trauma care. Based upon the American College of Surgeons Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocols, the authors have designed a document that records dynamically what happens to the multiply injured victim on arrival in the Emergency Room. It unifies the recording of vital signs, whilst acting as an assessment and resuscitation template. By ensuring no life-threatening illness is missed it is likely to improve patient survival. The document can act as a basis for teaching and a medico-legal record, whilst providing the necessary data for quality assurance and outcome audit.","1894":"One hundred and sixty five officer cadets completed a 6 month physical training programme; 47 (28%) were smokers and 118 (72%) were not. Improvements in fitness were measured by the Army Personal Fitness Assessment (APFA) which scores for both strength and endurance. Initially both groups had similar APFA scores [mean (SEM)]: smokers 114 (3.1), non smokers 120 (2.3), difference not significant. Six months later both groups had improved their scores: smokers 131 (2.7), non smokers 143 (2.3), but the smokers were now significantly less fit (p &lt; 0.01). The British Army needs a more effective anti smoking policy as 50% of young soldiers continue to smoke, and have an increased risk of premature ischaemic heart disease when compared with their civilian counterparts. Physical fitness remains important in the Army and evidence such as this may help persuade soldiers to give up smoking before standard tests of cardiovascular or lung function show any abnormalities, with benefits for the future health of the Army.","1895":"","1896":"Tracheobronchomalacia is a rare cause of respiratory distress in children. An infant with tracheobronchomalacia is presented. The aetiology, pathophysiology and management are discussed.","1897":"An eight year old girl who probably inhaled gastric contents during surgery for cleft palate repair was ventilated for 10 days in the post-operative recovery area on board the Mercy Ship Anastasis with pulse oximetry as the only monitor of oxygenation. She walked off the ship on the seventeenth day.","1898":"The incidence of post-operative wound infections in Belize in 1986 and 1987 was studied. Both military practice in the military hospital and civilian practice in the rural hospitals of the local towns were included. Despite previous misgivings and sub-optimal conditions in the rural hospitals an acceptably low incidence was found in both areas of work.","1899":"The heights and weights of Army recruits have been placed on record since 1860 in Reports of the Army Medical Department with certain gaps, particularly during the two World Wars and the period between them, until their publication was discontinued in 1975. Mean values corrected where necessary for minimum standards of height and weight--in order that the results should represent the civilian population from which they were drawn--are presented, showing the trends over a century. The Quetelet index w\/h2, an indicator of weight corrected for height, is recommended as a measure of obesity for the Army. The value to the Army Medical Services of a continuously published record of heights and weights is assessed, and the hope is expressed that publication of these data will be recommenced.","1900":"A cross sectional survey of 581 TA personnel from Wales, the Midlands and Scotland was performed. The aim was to determine their hearing levels, to attempt to relate any degree of noise induced hearing loss detected with military, occupational and leisure noise and to make recommendations to improve the existing Army Hearing Conservation Programme. Each subject answered a questionnaire, had a clinical examination of each ear and pure tone audiometry. The hearing acuity of the TA group as a whole was similar to the regulars in the lower H gradings but there was a worrying number of H4\/8 (5.6%) who had not been picked up before on routine screening and would probably have been discharged if they were in the Regular Army.","1901":"A study was performed at the Garrison Medical Centre, Larkhill to assess the incidence of skin tattoos in a sample of soldiers. The soldiers were questioned with the aim of establishing where they had had their tattoos done, identifying any factors involved in becoming tattooed and assessing what proportion later regretted their actions. The study included 450 male soldiers. Assessment was by a questionnaire completed in the medical centre waiting room. Overall 44% of the soldiers questioned were tattooed. Most (85.7%) had had tattoos done by recognised artists in the United Kingdom. Younger soldiers had a significantly higher incidence of 'home made' tattoos. Peer pressure was identified as an important influence on the decision to become tattooed. 31.1% of tattooed soldiers regretted their tattoos. This figure rose to 44.6% in those over 26 years old. The author advocates increased education to encourage the young soldier to think hard about its implications before becoming tattooed.","1902":"In a survey of the smoking habits of over 6,000 young soldiers, it was found that the prevalence of regular smoking was 45%. Though the prevalence of regular smoking in young soldiers is higher than the general prevalence rate for smoking in 16 to 19-year olds in the civilian population, the excess is considered to be a reflection of the social and geographical background of Army recruits. The survey found that young soldiers who smoke, smoke heavily. Eighty two percent smoked more than 20 cigarettes per week, 58% more than 40 cigarettes per week. This is higher than has been recorded by any previous survey of young soldiers. The proportion of young soldiers who have never smoked has risen markedly over the years. This survey found that 34% had never smoked.","1903":"","1904":"","1905":"","1906":"","1907":"","1908":"","1909":"","1910":"Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare, benign but aggressive tumour of the nasopharynx. It occurs primarily in male adolescents. The usual presentation is either nasal obstruction or epistaxis. We present a case with complete nasal obstruction of short duration. The management is discussed with reference to the literature. Because this tumour tends to occur in men in their second decade it is an important disease to consider in soldiers.","1911":"The 61 personnel, 60 male, evacuated from the Gulf to Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital on medical grounds between late October 1990 and mid March 1991 are reviewed with particular regard to previous medical history, previous medication, and appropriate PULHHEEMS grading. The percentage evacuated was 0.24% of Army personnel involved in \"Operation Granby\" which is considered acceptably small.","1912":"","1913":"","1914":"","1915":"","1916":"","1917":"A premature neonate with a severe form of Bartter's Syndrome is presented. Clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of Bartter's Syndrome are discussed.","1918":"A case of testicular epidermoid cyst which had initially been misdiagnosed as a malignant testicular tumour is presented. The role of clinical and ultrasound examination in the pre-operative assessment is discussed. Although the benign nature of this condition must be demonstrated histologically before conservative surgery is contemplated, it is equally important that the patient should not be told that the tumour is malignant without adequate evidence.","1919":"A case of systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) affecting the heart, joints, skin and kidneys is reported. Antinuclear antibodies were insignificant at presentation. Diagnosis was only possible with passage of time and renal biopsy.","1920":"A severe case of Weil's disease is presented. The particular relevance of this condition to the Armed Forces and Service physicians is discussed, together with methods of diagnosis.","1921":"Malignant melanoma is becoming more common. 'Curable' early, the prognosis worsens quickly with depth and stage. Publicity in Hong Kong led to an increase in the referral and excision rates for 'benign' pigmented lesions. These excisions yielded 5% (3\/61) malignant melanomas. It is suggested that aggressive policies of publicity and excision are justified, along with advice on prevention targeted at known high risk groups.","1922":"","1923":"In a prospective trial, 10 patients underwent inter-fragmentary screws and external fixation for unilateral tibial shaft fractures. Anatomical reduction was achieved in all cases and uncomplicated bone union occurred in nine patients with a mean time to union of 122 (SD 20) days. One patient had delayed union and the fracture malunited. A 20% pin tract sepsis rate was encountered. The high risk of infection, the demanding follow-up and availability of better methods, does not allow this technique to be recommended in the routine treatment of closed tibial diaphysial fractures.","1924":"Clinical confusion, treatment failure and recurrence commonly plague the Management of Otitis Externa. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical attitudes and habits of army general practitioners and to review the recent literature. The results of a questionnaire survey showed that although all the respondents agreed that aural toilet was important, only 50% felt confident in performing aural toilet and packing. There also appeared to be much greater scope for the use of astringents and effective preventative measures in addition to aural toilet. The discussion emphasises and need for careful selection of the most appropriate topical agent, whilst highlighting the roles of practical procedures, bacteriology and prevention. A practical guide to diagnosis and management is offered with the aid of illustrations and an algorithm.","1925":"The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and degree of distress among military personnel following their experiences during Operation Orderly in London District. A questionnaire was distributed at the end of the deployment which inquired about distressing experiences. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) were included to provide an objective measure of the distress. Thirty two per cent of respondents admitted to distressing experiences, of these a subgroup (20.5%) who were more severely distressed welcomed the opportunity to discuss their experiences.","1926":"A total of 3886 civilian candidates were medically examined for entry to the Army during the period 1980 to 1990. Eight per cent of the candidates failed their examination. The commonest causes for rejection were back and knee disorders, the majority associated with trauma. The next most common disorder was hearing loss, closely followed by myopia. Analysis of the incidence of individual conditions showed that only hearing loss and myopia were more prevalent than spondylolisthesis. It is felt, therefore, that consideration should be given to the routine radiographic screening of all candidates for spondylolisthesis and indeed for spondylolysis. The incidence of medical conditions was low. In the assessment of the individual's fitness for entry, the effects of military training and service in the field on his or her functional capacity must be considered. Problems that may arise when a candidate is rejected are discussed.","1927":"A survey has shown that many women favour eliminating menstruation and it has been suggested that therapeutic induction of amenorrhoea might be an advantage in female personnel mobilised for war. The traditional method has been to take the oral contraceptive pill continuously. This produces weight gain and other side-effects; spotting and breakthrough bleeding can be a problem initially. The method is however cheap. The Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) analogue, goserelin, is extremely effective, produces less side-effects, but it is very expensive. Two synthetic steroids, danazol and gestrinone, are moderately effective, have a variety of prominent side-effects and are also quite expensive. With all these drugs normal menstruation resumes in the cycle after they are discontinued. Although goserelin has many advantages over the continuously taken contraceptive pill, its cost precludes it from consideration as a means of eliminating menstruation. The Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) of the UK is considering offering women in the Army the option of inducing amenorrhea especially those in war.  Logistics problems of supplying sufficient sanitary protection makes inducing amenorrhea in these women an advantage.  It is important that the Royal Army not force servicewomen ready for war to agree to chemical induction of amenorrhea, however.  A survey of civilian women shows that 80% liked the notion of eliminating menstruation.  continuous combined oral contraceptive (COC) therapy induces amenorrhea, but it poses some side effects including bleeding and spotting, 2 kg weight gain, breast tenderness, depression, and headaches.  12 weeks of COC therapy costs range form 2 to 6 pounds.  The synthetic androgen used to treat endometriosis, danazol, may also induce amenorrhea at daily doses of 800 mg.  It causes various side effects including reduced breast size, flushing, sweating, loss of libido, acne, weight gain, edema, hirsutism, and voice change.  12-week danazol therapy costs about 200 pounds.  Another drug with androgenic, antigonadotrophic, antiestrogenic, and antiprogestogenic properties which is also used to treat endometriosis, gestrinone, in another possible amenorrhea inducer at 2 doses of 2.5-5 mg\/week.  Side effects are similar to those of danazol.  In 1 study, all 20 patients developed acne and seborrhea.  Its 12 week costs are considerably more than danazol and COC therapy (450 pounds).  Intermittent administration of 2 gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, buserelin and goserelin, suppresses production of gonadotropins.  Health workers need to inject 3.6 mg goserelin every 28 days while they administer buserelin subcutaneously or intranasally. the leading side effect on both GnRH analogues is not flushes.  12-week therapy is about 375 pounds.  Fertility is restored after discontinuation of all the aforementioned therapies.  The GnRH analogue goserelin is the most effective therapy, but the cost factor causes the Royal Army to favor COCs.

The development of chloroquine resistant in West Africa has further compounded the risk. Two cases of falciparum malaria from Sierra Leone are presented. One represents the classic missed case and the other a probable case of chloroquine resistant (RI vide infra) falciparum malaria. These cases highlight the danger of the missed or late diagnosis; the need for chemoprophylaxis, even in emigrants; the threat posed to the international traveller by malaria; and the problem of chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum (CRPF) malaria from West Africa. The position of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in West Africa is reviewed along with the problem caused by chloroquine resistance.","1936":"A rare case of trans-radial styloid, trans-scaphoid, trans-triquetral perilunate dislocation is described. The injury was treated by reduction and internal fixation using a Herbert screw and Kirschner wire. A good functional result was achieved. A review of the literature illustrates that early surgery is recommended. Alternative surgical approaches are discussed.","1937":"Closed traumatic rupture of the biceps brachii has not been reported occurring to a British military parachutist. This paper describes such an injury to a British military parachutist using United States (US) Army equipment and procedures. The discussion highlights differences between British Army and US Army equipment and procedures which make the chances of this injury occurring to a British paratrooper very small.","1938":"The use of the Triservice Anaesthetic Apparatus for the emergency evacuation of an anaesthetised patient from nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) collective protection in a tented hospital complex in the Gulf is described. Because of its compact size and portability the Triservice Anaesthetic Apparatus may prove to be ideal for use in emergency evacuation.","1939":"","1940":"A review is presented of past and present records of injuries caused by these fish with particular reference to the occasional fatalities that have ensued. The wide geographical range of species of both types indicate a variety of current Service postings where such injuries can be sustained.

Means of reducing the number of preventable deaths are discussed.","1942":"The case notes of patients admitted with loss of consciousness (LOC) to BMH Rinteln over 18 months were retrospectively studied. Forty percent of those diagnosed as epileptic were heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers. This paper audits the criteria for diagnosis and discusses its implications on the soldier's career.","1943":"","1944":"Fifty-eight cases of snake bite seen at the British Military Hospital, Dharan, Nepal during 1989 were studied prospectively. Data is presented on the epidemiology and outcome of snake bite in this area of lowland Nepal with details of the age and sex of patients, date and time of bite, delay in arrival at hospital, use of tourniquets, circumstances of the bite, and snake identification. Neurotoxicity due to envenomation was recorded in 11 patients. No case of coagulopathy was recorded. The overall case fatality was 5.2% but mortality amongst those exhibiting signs of neurotoxicity was 27.3%.","1945":"A retrospective study of 34,236 consecutive static line parachute descents by trained parachutists, in which 379 were injured, is described. Injury rates associated with extrinsic factors were compared and then analyzed using logistic regression. A table describing the association with extrinsic factors, with relative risks, is at Annex A. The overall injury rate was 1.11% (1.11 injured per 100 descents). Rates from Helicopter (0.20%) and Balloon (0.13%) were low, and the study thus concentrated on aeroplane descents (injury rate 1.46%). Extrinsic factors associated with increased injury rates were carriage of equipment; wind speed and direction; numbers exiting and (on logistic regression) night descents. The overall rates appear higher than expected, possibly due to equipment weight potentiating the other factors. A prospective study is required to investigate the effect of equipment weight after which peace time training constraints should be reviewed. (Two approaches are described.)","1946":"","1947":"A case of dental sepsis is presented which resulted in a deep neck infection and eventually caused a mediastinal abscess. The microbiology of such a mixed infection is briefly discussed with emphasis on the synergistic activity of the organisms. The anatomy of the fascial spaces is also described to draw attention to the possible routes of spread of this potentially life threatening condition.","1948":"A pilonidal sinus developed in the superio-medial aspect of the thigh of an above-knee amputee. This is an unusual site for the condition to develop. We suggest that the same aetiological factors that were responsible for the \"Jeep Bottom\" of World War II were also responsible for this problem in the amputation stump of a Falklands campaign casualty.","1949":"A retrospective analysis of 732 consecutive deliveries at this hospital was undertaken to see if the early (15-20 weeks) pregnancy ultrasound placental localisation was of value, and whether the diagnosis of low-lying placenta warranted a repeat scan. The placental site was reported as normal in 413 pregnancies, as low-lying in 79 and was not recorded in 240. None of the women with a low-lying placenta developed placenta praevia. There were no significant differences in pregnancy outcome between those women with a low-lying placenta and those in whom it was normally situated. The ultrasound diagnosis of low-lying placenta between 15 and 20 weeks gestation does not warrant a repeat scan.","1950":"An anonymous, self administered health questionnaire survey of the habits and attitudes of servicemen in the 3 Services was conducted. The overall response rate was 75%. This paper reports the results of questions on smoking. The Army had the greatest percentage of smokers, smoked most heavily and had the worst attitude to smoking of the 3 Services. The RAF had the best results in these fields. There was a higher percentage of smoker, who smoke more heavily in Germany\/seadraft than UK\/shoredraft. There was a rank gradient in percentage smokers, with the lowest ranks smoking the most. A sizeable proportion of the smoking population wish to give up, have tried to do so and feel their Medical Officer should be interested in their smoking habits. A reduction in prevalence of cigarette smoking to less than 30% within 5 years is recommended as a Tri-service Health Policy Goal, with the Army, Tri-Service 16-20 year olds and Private-Corporal rank equivalents and recruits, as specific target groups for intervention. The health promotion strategy should include concerted anti-smoking advice from Medical Officers.","1951":"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of patellectomy on the service career of soldiers. Information on 184 individuals on whom patellectomy was performed between 1981 and 1986, was retrieved from computer records. The criterion for success of the operation was the recovery to a fully fit category. Fifty three patients (29%) regained full fitness. The outcome of patellectomies performed for chondromalacia patellae and osteoarthritis appears to be worse than that for patellar fractures.","1952":"Twenty two Army patients with synthetic (Gore-tex) anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions were reviewed (mean follow up 18 months). Reconstruction appeared to abolish the pivot shift sign in all cases, but some subjective instability persisted in all but 6 patients. Outcome was also assessed by medical (PULHHEEMS) grading: 6 patients were fully fit (graded L2), 7 returned to moderate activity but not full fitness (L3), and 9 remained severely incapacitated (L7 or L8) with 4 of this group being medically discharged. Specific operative complications included: prosthesis breakage (3 partial, 1 complete), infected prosthesis(1), and problems with the tibial screw(3). The range and frequency of complications was similar in other series. Physical fitness is an integral part of a soldier's job, placing particular demands on the knee and on surgical repair of knee injuries. Reports on the Gore-tex ACL prosthesis in other groups have been more encouraging, but there are difficulties in comparing this study with others. ACL insufficiency remains a serious problem, with implications for a soldier's fitness and career. The Gore-tex prosthesis improves stability but does not always allow a soldier to return to full fitness.","1953":"","1954":"","1955":"","1956":"","1957":"","1958":"","1959":"","1960":"One hundred and forty eight patients with bilateral symmetrically impacted lower third molars entered a clinical crossover trial to compare the effects on postoperative recovery of a Bismuth Iodoform Paraffin Paste (BIPP) socket dressing, primary closure using a resorbable suture (Softgut) and to ascertain if prophylactic metronidazole influenced the outcome. The results reaffirm the surgical principle that contaminated surgical wounds such as third molar sockets are best kept open with a dressing. Attempts at primary closure should be resisted if there is no intention to prescribe antibiotic cover. However, if a suitable antibiotic is taken then primary closure using a resorbable suture can be carried out with confidence. This may reduce the need for outpatient follow up.","1961":"A case of pleomorphic adenoma arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland is presented. Controversy often surrounds the management of a parotid lump, and many investigations are of little help. The first operation cures most salivary tumours and the patient usually has no residual disability. There is no place for the use of radiotherapy, in the treatment of pleomorphic adenoma.","1962":"","1963":"","1964":"","1965":"","1966":"Since Atkinson first described idiopathic rupture of a normal spleen in 1874, there has been controversy regarding the application of the terms \"idiopathic\" and \"spontaneous\". One such case is reported, and the validity of the description \"idiopathic\" or \"spontaneous\" discussed.","1967":"Tattoo removal from the forearm often requires excision and split skin grafting. The authors propose the use of a bloodless field to facilitate accurate dermal peeling, to ensure complete removal of the pigment, and to reduce operative time.","1968":"Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain which may mimic other causes of acute abdominal pain and result in unnecessary laparotomy. In many cases clues to the diagnosis are available prior to surgery; however a high index of suspicion must be maintained if the condition is to be identified at presentation. Two cases are described followed by a review of the disease entity.","1969":"A series of 12 neck space infections admitted to a military hospital in Germany in a 12 month period are presented. This represents an incidence of 1:1000 for the age group studied. The reappearance of the retropharyngeal abscess which has been rare since the widespread use of antibiotics, along with the generally high incidence of this group of infections, is probably a result of the more discriminating use of antibiotics in primary health care. The pitfalls in diagnosis and the preferred antibiotic cover are discussed.","1970":"Three hundred and twenty eight children of British servicemen serving in West Germany were studied in order to ascertain any relationship between parental smoking and the presence of middle ear effusion. The age range of the children was 18 months to 8 years. A questionnaire was completed by the parents of each child, and clinical examination and audiological tests demonstrated the presence or otherwise of middle ear effusions. One hundred and sixty four patients who had been referred with otological symptoms to the Ear, Nose and Throat Out Patient Department (ENT OPD) were surveyed, as were 164 other patients drawn from the Paediatric, Orthopaedic and Ophthalmic Out Patient Departments (OPDs) at BMH Rinteln. These 2 groups had similar age and sex distributions. The presence of middle ear effusions amongst children attending the ENT OPD was strongly associated with maternal cigarette smoking. This finding implies that mothers should not smoke at all in the same living accommodation as that used by their children. Paternal cigarette smoking showed no significant association with the presence of middle ear effusions.","1971":"","1972":"A two part study was carried out to identify the most cost-effective way of enhancing first aid in the British Army. There is a lack of co-ordination between a variety of training programmes for paramedical non-RAMC personnel. Questionnaires were used to ascertain the views of users and experts were asked their views on the requirement for first aid at point of wounding on the battlefield. Skills needed in addition to those currently taught to all soldiers were identified. These include the setting up of intravenous infusions, administration of analgesia and antibiotics and the recognition and treatment of battleshock.","1973":"Airborne operations may demand an intense level of activity prior to parachuting. In addition the movement of troops to the theatre of operations may well involve the crossing of several time zones. These factors may well deprive the troops of sleep. Furthermore, a parachute assault may well be at night leading to a long period without rest. Scheduled sleep may help ameliorate this sleep deprivation. Studies have shown that daytime sleep prior to overnight activity can improve performance. A study was undertaken to see whether temazepam would improve daytime sleep during a scheduled rest period compared to placebo. The results showed a significant increase in the average sleep period in the group taking 20mg and 10mg of temazepan compared to placebo. The quality of sleep was also improved yet there was no difference in subjective alertness between the groups six hours post ingestion.","1974":"A group of non goitrous, potential Gurkha army recruits were tested in Nepal for serum free triiodothyronine (fT3), free thyroxine (fT4) and thyrotropin (TSH) concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the men were recruited into the army and urine samples taken for analysis of iodine and creatinine. Twenty per cent of the recruits underwent thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation tests. After ten months basic training on a diet considered to be iodine sufficient, the tests were repeated on the same men. The results were also compared to army recruits in the UK. All the potential Gurkha recruits had higher serum levels of thyroid hormones than the UK recruits. Some regional differences were found with those men from the Western recruiting depot having lower fT4 and higher TSH concentrations. Urinary iodine and creatinine concentrations showed evidence of slight relative malnutrition and iodine deficiency which was more pronounced in the Western depot. TRH stimulation tests showed no evidence of thyroid dysfunction but highlighted the differences between the Eastern and Western groups. After ten months on an iodine sufficient diet the serum thyroid hormone concentrations became closer to those of the UK recruits, showing any differences to be reversible. The results from the two Gurkha groups became similar which was reflected in the urine analysis results.","1975":"A multi disciplinary team furthered the collaborative study of acute encephalitis in southeastern Nepal during a major epidemic which occurred in the monsoon period of 1986. Viral studies of serum and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) confirmed Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) as the causative agent. Analysis of epidemiologic data suggests recent introduction of the virus to the regional population. Children accounted for the majority of all hospital admissions and had a markedly lower fatality rate from the infection than adults. Unfavourable prognostic indicators identified include a reduced conscious level on admission to hospital and a low serum or CSF IgM response to JEV.","1976":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast is a malignant tumour of significant incidence with a better prognosis than histologically identical tumours occurring in other sites and as compared to other malignant tumours of the breast. The recognition of the tumour is important especially in the management of the individual patient but also in furthering understanding of growth, spread and biological behaviour of tumours.","1977":"The cases of four male patients with severe cardiac failure due to ischaemic heart disease are presented. They were selected on the basis of their wide variation in response to the intravenous administration of enoximone, an haemodynamic stimulant licensed recently. They serve to emphasize the need for close haemodynamic and electrocardiographic monitoring in a unit with appropriate facilities for remedial action if adverse responses occur when this drug is employed.","1978":"","1979":"","1980":"","1981":"Major conflicts in history have yielded an equal number of medical casualties as those injured in battle, and no more common a problem exists in the insanitary conditions of war as dysentery. The complication of arthritis following dysentery has been documented since ancient times, but it is not until the 16th Century that these cases appear in any numbers, and then it is predominantly in military personnel. \"Reiter's Disease\" is currently understood to mean an asymmetrical, predominantly lower-limb polyarthritis developing after urethritis (usually non-gonococcal) or dysentery; conjunctivitis is not always a constant feature. This is the commonest inflammatory polyarthropathy of young men and both the epidemic (dysenteric) and sporadic (venereal) forms are historically prevalent in soldiers--a not surprising fact considering the squalor of war and the unrestrained behaviour of the Private soldier. This paper traces the history of Reiter's disease and highlights its affinity for military populations.","1982":"Nosebleeds are exceedingly common, and usually idiopathic. Cautery under local anaesthetic to the vessels of the nasal septum is often used successfully as a treatment for the recurrent condition. However, rarely, a nosebleed may be a symptom of a more serious underlying disorder and a suitable history and examination are required.","1983":"Since its initial description in 1951 many variants of Munchausen's Syndrome have been described. This present case report is of a patient who adopts military rank in order to gain admission to a service hospital: a case of Military Munchausen's Syndrome.","1984":"A retrospective study was undertaken of all epidurals inserted on the labour ward in BMH Rinteln from 1980 to 1985 inclusive, during which time both obstetricians and anaesthetists participated in providing an epidural service. It was impossible to show any difference between the expertise of anaesthetists and obstetricians in siting epidurals, when the incidence of complications or failed analgesia was compared. However, epidurals inserted by obstetricians were more likely to be converted to general anaesthetics for operative procedures than those inserted by anaesthetists, although no adequate explanation for this could be found. Given increasing patient demand for a 24-hour epidural service, and the logistic difficulties in Service hospitals of providing sufficient anaesthetic staff for this, obstetricians can be trained to help provide such a service.","1985":"Over a 15 month period, all the scripts written by doctors in the Episkopi Garrison Medical Centre, Cyprus, were analysed. A formulary was produced by using the most popular items in that 15 month period and tested in a one month trial period. The idea was to find a practical and efficient method of producing a 'basic' formulary to which items could be added or removed after discussion with colleagues.","1986":"A screening programme designed to detect visual defects in pre-school children was mounted in a Service community in West Germany. This showed the feasibility of screening and demonstrated that the results produced were superior to those of routine referral. The methods of findings are discussed.","1987":"The incidence of diabetes mellitus in the Services for 1978-88 is reviewed. Its influence on the Serviceman's career in the long and short term is discussed. Mortality and morbidity rates are low in the Services when compared with the general population, primarily because of the service demographic distribution. Problems with the discovery of asymptomatic diabetes and possible recommendations are discussed.","1988":"A prospective study of Nepalese adults (Gurkhas) based in Hong Kong who presented with adult-onset epileptiform seizures determined that cerebral cysticercosis was causative in 7 out of 8 cases. The relative roles of specific cysticercal serology and computerised axial tomography in diagnosis are discussed. Serum IgE levels were found to be raised in all patients with cerebral cysticercosis in the absence of other parasitic infection and reverted to normal after the patients were treated with praziquantel. Evidence suggests that the Gurkhas acquired their cysticercal infections in Nepal.","1989":"A study was made of recruit medical discharges in the British Army in 1988 with the aim of ascertaining the number of medical discharges amongst recruits. AFBs 6863 (Notification of Discharge of a Regular Recruit) were used as the source of data. Recruit medical wastage rate for 1988 was 897 cases, or 16.7% of all known discharges. Three types of medical discharges were present. Four hundred and ninety-six Type 1 or concealed discharges, (9.2% of discharges for all reasons) were made up of cases who had not been boarded and had mainly been discharged under QR 9.381 (defect of enlistment). Two hundred and seventy-five Type 2 discharges (5.1% of discharges for all reasons) represented boarded cases discharged under QR 9.385 (ceasing to fulfil medical requirements). One hundred and twenty-six Type 3 discharges (2.3% of all discharges) were boarded cases mainly discharged under QR 9.381 (defect of enlistment). As all discharges under paragraphs other than QR 9.385 are given administrative discharge outflow code, only the 275 Type 2 discharges (or 31.7% of medical discharges) appeared on the Army's own source of medical data, the TRIMEDS database. This had the effect of concealing the majority of those discharges caused by conditions predating enlistment therefore decreasing the number of known false negatives not detected at recruiting medicals. The biggest causes of discharge were conditions of the lower limbs and back (54.5% of medical discharges), a conglomerate of minor categories of pathology (14.6%), asthma (9.6%) and deformities (7.4%). Within each type the bulk of the discharges was concealed in Type 1 discharges especially for conditions predating enlistment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1990":"A year-long prospective study of injuries caused by armoured fighting vehicles on exercises in West Germany revealed that 2 soldiers were killed. Another 41 needed hospital admission for treatment of injuries of the lower limb (16), upper limb (15), head (8) and back (2). Tank loader\/signallers were peculiarly susceptible to severe leg injuries, due to the ankle being trapped and twisted by the turret rotating within the hull. Insecure, falling hatch covers accounted for many of the hand, head and back injuries. Soldiers in training need to be made more aware of these particular hazards. Reduced caution would make injuries such as these more common during armoured warfare, and their statistics should be included in casualty estimates.","1991":"","1992":"A young male presented with acute cervico-facial swelling and loss of consciousness, following ingestion of barracuda flesh. He recovered after administration of anti-histamines and steroids. Toxicity associated with barracuda is discussed.","1993":"Changes in thoracic electrical bioimpedance during the cardiac cycle have been related to the ejection of the stroke volume of blood during cardiac systole. Refinements in the recording and analysis of these changes permit estimation of cardiac output. Encouraging reports comparing results obtained by this method and those obtained simultaneously using the current standard invasive method have been published. While there are limitations, the advantages of this technique are sufficient to make bioimpedance cardiography attractive to the military physician. It is for these reasons that the principles of this technology are reviewed in this paper.","1994":"","1995":"Two years have passed since the worst firearms incident in recent British civil history. Most of the casualties were managed at a local district general hospital; this experience was reported soon afterwards. Two casualties were managed at Princess Alexandra's Hospital, RAF Wroughton; both are still under review. This paper describes their injuries, investigations and treatment. Current thoughts on optimal management are discussed; areas of particular controversy are highlighted.","1996":"","1997":"","1998":"","1999":"","2000":"","2001":"The results of hospital admissions for adder bite suffered by British Army personnel were reviewed over a ten year period. They confirmed the low bite rate and the risk factors previously demonstrated in earlier studies. In particular, the dangers of handling and attempting to catch the snake were highlighted. Also illustrated was a general ill-preparedness by clinicians to manage the condition. In this connection, the use of specific Zagreb anti-venom preparation for cases of severe poisoning is advocated, as is admission to hospital for assessment and appropriate monitoring. Adder bite is both unusual and unpredictable so caution needs to be exercised in the initial clinical appraisal.","2002":"","2003":"","2004":"A retrospective study was made of 309 randomly selected potential service recruits seen over five years by different consultant physicians in an Army hospital. Only nine of 133 referred with a history of asthma were turned down because of an abnormality in their exercise lung function test. Only four of 92 referred for a systolic heart murmur were rejected. Only one was turned down because of a headache or migraine out of 30 referred with that diagnosis. None of nine with supposed high blood pressure nor of five with a past history of pneumothorax was rejected. Of seven referred because of epilepsy, all five with definite evidence of this were turned down. The predictability of the specialist decision in these conditions suggests that more than 80% of all potential recruits referred to hospital with medical problems (at least 800 people yearly in UK) do not need to attend.","2005":"The medical aspects of recruiting for the Brigade of Gurkhas are discussed with particular emphasis to the medical examination being the first sieve in the recruiting process. In 1987 there were 248 medical failures of a total of 913 recruits examined. The commonest causes of failure were an abnormal chest X-Ray and chronic middle ear disease with or without defective hearing.","2006":"","2007":"","2008":"A randomized double blind cross over trial to compare nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate with placebo in the prevention of exercise induced asthma was conducted. Twenty asthmatics received nedocromil sodium, sodium cromoglycate or placebo via metered dose inhalers on successive days 30 minutes before exercise in a randomized order. Nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate gave sufficient protection (P less than 0.05) compared to placebo as assessed by the reduction in the maximum percentage fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). The protective effect of nedocromil sodium and sodium cromoglycate varied in individuals.","2009":"Following a large earthquake in Nepal, the experience of a small hospital in dealing with the resulting mass casualties is described. The value of pre-planning and effective triage of the injured is stressed, and aspects of surgical and medical care specific to earthquake victims discussed. Clinical and administrative challenges encountered in mounting a major relief exercise in a Third World setting are also described. frequent exercising of military hospitals and personnel in handling mass casualties is an applicable to civilian natural catastrophies as to battlefield medical support.","2010":"","2011":"","2012":"","2013":"","2014":"Two cases of partial lesions of the brachial plexus (brachial plexopathy) occurring in soldiers wearing body armour are described. This is an occupational hazard which has not been reported before.","2015":"A retrospective study was undertaken of all preterm babies born in BMH Rinteln between 1980-88 weighing less than 2500g. The total proportion of low birth weight babies was 7% and 58% of these were preterm (454 babies). Sixty per cent of women presented after the spontaneous rupture of membranes or in established labour. Conservative management of ruptured membranes, whilst not leading to life-threatening sepsis, did not significantly prolong pregnancy. Sixteen percent of the babies were very low birth weight (under 1500g). Delivery of these infants by Caesarean section when presenting by the breech improved survival, although this was not statistically significant. Thirty percent of all babies were delivered by Caesarean section before 36 weeks, reflecting obstetric emergencies in the mother which predisposed to preterm delivery. Neonatal survival depended on both gestational maturity and birth weight and was not significantly better in babies who were low birth weight for gestational age. These infants however represented 75% of the still-births and congenital abnormalities. Sixty percent of the mothers smoked and 50% had other identifiable risk factors for preterm delivery; 20% of the multiparous patients had previously experienced a perinatal death, preterm delivery or had a baby with intra-uterine growth retardation. It is suggested that preterm delivery is a significant problem in an Army population despite full employment, adequate housing and comprehensive medical care. Attempts to stop labour are unlikely to be successful. Effort should be made antenatally to identify those women who may be at risk of \"idiopathic\" preterm labour, as patient education programmes have been shown to decrease the incidence.","2016":"The use of the electrocardiograph by general practitioners was studied by scrutiny of 100 successive referrals to the Department of Clinical Electrophysiology. 31% of referrals were on patients with chronic, recurrent chest pain and a further 13% were on patients with a recent episode of acute chest pain. The ECG is of limited diagnostic value in patients with chest pain, and it may be both misleading and time-wasting when used inappropriately by general practitioners.","2017":"Spontaneous haemopneumothorax has a high mortality and morbidity which increase if the treatment is delayed. A patient with tension haemopneumothroax and mediastinal emphysema, rescued from a fishing boat in the middle of the South Atlantic, responded well to conservative treatment, despite delay in initiating treatment. The clinical presentation and management are discussed.","2018":"","2019":"The injuries likely to occur during a future general war will differ in severity and number from those experienced during recent short campaigns, terrorist incidents and natural disasters. If general war should break out in Europe, casualty numbers will lean towards the First World War rather than the Second in scale. Medical assets can expect, at least temporarily, to be overwhelmed with casualties. To deal with this problem, casualty management will be staged through five echelons or lines of medical support. The principal problem that will face medical attendants at the forward lines will be the sorting of casualties by priority so that those unable to tolerate delay in treatment will be evacuated rapidly before the less severely injured. Sorting will be achieved by the application of a crude scoring system known as Military Triage. We examine this concept and discuss its likely effectiveness in a scenario characterised by limited medical resources and a high flow of casualties. With the widespread introduction of modern and complex injury severity scoring systems into civilian trauma practice it is timely to examine their potential role in augmenting or replacing the current Military Triage system.","2020":"In August 1988 an aircraft of the Italian aerobatic display team fell into the spectator enclosure at the Ramstein Airshow, causing over 500 casualties. The survivors were triaged, treated and evacuated from Ramstein within 96 minutes. The speed and efficiency of this evacuation was a result of prior planning, thorough training, medical reinforcement, co-operation with other agencies and the availability of an abundance of vehicles for both air and road evacuation. Not suprisingly, though, problems did occur, especially with communications, casualty identification and documentation.","2021":"","2022":"Sigmoid volvulus is uncommon in the U.K. and more so in pregnancy. A case of sigmoid volvulus in pregnancy with a rare successful conclusion by conservative management is described and discussed, with a review of the literature. Sigmoid volvulus in the U.K. accounts for only 0.9% of all cases of intestinal obstruction, with most cases occurring in the elderly. Intestinal obstruction in pregnancy is also uncommon, with a reported incidence varying between 1 in 3,600 maternities to 1 in 66,431 maternities. A case is reported which was successfully treated conservatively.","2023":"A retrospective analysis of 53 consecutive cases of orchidopexy performed at the British Military Hospital Munster between 1984 and 1988 showed that the average of referral for orchidopexy was 4 years 7 months and that the average age at surgery for mal\/un-descended testes was 5 years exactly. Sixty-four percent of all orchidopexies were carried out before the age of 5 years; 8 percent were carried out by the age of 2 years.","2024":"A contemporary examination of the response of British and United States military organizations to the increased manpower wastage occasioned by the diseases and weaponry of war during the period 1854 to 1914 and the resulting changes in how these respective medical services were organized and employed.","2025":"The problems posed by flat feet to recruitment for the Army are assessed and the methods by which the Army has responded to the challenge over the years are reviewed.","2026":"A study was made of the titres of tetanus antitoxin in the sera of 186 recruits and 886 serving personnel. All were found to have titres of more than 0.01 IU per ml, the titre regarded as sufficient to provide protection from tetanus. The percentage of recruits with tetanus antitoxin titres less than 0.1 IU per ml was significantly greater than the percentage of serving personnel with antitoxin titres less than 0.1 IU per ml and the overall geometric mean titre of the antitoxin in the sera of the recruits was significantly lower than that in the sera of the serving personnel. In the light of the finding that all of the recruits had protective levels of tetanus antitoxin and in view of the imminent withdrawal of TABT Vaccine, alternative strategies for immunisation against tetanus are presented.","2027":"","2028":"","2029":"","2030":"","2031":"","2032":"During the initial six week period of deployment and jungle training in Belize, a 634 man strong infantry battalion group sustained twenty-three machete hand injuries.

Smoking, one risk factor is well managed with over 80% giving up peri-operatively, but hyperlipidaemia is not. Only 27% of such patients on a rehabilitation course knew their cholesterol and 32% had received no dietary advice. As baseline mean cholesterol was high (7.03 mmol\/l) this may be a serious omission. After rehabilitation patients have complied for a mean 16.6 months with recommendations on diet (97% remain on a low fat diet) and exercise (now over 3 sessions per week, a level at which long term cardiovascular benefit may be expected). Within 4 months a significant (14%) fall in total cholesterol was achieved. Rehabilitation after by-pass grafting induces life style changes which may improve long term graft survival and should be made more available.","2034":"Ten preterm infants were each studied by three observers using a commercial duplex Doppler ultrasound scanner, in order to determine the intra-observer and inter-observer variability in the measurement of pulsatility index (PI) of the anterior cerebral artery. There was considerable difference in estimates of PI, with a mean range of 0.11 between the three observers for each infant. Intra-observer variability exceeded inter-observer variability and had a coefficient of variation of 8.4%. The five observers involved in this study had less than six months experience of duplex scanning. The results suggest that the PI can be measured with acceptable reproducibility by personnel with limited experience.","2035":"British Military Hospital Dharan provides the surgeon with an opportunity, unparalleled anywhere in the United Kingdom to observe and manage a range of malignancies. The historical and contemporary reasons for this are outlined. The paper illustrates the military hospital experience and mode of presentation of a wide range of malignant conditions treated during the tour. Differences from United Kingdom practice are noted and where known, the reasons for this are discussed. Problems in diagnosis, treatment and continuing care, unique to a practice of this kind, are highlighted. The training potential of a hospital of this nature for future military surgeons is discussed.","2036":"Male medical discharges from the British Army were analyzed for the years 1979-1986. There was a sudden increase in 1983 which reached a peak in 1985 caused by a significant rise in rates of discharge as a consequence of lower limbs and muscular overuse conditions, injuries from road traffic accidents, sports and falls. Training injuries showed an increase which, although substantial, failed to reach statistical significance. The highest increase took place in lower limb and muscular overuse conditions in the youngest and most junior members of the infantry, especially when undergoing basic training. This category appears to be at the highest risk of medical discharge. Other teeth arms had the highest incidence of medical discharges from road traffic accidents. The importance of medical discharges may be misunderstood through the underestimation of their incidence and the absence of a capital valuation of the skills and experience of personnel discharged. The discharge of an infantry corporal with 8 years service may mean the loss of a capital of at least 149,599 pounds. Any interventions aimed at reducing the number discharges should be evaluated using the cost-benefit approach. Ways of reducing wastage are discussed.","2037":"","2038":"A case of opisthotonus following the use of the anaesthetic induction agent propofol is described.

They represented an overall prevalence of 36 per 1000 couples in the population. Thirty seven couples (66%) were trying for their first pregnancy and 19 (34%) has experienced a previous conception. Disorders of ovulation occurred in 29 women (52%) whereas disorders of sperm production or function occurred in 21 men (38%). Other causes were less common. Twelve couples (21%) had more than one diagnosed cause for their infertility, but 21 (37%) withdrew voluntarily or were posted back to the UK during the study period. Only 10 couples (18%) were referred to hospital for specialist investigations or treatment. A logical scheme for the GP management of infertile couples was used. This regime may have been partially or wholly responsible for the 14 pregnancies (25%) reported.","2040":"","2041":"","2042":"","2043":"","2044":"A patient who presented with recurrent bilateral knee effusions was found to have positive serum syphilis serology.

This paper discusses such tumours and illustrates the importance of a careful clinical examination during counselling. A case of liposarcoma, a rare malignancy of lipoblasts derived from mesenchyme, in a 36-year old man applying for vasectomy is described.  The subject reported nagging scrotal pain for 14 years.  Examination revealed a soft mass above the left testis, thought to be an epididymal cyst.  During exploration under general anesthesia, a partly encapsulated fatty lesion was found encircling the testis and the cord.  The tumor was dissected and excised.  Some parts of the tumor resembled a vascular lipoma, others contained multivesiculated primitive cells and hyperchromatic multi-nucleated and granular lipoblasts.  The man was treated with left radical orchidectomy with high ligation of the cord 10 days later, and biopsies of lymph nodes, retroperitoneal fat and skin were taken for examination.  He has remained recurrence free for 4 years by CT scans.  This case dramatizes the need to consider paratesticular tumors in any case of a mass found in a vasectomy candidate.

In practice it is difficult to differentiate a 'prolapsing' valve from one that is 'normal' no matter what methods are used. Since diagnosing 'heart disease' is itself a well known cause of ill health, the most stringent criteria must be adopted before the mitral valve is labelled as being abnormal. The need for the diagnosis at all is, in most cases, doubtful.","2051":"","2052":"","2053":"The physical mechanism of blunt impact injuries to thoracic and abdominal viscera is often conveniently described simply in terms of \"crush\"--this is an over-simplification. Any impact to the torso does result in the rapid displacement of the body wall which may lacerate and contuse underlying viscera, but this simple explanation does not account for pathology at sites some distance from the contact point and does not adequately describe the dependence of the severity and location of injury upon the rate of energy transfer. Quite minor displacements of the body wall may produce serious injury if the body wall velocity is high. The motion of the body wall generates waves that propagate within the body and transfer energy to internal sites. The nature and properties of these waves are discussed in simple terms and the role of waves in the production of the characteristic injuries resulting from impact to the torso is presented.","2054":"","2055":"","2056":"","2057":"","2058":"The current policy of obtaining routine skull and chest X-rays on all psychiatric admissions to military hospitals has been examined by scrutiny of the radiology reports on all such admissions during one calendar year.

The patterns of presentation, management, progress and outcome are described. Exercise induced asthma is seen as the biggest problem for servicemen often with otherwise mild asthma, and there is evidence that potential recruits are still not being adequately assessed. In younger men, exercise associated disability is an early symptom, but older individuals tend to divide into one group with early exercise related problems and another who remain able to exercise at least for a time. Response to prophylactic therapy is good, but it is often difficult to eliminate exercise induced wheeze in military training and relapse is common when prophylaxis is withdrawn. The effect of this on medical category is described and some of the implications are discussed.","2074":"Each summer cases of adder bite occur in Aldershot and its surrounding areas. Many of these are brought to the Cambridge Military Hospital. This paper reports three cases that together illustrate the commonest clinical signs and symptoms. These include rapid swelling, malaise and anxiety. An important diagnostic indication is an early and marked leucocytosis. Treatment regimes are also reviewed with the advice ultimately being to \"admit and monitor\". The danger of early resort to antivenom is also examined and the principles of both treatment and first aid are developed.","2075":"The change in the role of the arthroscope in the investigation and treatment of the problems in the knee joint during the period 1977-1985 in one Service hospital was examined and a retrospective study was undertaken of 345 arthroscopies performed in Princess Alexandra RAF Hospital Wroughton in 1984. Three hundred and seventeen of the 345 records were available for study. One hundred and seventy five patients required an operative procedure, 129 arthroscopically and 46 by arthrotomy. These two groups were compared in respect of the length of stay in hospital and the periods taken to return to work and to normal sporting activities. Analysis showed a significant reduction (p less than 0.001) in all 3 periods in the group undergoing arthroscopic surgery when compared with the group undergoing arthrotomy. After 4 months, however, there were no significant differences between the 2 groups. The results in respect of clinical outcome were also assessed. Although not statistically significant, there were fewer post-operative complaints in those undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Analysis of the clinical outcome of 34 patients in whom no detectable pathology was seen at arthroscopy was inconclusive in predicting the final outcome.","2076":"The first reported case of Ellis--van Creveld syndrome in a Gurkha child is described, and the implications of the syndrome in this ethnic group are briefly considered.","2077":"","2078":"Nine term and premature infants were discharged home while still being partly tubefed, and were successfully weaned onto full bottle or breast feeds by their mothers under minimal supervision.","2079":"","2080":"Proguanil 200mg daily and chloroquine base 300mg weekly along with maloprim 1 tablet weekly was used as malaria chemoprophylaxis for 140 Hong Kong based soliders on a seven-week jungle exercise in a holoendemic malarial area of Papua New Guinea.

There were approximately 50 medical discharges from asthma per year, representing about 1 in 3400 of the held strength of the Army and 6.3% of the discharges from all medical causes. The average number of non-effective days before discharge was about 20 and those discharged were generally young (57% aged 20 years or less), of short service (47% less than 2 years service) and of low rank (86% privates, apprentices or juniors). Three hundred and fifty two individuals were admitted to hospital on 415 occasions in 4 years, of whom 82 were eventually discharged from the service for medical reasons. Average non-effective days for this group was 11. There was only one death. Of 108 discharged soldiers who were eventually shown to have a history of asthma in childhood (HAC), this was identified at recruit examination in only 43%. Before enlistment, only 20% were referred for consultant opinion and only 6% had exercise testing. 28% were probably current asthmatics on entry. From available records, age of remission of childhood asthma was most commonly 10-14 years (64%).

The overall Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) was 92. By comparison with the UK civil population serving members of the Regular Army suffered considerably less from disease deaths (SMR 58) with the exception of IHD (SMR 92), but more from injury deaths (SMR 135). RTA deaths had an SMR of 200. The review suggests that attention should be directed towards incidents causing RTAs and drowning.

It is estimated that 4% of TA personnel have a hitherto undetected hearing loss which would result in their medical downgrading. Noise is likely to be responsible for three-quarters of such cases. For 86% of the sample TA service is the major source of hazardous noise. There is strong tendency for hearing loss to increase with length of TA service although it is not possible completely to disentangle the effects of age and social exposure.","2108":"","2109":"A high index of suspicion is required to pick up cases of subdural empyema in clinical practice.

This paper compares perinatal data from these three groups of mothers and their babies, and in particular looks at the variations in perinatal mortality rates over the 10 year period 1976-1985. Mortality among the British babies has declined in a way similar to many areas of Britain. The Chinese have a very low perinatal mortality rate probably due to fewer preterm, multiple and abnormal births, but mortality has increased over the last 10 years and there is evidence that the rise may be due to changes in maternal health. The incidence of pregnancy associated hypertension has increased threefold among the Chinese. The Nepalese have a perinatal mortality similar to that of the British, much lower than that expected had they delivered in Nepal, and this probably reflects the application of modern obstetric care to these mothers. In all groups there has been a rise in instrumental deliveries but this is most marked among the Chinese in whom there has also been a significant increase in infants with low apgar scores. The Nepalese have the lowest incidence of forceps and operative deliveries and possible reasons for these differences are discussed.","2123":"A case of hospital acquired endocarditis due to Acinetobacter calcoaceticus in a severely burned patient is presented.

The technique is described and the results presented. The implications of these results to the Serviceman in particular and the current advice regarding vasectomy counselling is discussed. The increasing demand of bilateral vasectomy as a method of contraception has resulted in an increased request for reversal (vasovasostomy).  There have been 20 attempts at reversal at Queen Elizabeth Military hospital in England since 1983.  The patients were 20 soldiers aged between 30-41 years and in whom bilateral vasectomy had been carried out for contraceptive purposes.  The interval between vasectomy and reversal varied between 3-11 years.  The primary method used is the technique of end-to-end anastomosis of the divided vas over a nylon splint, using fine interrupted sutures.  Of the 20 operations, 5 were unavailable for study because they had left the service.  Of the 15 others, 11 (73%) produced sperm count greater than 5 million\/ml, but only 4 (26.6%) had achieved a pregnancy in the 6-12 month period.  There have been many reports of reversal procedures and the best attained a 53% pregnancy rate and 88% reappearance of sperm, and those using microsurgical techniques attained 71% pregnancy rates.  Poorer results in 1 study were attributed to the age at reversal being over 35 years.  It was found that the chances of success are much greater if the reversal is performed within 2 years of the vasectomy; there is much less chance of pregnancy 7 years post vasectomy.  The policy is not to perform a vasectomy on men below 30 because of emotional and service factors which result in marital disharmony.

Comparisons are drawn within and between each service and with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in the UK male population. Evidence of a significant decline in the Army death rate over this 12 year period has been found. Officers in each Service are seen to have a much higher rate of mortality, ie death rate per 100,000 at risk, than other ranks but a much lower rate when age distribution relative to the UK population is taken into account as indicated by the Standardised Mortality Ratios. The Army other ranks in the 25-39 age range are identified as a particularly high risk group for IHD. The wide ranging effects of social habits and the peculiarities of military life style may go part way to explaining the diversity between officers and other ranks and between the services and the general UK male population.","2139":"","2140":"Malaria poses the greatest health threat to British soldiers engaged in jungle training in Papua New Guinea.

Psychoneurotic reactions were found in 69.8% of total cases and these reactions were closely correlated with the occurrence of dyspepsia both in soldiers who were local residents and those who were not. Dyspepsia could not however be correlated with eating habits, or with the consumption of alcohol, coffee or tobacco.","2145":"The discharge for medical reasons of recruits in the first five months of 1984 was studied. The rate of discharge for medical reasons was found to be 3.3% of the total intake for the same period. Many recruits were discharged without appearing before a medical board. The number of medically discharged recruits represents 12.4% of the total discharges for all reasons. The conditions giving rise to discharge were investigated and it was found that most were related to lower limb problems, particularly patellofemoral pain. Suggestions are made as to ways of decreasing the medical wastage, but it is thought to be unlikely that much impact would be made on the low rate of 3.3%.","2146":"During 1984 a short summary of all recruits who failed their recruitment medical examination at Leven was kept. An overall failure rate of 19% was discovered and no recruit examined in 1984 from Army Careers Information Office, Leven, was dismissed from service on medical grounds. It seems quite likely, therefore, that the Regulations covering medical fitness are adequate. Indeed, the Regulations may sometimes exclude fit men from Army service.","2147":"In the decade 1968-77, 203 (12%) of the 1723 deaths in off duty British Army males were associated with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) in excess of 80 mgs\/100 mls. These deaths occurred in road traffic accidents (49%), acute alcohol poisoning (23%), suicide (9%), drowning (8%), falling from a height (7%), burns (3%), and interpersonal violence (1%). The mean BAC was similar in all of these categories (180 mgs\/100 mls) except in acute alcohol poisoning where it was double this figure. The mean age at death was similar, approximately 24 years, for all categories except suicide, where it was 28 years. The mean age at death of those with raised alcohol levels was not significantly different from that of the total number in the same group. Alcohol associated death is generally more common abroad than in the United Kingdom, with the notable exception that, in the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), the incidence of alcohol associated road traffic deaths is no higher than that in the United Kingdom. BAC above 80 mgs % is much less common in soldiers whose deaths occur on duty (1.6%).","2148":"","2149":"A thalassaemic ulcer in a male Greek Cypriot patient, resistant to standard medical treatment, was treated using hyperbaric oxygen in a recompression chamber.

The ulcer became fully epithelialised within three weeks of starting treatment.","2150":"A study of all the cot deaths in infancy which occurred in Service families in British Forces Germany (BFG) from 1981-4 was undertaken in order to ascertain the frequency of these tragedies. The total number of deaths was ninety-seven and in sixty cases no cause of death was found at post mortem. The incidence in the Service community was calculated so that comparison could be made with the civilian population of England and Wales. The results of the study indicated that cot deaths occurred relatively more frequently in the Service population even allowing for socio-economic differences between the two groups. However, postneonatal deaths from causes other than cot death occurred less often in BFG. Cot deaths are therefore the cause of the higher postneonatal mortality rates in the Service community and they constitute an important target for preventive medicine. The measures which have been taken in BFG in recent years to reduce the number of cot deaths are discussed in this paper together with some further ideas which might help to solve this distressing problem.","2151":"Routine echocardiography following acute myocardial infarction revealed a large totally asymptomatic left atrial myxoma.

Malaria biology and protective measures are discussed.","2163":"","2164":"A four-year-old boy was seen in the Eye Department at the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital, Woolwich, because his parents had noticed that his right pupil appeared white. The diagnosis of toxocaral endophthalmitis was later made. The pathogenesis and management of infestation by Toxocara species are described.","2165":"During February 1985 a squadron of an engineer regiment deployed into the field to exercise its men in basic infantry skills. One of these men was a 20 year old sapper. During the exercise he sustained frostbite injury to both feet, the right foot being more affected than the left. The background, clinical progress and preventive medicine implications are discussed.","2166":"Editor's note: The following notes were intended as a help to platoon commanders operating with LRP troops and were the result of observations made on six months LRP training and fifteen weeks operations with a column of 23rd British Infantry Brigade in the Naga Hills. The operations, particularly from the point of view of treatment and evacuation of casualties, differed from those of the Brigades who were operating inside Burma itself owing to the nature of the terrain, but the basic problems, particularly from the platoon commander's point of view, were the same. The author's views may still be of interest today after more than 40 years.","2167":"During the summer of 1985, 45 soldiers with heat illness were admitted to the British Military Hospital, Hong Kong. Twelve had severe heat stroke, the remainder heat exhaustion. This paper discusses the management and prevention of heat illness in the military context.","2168":"The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical and pathological value of reports resulting from review of all completed surgical pathology cases submitted to the Army Histopathology Registry (AHR). All histopathological cases completed in the British Army are sent to the AHR for archiving; prior to placing cases in the archive both microscopic material and submitted reports are reviewed by staff of the AHR. A \"nonagreed\" report is produced for those cases in which the reviewing pathologist has a dissenting opinion or for which he thinks other comments may be helpful. All nonagreed reports produced over a 19 month period were subjected to a further pathological and clinical review. The original surgical pathology reports were compared with AHR reports and the significance of the differences in diagnosis assessed. During the study interval, 4.0% of total cases reviewed were identified as nonagreed record cases. The clinical and pathological reviews placed the nonagreed cases into significant categories in 2.1% and 1.9% of instances respectively. These findings suggest that nonselected review of completed surgical pathology cases identifies a significant proportion of cases for which dissenting opinions may have important clinical and pathological consequences.","2169":"","2170":"In maxillo-facial wounds with soft tissue involvement, the most important object in the initial treatment is to secure primary closure without deformity, or, if that is not possible, primary epithelialisation of the raw surfaces. In addition to the early healing with minimal scar tissue which results, this allows further operative procedures to be carried out much earlier and under much simpler conditions than if healing had occurred by granulation and scarring. The operative technique adopted in a series of 304 patients in a maxillo-facial surgical unit in the BLA included meticulous toilet and excision of wound surfaces before closure by several different methods: when soft tissue loss was minimal, direct closure in layers was affected; when the soft tissue defect was too large for direct closure the wound was closed by either local flaps or skin to mucous membrane suture or skin grafting of the raw surface. Examples of these methods are shown. In a series of 165 cases in whom the immediate results have been personally observed or on whom reports have been received, 153 cases (93 per cent) have been completely successful, 10 cases (6 per cent) have had a partial breakdown of the wound, and two cases (1.2 per cent) have been complete failures.","2171":"Several criteria exist for the diagnosis for left ventricular hypertrophy as shown by high voltage on the electrocardiograph. This study of 200 healthy young recruits to the Royal Artillery with normal blood pressure and normal left ventricular wall thickness as measured by echocardiography [corrected] shows that no matter which criteria are used the false positive rate is approximately 25%. High voltage is a normal phenomenon in young men and its use as a predictor of left ventricular hypertrophy is likely to be misleading in this age group.","2172":"An infantry battalion as part of an Airmobile Brigade took part in a field exercise in Germany during mid summer 1984. During the exercise the battalion suffered from an outbreak of gastroenteritis which affected at least 64 men, some 10% of its total strength. The follow up investigation revealed that it was likely that the origin of the outbreak was uncontrolled drinking of polluted water from two streams. This paper seeks to underline the lesson that poor water discipline can have serious consequences for units in the field.","2173":"The paper addresses the clinical entity of Combat Stress Reaction as it occurs in its immediate, undifferentiated form as well as its well-defined form - PTSD.

They were asked their opinions on the PULHEEMS Grading and restriction of duty in each case. In many cases there was a wide range of opinion on the management. Clearer guidelines concerning the diagnosis and administrative management of patients need to be drawn up to allow Service physicians to be consistent and fair to their patients.","2176":"A project sponsored by HQ AMS TA and executed by an experienced TA Commanding Officer enhanced the effectiveness of Hospital Collective Training by improving the standard of selection and documentation of the input of exercise casualties, and set up the basis of a comprehensive library of casualty cards for future use.","2177":"A case of malignant melanoma arising in a T.A.B.T. inoculation site is reported. Any progressive change within a inoculation scar, or immunisation site, should be thoroughly evaluated and treated appropriately after tissue diagnosis.","2178":"A case of typhoid fever with neuropsychiatric features is described.

Some observations on Paludrine dose-regimes are made. The use of Paludrine in the Army is very briefly reviewed and a preliminary report on recent experience included.","2186":"In 1978 there was a disproportionate increase in the number of cases of Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis (IHPS) admitted to the Cambridge Military Hospital Aldershot. This increase has not been sustained in subsequent years, although the mean incidence for the period 1979\/82 was slightly higher than the preceding years 1975\/77. Analysis of the cases occurring in 1978 did not reveal any unusual factor relating to the increased incidence.","2187":"This paper examines the total incidence of coronary events in British Army males in a five year period and shows that, whether diagnostic criteria are strict or lax, the mortality rate for coronary events occurring during strenuous exercise is no greater than that for such events occurring at rest.","2188":"Modern drug treatment, added to our previous experience of surgery and radiotherapy, is currently producing nearly 90% cure of all patients with testicular tumours. Most of the failures of treatment today occur in patients with a large mass of diseased tissue which has accumulated due to delayed diagnosis. A retrospective study of 23 Servicemen with testicular tumours, treated at the QEMH Woolwich, shows that the blame for this delay is shared by the patient, his medical practitioner, and surprisingly enough the hospital specialist. Recommendations for improvement are discussed.","2189":"The initial experience gained from setting up a cervical pathology clinic is described. The demand for and cost effectiveness of the clinic are examined. Proposals are made for the future development of a colposcopy service for the Army at home and abroad.","2190":"","2191":"Depression, anxiety, irritability with unpredictable explosions of aggressive behaviour, impulsivity, suicidal actions and substance abuse have been repeatedly observed among ex-servicemen from World War II in psychiatric treatment settings. In the most recent American Psychiatric Association classification of mental disorders the category of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was introduced, replacing the earlier Traumatic War Neurosis and the above cluster of symptoms were included as associated features of this disorder. Two recent uncontrolled studies on U.S. Vietnam veterans receiving psychiatric care supported the linkage of PTSD with these abnormalities. However, the present controlled study found these associated features occurred with equal frequencies among one group of psychiatrically hospitalised Australian Vietnam veterans with PTSD and another group not so afflicted. Reservations, then, should be harboured about ascribing all the presented psychopathology and behavioural abnormalities of ex-servicemen to the stress of their war service.","2192":"","2193":"","2194":"","2195":"34 patients with catheter verified, haemodynamically trivial mitral leaflet prolapse with chest pain and normal coronary arteries were studied.

The resulting disability was severe and recovery, although complete, was prolonged. Realization of the potential for brachial plexus injury, particularly in the combat situation, when the duration of march and the rough terrain cannot be varied is strongly emphasised. The mechanics as well as the two different sites of injury are described.","2212":"This study examines sudden unexpected deaths in relation to strenuous exercise in the five years following the introduction of the Basic Fitness Test viz: 1978-82 and, by comparison with an identical study of the years 1968-77, shows that the annual exercise associated mortality rate rose from 3.5 per 100,000 before the Basic Fitness Test to 4.75 per 100,000 after its introduction. Sudden unexpected death in relation to strenuous exercise is rare, and its incidence has not importantly changed since the introduction of the Basic Fitness Test.","2213":"In a retrospective study of coronary risk factors in young soldiers with coronary heart disease (CHD), designed to explain why junior ranks in the British Army have a higher mortality rate from CHD than comparable British civilians, high prevalence of heavy cigarette smoking was found to be the major discriminant. In general, young men with CHD have higher prevalence of cigarette smoking, and a higher per capita consumption than older men with CHD. They also have higher cholesterol levels, perhaps resulting from more symptomatic cases of familial hypercholesterolaemia in the younger age group. Young affected soldiers are more obese than young affected civilians and smoke more cigarettes (24% smoke 40 or more per day). This may be related to the reduced cost of cigarettes to soldiers in some parts of the world. In the British Army, the expected protective effect of physical fitness is overwhelmed by the deleterious effect of high cigarette consumption.","2214":"","2215":"The presentation of haematuria in the otherwise fit young adult is common in military practice. Controversy still exists as to how fully such patients should be investigated. The findings in 90 military patients under 40 are reported and a scheme to rationalise the investigation of haematuria is put forward.","2216":"The isolation and identification of a new sub-genus I Salmonella is described. The complete antigenic formula is 3,10:z29:enx; the serotype has been named Salmonella everleigh.

The results were expressed as an exercise lability index, (ELI), based on measurement of FEV. The mean ELI of the control group was 7.6%, range 2.9-12.2% and a positive result in the asthma subjects was an ELI greater than 15%. Seventy five of the asthma subjects were found to have been asymptomatic for a year or more (group 1) and, in 15 of them (20%) the test was positive. The remaining 79 were currently symptomatic, or had been symptomatic within a year (group 2), and in 52 of these (66%), the test was positive. The difference between the two results was significant, p greater than or equal to 0.001. We believe this observation suggests that exercise induced asthma (EIA) cannot be demonstrated in the majority of asthmatics who are in remission.","2218":"A study was made of renal trauma in a South African hospital during the period 1977-1979. The diagnosis and treatment of the 119 patients admitted to the Surgical Unit with moderate to severe renal injury are described. The 21 patients with penetrating wounds were treated by surgical intervention. The remainder were successfully managed conservatively. In all cases every effort was made to salvage viable renal tissue.","2219":"The General Health Questionnaire of Goldberg was used as an indicator of morbidity in three groups of a Military General Practice in British Army of the Rhine. Group 1 consisted of 299 service and civilian consecutive new attenders at the General Practice. Group 2 of 80 attenders for routine medical examination and Group 3 of a community sample of 446 soldiers from units in the practice area. Patients presenting for consultation at the practice were shown to have higher GHQ scores and percentage positive scores than the community sample, which in turn showed higher mean scores than those referred to the practice as non-complainants for routine medical examination. Service personnel showed lower mean scores than dependants or civilians. There were significant differences in scores between groups by rank in soldier attenders, those of junior non-commissioned officer rank having lower mean scores and lower percentage high scores than others.","2220":"","2221":"","2222":"An ex-Far East prisoner of war (FEPOW) treated with corticosteroids for severe polymyositis died from multisystem strongyloidiasis and pyogenic meningitis.

Failure of correct application and interpretation of results can be dangerous for the sick or preterm infant.","2226":"","2227":"The environmental problems affecting aircrew are partly those which all soldiers face, such as noise, heat and cold, and partly peculiar to the medium and the vehicle in which aircrew train and fight, such as disorientation and decompression. The cockpit environment of the modern helicopter is luxurious in comparison with many of its predecessors, yet most of the adverse effects of flight on the man still pertain. The result can, predictably, be acute and disastrous, resulting in an accident produced by severe disorientation, or chronic, producing insidious fatigue and performance decrement, which may also result in an accident. One particular stressor may be dominant in a given situation, but generally, many separate factors act simultaneously to produce their results.","2228":"Army Air Corps accident and fatality rates have now reached levels which compare favourably with data from other civilian and military sources. This improvement is the result of enhanced helicopter design and parallel progress in aircrew training. The introduction of new generations of turbine powered rotor craft has largely eliminated mechanical failure as the cause of accident. As a result 75% of Army Air Corps accidents are due to pilot error. This contribution is likely to increase in the future as the pilot's task is made more difficult by the incumberance of personal equipment. Methods whereby occupant protection and aircraft crashworthiness can be improved are reviewed and it is concluded that it would make sound economic sense to implement some of these well proven design features.","2229":"","2230":"","2231":"The purpose of this short series of articles is not to present the reader with a vast amount of technical data, soon to be forgotten, but to provide some items of general interest from the past, present, and future of Army aviation. Obviously there will be a concentration on medical matters, but the aim is to give the reader a feel for the rapid progress being made in helicopter design and the likely problems we may face in the future. The first article serves as an introduction to the series and three further articles will cover various aspects of the speciality. The second will be concerned with AAC helicopter accidents and will include accident investigation, crashworthiness and the contribution made by pilot error. The third article will cover major environmental problems of helicopters, particularly noise, vibration and thermal stress. The fourth article will examine ways in which microprocessors and modern technology will affect future helicopter and ancillary equipment development; for instance, a helicopter with no external windows has been suggested, 'The Iron Cockpit'. The fifth article will be concerned with the clinical aspects of Army Aviation medicine.","2232":"This paper reviews sports injuries in the Armed Services 1969-1980 to establish their incidence and to analyse trends over time. There were on average 2135 sports injuries per year showing a falling trend over time until 1979 and then rising. Playing soccer was the cause of 43% of the sports injuries over the years 1969-1980. By far the greatest proportion 85% the injuries occurred in the under 30 age group. The number of medical discharges fell until 1974 when it rose to a new level of between 22 and 31 per year. The number of deaths showed no particular trend over time but half of the deaths were caused by drowning.","2233":"During the summer of 1983, 1152 subjects were immunized against Japanese Encephalitis at BMH Dharan. This was the first use of the BIKEN killed lyophilised vaccine in the British Army. Three doses of 1 ml (0.5 ml for children under 3 years) given 10 days apart produced a protective neutralizing antibody response (titre more than 1:10) in almost 90% of subjects. Two doses of vaccine however seemed inadequate in that less than 40% of subjects seroconverted. Side-effects were minimal and trivial. Studies of neutralizing antibodies before vaccination showed up to 30% of Nepalese subjects tested were already immune due to previous inapparent infection while all but one of the British Nationals were fully susceptible.","2234":"We describe a variant of typhoid which was clinically indistinguishable from Japanese Encephalitis (JE). The strongly encephalitic presentation led to a potentially serious delay in starting specific antibiotic therapy. Awareness of the usual form of typhoid is of great importance to Army doctors because of the presence of British soldiers and families in the Dharan area of southern Nepal where both typhoid and JE are endemic.","2235":"The factors related to the development of sepsis in the soft tissue limb injuries sustained by soldiers during the Falklands Campaign have been assessed. Delay in surgery and delay in antibiotic administration are the most important factors, and where delay in surgery is inevitable, delay in antibiotic administration assumes an even greater importance.","2236":"During Military Operations in the South Atlantic to recover the Falkland Islands in 1982, the troopship Sir Galahad was bombed. Initial treatment of the injured in field medical units was followed by transfer to the hospital ship SS Uganda and evacuation to the United Kingdom where 48 patients were treated in the Burns and Plastics Unit, Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital, Woolwich. The treatment of these patients is described and the management of war burns discussed.","2237":"","2238":"","2239":"","2240":"An Audiometric Survey was carried out on two batteries of 4 Fd Regt RA (n-84) who were exposed to massive levels of impulse noise during \"OP CORPORATE\". A control group (n-30) was obtained from the remaining battery which did not serve in the Falklands, and it was matched well in age, service and job. They completed a questionnaire, were physically examined and had an audiogram using the MAICO M26 computer audiometer. Results were related to PULHEEMS standards and compared. No subject in the control group was classed below H2 but in those exposed, 17 were H3 or worse. This is significant (p 0.01 for 1 df) but the significance is attenuated medically and statistically. No significant correlation was found between type of ear defender and degree of protection. The survey showed that sufficient numbers had been affected to necessitate a full examination of all troops who fought in East Falkland.","2241":"","2242":"","2243":"","2244":"","2245":"This paper examines factors leading to the low rate of combat psychiatric casualties in the British recapture of the Falklands compared to the American experience in North Africa, Italy, Europe and South Pacific theatres during World War II, the Korean Conflict and Vietnam. The factors compared are those thought to affect rates seen in these past wars. The factors highlighted are psychiatric screening of evacuees, presence of psychiatric personnel in line units, intensity of combat and use of elite units. Factors also mentioned are presence of possible occult psychiatric casualties such as frostbite and malaria, amount of indirect fire and the offensive or defensive nature of the combat. A unique aspect of the Falklands War examined is the exclusive use of hospital ships to treat psychiatric casualties and the impact of Geneva Convention rules regarding hospital ships on the classic treatment principles of proximity and expectancy. The types and numbers of various diagnoses are also presented. The British Campaign in the Falklands produced a remarkably low rate of psychiatric casualties. When viewed in light of American experience in recent wars, this low rate represents a concentration of optimal factors leading to healthy function in combat. The results of this war should not be used to predict a similar outcome in future combat as this particular constellation of factors may not recur.","2246":"Beta Thromboglobulin plasma levels were measured in three groups of hospital patients; a control group (n = 13) of non-drinkers, and test groups of patients who from their medical history regularly consumed either moderate amounts (80-200G\/24 hours n = 31) or large amounts (200G\/24 hours n = 10) of alcohol. Significant differences were detected between the control group, and both groups of drinkers. A correlation was demonstrated between the amount of alcohol consumed and the plasma Beta Thromboglobulin. It is necessary to consider a patient's drinking habits when interpreting Beta Thromboglobulin levels.","2247":"Throughout the history of war, there have been many instances when the cold has ravaged armies more effectively than their enemies. Delineated risk factors are restricted to negro origins, previous cod injury, moderate but not heavy cigarette smoking and the possession of blood group O. No attention has been directed to the possibility that abnormal blood constituents could feasibly predispose to the development of local cold injury. This study considers this possibility and investigates the potential contribution of certain components of the circulating blood which might do so. Three groups of soldiers from two of the battalions who served during the war in the Falkland Islands in 1982 were investigated. The risk factors which were sought included the presence or absence of asymptomatic cryoglobulinaemia, abnormal total protein, albumin, individual gamma globulin or complement C3 or C4 levels, plasma hyperviscosity or evidence of chronic alcoholism manifesting as high haemoglobin, PCV, RBC, MCV or gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). No cases of cryoglobulinaemia were isolated and there was no haematological evidence to suggest that any of those men who had developed cold injury, one year before this study was performed, had abnormal circulating proteins, plasma hyperviscosity or indicators of alcohol abuse. Individual blood groups were not incriminated as a predisposing factor although the small numbers of negroes in this series fared badly. Although this investigation has excluded a range of potential risk factors which could contribute to the development of cold injury, the problem persists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","2248":"","2249":"A case of idiopathic scrotal oedema is presented in detail and the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment considered with references to the literature available.","2250":"With the decline in the frequency of rhesus isoimmunisation, hydrops fetalis secondary to other factors is becoming increasingly recognised.

The expected social class differences were found, but even among the lower social classes more mothers than previously reported were breast feeding their babies for at least six weeks post partum. Comparison of the mothers delivering in England with those in Germany gives some support to the view that antenatal influences were more important than postnatal education in determining if a mother would successfully breast feed. Parity, mode of delivery and length of stay in hospital had no effect on feeding. Maternal smoking was correlated with failure to maintain breast feeding, and as this association was found in all socioeconomic groups, it is suggested that smoking may have a direct effect on breast feeding.","2268":"The terminal P wave vector in lead V1 of the electrocardiograph (V1PTV) was abnormal in 93 (3.2%) of 3119 healthy recruits into the Royal Air Force of mean age 19 (SD 4) years.

A knowledge of this disease is of particular importance to the military medical officer as in recent years approximately one-hundred and fifty cases of leishmaniasis have been seen in British troops who have served in Belize. Leishmania braziliensis sp. have been isolated from a number of these cases. Organisms of this complex had not previously been recorded in Belize and the Army Medical Services are therefore in a unique position to study this disease, as well as having a responsibility to ensure its correct management.","2272":"Examination of hospital records from BMH Dharan and the large Nepalese hospital at Biratnagar has revealed a worrying trend in the incidence of acute encephalitis in the area of the British Military Cantonment at Dharan. The weight of available evidence strongly favours Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV) as the aetiological agent. Serological studies from healthy Nepalese from the Dharan area and animals from the Cantonment farm indicate that intense transmission of JEV occurs within the Cantonment area. Japanese Encephalitis (JE) must now be regarded as a serious threat to British Military personnel and dependants living in or visiting Nepal.

Although it was not recognized as a commonplace illness in civilian populations until 35 years ago, hepatitis has been a problem in all major wars during the last two centuries. Much of the knowledge of this disease has been obtained by investigation of outbreaks in military populations. The military importance of hepatitis during World War II led to studies of this disorder which defined it as a distinct clinical entity and delineated both the epidemiology and its mode of transmission.","2276":"The incidence of patellofemoral pain in a Junior Unit was assessed retrospectively over a 4 year period and prospectively by studying an annual intake of recruits during their initial training year. An average of 3.5% per intake were found to have been discharged due to the disease between 1977 and 1980. 4.5% of the intake prospectively studied were discharged and 75% of those presenting with symptoms were cured. The clinical characteristics of recruits presenting with the the disorder were prospectively studied in a controlled, blind, consecutive series of 45 patients. Two groups of characteristics were identified; those with an early, insidious onset in training, a pre-Service history and a poor response to physiotherapy and those with an acute, traumatic onset, presenting later in training and responding well to physiotherapy. The aetiology of patellofemoral pain in a Junior Recruit is discussed and attention drawn to specific problems encountered by these patients.","2277":"An environmental and biological survey of lead involving 35 soldiers from an artillery training unit was carried out. The soldiers had a minimum of eighteen months service. The eight hour Time Weighted Average (TWA) for lead in air (0.19 mg\/m3) exceeded the Standard (0.15\/m3) on a maximum of three days per month. However, the weighted average for 40 hours (0.03 mg\/m3) was well within the Lead in Air Standard. No toxic effects on the soldiers were revealed by the biological tests employed. A comparison of blood lead (BPb) was made with those in a group (n = 292) of recruits (Fig. 1) which showed a statistically significant difference (t(df 328) = 4.28, P less than 0.001). The survey indicated that the level of lead exposure is not sufficient to require any special monitoring or corrective measures as laid down in the Control of Lead at Work Regulations.","2278":"To determine the prognostic value of Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) levels after acute myocardial infarction in patients thought to be at low risk of death or major complications, 94 consecutive patients with definite myocardial infarction were divided into two groups according to peak CPK levels. Group I contained 23 patients with a peak CPK of less than 1000 units and Group II contained 71 patients with a peak CPK level of greater than 1000. They were followed for six months or to death. A CPK of greater than 1000 was significantly associated with left ventricular failure, major arrhythmias and late death and seemed therefore to have value as an indicator of poor prognosis.","2279":"","2280":"","2281":"","2282":"A case of congenital atresia of the larynx in association with the Prune Belly Syndrome is reported. Some aspects of the aetiology and management of congenital atresia of the larynx are reviewed.","2283":"Various exotic foreign bodies have been found in the lumen of acutely inflamed appendices. The list includes parasites, pips, chips of bone, metal and wood. In the following case the cause of obstruction was a trichobezoar.","2284":"A case is described where death occurred, due to the penetration of small high velocity metal fragments, from the explosion of an anti-personnel grenade.","2285":"Two cases of leptospirosis are described in soldiers who fell into a river together. One developed Weil's disease due to icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup and the other \"Mud-Fever\" due to grippotyphosa serogroup. The organisms were initially cultured in standard blood culture media. There were six cases of leptospirosis in BAOR in the 10 years to 1980 giving an incidence 10 times greater than in the civil population of UK and West Germany. Leptospirosis is an occupational disease of soldiers in BAOR and the health risks of fresh water immersion should be publicised.","2286":"In a five doctor group practice a system was devised for collecting information about morbidity and practice activity. A structured 'day sheet' was used to record the doctors' case load and this information was then transferred on to a computer file. The computer was programmed to produce monthly morbidity returns and practice activity analyses, printed out in a format that allowed easy comparison to existing published data.","2287":"Maternal cigarette consumption during pregnancy, and infant birth weight were assessed in 427 consecutive births at BMH Rinteln. Smokers comprised 46.1% of the mothers. Babies born to mothers who smoked were significantly lighter than those born to non-smoking mothers, regardless of birth order. Smoking mothers were disproportionately represented in the low birth weight group. (19 out of 24) There are clear implications for military obstetric and paediatric practice.","2288":"Problem orientated medical records will accommodate and integrate information about minor and major problems, allow rapid updating of information and better communication between health agencies and primary care team members. They will allow colleagues to retrieve information and assess patient problems, enable better co-ordination to occur between patient investigation and treatment, and rationalise decision making. In Part Two a method of medical recording is described using various coloured forms. Problems encountered and suggested solutions have been made. It is felt that the introduction of this method will lead to improved medical care for patients.","2289":"Quotations from the many parts played by British army doctors interpreting the various facets of the anthropo-zoonosis Brucellosis, a disease which itself (as well as the generic name of its etiologic agent) is indeed named after one of them.","2290":"","2291":"","2292":"","2293":"","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"","2300":"","2301":"","2302":"","2303":"","2304":"","2305":"","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"","2309":"","2310":"","2311":"","2312":"","2313":"","2314":"","2315":"","2316":"","2317":"","2318":"","2319":"","2320":"","2321":"","2322":"","2323":"","2324":"","2325":"","2326":"","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"","2331":"","2332":"","2333":"","2334":"","2335":"","2336":"","2337":"","2338":"","2339":"","2340":"","2341":"","2342":"","2343":"","2344":"","2345":"","2346":"","2347":"","2348":"","2349":"","2350":"","2351":"In discussing the technical problems associated with the IUD, focus is on the basic insertion technique, the technique to use with the various IUDs (Copper 7, Lippes Loop, Copper T models, the Saf-T-coil, and the multiload 250), the timing of the insertion, and removal of the IUD.  Bimanual examination of the pelvis must be performed before an IUD is inserted.  Prior to starting the insertion, the patient should be given an explanation of what is to be done.  As patients are unfamiliar with the appearance of most of the instruments, it is advisable to keep them from view.  Having visualized the cervix and fixed the blades of the Cusco speculum in the open position, the cervix can be seized with a single toothed tenaculum or 7 inch Allis forceps.  It is generally necessary to steady the cervix with a forcep as it straightens out the canal and uterine flexion.  Sounding the uterine cavity will reveal its length and confirm any angulation.  On occasion it is impossible to sound the cavity because the internal os is too tight or the endocervical canal has a pinhole external os.  Force should be avoided.  High fundal placement without perforating the uterus is the objective when inserting any IUD, and this is particularly important with the copper IUDs which depend on a close association of their copper elements to the endometrium.  Generally, it is easier to insert a coil towards the end of the period when the cervix is partly dilated and any bleeding that occurs is masked.  Insertion following abortion is commonly performed, and encouraging results have been achieved with insertions immediately postpartum.  Removal can be done at any time.","2352":"","2353":"","2354":"Proper clinical practice in the military for IUD insertion is outlined.  Bimanual examination of the pelvis is prerequisite; a Cusco speculum should be used to visualize the cervix and vagina.  Cervical erosion and vaginal discharges should be treated before insertion.  The basic insertion method is to fix the blades of the speculum in open position and then seize the cervix with a tenaculum.  Tenaculum and inserter should be held securely to prevent rotation and incorrect orientation of the IUD.  Uterine sounding may be necessary in obese patients or in other patients where bimanual examination does not reveal uterine position.  Uterine perforation is avoided by lightly holding the device for insertion.  For copper IUDs, high fundal placement without perforation is essential because the close association of copper and endometrium is important.  A Gravigard can be inserted by either the push-in or withdrawal technique.  The push technique is best with Lippes Loops.  Cooper T models are slightly larger once loaded in their inserter than Copper 7s making this IUD less suitable for nulliparas.  A small Saf-T-Coil is indicated for nulliparas.  Timing of insertion should be just after the period, when the cervix is partly dilated, although IUDs can be inserted at any time in the cycle.  Copper models have been found successful as postcoital contraceptives when inserted within 5 days of coitus.","2355":"","2356":"","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"","2366":"","2367":"","2368":"","2369":"","2370":"","2371":"","2372":"","2373":"","2374":"","2375":"","2376":"","2377":"","2378":"","2379":"","2380":"","2381":"","2382":"","2383":"","2384":"","2385":"","2386":"","2387":"","2388":"","2389":"","2390":"","2391":"","2392":"","2393":"","2394":"","2395":"","2396":"","2397":"","2398":"","2399":"","2400":"","2401":"","2402":"","2403":"","2404":"","2405":"","2406":"","2407":"","2408":"","2409":"","2410":"","2411":"","2412":"","2413":"","2414":"","2415":"","2416":"","2417":"","2418":"","2419":"","2420":"","2421":"","2422":"","2423":"","2424":"","2425":"","2426":"","2427":"","2428":"","2429":"","2430":"","2431":"","2432":"","2433":"","2434":"","2435":"","2436":"","2437":"","2438":"","2439":"","2440":"","2441":"","2442":"","2443":"","2444":"","2445":"","2446":"","2447":"","2448":"","2449":"","2450":"","2451":"","2452":"","2453":"","2454":"","2455":"","2456":"","2457":"","2458":"","2459":"","2460":"","2461":"","2462":"","2463":"","2464":"","2465":"","2466":"","2467":"","2468":"","2469":"","2470":"","2471":"","2472":"","2473":"","2474":"","2475":"","2476":"","2477":"","2478":"","2479":"","2480":"","2481":"","2482":"","2483":"","2484":"","2485":"","2486":"","2487":"","2488":"","2489":"","2490":"","2491":"","2492":"","2493":"","2494":"","2495":"","2496":"","2497":"","2498":"","2499":"","2500":"","2501":"","2502":"","2503":"","2504":"","2505":"","2506":"","2507":"","2508":"","2509":"","2510":"","2511":"","2512":"","2513":"","2514":"","2515":"","2516":"","2517":"","2518":"","2519":"","2520":"","2521":"","2522":"","2523":"","2524":"","2525":"","2526":"","2527":"","2528":"","2529":"","2530":"","2531":"","2532":"","2533":"","2534":"","2535":"","2536":"","2537":"","2538":"","2539":"","2540":"","2541":"","2542":"","2543":"","2544":"","2545":"","2546":"","2547":"","2548":"","2549":"","2550":"","2551":"","2552":"","2553":"","2554":"","2555":"","2556":"","2557":"","2558":"","2559":"","2560":"","2561":"","2562":"","2563":"","2564":"","2565":"","2566":"","2567":"","2568":"","2569":"","2570":"","2571":"","2572":"","2573":"","2574":"","2575":"","2576":"","2577":"","2578":"","2579":"","2580":"","2581":"","2582":"","2583":"","2584":"","2585":"","2586":"","2587":"","2588":"","2589":"","2590":"","2591":"","2592":"","2593":"","2594":"","2595":"","2596":"","2597":"","2598":"","2599":"","2600":"","2601":"","2602":"","2603":"","2604":"","2605":"","2606":"","2607":"","2608":"","2609":"","2610":"","2611":"","2612":"","2613":"","2614":"","2615":"","2616":"","2617":"","2618":"","2619":"","2620":"","2621":"","2622":"","2623":"","2624":"","2625":"","2626":"","2627":"","2628":"","2629":"","2630":"","2631":"","2632":"","2633":"","2634":"","2635":"","2636":"","2637":"","2638":"","2639":"","2640":"","2641":"","2642":"","2643":"","2644":"","2645":"","2646":"","2647":"","2648":"","2649":"","2650":"","2651":"","2652":"","2653":"","2654":"","2655":"","2656":"","2657":"","2658":"","2659":"","2660":"","2661":"","2662":"","2663":"","2664":"","2665":"","2666":"","2667":"","2668":"","2669":"","2670":"","2671":"","2672":"","2673":"","2674":"","2675":"","2676":"","2677":"","2678":"","2679":"","2680":"","2681":"","2682":"","2683":"","2684":"","2685":"","2686":"","2687":"","2688":"","2689":"","2690":"","2691":"","2692":"","2693":"","2694":"","2695":"","2696":"","2697":"","2698":"","2699":"","2700":"","2701":"","2702":"","2703":"","2704":"","2705":"","2706":"","2707":"","2708":"","2709":"","2710":"","2711":"","2712":"","2713":"","2714":"","2715":"","2716":"","2717":"","2718":"","2719":"","2720":"","2721":"","2722":"","2723":"","2724":"","2725":"","2726":"","2727":"","2728":"","2729":"","2730":"","2731":"","2732":"","2733":"","2734":"","2735":"","2736":"","2737":"","2738":"","2739":"","2740":"","2741":"","2742":"","2743":"","2744":"","2745":"","2746":"","2747":"","2748":"","2749":"","2750":"","2751":"","2752":"","2753":"","2754":"","2755":"","2756":"","2757":"","2758":"","2759":"","2760":"","2761":"","2762":"","2763":"","2764":"","2765":"","2766":"","2767":"","2768":"","2769":"","2770":"","2771":"","2772":"","2773":"","2774":"","2775":"","2776":"","2777":"","2778":"","2779":"","2780":"","2781":"","2782":"","2783":"","2784":"","2785":"","2786":"","2787":"","2788":"","2789":"","2790":"","2791":"","2792":"","2793":"","2794":"","2795":"","2796":"","2797":"","2798":"","2799":"","2800":"","2801":"","2802":"","2803":"","2804":"","2805":"","2806":"","2807":"","2808":"","2809":"","2810":"","2811":"","2812":"","2813":"","2814":"","2815":"","2816":"","2817":"","2818":"","2819":"","2820":"","2821":"","2822":"","2823":"","2824":"","2825":"","2826":"","2827":"","2828":"","2829":"","2830":"","2831":"","2832":"","2833":"","2834":"","2835":"","2836":"","2837":"","2838":"","2839":"","2840":"","2841":"","2842":"","2843":"","2844":"","2845":"","2846":"","2847":"","2848":"","2849":"","2850":"","2851":"","2852":"","2853":"","
