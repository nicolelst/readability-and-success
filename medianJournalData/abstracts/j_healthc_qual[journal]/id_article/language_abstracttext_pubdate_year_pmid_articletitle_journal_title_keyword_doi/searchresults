of care can be difficult to manage and if not performed properly, can lead to increased readmissions and poor outcomes. Transitions are more complex when patients are discharged to skilled nursing facilities. We assessed the impact of pharmacist-led initiatives, including medication reconciliation, on readmission rates between an academic medical center and a local skilled nursing facility (SNF). We conducted a two-phase quality improvement project focusing on pharmacist-led medication reconciliation at different points in the transition process. All-cause 30-day readmission rates, medication reconciliation completion rates, and total pharmacist interventions were compared between the 2 groups. The combined intervention and baseline cohorts resulted in a 29.8% relative reduction (14.5% vs. 20.6%) in readmission rates. Medication reconciliation was completed on 93.8% of SNF admitted patients in the first phase and 97.7% of patients in the second phase. Pharmacist interventions per reconciliation were 2.39 in the first phase compared with 1.82 in the second phase. Pharmacist-led medication reconciliation can contribute to reduction of hospital readmissions from SNFs and is an essential part of the SNF transition process. ","1":"This study describes the work of healthcare quality professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the successes and challenges they faced when applying their expertise in performance and process improvement (PPI) to help manage the crisis. The researchers performed a descriptive analysis of anonymous survey data collected from members of the National Association for Healthcare Quality professional community who were asked about their improvement work during the pandemic response. Most survey respondents used improvement methods to a great or moderate extent to measure what was happening (83%), rapidly review processes and practice (81%), and decide where to focus effort (81%). Fewer respondents used PPI methods to engage with patients and families (58% to a great or moderate extent). Looking to the future, respondents indicated that embedding systematic approaches to improvement within healthcare organizations (59%) and working in a more integrated way across teams (48%) should be prioritized in the post-pandemic recovery. The results from this study demonstrate why healthcare leaders should recognize the value that performance improvement approaches provide to everyday operations. They must empower PPI experts to lead this critical work and continue building workforce capacity in PPI methods to strengthen staff engagement and achieve better outcomes. ","2":"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented the healthcare system with a plethora of challenges, including implementation of an efficient vaccination strategy. Mass vaccinations have been used during previous pandemics; however, the associated data have largely been limited to theoretical simulations and post hoc analysis. An innovative data collection tool was created to deliver real-time data analysis during a drive-through mass vaccination. Patients were assigned unique identification numbers at the clinic entrance. Using these identification numbers, and the web-based spreadsheet, patients were tracked throughout the vaccination process. Static timestamps corresponding to the entry and exit at each checkpoint were recorded in real time. Data were collected on a total of 3,744 vehicles over five clinic days. Total time was collected, from entry to exit, on 2,860 vehicles. Registration and vaccination times were collected on 3,111 vehicles. Of the vehicles sampled, 1,588 (42%) had data points associated with all checkpoints. This open-source, innovative data collection tool was successfully implemented in our mass vaccination clinic for tracking patients in real time providing actionable data on overall throughput efficiency. This cost-effective tool can be used on a variety of healthcare-related projects to provide data-driven evaluation on the efficiency of care. ","3":"Hospital readmission of a primary diagnosis can have a substantial financial impact via reductions in reimbursement rates up to 3%, and have a negative impact on the lives of patients. Discharge medication reconciliation (DMR) can reduce medication errors that play a role in readmission. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of expanding pharmacist-led DMR across a four hospital health system on 30-day readmission rate for high risk of readmission disease groups. During the 3-month period, DMR was performed for patients with at least one of the disease states associated with a high risk for 30-day readmission, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, or acute myocardial infarction. The 30-day readmission rate for patients with a high risk for readmission disease state significantly decreased from 17.5% to 15.5% in the pre-expansion to postexpansion phase, respectively (p = .003). Discharge medication reconciliation capture rate increased from 28% pre-expansion to 35% postexpansion. After expansion, the number of DMR interventions reported by pharmacists increased 2.93 times. Expansion of pharmacist-led DMR as a form of transitions of care significantly decreased 30-day readmission rate for high risk of readmission disease groups. ","4":"Inpatient management of diabetes mellitus (DM) often involves substituting oral medications with insulin which can result in unnecessary insulin use. Attempting to address unnecessary insulin use, a quality improvement initiative implemented a newly developed evidence-based care pathway for inpatient diabetes management focused on patients with recent hemoglobin A1c values &lt; 8% and no prescription of outpatient insulin. This retrospective observational preintervention and postintervention and interrupted time series analysis evaluates this intervention. Over a 21-month time period, there was a significant decrease in mean units of insulin administered per day of hospitalization from 2.7 (2.2-3.3) in the preintervention group to 1.7 (1.2-2.3) in the postintervention group (p = .017). During the initial 72 hours after admission, a significant downward trend in mean glucose values and mean insulin units per day was seen after the intervention. There was no significant change in hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events between the two groups. The proportion of patients who received zero units of insulin during their admission increased from 27.7% to 52.5% after the intervention (p &lt; .001). An evidence-based pathway for inpatient management of DM was associated with decreased insulin use without significant changes in hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events.","5":"Missed appointments negatively affect patients, providers, and health systems. This study aimed to (1) quantify the percentage of missed appointments across 14 pediatric subspecialties in a tertiary-care children's hospital and (2) identify patient characteristics associated with missed appointments in those subspecialties. We extracted patient characteristics from 267,151 outpatient appointments, between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, across 14 subspecialty clinics. Medical complexity was categorized using the Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm. The primary outcome was appointment nonattendance. Cancellations, imaging\/laboratory visits, patients older than 18 years, and duplicate visits were excluded. Characteristics associated with nonattendance were analyzed with chi-square tests and included in the multivariable model if p &lt; .1. Missing data were addressed using random forest imputation, and assuming data were \"missing at random.\" Variables were considered statistically significant if p &lt; .05. Of the 128,117 scheduled appointments analyzed, 23,204 (18.1%) were missed. In the multivariable model, clinical nutrition had the greatest subspecialty odds of missed appointments, whereas cardiology had the lowest. Patient characteristics most strongly associated with missed appointments were public insurance, history of &gt;2 missed appointments, appointment lead time, lesser medical complexity, Black race\/ethnicity, and fewer medications. Clinical characteristics including lesser medical complexity and fewer medications are associated with missed appointments in pediatric subspecialties. ","6":"The transition in health care from a volume-based to value-based model of care, combined with pressures brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, makes the need for efficiency and coordination of the health center system imperative. The Value Transformation Framework (VTF), developed with health centers in mind, provides an organizing framework to support transformation of infrastructure, care delivery, and people systems. NACHC applied the VTF within a cohort of health centers across the country to drive systems change and improve performance on measures of clinical care. A comparison of health centers \"participating\" in application of the VTF relative to \"nonparticipating\" health centers nationally showed improvement during 3 years of program implementation. Significant differences (p &lt; .05) favoring health centers who participated were noted for screening of colorectal cancer (p &lt; .001), depression (p &lt; .001), hypertension (p &lt; .001), obesity (p = .001), and cervical cancer (p = .011). Performance for diabetes control also favored participating programs, although the difference did not quite reach significance (p = .45). Applying a systems approach, organized by the VTF, with evidence-based interventions and deployed in a learning community, can result in improved performance across multiple measures of clinical care. ","7":"Discharge education is essential to patient health and care coordination. Patient satisfaction with discharge education reveals a hospital's ability to provide reliable, quality experiences that engage and prepare patients for recovery in the community. The purpose of this study was to examine and improve patient satisfaction with discharge preparation by providing timely, standardized methods of educating patients about their medical condition, discharge needs, and follow-up care. This project provided nursing and the care team with training in effective techniques such as the teach-back method as well as new tools like a discharge folder to be successful. Provider workflows were redesigned, and the discharge education document was changed to ensure appropriate information was provided to patients. Patient perspective and satisfaction with their degree of preparedness for discharge were measured using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. After intervention, an improvement in the HCAHPS survey top box percent score for the domains of Care Transitions, 52.41%-54.49% (p &lt; .0001) and Discharge Information, 87.38-90.12% (p &lt; .0001), was noted. Increasing scores for HCAHPS questions pertinent to discharge suggest the intervention improved patient satisfaction with discharge information and preparation for recovery outside the hospital.","8":"Healthcare quality can be measured by studying structure, processes, and outcomes. This study examines how trialists capture process outcomes in implementation trials to provide guidance for researchers and health professionals. Electronic databases were searched, and two researchers performed the title, abstract, and full-text selection. Only implementation studies involving nonpharmacological approaches were included. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy and completeness by a second reviewer. Study quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. Of the 3,186 articles screened, 24 studies matched our inclusion criteria. Most studies were cluster randomized control trials, followed by interrupted time series studies and stepped wedge studies. The population in the studies was diverse and settings included hospitals, community centers, residential aged care facilities, and primary care. The reporting of process measures across the included studies varied, and there was limited information about the mechanisms of data collection procedures. Nineteen studies extracted information about processes from electronic medical records, patient records, or chart reviews. The remaining five studies used staff surveys. Challenges remain in the practical aspect of data collection for measuring process outcomes, particularly outside of hospital settings or where processes are hard to capture in patient records.","9":"Several quality measures for continuity of substance use care are being used in accountability programs, but it is not known whether they are predictive of better patient outcomes. We analyzed whether opioid use disorder (OUD) patients in the care of clinicians and practices with higher rates on one of these measures-continuity of pharmacotherapy for OUD-have a lower risk of overdose and detox events using Medicare data. For a 10-percentage point increase in an individual clinician's measure rate, the estimated odds ratios of a patient experiencing each of these two events were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85 to 0.99) for overdose and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.92) for detox. The corresponding estimates at the practice level were 0.90 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.95) for overdose and 0.83 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.89) for detox. These results suggest that a clinician's or practice's higher measure rate for continuity of pharmacotherapy for OUD is predictive of their patients' lower likelihood of having an adverse event. The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence on the importance of treatment continuity for OUD and support the validity of measuring continuity in provider-level accountability programs.","10":"A multidisciplinary team at a tertiary care Veterans Health Administration medical center created a standardized process to identify medically stable inpatients, to notify inpatient staff of available COVID-19 vaccine doses, and to coordinate inpatient vaccine administration. The team's goals were to mitigate vaccine waste while safely vaccinating as many patients as possible. Using a unique set of exclusion criteria and clinical judgment, a quality improvement team reviewed patients admitted to medicine teams to determine medical stability. Eligible, interested patients were listed in a secure shared file, and outpatient vaccine clinic staff communicated with inpatient nurse leaders regarding the availability of unadministered doses. Doses were transported to the hospital from the clinic and administered by inpatient nurses. Between January 8 and April 26, 2021, 105 patients were vaccinated with either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine during admission. Sixty-nine percent of the patients received a first dose, 27% received a second dose, and 4% received both doses. Forty-two percent of the patients vaccinated while inpatient identified as Black or African American compared with 28% of the vaccinated outpatients. No vaccine-related safety events were reported. This process demonstrates a viable approach to mitigating waste of COVID-19 vaccines and safely, efficiently, and equitably vaccinating an inpatient population.","11":null,"12":"Vaso-occlusive pain leads to high acute care utilization among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Data suggest that clinical pathways (CPWs) reduce variation in the management of vaso-occlusive pain and improve clinical outcomes. We implemented and evaluated a CPW for vaso-occlusive pain at our institution using a before and after study design. The primary objective was to decrease acute care utilization among patients with SCD, which was assessed by the primary outcome measures of hospital length of stay (LOS), 30-day readmission rate, and total hospitalizations annually per patient. Secondary outcome measures were packed red blood cell transfusions, and acute chest syndrome incidence. Patient-controlled analgesia use and promethazine use were assessed to estimate CPW use. Three hundred fourty-four admissions in 112 patients were analyzed, of which 193 admissions occurred pre-CPW and 151 admissions occurred post-CPW implementation. Post-CPW implementation, we observed a significant decrease in hospital admissions annually per patient, an increase in patient-controlled analgesia use, and a decrease in intravenous promethazine use. We observed trends toward decreased 30-day readmission rate and increased acute chest syndrome incidence, which were not statistically significant. No effect was found on hospital LOS. Clinical pathway implementation at our institution reduced variation in management and decreased hospital admissions for vaso-occlusive pain. ","13":"Previous research has shown that appropriate pediatric postintubation sedation (PIS) after rapid sequence intubation only occurs 28% of the time. Factors such as high provider variability, cognitive overload, and errors of omission can delay time to PIS in a paralyzed patient. To increase the proportion of children receiving timely PIS by 20% within 6 months. A multidisciplinary team identified key drivers and targeted interventions to improve timeliness of PIS. The primary outcome of \"sedation in an adequate time frame\" was defined as a time to post-Rapid Sequence Intubation sedative administration less than the duration of action of the RSI sedative agent. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients receiving any sedation and time to PIS administration. Pediatric postintubation sedation in an adequate time was improved from 27.9% of intubated patients to 55.6% after intervention (p = .001). The number of patients receiving any PIS improved from 74% to 94% (p = .006). The median time from RSI to PIS was reduced from 13 to 9 minutes (p &lt; .001). Process control charts showed a reduction in PIS variability and a centerline reduction from 19 to 10 minutes. Implementation of an intubation checklist and a multidisciplinary approach improved the rate of adequate pediatric PIS. ","14":"Preventable harm continues to occur with critically ill neonates despite efforts by hospital neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) to improve processes and reduce harm. Attaining significant and sustainable improvements will require training including leadership support, mentoring, and patient family engagement to improve care processes. This paper describes the implementation of a robust process improvement (RPI) program in the NICU to reduce harm. Leaders, staff, and parents were trained in RPI concepts and tools. Multidisciplinary teams including parent members applied the training and received regular mentorship for their improvement initiatives. Participants (N = 67) completed pretraining and post-training surveys. Training scores (0-10 scale) improved from an average of 4.45-7.60 (p &lt; .001) for confidence in leading process improvement work, 2.36 to 7.49 (p &lt; .001) for RPI knowledge, and 2.19 to 7.30 (p &lt; .001) for confidence in using RPI tools; relative improvement of 71%, 217%, and 233% respectively. Participants applied their RPI training on improvement initiatives that resulted in improvements of central line blood stream infections, very low birth weight infant nutrition, and unplanned extubations. Implementing an RPI program in the NICU to reduce harm resulted in significant and sustainable improvements on their improvement initiatives. ","15":"Rapid response teams (RRTs) have been used by multiple hospital systems to enhance patient care and safety. However, processes to document rapid response events (RRE) are often varied among providers and teams, which can lead to suboptimal communication of recommendations to both the primary medical team and family. A preintervention chart review was conducted from January-March 2018 and revealed suboptimal baseline documentation following RREs. A literature review and survey of RRT team members led to the creation of a standardized document with an Epic SmartPhrase which included six key elements of RRE documentation: physical examination, intervention performed, response to intervention, plan of care, communication with care team, and communication with family. A postintervention chart review was completed from April-June 2019 to assess improvements in documentation with the use of this SmartPhrase. There were 23 RRE activations in the postintervention period, of which 60.8% were due to respiratory distress. The documentation of the six key elements improved (p &lt; .05) after SmartPhrase creation and serial educational interventions. Standardized RRE documentation of six key elements significantly improved with the implementation of an Epic SmartPhrase. Improved quality of documentation enhances communication between team members and can contribute to safer patient care. ","16":"Effective communication among healthcare teams is essential for ensuring handoff-related safety and quality care outcomes. The aim of this project was to improve patient safety through the reduction of communication-related errors on an acute hemodialysis unit (AHU) in an academic medical center. A target was set to reduce by 50 percent the communication-related errors using strategies to improve teamwork and communication. Acute hemodialysis unit team members attended Clinical Team Training (CTT) informational sessions on teamwork and communication. A structured handoff tool was implemented in the AHU to improve nurse communication and reduce communication-related patient safety events. Descriptive statistics and comparison of means were conducted to assess the differences between preimplementation and postimplementation audit and safety event data. There was a statistically significant difference between the preintervention and postintervention groups of handoff tool usage and completion as well as a consistent decrease in handoff-related safety events after implementation. Findings suggest that CTT and a structured handoff tool used to guide nurse-to-nurse care transitions lead to a reduction in communication-related safety events during handoffs in an AHU. ","17":null,"18":"Those with diabetes are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Safety net clinics serve populations that bear a significant burden of disease and disparities and are a key setting in which to focus on reducing CVD. An integrated health system provided funding and technical assistance (TA) to safety net organizations (community health centers and public hospitals) in Northern California to decrease the risk of cardiovascular events for patients with diabetes. This was a program called Preventing Heart Attacks and Strokes Everyday (PHASE), which combined an evidence-based medication protocol with population health management and team-based care strategies. The TA supported organizations by sharing best practices, providing quality improvement coaching, and facilitating peer learning. A mixed-methods evaluation found that organizations involved in PHASE improved rates of blood pressure control and cardioprotective medication prescriptions for patients with diabetes. They made progress on these measures through strategies such as leveraging team-based care, providing education on evidence-based protocols, and using data to drive improvements. The evaluation concluded that financially supporting and providing focused TA to safety net organizations can help them build capacity and leverage their strengths to improve outcomes and potentially decrease the risk of heart attacks and strokes in communities.","19":"Inpatient hospital settings require access to high-quality blood specimens and durable peripheral intravenous (IV) catheters for patient care. The most common standard-of-care method for acquiring each blood specimen-venipuncture-often results in a non-negligible preanalytical error rate, patient discomfort, and tissue inflammation. In a 2-year, multicenter (23 hospitals) retrospective study, a novel blood collection system that collects blood specimens through existing inpatient IVs without a needle (PIVO, Velano Vascular) was compared with the current standard of care, in regards to its effect on specimen quality and IV catheter longevity. Using the PIVOTM device for blood collection decreased the rate of preanalytical errors by 56% compared with other collection methods, including venipuncture and conventional line draws. In addition, peripheral IV catheters that were used with PIVOTM for blood draws also had a 19% lower rate of replacement compared with those that did not. This is the largest study to date of PIVO use and demonstrates significant quality improvement outcomes compared with the current standard of care in blood collection, providing an opportunity to innovate inpatient hospital care.","20":"Mobile integrated health and community paramedicine (MIH-CP) programs are gaining popularity in the United States as a strategy to address the barriers to healthcare access and appropriate utilization. After one year of operation, leadership of Baltimore City's MIH-CP program was interested in understanding the circumstances surrounding readmission for enrolled patients and to incorporate quality improvement tools to direct program development. Retrospective chart review was performed to determine preventable versus unpreventable readmissions with a hypothesis that deficits in social determinants of health would play a more significant role in preventable readmissions. In the studied population, at least one root cause that can be considered a social determinant of health was present in 75.8% of preventable readmissions versus only 15.2% of unpreventable readmissions. Root Cause Analysis highlighted health literacy, functional status, and behavioral health issues among the root causes that most heavily influence preventable readmissions. Common Cause Analysis results suggest our MIH-CP program should focus its resources on mitigating poor health literacy and functional status. This project's findings successfully directed leadership of the city's MIH-CP program to modify program processes and advocate for the use of these quality improvement tools for other MIH-CP programs.","21":"Overprescribing contributes to the misuse and overuse of narcotics. We hypothesized that implementation of postoperative prescribing guidelines would consistently reduce the amount of opioids prescribed after ambulatory hand surgery. A divisional protocol was instituted in November 2018. A retrospective cohort study was designed to examine the policy's effects on postoperative prescribing. Postoperative opioid prescriptions for patients undergoing ambulatory hand surgery were evaluated 1 year before and 1 year after policy initiation. All prescriptions were converted into the total oral morphine equivalent (OME) prescribed. A total of 1,672 surgeries were included. Six hundred sixty-one cases were in preimplementation group, and 1,011 cases were in the postimplementation group. The median of total OME decreased significantly after distribution of prescribing guidelines from 75 in the preimplementation group to 45 in the postimplementation group (p &lt; .001) with significant reductions seen for carpal tunnel release (p &lt; .001), trigger finger release (p &lt; .001), distal radius open reduction internal fixation (p &lt; .001), and finger closed reduction and pinning (p &lt; .001). When categorized by procedure type, the median of total OME decreased from 75 to 30 for soft tissue procedures (p &lt; .001) and from 120 to 100 for bony procedures (p &lt; .001). Divisional prescribing guidelines lead to consistent short-term to mid-term reductions in the amount of opioid medication prescribed postoperatively. ","22":"We sought to determine if audit-and-feedback with peer comparison among emergency physicians is associated with improved emergency department (ED) throughput and decreased variation in physician performance. We implemented an audit-and-feedback with peer comparison tool at a single urban academic ED from March 1, 2013, to July 1, 2018. In the first study period, physicians received no reports. In the second period, they received daily reports. In the third period, they received daily, quarterly, and annual reports. Outcomes included patients per hour, admission rate, time to admission, and time to discharge. A total of 272,032 patient visits and 36 ED physicians were included. The mean admission rate decreased 6.8%; the mean time to admission decreased 43.8 minutes; and the mean time to discharge decreased 40.6 minutes. Variation among physicians decreased for admission rate, time to admission, and time to discharge. Low-performing outliers showed disproportionately larger improvements in patients per hour, admission rate, time to admission, and time to discharge. Automated peer comparison reports for academic emergency physicians was associated with lower admission rates, shorter times to admission, and shorter times to discharge at the departmental level, as well as decreased practice variation at the individual level. ","23":"Hospital 30-day readmissions remain a major quality and cost indicator. Traditional readmission risk scores, such as LACE (length of stay, acuity of admission, Charlson comorbidity index, and emergency department visits), may be suboptimal in special patient populations, such as those with sepsis. As sepsis survivorship improves, there is a need to determine which variables might be associated with a decrease in 30-day readmission. We completed a retrospective analysis reviewing patients with sepsis who had unplanned 30-day readmissions. Multivariate regression analysis was performed for the REadmission PREvention in SepSis (REPRESS) model, which evaluated age, length of stay, Charlson disease count, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score, discharge to a skilled nursing facility, and mobility for predictive significance in hospital readmission. Our REPRESS model performed better when compared with LACE for predicting readmission risk in a sepsis population.","24":"Asthma is a leading cause of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits. A metered-dose inhaler and spacer (MDI-S) device is equivalent to and more cost effective than delivery by nebulization in the ED management of mild asthma exacerbations. We aimed to increase the use of albuterol MDI-S among patients with mild asthma exacerbations using a quality improvement framework. We evaluated albuterol use for mild asthma exacerbations between January 2019 and March 2020 in our pediatric EDs. Our primary outcome was the proportion of albuterol delivered through an MDI-S. Our process measure was the use of a new electronic order set. Balancing measures included ED length of stay, admission rates, and the use of intravenous magnesium. Interventions included forging multidisciplinary partnerships, revising clinical practice guidelines, establishing an electronic order set, and leading educational initiatives for clinicians. We demonstrated a center line shift of MDI-S use from 34.4% to 47.7%. The average length of stay, hospital admissions, and magnesium use were not affected by our interventions. Forging multidisciplinary partnerships, creating an electronic order set prioritizing albuterol MDI-S use, and educational initiatives led to a sustained increase in albuterol MDI-S use for mild asthma in our pediatric EDs. ","25":"Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a serious complication that can lead to negative outcomes. There are known risk factors for OIRD; however, a lack of national guidelines for the prevention and early detection of OIRD exists. An evidence-based practice study was conducted to create an enhanced monitoring (EM) program. The EM program consisted of risk stratification of surgical spine patients, including the use of STOP-BANG screening for obstructive sleep apnea, capnography monitoring, use of home positive airway pressure therapy, capnography alarm optimization, hospitalist consultation, nursing education, and patient education. Approximately 17% (N = 937\/5,462) of surgical spine patients were enrolled in the EM program. Fifty-six percent of EM patients were monitored with capnography and had out of range end-tidal carbon dioxide levels 17% of the time. The rate of transfers to the intensive care unit (ICU) for OIRD decreased, though not statistically significant (p = .151). The EM program with risk stratification was found to reduce transfers to the ICU for OIRD. Although not statistically significant, the decreased number of transfers was clinically significant. Engagement of the interprofessional team and capnography alarm parameter optimization helped to reduce nonactionable alarms. ","26":"The Medicare Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) program established performance-based financial incentives for hospitals. We hypothesized that total performance scores (TPS) would vary by hospital type. Value-Based Purchasing reports were collected from 2015 to 2017 and merged with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Impact File data. A total of 3,005 hospitals were grouped into physician-owned surgical hospitals (POSH), accountable care organizations (ACO), Kaiser, Vizient, and General hospitals. Longitudinal linear mixed-effects models compared temporal differences of TPS and secondary composite outcome, process, patient satisfaction, safety, and cost efficiency measures between hospital types. Total performance scores decreased across all hospital types (p &lt; .001). Physician-owned surgical hospitals had the highest TPS (59.9), followed by Kaiser (49.2), ACO (36.7), General (34.8), and Vizient (30.7) (p &lt; .001). Hospital types differed significantly in size, geography, mean case-mix index, Medicare patient discharges, percent Medicare days to inpatient days, Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, and uncompensated care per claim. Scores improved in 84% of POSH and 14.6% of Kaiser hospitals using score reallocations. In comparison with General hospitals, the TPS was higher for POSH and Kaiser and lower for Vizient in part due to weighting reallocation and individual domain scores. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services scoring system changes have not addressed the methodological biases favoring certain hospital types. ","27":"","28":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a chronic infection that can lead to severe liver damage if left untreated. With increased availability and affordability of curative treatments, screening for HCV has become an important first step in reducing morbidity and mortality. At a rural federally qualified health center in North Carolina, two quality improvement initiatives-an electronic health record (EHR) prompt and educational flyers-were implemented to improve HCV screening rates. We compared the proportion of eligible patients born from 1945 to 1965 who received HCV screening before, during, and after the initiatives. HCV screening rates were highest during the two initiatives (30% and 39%, respectively). Screening rates fell in the 6-month period after the initiatives' conclusion (12%) but remained higher than at baseline (6%). Although HCV screening can increase with simple interventions, more durable solutions are needed to maintain screening coverage.","29":"Healthcare transformation requires a healthcare quality workforce with the requisite expertise to lead, oversee, and implement positive change within healthcare organizations. The National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ) Competency Framework, which spans 29 competencies across 8 domains of healthcare quality, outlines the specific knowledge and skills needed to advance personal and organizational quality goals. This study describes 1,671 responses to the NAHQ Professional Assessment survey from a diverse group of healthcare quality professionals representative of NAHQ's professional community. Results show that two-thirds of respondents indicated they are working in 4 or more competency domains, with 85% reporting working in Performance and Process Improvement. Results also indicate that individuals who hold the Certified Professional in Healthcare Quality (CPHQ) certification perform work at more advanced levels across all eight domains of the competency framework. This was statistically significant for 13 of the 29 competencies including all three competency statements within the Performance and Process Improvement domain. Healthcare organizations need a workforce with specialized quality and safety expertise to advance quality goals, and this study suggests that those who invest in continued professional development by attaining the CPHQ certification may be better positioned to contribute meaningfully to advance these goals and improve organizational outcomes.","30":"","31":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that half of the antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in ambulatory care settings are unnecessary. To better understand the quality-of-care implications of prescription patterns for ARTIs, we conducted a retrospective chart review of outpatient ARTI visits, across a large integrated health system, and examined the association of patient characteristics with receiving antimicrobials, as well as the association between receiving antimicrobials and healthcare utilization (outpatient and emergency department visits). We found that 55.4% of all ARTI outpatients were treated with antimicrobials. There was no association between patient demographics and antimicrobial prescriptions on either the first (p &lt; .0771) or follow-up (p &lt; .6316) visits. A lower comorbidity score was significantly associated with receiving antimicrobials (p &lt; .0022). Patients who received antimicrobials at the first visit had significantly higher number of follow-up visits (p &lt; .005) and more follow-up antimicrobial prescriptions (p &lt; .0066) as compared with patients who did not receive antimicrobials at the first visit. Our results highlight the potential for clinicians to improve quality of care in ARTI management.","32":"Patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) are at high risk of being readmitted to hospitals within 30 days. Routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data may enable hospitals to predict CRF readmission and target interventions to increase quality and reduce readmissions. We compared the ability of manually extracted variables to predict readmission compared with EHR-based prediction using multivariate logistic regression on 1 year of admission data from an academic medical center. Categorizing three routinely collected variables (creatinine, B-type natriuretic peptide, and length of stay) increased readmission prediction by 30% compared with paper-based methods as measured by C-statistic (AUC). Marginal effects analysis using the final multivariate model provided patient-specific risk scores from 0% to 44.3%. These findings support the use of routinely collected EHR data for effectively stratifying readmission risk for patients with CRF. Generic readmission risk tools may be evidence-based but are designed for general populations and may not account for unique traits of specific patient populations-such as those with CRF. Routinely collected EHR data are a rapid, more efficient strategy for risk stratifying and strategically targeting care. Earlier risk stratification and reallocation of clinician effort may reduce readmissions. Testing this risk model in additional populations and settings is warranted.","33":"It is unclear if national investments of the HITECH Act have resulted in significant improvements in care processes and outcomes by making \"Meaningful Use (MU)\" of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of EHRs and MU on inpatient quality. We used inpatient hospitalization data, American Hospital Association annual survey, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services attestation records to study the impact of EHRs on inpatient quality composite scores. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Inpatient Quality Indicator (IQI) software version 5.0 was used to compute the hospital-level risk-adjusted standardized rates for IQI indicators and composite scores. After adjusting for confounding factors, EHRs that attested to MU had a positive impact on IQI 90 and IQI 91 composite scores with an 8% decrease in composites for mortality for selected procedures and 18% decrease in composites for mortality for selected conditions. Meaningful Use attestation may be an important driver related to inpatient quality. Health care leaders may need to focus on quality improvement initiatives and advanced analytics to better leverage their EHRs to improve IQI 90 composite score for mortality for selected procedures, because we observed a lesser impact on IQI 90 compared with IQI 91.","34":"Quality measurement across healthcare is undertaken with a goal of improving care and outcomes for patients; however, the relationship between quality measurement and patient outcomes remains largely untested, particularly in inpatient behavioral health. Using a retrospective quantitative design, we assessed 142 behavioral health organizations' quality data submitted to the Hospital-Based Inpatient Psychiatric Services and Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting programs from 2017 to 2018 and tested relationships between compliance on 16 quality measures and symptom improvement on patient self-report outcomes (SROs) at the facility level. Performance on many quality measures was negatively skewed (at least four have almost no room for improvement on average), and there was high interrelatedness between most quality measures. Nine of the assessed measures correlated with patient SROs but not in clear groupings. Findings indicate that an underlying organizational construct may be driving compliance rates on quality measures, but the measures are not linked to treatment outcomes as expected. We encourage an expansion of the current framework of behavioral health quality measurement beyond process and organization and suggest the addition of patient outcomes such as SROs as quality measures to directly assess patient improvement.","35":"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid uses the standardized readmission ratio (SRR) to evaluate 30-day readmissions among dialysis providers in the U.S. Readmissions among dialysis recipients remains 37%. This study investigates associations among dialysis facilities and patient characteristics with facility's performance on the SRR. Descriptive, longitudinal, approach using multivariate regression analysis on data retrieved from the Dialysis Facility Report to evaluate the associations between facility-level (staffing, profit status, chain membership, clinic size, care, length of care, vascular access type, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), creatinine, hemoglobin, use of erythropoietin-stimulating agent, albumin, and primary dialysis modality) with the SRR. Factors associated with a high SRR included nurse ratios, facility average GFR, and Northeast geographic location. Factors associated with a low SRR included patient care technician ratio, length of predialysis nephrology care, initiation of dialysis with an arteriovenous fistula, average hemoglobin, and Western geographic location. This study defines the influence predialysis nephrology care has on dialysis facilities SRRs. Access to care, adequate preparation for dialysis, and transitional support affect facilities' performance; however, without an appropriate staffing model, dialysis facilities may continue to struggle to reduce readmissions. ","36":"","37":"There is a gap between evidence-based knowledge of exercise benefits and the translation of these benefits among persons with multiple sclerosis within clinical practice. This study represents the second cycle of a Plan-Do-Study-Act ramp to assess and improve three exercise promotion practice models and a screening process for use by healthcare providers to bridge the knowledge-translation gap within comprehensive multiple sclerosis care. Using a quality improvement design, our research team created an online survey for evaluating program materials by healthcare providers (i.e., neurologists, nurses, physical therapists, and occupational therapists). Participants provided written comments and suggestions for improvement regarding roles and responsibilities and clarity and relatability of these tools within a real-world setting. Healthcare providers submitted 13 suggestions for improvement. Responses informed four specific improvements regarding program materials (i.e., patient screening, current exercise behavior, referrals, and provider checklists), thereby prompting the research team to adapt and further test the change idea. This article provides a step forward in a line of research focused on developing a systems-based process for integrating exercise promotion as part of comprehensive multiple sclerosis care. ","38":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused over 1,250,000 deaths worldwide. With limited therapeutic options, proning nonintubated patients emerged as a safe and affordable intervention to manage hypoxemia. A proning protocol to identify and prone eligible patients was implemented. Patients were encouraged to self-prone for 2-3 hours, 3 times daily. Investigators created educational materials for nurses and patients and developed a COVID-19-specific proning order within the electronic health record (EHR). Investigators completed an 800-person retrospective chart review to study the implementation of this protocol. From March 22, 2020, to June 5, 2020, 586 patients were admitted to the COVID-19 floor. Of these patients, 42.8% were eligible for proning. Common contraindications were lack of hypoxia, altered mental status, and fall risk. The proning protocol led to a significant improvement in provider awareness of patients appropriate for proning, increasing from 12% to 83%, as measured by placement of a proning order into the EHR. There was a significant improvement in all appropriate patients documented as proned, increasing from 18% to 45% of eligible patients. The creation of an effective hospital-wide proning protocol to address the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic is possible and may be accomplished in a short period of time. ","39":"Although most patient-clinician interactions occur in ambulatory care, little research has addressed measuring ambulatory patient safety or how primary care redesign such as the patient-centered medical home (PCMH) addresses patient safety. Our objectives were to identify PCMH standards relevant to patient safety, construct a measure of patient safety activity implementation, and examine differences in adoptions of these activities by practice and community characteristics. Using a consensus process, we selected elements among a widely adopted, nationally representative PCMH program representing activities that, according to a physician panel, represented patient safety overall and in four domains (diagnosis, treatment delays, medications, and communication and coordination) and generated a score for each. We then evaluated this score among 5,007 practices with the highest PCMH recognition level. Implementation of patient safety activities varied; the few military practices (2.4%) had the highest, and community clinics the lowest, patient safety score, both overall (82.0 and 72.0, respectively, p &lt; .001) and across specific domains. Other practice and community characteristics were not associated with the patient safety score. Understanding better what factors are associated with implementation of patient safety activities may be a key step in improving ambulatory patient safety.","40":"The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Score for Trauma Triage in the Geriatric and Middle-Aged (STTGMA) patients is able to predict fall, fracture, periprosthetic fracture, or dislocation risk after femoral neck fracture arthroplasty surgery. Four hundred one patients who underwent hip arthroplasty surgery after a femoral neck fracture at one urban academic medical center were stratified into groups based on their risk scores assigned at femoral neck fracture presentation. The cohort was reviewed for the occurrence of postdischarge falls, secondary fractures, and prosthetic dislocations that resulted in a presentation to the emergency department (ED) after discharge from their hip fracture surgery. The incidence and timing of these complications after discharge were compared between the low-risk and high-risk groups. The low-risk group included 201 patients, and the high-risk group included 200 patients. The high-risk group had significantly more postdischarge falls resulting in ED presentation (49 vs. 32, p = .035) that occurred significantly sooner (12.6 vs. 18.3 months, p = .034) after discharge. The STTGMA model was able to successfully stratify patients who are at a higher risk of sustaining a fall after an arthroplasty procedure for a femoral neck fracture. ","41":"Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) has been shown to improve healthcare quality and patient safety; however, formal interprofessional education (IPE) training is insufficient. The VA Quality Scholars (VAQS) program exists to develop interprofessional leaders and scholars in healthcare improvement. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of integrating interprofessional healthcare learners and designing an interprofessional curriculum for the national VAQS program. VAQS alumni (graduates from 2001 to 2017) across eight national sites (n = 102 [53.1%]) completed a web-based survey to assess alumni perceptions of IPC skill development during the program and IPC skill utilization in their careers. Alumni from 2009 and earlier were physicians; alumni after 2009 came from diverse health professional backgrounds. Overall, IPC and teamwork was identified as the most used skill (n = 82, 70%) during their career. When comparing the pre-IPE period and the post-IPE period, post-IPE alumni identified IPC and teamwork as the area of greatest skill development (n = 38). Integrating interprofessional trainees and robust IPE curricula enhanced an established and successful quality improvement (QI) training program. VAQS alumni endorsed the importance of IPC skills during their careers. The VAQS program is an example of how health professionals can successfully learn IPC skills in healthcare QI.","42":"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented numbers of patients with acute respiratory distress to medical centers. Hospital systems require rapid adaptation to respond to the increased demand for airway management while ensuring high quality patient care and provider safety. There is limited literature detailing successful system-level approaches to adapt to the surge of COVID-19 patients requiring airway management. A deliberate system-level approach was used to expand a preexisting airway response service. Through a needs analysis (taking into account both existing resources and anticipated demands), we established priorities and solutions for the airway management challenges encountered during the pandemic. During our COVID-19 surge (March 10, 2020, through May 26, 2020), there were 619 airway consults, and the COVID airway response team (CART) performed 341 intubations. Despite a 4-fold increase in intubations during the surge, there was no increase in cardiac arrests or surgical airways and no documented COVID-19 infections among the CART. Our system-level approach successfully met the sudden escalation in demand in airway management incurred by the COVID-19 surge. The approach that addressed staffing needs prioritized provider protection and enhanced quality and safety monitoring may be adaptable to other institutions. ","43":"Late cancellations and no-shows for surgery place a burden on patients, healthcare providers, and the health system. We aim to identify risk factors contributing to this phenomenon. Patients who did not arrive for, or canceled within 24 hours of, their surgical appointment between January 2019 and 2020 were identified. Controls were matched by date, procedure, and gender. Demographic information was obtained by phone interview and chart review. Chi-square and Student t-test analyses were used to predict risk factors for cancellation. Thirty-one patients were identified, of whom 21 completed phone interviews. Age, gender, race, language, marital status, and smoking status were not significantly different. Study patients reported more transportation challenges (33.3% vs. 4.8%, p = .01) yet lived closer to the hospital (4.53 miles vs. 14.05 miles, p = .01). Study patients lived in lower income zip codes ($48,145 vs. $63,406, p = .02) and more commonly had Medicaid as their primary insurance (70.9% vs. 38.7%, p = .04). Most commonly, no reason was given for cancellation (22.6%) followed by personal reasons (16.1%) and surgery reconsideration (16.1%). Transportation trouble and lower income are significant risk factors for surgery late cancellation. Prior no-show must also be considered. A targeted pilot program may help prevent late cancellations. ","44":"Despite trends showing increases in the utilization of outpatient (OP) ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) and decreases in the utilization of inpatient (IP) facilities for total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA), little is known about opioid prescribing for these procedures between each setting. This study evaluated differences in opioid prescribing and consumption between OP ASC and IP settings for elective TKA and THA surgeries over a 1-year period. Data collection also included pain and satisfaction of pain control postsurgery. In an OP ASC, analysis revealed a significant decrease in pills prescribed (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001) and consumed (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001) for TKA and THA, respectively. There was a significant decrease in the morphine equivalence units prescribed (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001) and consumed (p &lt; .001, p &lt; .001) for TKA and THA, respectively. For TKA, pain was significantly lower (p = .018) and satisfaction of pain control was significantly higher (p = .007). For THA, pain (p = .374) and satisfaction of pain control (p = .173) were similar between the settings. Benefits of performing these surgeries in an OP ASC setting are patients having similar or lower levels of pain and having similar or higher satisfaction of pain control. Patients are also prescribed and consume less opioids. This has important implications for healthcare systems.","45":null,"46":"Depression is a common and serious illness that impairs the health of individuals and societies globally. It is associated with a significant economic burden, with productivity losses exceeding $40 billion dollars annually in the United States (U.S.) alone. This project focused on the use of a systematic, data-driven approach to improve the screening rate for depression in an academic, metropolitan cancer center located in North Texas. A multidisciplinary team collaboratively applied Lean Six Sigma education, methods, and tools within oncology and psychiatry clinics to address the increased risk of depression among oncology patients. Improving the standardization of screening and follow-up processes, resulted in a 44% sustained increase in the depression screening and follow-up performance rate. This improvement was verified to be statistically significant through the use of control charts toward the end of the project.","47":"The impact of COVID-19, on the health and safety of patients, staff, and healthcare organizations, has yet to be fully uncovered. Patient adverse events, such as hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs), have been problematic for decades. The introduction of a pandemic to an environment that is potentially at-risk for adverse events may result in unintended patient safety and quality concerns. We use the learning health system framework to motivate our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of HAPIs within our health system. Using a retrospective, observational design, we used descriptive statistics to evaluate trends in HAPI from March to July 2020. Hospital-acquired pressure injury numbers have fluctuated from a steady increase from March-May 2020, hitting a peak high of 90 cases in the month of May. However, the trend in the total all stage HAPIs began to decline in June 2020, with a low of 51 in July, the lowest number since March 2020. Patients evaluated in this study did not have a longitudinal increase in HAPIs from March-July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite similarities in illness severity between the two time points. Our experience has demonstrated the ability of our organizational leaders to learn quickly during crisis.","48":"Reducing environmental noise has become a priority for many health systems. Following a 10-week preparation period, our health system transitioned from an overhead-activated to a silently activated in-hospital code team notification system. The goal of this initiative was to reduce environmental noise and support code team communication and function without adversely affecting response time, provider availability, or key quality metrics. Transitioning from overhead to silently activated events involved a three-step quality improvement approach. Input from key stakeholders and preimplementation education were of key importance. Multiple timed trials and a full in situ simulation were completed before going live with the new process. Evaluation of 6-month pre- and postimplementation quality metrics showed no significant difference in compliance with defibrillating shockable rhythms within two minutes, event survival, or survival to discharge. Provider survey data and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems \"quiet at night\" scores were not significantly different. By utilizing a multistep implementation approach, transitioning from overhead pages to a silently activated system for in-hospital code team activation was feasible and safe. Abandoning the overhead paging system did not lead to a decrease in key quality metrics nor impair team perception of code function. ","49":"It is unknown if changes in the rate of discharges against medical advice (DAMA) are related to the implementation of the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). We performed an interrupted time series analysis of monthly DAMA rates per 1,000 discharges of all enrolled individuals 18-64 years old with a hospitalization between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, in a commercially insured population. We performed a segmented linear regression with two interruptions: (1) April 2010 to coincide with the passage of the HRRP and (2) October 2012 to coincide with the implementation of HRRP penalties. There were 1,087,812 discharges representing 668,823 individuals over 120 months. The downward trend in monthly DAMA rates was reversed significantly after April 2010 with a sustained 0.1 increase in the monthly rate that continued after the implementation of penalties in October 2012. Allowing for the two interruptions, there was a statistically significant positive trend (0.10; 0.06-0.13, p &lt; .01) in April 2010. Relative to the first interruption, there was no statistically significant change in the slope in October 2012; the estimated slope was -0.04 (-0.08 to 0.002). Monthly DAMA rates increased in anticipation of and after HRRP implementation, suggesting a potential relationship between the HRRP and DAMA.","50":"Diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), is the leading cause of blindness in the United States. Early detection and appropriate timely treatment would result in 50-70% reduction in blindness due to DM, with a positive economic impact on patients and the healthcare system. The purpose of our project is to improve screening rates for retinopathy among patients with DM seen in a large endocrinology clinic applying the Lean Six Sigma Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control project framework and clinical decision support tools embedded in the electronic health record (EHR). Retinopathy screening rates improved from 49% to 72% by the end of the project. Interventions included identifying care gaps using a population registry, patient outreach through the electronic medical record patient portal, placing referrals to ophthalmology, improving documentation in health maintenance, and tracking improvement for sustainability. Our results demonstrate that process improvement methodologies and EHR tools can be successfully applied to improve care and clinical outcomes in patients with DM.","51":"Interhospital transfers (IHT) are important yet high-risk transitions in care. Variable IHT processes and a lack of clarity around best practice may contribute to risk. To define the best practice principles for IHTs and identify improvement opportunities in the transfer process to our hospital's Cardiology services. Through literature review, interviews with experts and key stakeholders, a survey of health care professionals at our institution, and a failure modes effect analysis, we identified themes in IHT best practices and improvement opportunities. We identified six critical elements of IHT: (1) initiation of transfer request; (2) the management of transfer request and information exchange; (3) updates between transfer acceptance and patient transport; (4) transport; (5) patient admission and information availability; and (6) measurement, evaluation, and feedback. Improvement opportunities were found in all elements. The standardization of these six critical elements may improve the safety of IHTs. ","52":null,"53":"The American Diabetes Association recommends scheduled basal and nutritional insulin doses as the preferred treatment for noncritically ill hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes; however, the adoption of these practices remains suboptimal. We sought to understand current diabetes management practices and improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes on the Hospital Medicine Services at our academic medical center. We surveyed resident and attending physicians to understand barriers to guideline-based practice. We conducted educational sessions, developed pocket-card decision aids, encouraged discussion on rounds, and provided periodic performance feedback to attending physicians. Results of the barriers survey identified \"fear of causing hypoglycemia\" as the most common barrier to guideline-based practice. Compared with the preintervention 12-month period, these interventions were associated with doubling of the use of guideline-based insulin therapy regimens, a significant reduction in the rate of severe hyperglycemia days, and a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of hypoglycemia days over a 12-month period. These results demonstrate that a simple, low-cost intervention can be associated with an increase in guideline-concordant insulin ordering with improvement in glycemic outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes.","54":"The transfusion of blood products is a widely used practice but comes with the risk of transfusion-associated adverse events and fatalities. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate if strict adherence to transfusion guidelines would lead to a decrease in the rate of transfusion reactions that occurred when blood products were given outside of established indications. Hospital-wide educational programs and dedicated electronic transfusion order sets were used to encourage adherence to guidelines. A secondary aim of this study was to evaluate if a decrease in the incidence of transfusion reactions also lead to a decrease in associated healthcare costs.","55":null,"56":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that tobacco use is the largest and most preventable cause of disease and mortality in the United States. The Joint Commission implemented inpatient tobacco treatment measures (TTMs) in 2012 to encourage healthcare systems to create processes that help patients quit tobacco use through evidence-based care. A tobacco cessation care delivery system was implemented at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital and Clinics, which included: standardized pathways within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) electronic health record system to improve nicotine replacement therapy ordering; evidence-based tobacco cessation counseling; and improved care coordination for tobacco cessation treatment through the use of technological innovation. Outcomes were obtained from the VHA quality metric reporting system known as Strategic Analytics for Improvement and Learning (SAIL). TOB-2 and TOB-3 (two Joint Commission inpatient TTMs) equivalent to tob20 and tob40 within SAIL improved by greater than 300% after implementation at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital and Clinics. Implementation of a tobacco cessation care system at James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital and Clinics enhanced interdisciplinary coordination of tobacco cessation care and resulted in improvements of The Joint Commission inpatient TTMs by greater than threefold. ","57":"Every one out of 10 nurses reported suffering from high levels of burnout worldwide. It is unclear if burnout affects job performance, and in turn, impairs patient safety, including medication safety. The purpose of this study is to determine whether nurse burnout predicts self-reported medication administration errors (MAEs). A cross-sectional study using electronic surveys was conducted from July 2018 through January 2019, using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Staff registered nurses (N = 928) in acute care Alabama hospitals (N = 42) were included in this study. Descriptive statistics, correlational, and multilevel mixed-modeling analyses were examined. All burnout dimensions (Personal, Work-related, and Client-related Burnout) were significantly correlated with age (r = -0.17 to -0.21), years in nursing (r = -0.10 to -0.17), years of hospital work (r = -0.07 to -0.10), and work environment (r = -0.24 to -0.57). The average number of self-reported MAEs in the last 3 months was 2.13. Each burnout dimension was a statistically significant predictor of self-reported MAEs (p &lt; .05). Nurse burnout is a significant factor in predicting MAEs. This study provides important baseline data for actionable interventions to improve nursing care delivery, and ultimately health care, for Alabamians. ","58":"As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, patient care guidelines were published and elective surgeries postponed. However, trauma admissions are not scheduled and cannot be postponed. There is a paucity of information available on continuing trauma care during the pandemic. The study purpose was to describe multicenter trauma care process changes made during the COVID-19 pandemic. This descriptive survey summarized the response to the COVID-19 pandemic at six Level I trauma centers. The survey was completed in 05\/2020. Questions were asked about personal protective equipment, ventilators, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and negative pressure rooms. Data were summarized as proportions. The survey took an average of 5 days. Sixty-seven percent reused N-95 respirators; 50% sanitized them with 25% using ultraviolet light. One hospital (17%) had regional resources impacted. Thirty-three percent created ventilator allocation protocols. Most hospitals (83%) designated more beds to the ICU; 50% of hospitals designated an ICU for COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients were isolated in negative pressure rooms at all hospitals. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Level I trauma centers created processes to provide optimal trauma patient care and still protect providers. Other centers can use the processes described to continue care of trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. ","59":"","60":"Intraoperative anesthetic technique directly impacts immediate postoperative recovery, yet there are few opportunities for anesthesiologists to receive feedback and no easily available benchmarks, making it difficult to reflect on one's own practice. This initial implementation study used retrospective data from 5,712 ambulatory surgery cases with healthy adult patients undergoing general anesthesia in 2018 at a large tertiary care academic center. It examines variation in practice among anesthesiologists for eight surgical specialties. Scorecards assessing intraoperative and postoperative opioids, antiemetics, nonopioid analgesics, regional blocks, recovery time, and severe postoperative pain compared with peers were given to anesthesiologists with prefeedback and postfeedback surveys assessing their attitudes toward feedback. Before receiving their scorecard, 71% of providers predicted their performance was average, and 29% predicted their performance was above average. After receiving their scorecards, 42% rated their quality of recovery as worse than expected, 42% rated it as expected, and 16% rated it as better than expected. Thirteen percent disagreed, 44% were neutral, and 44% agreed that this feedback will change their practice. Implementing a scorecard of patient-centered measures that shows where an anesthesiologist stands in the distribution of their peers was well-received, provides a benchmark, and has the potential to change practice.","61":"Lawmakers suggest Certificate of Need (CON) laws' main goals are increasing access to healthcare, increasing quality of healthcare, and decreasing healthcare costs. This retrospective database study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of CON through analysis of total knee, hip, and shoulder arthroplasty (TKA, THA, and TSA, respectively). A review was performed using the Humana Insurance PearlDiver national database from 2007 to 2015. Access to care was approximated by the rates of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in patients diagnosed with arthritis to the corresponding joint. The quality of care was assessed using complication rates after TJA. The total cost of TJA was approximated from average reimbursement to the healthcare facility per procedure. Patients in states without CON programs received TKA, THA, and TSA more frequently (p &lt; .0001, p = .250, p = .019). No significant difference was found in studied complication rates between CON and non-CON states. Similarly, there was no trend found when comparing the cost of each procedure in CON versus non-CON states. These findings are consistent with other recent studies detailing the impact of CON regulation on THA and TKA. The apparent nonsuperiority of CON states in achieving their purported goals may call into question the effectiveness of additional bureaucracy and regulation, suggesting a need for further examination.","62":"As part of an institutional quality improvement (QI) initiative for the 2018-2019 academic year, orthopedic residents at our tertiary center were incentivized to bring over 75% of hip fracture patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Class 2 or less to surgery in under 24 hours, compared to the baseline rate of 55.9%. The time between admission and surgery for hip fracture patients with ASA class 2 or less was prospectively recorded. At the end of the study period, a retrospective comparison was performed between patients treated before and after the resident QI initiative. The percentage of patients who underwent surgery within 24 hours of admission increased significantly in the Study Cohort compared to the Baseline Cohort (78.6% vs. 55.9%, p = .037). Length of stay was shorter in the Study Cohort compared to the Baseline Cohort (3 days vs. 4 days, p = .01), whereas readmissions (3.6% vs. 4.4%, p = .85) and discharges to skilled nursing facilities (60.7% vs. 57.4%, p = .76) were comparable between both cohorts. A goal-directed, resident-led QI initiative was associated with a significantly increased percentage of hip fragility fracture patients who underwent surgery in less than 24 hours.","63":"The Transforming Clinical Practice Initiative (TCPI) was designed to provide technical assistance to clinicians and prepare practices to participate in value-based payment arrangements. In this longitudinal cohort study, we assessed whether clinician's participation in TCPI practice transformation networks (PTNs) was associated with changes in quality of care from 2016 to 2018. We extracted quarterly measure performance data from 2016 to 2018 on two NQF-endorsed measures, one for outcome (Controlling High Blood Pressure) and one for process (Use of Imaging Studies for Low Back Pain), from 1,981 primary care clinicians enrolled in the PRIME Registry. Clinicians participating in PTNs were identified and compared with their counterparts who did not participate in PTNs. We found that the performance of PTN clinicians on controlling high blood pressure and use of imaging studies for low back pain was equivalent to that of non-PTN clinicians during the first 3 years of the TCPI. Although PTNs provided assistance to help practices achieve their clinical outcomes, these findings suggest that the changes in quality of care, for the measures studied, among PTN clinicians in the first 3 years of the TCPI were attributable to temporal trends rather than participation in PTNs.","64":"Urinary tract infection (UTI) complications are often attributed to the inappropriate use of urinary catheters. We sought to examine the effectiveness of a hospital-wide policy aimed at reducing the use of indwelling Foley catheters. We completed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 577 hip and femur fracture patients aged 55 years and older who were operatively treated at a Level 1 trauma center between October 2014 and March 2019. New standard-of-care guidelines restricting the use of indwelling Foley catheters were implemented starting January 2018, and we compared perioperative outcomes between cohorts. Over a 50% absolute reduction in indwelling Foley catheter use and a near 30% relative reduction in hospital-acquired UTI were achieved. Postpolicy cohort patients without indwelling Foley catheters experienced lower odds of hospital-acquired UTI, higher odds of home discharge, as well as decreased time to surgery, shorter length of stay, and lower total inpatient cost compared with those with indwelling Foley catheters. The policy of restricting indwelling Foley catheter placement was safe and effective. A decrease in indwelling Foley catheter use led to a decrease in the rate of hospital-acquired UTI and positively affected other perioperative outcomes. ","65":"With unintended medication discrepancy rates ranging from 30% to 70%, a formal discharge medication reconciliation process must be developed. One strategy shown to reduce medication errors is a pharmacist medication review at discharge. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of a pharmacist-driven discharge medication reconciliation program. The intervention group included pharmacist-reviewed patients with a high risk of unplanned readmission score and had a discharge order signed during a 2-month period. The control group included eligible patients who were not reviewed by a pharmacist. The after-visit summaries for both groups were then reviewed for additional medication discrepancies. This study included 140 patients, with 70 patients in each group. A total of 176 discrepancies were identified in the intervention group and 235 were found in the control group. The median number of discrepancies per patient was not statistically different between groups (2 vs. 2, p-value = .196). There were 22 and 24 30-day hospital readmissions in the intervention and control groups, respectively (p-value = .857). More medication discrepancies were identified in the control group compared to pharmacist-reviewed patients. More robust studies including a pharmacist dedicated to discharge medication reconciliation should be conducted to identify the potential benefit. ","66":"Several hospitals have embraced customer orientation as a strategy to better meet patients' needs, desires, and wishes. This study therefore investigates how hospitals can boost the extent to which patients feel treated in a customer-oriented way by staff (hereafter, \"perceived customer orientation\") and its implications for their satisfaction with the hospital. A cross-sectional study of hospital staff's interpersonal skills (interpersonal quality) and the atmosphere and physical features of the hospital (environmental quality) as drivers of perceived customer orientation and its satisfaction implications. Two hundred eighty-nine patients in seven surgery wards and two day-surgery departments of a Belgian hospital. Perceived customer orientation and patient satisfaction. Our results show that interpersonal and environmental qualities have a positive impact on perceived customer orientation, with the interpersonal skills of nursing staff having a greater effect than those of physicians. Perceived customer orientation, however, matters most for patient satisfaction when the nature of the service involves high-contact frequency. Interpersonal and environmental qualities may help to ensure that patients feel treated in a customer-oriented way, which improves patient satisfaction with the hospital. ","67":"Emergency department (ED) wait time is an important health system quality indicator. Prolonged consult to decision time (CTDT), the time it takes to reach a disposition decision after receiving a specialty consultation request, can contribute to increased overall length of stay in the ED. To identify delays in the consultation process for general internal medicine (GIM) and trial interventions to reduce CTDT. The study was conducted at a large tertiary teaching hospital with GIM inpatient wards at two campuses. Four interventions were trialed over sequential Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles: (1) process mapping, (2) resident education sessions, (3) audit and feedback of CTDT, and (4) adding a swing shift during peak consult volume. The primary outcome measures were mean CTDT for patients admitted to GIM and the proportion of admitted patients with CTDT of less than 3 hours. Mean CTDT decreased from 4.61 hours before intervention to 4.18 hours after intervention (p &lt; .0001). The proportion of GIM patients with CTDT less than 3 hours increased from 25% to 33% (p &lt; .0001). The interventions trialed led to a sustained reduction in CTDT over a 12-month period and demonstrated the effectiveness of education in influencing physician performance. ","68":"Measuring adherence to the 2015 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) diabetes prevention guidelines can inform implementation efforts to prevent or delay Type 2 diabetes. A retrospective cohort was used to study patients without a diagnosis of diabetes attributed to primary care clinics within two large healthcare systems in our state to study adherence to the following: (1) screening at-risk patients and (2) referring individuals with confirmed prediabetes to participate in an intensive behavioral counseling intervention, defined as a Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recognized Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Among 461,866 adults attributed to 79 primary care clinics, 45.7% of patients were screened, yet variability at the level of the clinic ranged from 14.5% to 83.2%. Very few patients participated in a CDC-recognized DPP (0.52%; range 0%-3.53%). These findings support the importance of a systematic implementation strategy to specifically target barriers to diabetes prevention screening and referral to treatment.","69":"The LACE+ index has been shown to predict readmissions; however, LACE+ has not been validated for extended postoperative outcomes in an orthopedic surgery population. The purpose of this study is to examine whether LACE+ scores predict unplanned readmissions and adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery. Use of the LACE1 index to proactively identify at-risk patients may enable actions to reduce preventable readmissions. LACE+ scores were retrospectively calculated at the time of discharge for all consecutive orthopedic surgery patients (n = 18,893) at a multicenter health system over 3 years (2016-2018). Coarsened exact matching was used to match patients based on characteristics not assessed in the LACE+ index. Outcome differences between matched patients in different LACE quartiles (i.e. Q4 vs. Q3, Q2, and Q1) were analyzed. Higher LACE+ scores significantly predicted readmission and emergency department visits within 90 days of discharge and for 30-90 days after discharge for all studied quartiles. Higher LACE+ scores also significantly predicted reoperations, but only between Q4 and Q3 quartiles. The results suggest that the LACE+ risk-prediction tool may accurately predict patients with a high likelihood of adverse outcomes after a broad array of orthopedic procedures. ","70":"Persons living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWH) are living long enough to need age-related and HIV-related nursing home (NH) care. Nursing home quality of care has been associated with risk for hospitalization, but it is unknown if quality of HIV care in NHs affects hospitalization in this population. We assessed HIV care quality with four national measures adapted for the NH setting. We applied the measures to 2011-2013 Medicare claims linked to Minimum Data Set assessments of resident health, prescription dispensing data, and national reports of NH characteristics. Cox proportional hazards models calculated the risk of all-cause and HIV\/AIDS-related hospitalization by HIV care compliance. We identified 1,246 PLWH in 201 NHs with 382 all-cause and 63 HIV\/AIDS-related hospitalizations. Nursing home HIV care compliance varied from 24.9% to 64.7%. After regression adjustment, we could detect no difference in all-cause or HIV\/AIDS-related hospitalizations by NH HIV care compliance. We postulate that the lack of association may be due to inappropriate HIV care quality measures that do not accurately represent NHs ability to care for PLWH. There is urgent need to create valid NH HIV care quality measures.","71":"","72":"As healthcare organizations seek to improve patient experience, quality, and safety, employee engagement and perceptions of patient safety (POPS) have increasingly become foci of attention. Yet, the relationship between these constructs is poorly understood. We examined the correlation between provider and staff engagement (collectively, \"employee engagement\"), and between employee engagement and POPS in ambulatory and hospital environments. We found significant correlations between staff engagement and POPS, and between provider engagement and POPS in ambulatory and hospital environments. We also found significant correlation between provider and staff engagement. Although all correlations were weak (correlation coefficients of 0.17-0.47), there were significant increases in POPS with increases in employee engagement (in both ambulatory and hospital environments) and increases in provider engagement with increases in staff engagement. These increases range from 4% to 11% for every 17% increase in staff engagement. These findings suggest that healthcare systems seeking to improve provider engagement, staff engagement, and POPS may find synergistic effects between these efforts in ambulatory and hospital settings.","73":null,"74":null,"75":"National utilization of Medicare's Annual Wellness Visits (AWVs) benefit is low. Few studies have evaluated how beneficiaries perceive this service. This study aimed to characterize beneficiaries' opinion on the value of AWVs, preventive care services offered by Medicare, and barriers and facilitators to receiving those services. This qualitative study used semistructured focus group interviews of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older with a standardized facilitator guide. Four focus groups were conducted with 30 Medicare beneficiaries in an assisted-living facility, senior housing apartments, and a primary care office. Qualitative thematic analysis of focus group responses revealed that preventive healthcare was valued, but access to quality preventive care remains an issue for patients. Most participants did not know about AWVs and reported confusion over the terminology \"wellness visit\" compared with checkup or physical. Medicare beneficiaries are not commonly aware of AWVs. Increased promotion of AWV services by healthcare professionals may increase the number of beneficiaries participating in these preventive visits.","76":"Caesarean section surgical site infection (SSI) is a surgical wound site infection occurring within 30 days of surgery with a reported incidence of 3-15%. This quality improvement (QI) project aimed to reduce caesarean section SSI by 50% in a tertiary maternity center. Using multidisciplinary team approach, the project was designed with evidence-based interventions. The Royal College of Physicians of Ireland\/Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland \"Preventing Surgical Site Infections Key Recommendations for Practice\" guideline was used as standard perioperative care. A care bundle was designed targeting preoperative personal patient preparation, preoperative prophylactic antibiotics, and strict skin preparation technique, all measured using a patient survey. The rate of SSI was followed for 14 months. The Model for Improvement methodology was used to implement change. Surgical site infection rate decreased from 6.7% (n = 684 caesarean sections, n = 46 SSI) to 3.45% (n = 3,206 caesarean sections, n = 110 SSI), p = .0006. Reduction occurred in both elective (4.4%-2.7%) and emergency (9.1%-4.1%) caesarean section groups. There was excellent adherence to all three elements of the care bundle. The 50% reduction in caesarean section SSI was sustained over the 14-month period, significantly reducing maternal morbidity. The success of this QI project is attributable to frontline ownership and empowerment of patients and staff. ","77":"Recording vaccine data accurately can be problematic in medical documentation, including blank and inaccurate records. Vaccine two-dimensional (2D) barcode scanning has shown promise, yet scanner use to record vaccine data is limited. We sought to identify strategies to improve scanning rates and assess changes in accuracy. Between January and June 2017, 27 pilot sites within a large health system were assigned to one of four groups to test strategies to maximize scanner use: training only, commitment card, scanning report, or combination. Seventy-two thousand vaccine records were assessed for completeness, accuracy, and scanning. Significant increases in vaccinator scanning rates found with commitment card and scanning report inclusion (alone and paired) compared with the training-only group. Record completeness and accuracy significantly improved with use of scanning. When manually entered, about 1 in 9 records had a missing or inaccurate expiration date; when scanned, this dropped to 1 in 5,000. Pilot findings indicate 2D scanning has the potential to eliminate most omissions and inaccuracies in vaccine records. Such data are critical during a recall or need to trace specific vaccines or patients. Consistent use and expanded adoption of 2D scanning can meaningfully improve the quality of vaccine records and clinical practices. ","78":"Adapting Project Re-Engineered Discharge (Project RED), an intervention for reducing internal medicine hospital readmissions, is a promising option for reducing colorectal surgery readmissions. We conducted a pilot study for the adaptation and implementation of Project RED with patients admitted for colectomy at a regional VA tertiary care center between July 2014 and January 2015. Implementation was evaluated using adherence to intervention components and results from the Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients. The adapted Project RED for Surgery has five components: surgical wound\/ostomy-care education, scheduled follow-up appointments, medication reconciliation, an After Hospital Care Plan, and postdischarge phone calls. All (n = 21) participants received postoperative wound care education, and 77% of ostomy patients received education. Follow-up appointments were scheduled for 76% with surgery clinic and 67% with primary care. Half received pharmacist-led medication reconciliation. Seventy-five percent received a postdischarge phone call. Ninety five percent of participants reported positive or satisfactory care transitions versus less than 60% of a comparison group of surgery patients from the same institution. We summarized lessons learned from this intervention study to facilitate future dissemination efforts. The lessons learned from this pilot can guide quality improvement teams seeking to implement the Re-Engineered Discharge for Surgery intervention within their existing workflows. ","79":"Access to medical care seems to be impacted by race. However, the effect of race on outcomes, once care has been established, is poorly understood. This study seeks to assess the influence of race on patient outcomes in a brain tumor surgery population. This study offers insights to if or how quality is impacted based on patient race, after care has been established. Knowledge of disparities may serve as a valuable first step toward risk factor mitigation. Patients differing in race, but matched on other outcomes affecting characteristics, were assessed for differences in outcomes subsequent to brain tumor resection. Coarsened exact matching was used to match 1700 supratentorial brain tumor procedures performed over a 6-year period at a single, multihospital academic medical center. Patient outcomes assessed included unplanned readmission, mortality, emergency department (ED) visits, and unanticipated return to surgery. There was no significant difference in readmissions, mortality, ED visits, return to surgery after index admission, or return to surgery within 30 days between the two races. This study suggests that race does not independently influence postsurgical outcomes but may instead serve as a proxy for other closely related demographics. ","80":"Providing complete pending diagnostic test information and medication lists on inpatient discharge and ambulatory end-of-visit summaries decreases adverse events, reduces medical errors, and improves patient satisfaction. The purpose was to compare inpatient and ambulatory settings regarding percentages of records with documentation of pending diagnostic test result information and medication lists given at discharge\/end of visit. Using a cross-sectional, observational design, 2018 NDNQI discharge\/end-of-visit data from 133 inpatient and 90 ambulatory units in 20 hospitals were examined. Trained site coordinators reviewed records for documentation of discharge\/end-of-visit elements. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare inpatient and ambulatory percent of elements completed. Across all discharge\/end-of-visit elements, there were differences (all p &lt; .001) between inpatient and ambulatory settings. Ambulatory units had a lower percent completion for all medication list and pending diagnostic result elements. Depending on the element, the sample means for documentation in discharge\/end-of-visit summaries were 18.6-98.8% for inpatient and 4.5-61.8% for ambulatory settings. Discharge instructions and end-of-visit summaries are crucial forms of communication between clinicians and patients. However, many patients are not receiving complete information. In a large nationwide sample, we found substantial opportunities to improve completeness of summaries, particularly in ambulatory settings. ","81":"Thirty-day readmissions for heart failure (HF) patients are often considered avoidable and linked to inadequate treatment and poor coordination of services and discharge plans. Lack of coordinated transitional care services and high 30-day readmissions prompted the interdisciplinary team to develop an HF Transition Program (HFTP). This quality improvement initiative used monthly trend data before and after HFTP implementation. The American Heart Association Guidelines for HF Transitions served as a framework for developing the HFTP. Over an 11-month period, 466 patients were enrolled into the HFTP, resulting in 18.2% (n = 82\/450) 30-day cumulative readmission rate that is lower than the 21.9% national average. Sixteen patients did not code for HF after discharge. Heart Failure Transition Program calls to patients and families within the first week home were consistently high at 92.3% (430\/466). These data show that care coordination and transitional care are important strategies to decrease 30-day HF readmissions. ","82":"Communication and teamwork are essential during inpatient emergencies such as cardiac arrest and rapid response (RR) codes. We investigated whether wearing numbered jerseys affect directed commands, teamwork, and performance during simulated codes. Eight teams of 6 residents participated in 64 simulations. Four teams were randomized to the experimental group wearing numbered jerseys, and four to the control group wearing work attire. The experimental group used more directed commands (49% vs. 31%, p &lt; .001) and had higher teamwork score (25 vs. 18, p &lt; .001) compared with control group. There was no difference in time to initiation of chest compression, bag-valve-mask ventilation, and correct medications. Time to defibrillation was longer in the experimental group (190 vs. 140 seconds, p = .035). Using numbered jerseys during simulations was associated with increased use of directed commands and better teamwork. Time to performance of clinical actions was similar except for longer time to defibrillation in the jersey group.","83":"Infection prevention is a high priority for home healthcare (HHC), but tools are lacking to identify patients at highest risk of developing infections. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a predictive risk model to identify HHC patients at risk of an infection-related hospitalization or emergency department visit. A nonexperimental study using secondary data was conducted. The Outcome and Assessment Information Set linked with relevant clinical data from 112,788 HHC admissions in 2014 was used for model development (70% of data) and testing (30%). A total of 1,908 patients (1.69%) were hospitalized or received emergency care associated with infection. Stepwise logistic regression models discriminated between individuals with and without infections. Our final model, when classified by highest risk of infection, identified a high portion of those who were hospitalized or received emergent care for an infection while also correctly categorizing 90.5% of patients without infection. The risk model can be used by clinicians to inform care planning. This is the first study to develop a tool for predicting infection risk that can be used to inform how to direct additional infection control intervention resources on high-risk patients, potentially reducing infection-related hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and costs.","84":"The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) has become a prevalent tool for quality improvement. At our tertiary military hospital, NSQIP collects 20% of eligible cases. We implemented an emergency general surgery (EGS) registry to prospectively review all EGS cases. We compared our EGS registry with NSQIP, hypothesizing that NSQIP sampling under-represents EGS outcomes. A formal EGS Process Improvement Program was implemented in 2016. From 2016 to 2018, the four most common operations were laparoscopic appendectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, surgery for small bowel obstruction, and nonelective hernia repair. Outcomes were compared between the EGS registry and NSQIP abstracted cases. In 2016, the EGS registry identified 11\/112 (9.8%) patients with a complication. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program abstracted 16% of EGS cases with 16.7% (3\/18) of patients having a complication. In 2017, the EGS registry identified 10\/87 (11.5%) cases with complications. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program abstracted 23% of EGS with zero complications. In 2018, the EGS registry identified 9.5% of 74 cases with complications. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program abstracted 15% of EGS cases with zero complications. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program did not capture many important EGS outcomes. In 2 of 3 years, NSQIP did not identify a single complication for EGS. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program alone may be insufficient to target EGS improvements. ","85":"Readmission is an increasingly important focus for improvement regarding quality, value, and patient burden in our surgical patient population. We hypothesized that inpatient harm events increase the likelihood of readmission in surgical patients. We created a system-wide inpatient registry with 30-day readmission. A surgical subset was created, and harm events were tracked through the electronic health record system. Between 2015 and 2017, 37,048 surgical patient encounters met inclusion criterion. A total of 2,887 patients (7.69%) were readmitted. After multiple logistic regression of the highly significant harm measures, seven harm measures remained statistically significant (p &lt; .05). Those with the three highest odds ratios were mucosal pressure ulcer, Clostridium difficile, and glucose &lt;40. Incorporating harm measures to the traditional risk, predictive model for 30-day readmission improved our model performance (area under the ROC curve from 0.68 to 0.71). This study demonstrated that inpatient hospital-based harm events can be electronically monitored and used to predict 30-day readmission.","86":"Patients evaluated after sexual assault may benefit from nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis (nPEP) to prevent infection with HIV, yet multiple barriers may prohibit nPEP delivery. The IN-STEP (Integrating nPEP after Sexual Trauma in Emergency Practice) project was designed to improve access to HIV screening and prevention for patients evaluated in the emergency department (ED) of our academic hospital after a sexual assault. The IN-STEP team identified and addressed four key areas for improvement: (1) training of ED providers to perform nPEP assessments; (2) access to HIV testing in the ED; (3) provision of nPEP medications, using a patient-centered approach; and (4) continuity of care between the ED and follow-up sites in the community. Improvements were implemented using parallel plan-do-study-act cycles corresponding to these four key areas. IN-STEP resulted in significant systems improvements in HIV screening, prevention, and continuity of care. This program not only improved the care of patients affected by sexual assault but also those evaluated for HIV due to other indications. Involvement of a multidisciplinary leadership team, clear delineation of a patient-centered project focus, and coordination across four parallel areas for improvement were useful for completing this complex effort. ","87":"Unnecessary hospitalizations may pose the risk of iatrogenic complications, suboptimal patient experience, and increased cost. Administrative data lack granularity to understand the proportion and causes of hospitalizations preventable through optimizing care continuum (HPOCC). We aim to identify the incidence and causes of HPOCC through clinician-adjudicated chart review. A retrospective review was performed for inpatient admissions from the emergency department (ED) over 1 week. Each admission was reviewed by a clinician to determine whether it is an HPOCC defined as not requiring inpatient care with the assumption of idealized outpatient care and social support. Of the 515 patients admitted from the ED, 31 (6.0%) patients were judged to have had an HPOCC. Causes of HPOCC include urgent diagnostics (9, 29.0%), unnecessary transfer from a long-term facility (7, 23.0%), needing IV therapy (5, 16.0%), benign incidental finding (5, 16.0%), diagnostic uncertainty in complex chronic illness (3, 10.0%), and lack of access to care for disposition (2, 6.0%). Hospitalizations preventable through optimizing care continuum account for about 1 in every 15 hospitalizations in an urban academic medical center. The need for urgent diagnostics accounts for a plurality of HPOCC and could be an important target for quality improvement. ","88":"Communication failures in healthcare constitute a major root cause of adverse events and medical errors. Considerable evidence links failures to raise concerns about patient harm in a timely manner with errors in medication administration, hygiene and isolation, treatment decisions, or invasive procedures. Expressing one's concern while navigating the power hierarchy requires formal training that targets both the speaker's emotional and verbal skills and the receiver's listening skills. We conducted a scoping review to examine the scope and components of training programs that targeted healthcare professionals' speaking-up skills. Out of 9,627 screened studies, 14 studies published between 2005 and 2018 met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the existing training exclusively relied on one-time training, mostly in simulation settings, involving subjects from the same profession. In addition, most studies implicitly referred to positional power as defined by titles; few addressed other forms of power such as personal resources (e.g., expertise, information). Almost none addressed the emotional and psychological dimensions of speaking up. The existing literature provides limited evidence identifying effective training components that positively affect speaking-up behaviors and attitudes. Future opportunities include examining the role of healthcare professionals' conflict engagement style or leaders' behaviors as factors that promote speaking-up behaviors.","89":"The decision to discharge versus admit a patient from the emergency department (ED) carries significant consequences to the patient and healthcare system. We evaluated all ED visits at a single facility from January 1-December 31, 2015, where the ED provider initially requested admission to medicine; however, following medicine evaluation, the patient was discharged from the ED. 8.1% of medicine referrals resulted in discharge from the ED after referral for admission. 62.6% lacked documentation by medicine or another consulting service. Patients completed clinic follow-up within 7 or 30 days, 52.8% and 76.0% respectively. Emergency department revisit rates were similar for patients not referred versus referred for admission (8.0% vs. 8.1%, 13.3% vs. 14.6%, and 29.9% vs. 28.9% at 3, 7, and 30 days, respectively p-value &gt; .05). Hospital admission during the follow-up period was also similar for these two groups (1.8% vs. 2.8%, 3.9% vs. 5.7%, and 11.3% vs. 15.0% at 3, 7, and 30 days, respectively p-value &gt; .05). Patients discharged from the ED after referral for medicine admission were not at significantly increased risk of subsequent ED revisit or hospital admission compared with nonreferred patients. This study illustrates the opportunity for collaboration between ED and medicine providers to refine disposition plans for patients who may fall into the \"gray zone.\" ","90":"This quality improvement initiative was aimed at reducing low-value Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) studies performed on hospital inpatients. Requests for PET-CT with a predetermined low-value indication triggered a requirement for the ordering provider to call the Nuclear Medicine radiologist to discuss the case for approval of the testing. A retrospective review of inpatient PET-CT approximately 2 years immediately before and after the implementation revealed a 20.6% decrease in scans for low-value indications after the intervention, from 0.397 to 0.315 studies per day (p &lt; .05; CI -0.158 to -0.005). The overall daily rate of PET-CT was reduced by 23%. Of the 12 low-value indications, 7 had reduced volumes (aggregate 43 fewer scans), 1 was unchanged, and 4 showed an increase in volumes (aggregate of 10 additional scans). Several common indications for inpatient PET-CT that were not targeted for reduction by this intervention also demonstrated large decreases in volumes during the intervention.","91":"There is increasing evidence of the role of non-patient-level factors on discharge against medical advice (DAMA), but limited quantitative information regarding the extent of their impact. This study quantifies the contribution of discharge-level and hospital-level factors to the variation in DAMA. We grouped variables from the 2014 National Inpatient Sample data and ran incremental mixed-effects logit models with grouping at the level of the discharge, the hospital, and the census region. We obtained the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and evaluated the incremental change in ICC. The final sample included 2,687,430 discharges. 12.8% of the identified variation in the probability of DAMA was associated with the hospital, and 1.2% of the variation was associated with the census division in which the hospital was located. The final, fully-adjusted model had 7.3% of variation in DAMA associated with the hospital-level, with the greatest percentage reductions because of the addition of patient demographics. Even after adjusting for measured patient-level characteristics, there was a contribution of non-patient-level factors to DAMA outcomes. The findings identify a role for a multi-level approach to addressing DAMA.","92":"Nationally, there is an expectation that residents and fellows participate in quality improvement (QI), preferably interprofessionally. Hospitals and educators invest time and resources in projects, but little is known about success rates or what fosters success. To understand what proportion of trainee QI projects were successful and whether there were predictors of success. We examined resident and fellow QI projects in an integrated healthcare system that supports diverse training programs in multiple hospitals over 2 years. All projects were reviewed to determine whether they represented actual QI. Projects determined as QI were considered completed or successful based on QI project sponsor self-report. Multiple characteristics were compared between successful and unsuccessful projects. Trainees submitted 258 proposals, of which 106 (41.1%) represented actual QI. Non-QI projects predominantly represented needs assessments or retrospective data analyses. Seventy-six percent (81\/106) of study sponsors completed surveys about their projects. Less than 25% of projects (59\/258) represented actual QI and were successful. Project category was predictive of success, specifically those aimed at preventive care or education. Less than a quarter of trainee QI projects represent successful QI. Hospitals and training programs should identify interventions to improve trainee QI experience. ","93":"Lean has gained recognition in healthcare as a quality improvement tool. The purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which quality improvement projects in healthcare adhered to Lean's eight-step process. We analyzed 605 publications identified through a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines. Each publication was coded using a structured coding sheet. The most frequent type of publication reported empirical research (48.6%) and most of these (80.3%) shared the results of the Lean projects. Of the 237 publications reporting Lean projects, more than half (71.3%) used an experimental, one-site, pre\/postdesign. The impact of the project was most often measured using a single metric (59.1%) that was operational (e.g., waiting time). Although most Lean project publications reported the use of tools to \"break down the problem\" (84.4%, Step 2) and \"see countermeasures through\" (70.0%, Step 6), fewer than half described using tools associated with each of the other steps. Projects completed an average of 2.77 steps and none of the projects completed all steps. Although some may perceive low adherence to the tenets of Lean as a deficiency, it may be that Lean approaches are evolving to better meet the needs of healthcare.","94":"The LACE+ index is a well-studied metric that compacts patient data in an effort to assess readmission risk. Assess the capacity of LACE+ scores for predicting short-term undesirable outcomes in an entire single-center population of patients undergoing gynecologic surgery. Proactive identification of high-risk patients, with tools such as the LACE+ index, may serve as the first step toward appropriately engaging resources for reducing readmissions. This study was a retrospective analysis that used coarsened exact matching. All gynecologic surgery cases over 2 years within a single health system (n = 12,225) were included for analysis. Outcomes of interest were unplanned readmission, emergency room (ER) evaluation, and return to surgery. Composite LACE+ scores were separated into quartiles and matched. For outcome comparison, matched patients were assessed by LACE+ quartile, using Q4 as the reference group. Increasing LACE+ score reflected a higher rate of readmission (p = .003, p = .001) and visits to the ER at 30 postoperative days (p &lt; .001). The data presented here suggest that LACE+ index is a viable metric for patient outcome prediction following gynecologic surgery. ","95":"Health care costs in the United States are considerable, and total national cost of preventable adverse events in the United States ranges from billions to trillions of dollars annually. Achieving the highest quality of health services requires delivering care that mitigates the risk of patient adverse events. Pressure injuries are a significant and costly adverse event. Mitigating or eliminating harm from pressure injuries not only improves quality and increases patient safety but also decreases costs of care. The purpose of this article is to pilot a systematic methodology for examining the differences in the cost of care for a subset of patients with and without hospital-acquired pressure injuries in an acute care setting.","96":"","97":"","98":"With the transition toward value-based care, health care organizations have a business imperative to simultaneously focus on improved health outcomes, improved patient and staff experience, and reduced costs (the Quadruple Aim). For federally qualified health centers-which provide care to some of nation's most vulnerable populations-balancing the complex task of systems change in the face of overwhelming volumes of information and best practices is challenging and can be supported through a guiding framework. This need for synthesis and translation of evidence in an actionable and practical way led to the design of a model for health center systems change. This article describes the development process and defines the resulting conceptual framework. Deployed a four-step process between 2016 and 2018 to develop and test a framework for value transformation in health centers. NACHC's Quality Center developed the Value Transformation Framework to guide health center systems change toward high value care. The framework identifies 15 change areas across three Domains: infrastructure, care delivery, and people and summarizes evidence-based action steps within the change areas. The framework shows promise in supporting health center efforts to adapt, transform, and balance competing demands as they advance value-based models of care. ","99":null,"100":"The effectiveness of neurosurgical operating room (OR) checklists to improve communication, safety attitudes, and clinical outcomes is uncertain. To develop, implement, and evaluate a post-operative neurosurgery operating room checklist. Four large academic medical centers participated in this study. We developed an evidence-based checklist to be performed at the end of every adult-planned or emergent surgery in which all team members pause to discuss key elements of the case. We used a prospective interrupted time series study design to assess trends in clinical and cost outcomes. Safety attitudes and communication among OR providers were also assessed. There were 11,447 neurosurgical patients in the preintervention and 10,973 in the postintervention periods. After implementation, survey respondents perceived that postoperative checklists were regularly performed, important issues were communicated at the end of each case, and patient safety was consistently reinforced. Observed to expected (O\/E) overall mortality rates remained less than one, and 30-day readmission rate, length of stay index, direct cost index, and perioperative venous thromboembolism and hematoma rates remained unchanged as a result of checklist implementation. A neurosurgical checklist can improve OR team communication; however, improvements in safety attitudes, clinical outcomes, and health system costs were not observed. ","101":"Reducing unnecessary tests reduces costs without compromising quality. We report here the effectiveness of a clinical decision support system (CDSS) on reducing unnecessary type and screen tests and describe, estimated costs, and unnecessary provider ordering. We used a pretest posttest design to examine unnecessary type and screen tests 3 months before and after CDSS implementation in a large academic medical center. The clinical decision support system appears when the test order is initiated and indicates when the last test was ordered and expires. Cost savings was estimated using time-driven activity-based costing. Provider ordering before and after the CDSS was described. There were 26,206 preintervention and 25,053 postintervention specimens. Significantly fewer unnecessary type and screen tests were ordered after the intervention (12.3%, n = 3,073) than before (14.1%, n = 3,691; p &lt; .001) representing a 12.8% overall reduction and producing an estimated yearly savings of $142,612. Physicians had the largest weighted percentage of unnecessary orders (31.5%) followed by physician assistants (28.5%) and advanced practice nurses (11.9%). The CDSS reduced unnecessary type and screen tests and annual costs. Additional interventions directed at providers are recommended. The clinical decision support system can be used to guide all providers to make judicious decisions at the time of care. ","102":"Delivering high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) requires teams to administer highly choreographed care. The American Heart Association recommends audiovisual feedback for real-time optimization of CPR performance. In our Emergency Department (ED) resuscitation bays, ZOLL cardiac resuscitation device visibility was limited. To optimize the physical layout of our resuscitation rooms to improve cardiac resuscitation device visibility for real-time CPR feedback. A simulated case of cardiac arrest with iterative ergonomic modifications was performed four times. Variables included the locations of the cardiac resuscitation device and of team members. Participants completed individual surveys and provided qualitative comments in a group debriefing. The primary outcome of interest was participants' perception of cardiac resuscitation device visibility. The highest scoring layout placed the cardiac resuscitation device directly across from the compressor and mirrored the device screen to a television mounted at the head of the bed. Comparing this configuration to our standard configuration on a five-point Likert scale, cardiac resuscitation device visibility increased 46.7% for all team members, 150% for the team leader, and 179% for team members performing chest compressions. An iterative, multidisciplinary, simulation-based approach can improve team satisfaction with important clinical care factors when caring for patients suffering cardiac arrest in the ED.

We examined changes in vaccination following decision support and workflow changes in a cross-sectional analysis of three vaccination seasons among adult primary care patients from 21 practices. Interventions included clinical decision support changes to facilitate documentation; changes to rooming workflow for medical assistants and licensed practical nurses to promote vaccination, prepare orders, document care done elsewhere; and record patient refusals. We measured rates for a national vaccination performance measure and receipt of onsite vaccination. Approximately 120,000 patients were eligible each season. Performance on the quality measure increased each year (40.6% to 62.5% to 76.4%). Corresponding rates of onsite vaccination were 27.7%, 28.8%, and 31.5%. The adjusted odds ratio for onsite vaccination in the second season compared with the first was 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92, 0.96). Onsite vaccination was more likely in the third season compared with either previous season-adjusted odds ratio for third versus second 1.14 (95% CI, 1.12, 1.16) or adjusted odds ratio for third versus first 1.07 (95% CI 1.05-1.09). Sequential changes in decision support and patient rooming process workflows were associated with large improvements in measured performance and with a significant increase in clinic-administered influenza vaccination by the third season.","105":null,"106":"Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is often used for displaced femoral neck fracture. In this study, institutional hip arthroplasty data were compared with the National American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data for any differences in outcomes between our hospital, with an integrated hip fracture care pathway, and those of the country as a whole. Elective THA was compared with arthroplasty performed for acute fracture. Outcomes for both groups included thromboembolic event (VTE), death, and deep prosthetic infection. Institutional data revealed no increased rate of infection after THA for fracture compared with elective. National Surgical Quality Improvement Program analysis revealed higher infection rates in fracture arthroplasty. There was an increased VTE rate in fracture performed for arthroplasty compared with elective in both institutional and NSQIP data. When performed at an academic medical center with an integrated care program, THA for fracture can have similar infection rates to elective THA. By contrast, national data showed significantly higher rates of infection and VTE for arthroplasty for fracture compared with elective. The contrast in complication rates may be related to well-functioning comprehensive interdisciplinary pathways. Patient-centered care pathways may be optimal for hip fracture patients. ","107":"Effective medical record documentation is required to support accurate capture of diagnoses, patient acuity (case mix index [CMI]), and justify resource utilization for reimbursement. Billing code complexity and a lack of formal documentation education in training programs have created a need for academic medical centers to incorporate training for trainees (residents, fellows, and new nurse practitioners). We hypothesized that standardized stroke note templates, trainee education, and feedback from chart audits would improve documentation accuracy. To improve the accurate\/complete capture of expected (E) length of stay (LOS) and CMI by designing\/implementing ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke templates containing high-frequency complication and comorbidity diagnoses with the greatest impact on stroke populations, combined with trainee education and chart audits. Descriptive statistics were used for outcomes before\/after implementation of the templates. Primary outcomes include ELOS and CMI. Wilcoxon rank-sum test or chi-square test was used for group comparison. The post-template group demonstrated a significant improvement in ELOS from 5.84 to 8.27 days (p &lt; .0001). Case mix index increased (1.73-1.75; p &lt; .0001) in the post-template group. Stroke-specific templates, trainee education, and chart audits were associated with significant improvement in documentation accuracy and an improved business model of stroke care in our hospital. ","108":"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Center offers two alternative payment models for joint replacement: the voluntary Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) model and the mandatory Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model. As CMS considers methods for cost reduction, research is needed to understand patient-level outcomes and organizational-level success factors. A retrospective cross-sectional study of hospitals was performed, using regression models to evaluate an aggregate patient satisfaction score, complication rates, and operational differences among BPCI, CJR, and nonparticipating hospitals. Results show that BPCI hospitals received significantly better patient satisfaction scores (88.6) than CJR hospitals (86.0), but complication rates were not significantly different between CJR and BPCI hospitals (2.83 and 2.77, respectively). Factors associated with BPCI participation include academic affiliation, a Northeast region locale, and having a higher CMS efficiency score. Thus, requiring more hospitals to participate in CMS-bundled payment programs as a federal policy may not be the optimal way to improve patient satisfaction and outcomes. Rather, the CJR and BPCI programs should be further studied, and the results generalized for use by nonparticipating hospitals to encourage preparation and participation in CMS value-based initiatives.","109":"Clostridioides difficile infections (CDIs) have been identified as a major health concern due to the high morbidity, mortality, and cost of treatment. The aim of this study was to review the extant literature and identify the various patient-related, medication-related, and organizational risk factors associated with developing hospital-acquired CDIs in adult patients in the United States. A systematic review of four (4) online databases, including Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library, was conducted to identify empirical studies published from 2007 to 2017 pertaining to risk factors of developing hospital-acquired CDIs. Thirty-eight studies (38) were included in the review. Various patient-level and medication-related risk factors were identified including advanced patient age, comorbidities, length of hospital stay, previous hospitalizations, use of probiotic medications and proton pump inhibitors. The review also identified organizational factors such as room size, academic affiliation, and geographic location to be significantly associated with hospital-acquired CDIs. Validation of the factors associated with high risk of developing hospital-acquired CDIs identified in this review can aid in the development of risk prediction models to identify patients who are at a higher risk of developing CDIs and developing quality improvement interventions that might improve patient outcomes by minimizing risk of infection. ","110":"A hospital's emergency department (ED) used the Johns Hopkins fall risk assessment tool (JHFRAT), which was not developed to assess the ED patients. The ED committee recommended the memorial ED fall risk assessment tool (MEDFRAT) plus a \"nursing judgment\" category. However, the modified MEDFRAT needed to be evaluated before implementation. This research evaluated the modified MEDFRAT in ED patients and nurses' perception of the tool. A two-stage quantitative design was used. Stage 1 was a chart review using both tools for patients who fell (n = 57) in the past 4 years and the control patients (n = 57). Two tools were compared using t-tests, Bland-Altman, predictive abilities, and mismatch rates. Stage 2 was the assessment of all ED patients (n = 435) seen by the ED triage nurses for 1 week using both tools. The chi-squared test and mismatch rates were used to compare the tools. Time to complete both tools and nurses' perceptions to the modified MEDFRAT were analyzed. Two tools were significantly different. The modified MEDFRAT had higher predictive ability and lower mismatch rates than the JHFRAT. It needed shorter time to complete and was preferred by most nurses. The modified MEDFRAT is adequate to use in the ED. ","111":"Quality improvement (QI) models and evidence-based self-management guidelines for reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk require patients to access community resources. The purpose of this study is to describe outcomes from implementation of a community resource referral system into small clinical practices to reduce CVD risk. Practices were given the opportunity to complete an inventory of local CVD-related resources; these data were used to create a printed list of resources for patients (\"HealtheRx-H3\"). Practices could request updates to HealtheRx-H3s. We assessed implementation outcomes, including appropriateness, feasibility, and adoption. Practice populations were at high risk for CVD. It was feasible to create practice-specific HealtheRx-H3s. Systematic distribution of HealtheRx-H3s using digital electronic health record (EHR) integration was infeasible due to inconsistent use of EHR systems, workflow variation, and lacking data-sharing infrastructure. Of 76 practices, 38 completed the inventory; completion was similar by patient and practice characteristics. HealtheRx-H3 updates were requested by 39% of practices; practices that completed the inventory were significantly more likely to request an update compared with those that did not (61% vs. 18%, p-value &lt;.01). Successful implementation of QI strategies to systematize community resource referral solutions is feasible at small practices, but more research is needed to understand what motivates small practices to participate in implementation of these solutions.","112":"Timely emergency department (ED) recognition of acute strokes reduces morbidity and mortality and improves outcomes. Prehospital telehealth evaluation rapidly assesses patients with stroke symptoms and mobilizes resources before ED arrival, decreasing ED arrival to computed tomography (CT) result times. Expediting CT results reduces the decision time to determining thrombolytic therapy eligibility. Seventeen ambulances in our region were supplied with equipment to perform a nonrecordable video examination with an ED physician. Emergency Medical Service requested a physician video examination on patients with a positive prehospital Cincinnati Stroke Scale. The physician and paramedic conducted an NIH-8 scale, and, based on the assessment, the patients were placed directly on the CT scanner table. Four time intervals that impact CT acquisition and thrombolytic decision-making were measured. There was improvement in all time intervals. Time from ED arrival to CT order decreased 1.7 minutes. Time from arrival to study start decreased 5.7 minutes. Time from CT order to result decreased 3.89 minutes and time from ED arrival to CT result decreased 5.6 minutes. Prehospital telehealth consults with paramedics, and the receiving hospital for acute strokes significantly decreased times for all metrics studied including the time from ED arrival to CT result. ","113":"Although Lean performance improvement (PI) has been used in health care for more than 15 years, little is known about how Lean has been used in Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) transformation. We describe our experience implementing Lean in our safety-net, primary care teaching clinic. To advance high value care, a culture of systematic, sustainable PI methods needed to be integrated into primary care and taught to resident physicians. Clinic leadership were trained in Lean methods, protected time was dedicated to PI for a stable, interdisciplinary team, then visual management was introduced, and resident physicians were integrated into the clinic's PI initiatives. Self-assessment using the PCMH Assessment tool demonstrated improvement in core features of the PCMH model. Process outcomes also revealed successful, sustainable integration of Lean into our primary care clinic and resident training, and early findings show improvements in clinical quality outcomes. Patient survey outcomes demonstrate improvement in patient experience. Lean can be used successfully to promote PCMH transformation and create a culture of continuous PI in an academic, safety-net primary care setting.","114":"A national sample (N = 982) of federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) for the period 2011-2016 was examined regarding the relationship between the age and extent of health information technology (HIT) use and clinical performance. We found that each additional year of HIT use was associated with an approximate 4 percent increase in both process and outcome measures of clinical performance. Furthermore, FQHCs that fully adopted HIT had 7 percent higher clinical performance on hypertension control than those that did not adopt HIT. This study's findings can assist stakeholders to make informed decisions for improving care and sustaining a competitive advantage.","115":"It is generally believed that pharmacologic prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is underused. However, previous studies have not shown associations between increased prophylaxis administration and reductions in VTE. We here investigated prophylaxis administration and VTE incidence among trauma patients at our facility to determine whether to further increase prophylaxis administration after implementation of a standardized monitoring protocol. Univariate analyses and regression models were used to evaluate the protocol's effect on VTE, identify clinical factors associated with VTE and with receiving prophylaxis, and identify over- or under-prophylaxed patients. A final prophylaxis rate of 71.2% was achieved, an increase from the 40.8% reported by the Trauma Quality Improvement Program in 2015, with no accompanying reduction in VTE (1.5% pre and postintervention). Factors that identified patients at lower probability of receiving prophylaxis were those that increased bleeding risk: severe head injuries (odds ratio [OR] = 0.13) and preexisting bleeding (OR = 0.69) and renal\/kidney (OR = 0.46) disorders. A large group of patients was both at increased odds of receiving prophylaxis and at low risk of VTE, representing a group that may be considered for nonpharmacologic options. Examination of current prophylaxis practices and identification of underuse or overuse is beneficial before expending effort to increase prophylaxis administration to reduce VTE.","116":"Previous transitional care research has focused on transitions occurring between community and hospital settings. Little is known regarding intrahospital transitions and how they affect care quality. A systematic review was therefore conducted to synthesize the literature regarding clinical outcomes associated with intrahospital transitions. Literature published between January 2003 and December 2018 and indexed in Medline\/PubMed, CINAHL, and PsychINFO were reviewed using PRISMA guidelines. Articles were limited to English language and peer-reviewed. Articles were excluded if they focused on transitions occurring from or to the hospital, discharge\/discharge planning, or postdischarge follow-up. Data abstraction included study characteristics, sample characteristics, and reported clinical outcomes. Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria, primarily using cross-sectional, cohort, or retrospective chart review quantitative designs. Data were analyzed and synthesized based on outcomes reported. Major outcomes emerging from the articles included delirium, hospital length of stay, mortality, and adverse events. Delirium, hospital length of stay, and morbidity and mortality rates were associated with delayed transfers and transfers to inappropriate units. In addition, increased fall risk and infection rates were associated with higher rates of transfer. Intrahospital transitions represent critical periods of time where the quality of care being provided may be diminished, negatively affecting patient safety and outcomes.","117":"Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) is effective in promoting pharmaceutical products to consumers and may pose a challenge to providers in the delivery of care. This study examined advanced practice nurse prescriber (APNP) general views of DTCA and tested the effects of DTCA discussion between the patient and APNP in an office visit on efficiency of care, quality of care, and health outcomes. A cross-sectional design was used to survey 1,163 APNPs in a single US Midwestern state. The final sample consisted of 316 participants (27.17%). Pearson's chi-squared and multinomial logistic regression analyses tested DTCA effects. Direct-to-consumer advertising disadvantages were increased costs of drugs (80%) and misled patients (75%). Direct-to-consumer advertising benefits included a balanced presentation of risks and benefits (60%) and patients getting treatments (51%). Direct-to-consumer advertising discussion was viewed as worsening time efficiency of visit (53%). Worsened efficiency was associated with worsened nurse-patient relationship. Direct-to-consumer advertising discussion had no effect on quality of care (86%) and health outcomes (89%). Worsened quality was related to inappropriate clinical requests and challenged prescriptive authority among other factors. The nurse doing what the patient wanted was related to worsened health outcomes. The findings suggest training initiatives to maximize DTCA benefits in health care delivery. ","118":"This department column highlights translation of research into health care quality practice. Achieving the highest quality of health care requires attention to creating and sustaining process efficiencies through the development of bedside provider competencies that result in workflow improvements and positive patient outcomes. An improvement intervention aimed at decreasing unnecessary referrals to a comprehensive vascular access team (CVAT) resulted in a 21% reduction in inappropriate consults to the team in approximately 6 weeks. The purpose of this article is to describe a simulation and competency assessment intervention aimed at increasing staff nurse proficiency in the emergency department for placing ultrasound-guided intravascular catheters, thereby reducing the number of inappropriate referrals to a CVAT team.","119":"Patients discharged against medical advice (AMA) have disproportionately high health care costs and increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital readmissions. Although patient risk factors for discharge AMA are known, there are little data regarding physician discharge practices surrounding AMA discharges. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients discharged AMA from a large, urban, academic medical center. Our study predictors included patient demographics and admission characteristics: primary service team, time of discharge, documentation of anticipated AMA discharge, and length of stay. The primary outcomes were physician discharge practices including a scheduled follow-up appointment, documentation of informed consent, documentation of a risk\/benefit discussion, and notification of the attending physician. Our coprimary outcome was the incidence of 30-day hospital readmission. Among AMA discharges, 33% had follow-up appointments scheduled upon discharge. There was documentation of a risk\/benefit discussion (69%), informed consent (63%), and notification of the attending physician (72%) in most discharges. Physician discharge practices were not associated with 30-day hospital readmission. Adherence to discharge best practices in AMA discharges was inconsistent and suboptimal, particularly for scheduling follow-up appointments, but was not associated with hospital readmission. Our results highlight the difficulty in facilitating safe transitions of care for patients discharged AMA. ","120":"Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed surgeries in women. Surgical-site infections (SSI) after hysterectomy can lead to increased morbidity and mortality as well as readmission, which is associated with increased costs for health systems. The aim of the project was to improve standardization of preoperative education on infection prevention and incorporate the use of preoperative chlorhexidine (CHG) bathing for patients undergoing hysterectomy to decrease rates of SSI. Data on SSI after hysterectomy were reviewed. Tracer methodology was used to identify gaps in the preoperative process by comparing the current process to the Council on Patient Safety in Women's Health Care Patient Safety Bundle \"Prevention of Surgical Site Infection after Gynecologic Surgery.\" After implementation, survey data were collected on adherence to the washing protocol, and SSI data were monitored. Survey results reflected high compliance with the CHG washing protocol, provision of patient education, and overall patient satisfaction with the process. Before implementation in 2016, we reported 8 deep or organ\/space SSI to the National Healthcare Safety Network. After implementation in 2018, we reported 3 deep or organ\/space SSI. Standardizing infection prevention processes to align with safety bundles improves the quality of care provided to patients.","121":"Practice facilitation is an approach for advancing quality improvement (QI), but its success depends on effective relationships and communication among participants. Our goal was to identify patterns of contrasting perspectives on implementation issues between practice leaders and their practice facilitators, and factors that may contribute to them. We conducted individual interviews with practice leaders and the practice facilitators assigned to them as part of a program focused on preventive cardiology within primary care practices. We used summative content analysis to quantify the incidence of contrasting perspectives, and bivariate and qualitative analyses to explore relationships between contrasting perspectives and contextual factors. Among the 16 dyads, contrasting perspectives commonly related to the easiest or hardest QI interventions to implement (8 of 16 dyads) and the practice's success implementing interventions (5 of 16 dyads). There was a nonsignificant, inverse correlation (r = -0.19, p = .47) between the number of in-person QI visits from the facilitator and the total number of contrasting perspectives. Turnover of staff was frequently reported in dyads with contrasting perspectives. Although the impact of contrasting perspectives warrants additional study, planners of QI initiatives using practice facilitation should consider taking steps to minimize contrasting perspectives, or the potential adverse consequences of them, by addressing turnover challenges and encouraging opportunities to share perspectives.","122":"Little is known about which hospitals participate in voluntary public reporting of quality processes and what influences their performance, particularly in cancer care. We hypothesize that patient volume is positively associated with both reporting and performance. In 2014, when Pennsylvania became the first and only state to have public reporting for cancer care, it became possible to test these hypotheses, which we did in cross-sectional study of the 72 Pennsylvania hospitals accredited by the Commission on Cancer. Hospitals that publicly reported their performance (57 of 72) had higher patient volumes than hospitals that did not release performance. Among reporting hospitals, no association was found between patient volume and performance on process of care metrics. These findings suggest the importance of attending to volume effects in public reporting of cancer care and recognizing that volume is not a predictor of performance for reporting hospitals, which indicates the need for research to identify other factors that differentiate performance within and across reporting and nonreporting hospitals.","123":"Heart failure-related recurrent hospitalizations are widely recognized as a source of burden to both patients and the health system. Hospital discharges represent a transition of care and can often become a catalyst for readmission. One strategy in reducing this burden is the implementation of dedicated heart failure clinics. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients discharged from an inner city safety-net public hospital with a discharge diagnosis of heart failure. Patients followed in the Heart Clinic (HC) were compared to those with standard follow-up. All included cases were followed for 30 days after discharge to determine whether an all-cause readmission occurred. There were 258 patient discharges with an overall sicker population in the HC cohort. The HC group had a better event-free survival with a 67.1% reduction in readmission (log rank *p &lt; .05). In concluding, a dedicated heart failure clinic reduced 30-day readmissions for patients who were discharged after having an acute exacerbation of heart failure.","124":"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) is the largest integrated health care system in the United States. To date, there has been scant research on how VHA adopts clinical preventive services guidelines and how U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations factor into the process. Researchers conducted semistructured interviews with eight VHA leaders to examine how they adopt, disseminate, and measure adherence to recommendations. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and aggregated into a database to enable sorting and synthesis. Themes were identified across the key informant interviews. The development of VHA clinical prevention guidelines is coordinated by the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. A VHA Advisory Committee discusses and votes to approve or disapprove each guideline. Several factors can impact the ability of a veterans affairs medical center to implement a guideline, such as local system capacity and priorities for quality improvement. Methods to promote implementation include electronic reminders, educational events, and a robust performance measurement system. Provision of evidence-based clinical preventive services is an important part of VHA's effort to provide high-quality care for Veterans. Recent achievements in lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and Hepatitis C screening highlight VHA's successful approach to implementation of preventive services guidance. ","125":"Errors in communication during handoffs are a significant source of medical error and put patients at risk. The I-PASS system was designed to systematically communicate information to the oncoming healthcare provider and has been shown to decrease the risk of communication errors. The objective of this observational quality improvement study was to determine whether the addition of a partially automated, electronic handoff tool would further decrease errors in communication during transitions of care for inpatient medical teams. We created an electronic tool to incorporate user-generated patient information in the I-PASS format with automatically compiled data derived from the electronic medical record. Numbers of errors in the printed handoff document were recorded before and after intervention. The first implementation cycle demonstrated an absolute risk reduction for written errors of 45.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39.2-51.2%) and a number needed to treat (NNT) of three patients. The second cycle showed an absolute risk reduction of 53.3% (95% CI 39.8-63.9%; NNT 2). Aggregate data showed an absolute risk reduction of 46.6% (95% CI 41.0-51.7%, NNT 3). Improving the routine task of patient handoff through the thoughtful application of technology can yield benefits in terms of decreasing documentation errors and streamlining workflow before patient handoff. ","126":null,"127":"Because more older adults undergo surgical procedures, it is incumbent on us to learn how to provide them with the safest possible perioperative care. We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a large tertiary care center to determine whether outcomes after anesthesia-related adverse events differed between patients aged 65 years and older versus patients under age 65. One thousand four hundred twenty-four cases were referred to the Performance Improvement committee of the Department of Anesthesiology from the years 2007-2015. After exclusions of cases that were not anesthesia-related, could not be identified, or were duplicates, 747 cases with anesthesia-related adverse events were included in the study. Two hundred eighty-six were aged 65 years and older and 461 were under age 65. Anesthesia-related adverse events occurred more commonly in the postoperative period in older patients relative to younger patients (37.7% vs. 21.9%, p = .001), and older patients had a greater incidence of mortality compared with a propensity-matched group of younger patients (adjusted odds ratio 1.87 [1.14-3.12], p &lt; .05). We concluded that older patients have a greater likelihood of mortality as a result of suffering an anesthesia-related adverse event and may benefit from increased vigilance in the postoperative period.","128":"Pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Therefore, prevention of pneumococcal pneumonia by administering effective and well-tolerated vaccines is an important goal, especially in the immunocompromised patients who are at an increased risk of infections. At a large Midwestern Veterans Affairs Rheumatology Clinic, an internal audit revealed a baseline immunization rate of 3%. Through the Lean Six Sigma approach, the investigators sought to increase the rate to 70%. An interprofessional approach incorporating provider education, reinforcement at the point of care, and workflow simplification was sequentially implemented. Lean Six Sigma tools, including process mapping, voice of the customer, and statistical process control charts were utilized. These interventions increased the percentage of eligible patients receiving vaccinations from 3% (n = 19\/687) to 23% (n = 11\/48) and decreased the vaccine administration time from 15 to 7 minutes. No adverse reactions were reported. This was balanced by an increase in appointment time by 4 minutes in those who received vaccines. The Lean Six Sigma approach was critical to reducing waste and improving value for patients and providers by increasing pneumococcal vaccination rates among the immunocompromised veteran population in a Midwestern Veterans Affairs Rheumatology Clinic.","129":"To provide up-to-date data on fall prevalence and trends in Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. Data were collected by the VHA Inpatient Evaluation Center (IPEC) between 2011 and 2017, to establish prevalence and trends of falls and major injuries occurring in acute care\/intensive care units (AC\/ICU), behavior health (BH), and community living center (CLC)\/long-term care, using bed days of care (BDOC) as denominators. A total of 204,681 falls were reported (rate = 4.8 falls\/1,000 BDOC) during the study period, of which 2,549 (1.2%) resulted in a major injury (rate = 6.0\/100,000 BDOC). Fall rates decreased over the 6-year study period for all unit types: 10% decrease for BH (p &lt; .0001), 9% decrease for AC\/ICU (p &lt; .0001), and 3% decrease for CLC (p = .0043). Major injury rates remained consistent. In this large descriptive study, fall and major injury rates varied by nursing unit type in VHA hospitals. Over the 6-year study period, a clinically and statistically significant decrease in fall rates for BH and AC\/ICU units was observed as well as a small but statistically significant decrease in fall rates for CLC units. No trend was observed for major injury rates. ","130":"As healthcare delivery systems increasingly adopt models designed to reward cost-efficient and high-quality care, the demand for expertise in healthcare quality continues to grow. There has been wide variation and limited conformity in the definition of the quality competencies that are essential for healthcare professionals. To address the need for a standard, widely accepted, comprehensive definition of the competencies required for healthcare quality, the National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ) made a strategic commitment to develop a comprehensive healthcare quality competency framework applicable to all practice settings across the care continuum. In this article, the authors describe the development of NAHQ's Healthcare Quality Competency Framework depicting eight competency dimensions required for success in current and future healthcare quality positions. In addition, they discuss a self-assessment survey tool to identify individual and organizational gaps in the workforce competencies of Healthcare Quality Professionals.","131":"Chronic pain (CP) is a common driver of emergency department (ED) visits despite the ED not being the ideal setting for CP because of increased risk of adverse events and high costs. The purpose of this study is to understand factors contributing to CP-related ED visits, patients' care experiences, and patients' perspectives on alternatives to the ED. We used a mixed-methods design combining semi-structured interviews and questionnaires with 12 patients with CP who had 12 or more ED visits over 1 year. We analyzed test scores using descriptive statistics and interviews using applied thematic analysis. Four themes emerged. Factors contributing to ED visits included the following: fear (e.g., pain and its impact); inability to cope with pain; family suggestions to go to the ED; and access to other services and resources. Patients had validating and invalidating experiences in the ED: needs were met or not met; and feeling acknowledged or unacknowledged. Patients' experiences with their family physician included feeling supported or unsupported. Alternatives to the ED included working with an interdisciplinary team, developing personalized care plans, and increased community-based resources. Patients with CP and frequent ED use present with complex pain and care experiences, requiring careful attention to management strategies and the patient-provider relationship. ","132":"Magnet Recognition is the highest distinction a healthcare organization can receive for excellence in nursing. Although Magnet status is generally associated with superior clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction, its association with performance on nationwide quality metrics is currently unknown. Within a propensity score-matched cohort, we compared performance on the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HACRP), Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP), and Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (RRP) initiatives. The mean HACRP total performance score was inferior at Magnet versus non-Magnet hospitals (p &lt; .001), and HACRP penalties were more likely to be levied against Magnet hospitals (p = .003). There was no significant difference according to Magnet status for VBP penalties after correcting for multiple comparisons (p = .049). There were no significant difference in RRP penalties according to Magnet status (p = .999). Magnet hospitals performed worse on a number of hospitalwide quality metrics tied to reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service. Although Magnet hospitals are known for superior nursing care and organizational support for safety and quality improvement, this is not captured within these composite measures of quality, which can be influenced at many levels of care. These data underscore the need for comprehensive quality improvement across multiple domains of care outside of nursing. Level III, retrospective study. ","133":"The health care sector has one of the highest rates of workplace violence, putting staff at risk and impeding care. To deliver quality health care, staff need targeted resources. This article describes a program to improve staff safety and reduce barriers to care for patients with behavioral disturbances. A nurse-led behavioral response team was created to identify high-risk patients and offer prompt targeted interventions. The Behavioral Optimization and Outcomes Support Team (BOOST) was implemented in November 2012, in conjunction with a proactive model of care, enabling psychiatric intervention. Advanced practice nurses in psychiatry respond to requests from staff on medical\/surgical units to assist with management of behavioral disturbances. Consultation and intervention data were reviewed, and staff satisfaction surveys were completed to evaluate the program. The program has contributed to staff feeling more supported and safer at work. There has also been a reduction in staff's experience of perceived burden in the care of patients with behavioral disturbances although they are caring for more of these patients. Although violence risk in health care continues to be a significant issue, programs to intervene early can be effective in supporting staff to minimize these risks. ","134":"Emergency departments (EDs) are the primary venue for diagnosis and initiation of treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Typically managed in an intensive care unit (ICU), in many medical centers, limited ICU bed availability necessitates DKA-extended ED management until sufficient improvement for admission to a non-ICU bed. Although DKA treatment is well established, coordinating safe and effective extended care in a busy ED is complex. Recurrent problems in this high-risk transition of care led us to improvement efforts. We studied the impact of a standardizing ED DKA management in two phases: rollout of a DKA pathway in our computerized order entry system followed by audit and feedback. We evaluated adherence, clinical process, operational, and safety measures following these interventions. Adherence to the pathway was initially slow, improving significantly after audit and feedback. We observed mixed improvements in clinical processes, no changes in operational metrics (as expected), and reductions in variability for several measures. There were no deteriorations and improvements in measures of safety, and a reduction in the number of adverse event reports in the postimplementation periods.","135":"To improve quality and outcomes, a preoperative anemia clinic (PAC) was established to screen, evaluate, and manage preoperative anemia. A retrospective review of primary and revision hip and knee arthroplasty patients from August 2013 to September 2017 was conducted. Patients at \"high risk\" for transfusion were referred to PAC for treatment with iron, erythropoietin, or both based on anemia type. Preoperative anemia clinic referred patients were compared with a 1:3 historic propensity-matched control set of patients to help determine impact of PAC. Forty PAC patients were compared with 120 control patients. Among PAC patients, 26 (63.41%) received iron only, 3 (7.32%) received erythropoietin (EPO) only, and 12 (29.27%) received both. Preoperative hemoglobin significantly increased in the treatment group (median [interquartile range] 10.9 g\/dl [10.3-11.2] vs. 12.0 g\/dl [11.2-12.7]; p &lt; .001). Four PAC patients (10.00%) received red blood cell transfusions compared with 29 (24.17%) from matched controls (p = .055). In addition, the PAC cohort had higher postoperative nadir hemoglobin levels (mean [SD] 9.7 g\/dl [1.31] vs. 8.7 g\/dl [1.25]; p &lt; .001). High-risk patients appropriately treated with iron and\/or EPO before surgery demonstrate a significant increase in preoperative hemoglobin, trend toward decrease perioperative transfusion, and increased hemoglobin levels postoperatively compared with matched controls.","136":"Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a risk factor for hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Much PPI use is inappropriate, and interventions to reduce PPI use, such as for stress ulcer prophylaxis in all critically ill patients, are essential to reduce CDI rates. This mixed-methods study in a combined medical-surgical intensive care unit at a tertiary academic medical center used a human factors engineering approach to understand barriers and facilitators to optimizing PPI prescribing in these patients. We performed chart review of patients for whom PPIs were prescribed to evaluate prescribing practices. Semistructured provider interviews were conducted to determine barriers and facilitators to reducing unnecessary PPI use. Emergent themes from provider interviews were classified according to the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model. In our intensive care unit, 25% of PPI days were not clinically indicated. Barriers to optimizing PPI prescribing included inadequate provider education, lack of institutional guidelines for stress ulcer prophylaxis, and strong institutional culture favoring PPI use. Potential facilitators included increased pharmacy oversight, provider education, and embedded decision support in the electronic medical record. Interventions addressing barriers noted by front line providers are needed to reduce unnecessary PPI use, and future studies should assess the impact of such interventions on CDI rates.","137":"To determine the association between pattern of participation in the Meaningful Use (MU) initiative and self-reported clinical quality metrics. We used state-level Medicaid electronic health record (EHR) incentive program data to categorize physicians based on receipt of MU payments (single year vs. multiple years) and self-reported quality metrics from 2011 to 2016. Among 4,198 participating physicians, only 36% received more than one EHR incentive payment. Physicians participating for a single year had better cancer-screening metrics. By comparison, physicians who participated for multiple years reported better medication-related metrics and chronic disease management metrics. Nature of participation may have varying degrees of influence on types of clinical quality metrics. Sustained participation may support management of chronic conditions. Administrative claims data will help to elucidate our findings. ","138":"The care of patients with multiple chronic conditions and those near the end-of-life is often compromised by miscommunications among the healthcare teams. These might be improved by using common risk strata for both hospital and ambulatory settings. We developed, validated, and implemented an all-payer ambulatory risk stratification based on the patients' predicted probability of dying within 30 days, for a large multispecialty practice. Strata had comparable 30-day mortality rates to hospital strata already in use. The high-risk ambulatory strata contained less than 20% of the ambulatory population yet captured 85% of those with 3 or more comorbidities, more than 80% of those who would die 30 or 180 days from the date of scoring, and two-thirds of those with a nonsurgical hospitalization within the next 30 days. We provide examples how the practice and partner hospital have begun to use this common framework for their clinical care model.","139":"To examine patterns and determinants of nonindex readmissions for Medicare as well as non-Medicare patients both before and immediately after the adoption of Medicare's Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012. Nonindex readmissions are readmissions to hospitals that are different from the one from which the patient was discharged. Observational analysis of statewide database from California comprising patient-level discharge reports. Mixed-effects logistic regression models examined the association between nonindex readmissions and both hospital- and patient-level characteristics. Nonindex readmissions for the population studied were approximately 25%, but the percentage of such readmissions was significantly higher for non-Medicare patients than those enrolled in Medicare. Nonindex readmissions were associated with several patient- and hospital-level characteristics from which patients were discharged. The adoption of the HRRP did not have any appreciable impact on the general pattern of nonindex readmissions. A substantial percentage of hospital readmissions are to nonindex hospitals, but the general pattern and determinants of these events have not changed following the adoption of the HRRP. As preventable readmissions continue to gain attention as a key quality indicator for hospital care, further investigations are needed to understand the potential value of nonindex readmissions as a quality indicator for hospital care. ","140":null,"141":"Telemedicine intensivist-led intensive care (electronic intensive care unit [eICU]) is recommended when on-site intensivist-led intensive care is not available. Although the effects of eICU on patient outcomes are comparable with bedside intensivist-led care, not all implementations of eICU are successful in improving patient outcomes. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (1) examine the associations of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, nurses' attitudes toward eICU, and intention to use and (2) determine which participant characteristics were associated with these four dependent variables. This cross-sectional, correlational study asked bedside registered nurses to complete an anonymous online survey to explore their acceptance of eICU. Nurses' attitude toward eICU and intention-to-use eICU demonstrated the strongest association, r(120) = 0.83, p &lt; .001. The most significant variable associated with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, nurses' attitudes toward eICU, and intention to use was support from nurses. In addition, support from physicians was significantly associated with perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and nurses' attitudes toward eICU. Support from both bedside physicians and registered nurses in the intensive care unit had the most association with acceptance of the eICU service. Gaining their support to use an eICU service is essential. ","142":"The growing number of elderly people with functional limitations, cognitive impairment, and disability is an organizational challenge for the health care sector. This study investigated the factors associated with hospitalization in the period between evaluation and the start of a long-term care (LTC) program for patients on the waiting list. A population-based historical cohort study was performed using data extracted from different administrative databases. The cohort included disabled individuals 65 years and older who were evaluated for entrance into an LTC program between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, in Tuscany, Italy. The sample consisted of 11,429 subjects. The characteristics positively associated with hospital admission were residence zone {urban incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.94)}, number of prescribed drugs IRR = 1.01 (95% CI 1.00-1.02), a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 2 IRR = 1.44 (95% CI 1.26-1.64), and lower social conditions IRR = 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00). The rate of hospitalization for patients with heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dementia was higher than for patients without these diseases. Our results indicate that it may be possible to predict factors that can lead to hospitalization before the start of an LTC program.","143":"Behavioral health integration is important, yet difficult to implement, in patient-centered medical homes. The Veterans Health Administration (VA) mandated evidence-based collaborative care models through Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) in large PC clinics. This study characterized PC-MHI programs among all PC clinics, including small sites exempt from program implementation, in one VA region. Researchers administered a cross-sectional key informant organizational survey on PC-MHI among VA PC clinics in Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico (n = 69 distinct sites) from February to May 2018. Researchers analyzed PC clinic leaders' responses to five items about organizational structure and practice management. Researchers received surveys from 65 clinics (94% response rate). Although only 38% were required to implement on-site PC-MHI programs, 95% of participating clinics reported providing access to such services. The majority reported having integrated, colocated, or tele-MH providers (94%) and care management (77%). Most stated same-day services (59%) and \"warm\" handoffs (56%) were always available, the former varying significantly based on clinic size and distance from affiliated VA hospitals. Regional adoption of PC-MHI was high, including telemedicine, among VA patient-centered medical homes, regardless of whether implementation was required. Small, remote PC clinics that voluntarily provide PC-MHI services may need more support. ","144":"Inadequate electronic medical record (EMR) documentation remains a significant source of revenue loss. The Department of Surgery in a trauma and tertiary care teaching hospital developed a revenue optimization initiative for inpatients on general, vascular, and trauma surgery and surgical intensive care unit services to enhance clinical documentation and increase revenue capture. Clinical documentation management program included six trained clinical documentation specialists (CDSs), five physician assistants (PAs), directors of health information management (HIM), and two surgical champions. Lean methodology was applied to develop a coding and documentation program wherein trained CDS polled ICD-10 codes in the surgical EMR for accuracy in diagnoses documentation. An opportunity for improved documentation prompted query generation for a specially trained PA review. Physician assistant adjusted EMR documentation according to query to more accurately describe high impact diagnoses. Outcomes included PA query response rate, potential revenue opportunities, validated revenue gains, and missed revenue opportunity. Twelve thousand EMRs were queried in the study interval. $2,206,620.16 in validated revenues were realized. Interestingly, we identified $1,792,591.91 in potential opportunities and $65,097.30 in lost opportunities. Query response rate increased from 17% to 94.7%. The authors demonstrate a concentrated Coding and Documentation Program involving CDS, and Surgical PAs results in significant revenue gains for an inpatient surgery service in a public hospital. ","145":"Antibiotic overuse for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in primary care (PC) is a known important contributor to the serious health threat of antibiotic resistance, yet remains a difficult problem to improve. The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of a combination patient and provider education program on antibiotic prescribing in RTIs in a rural primary care clinic. Utilizing a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, a retrospective electronic medical record review was conducted to determine if a patient and provider education program changed the rates of antibiotics being prescribed (immediate or delayed) during a visit for RTI for 207 randomly selected patients during the established evaluation time periods. The antibiotic prescription rate for the preintervention group was 56.3% compared to 28.8% for the postintervention group (p &lt; .01). Immediate antibiotics were ordered in the preintervention group 31.1% of the time compared to 13.5% for the postintervention group (p &lt; .05). The results of this study demonstrate that educational interventions can be effective in rural settings and that changes in antibiotic prescribing are possible.","146":"This department column highlights translation of research into health care quality practice. Achieving the highest quality of health care requires attention to developing and sustaining process efficiencies, and a thorough understanding of data and reporting. Mitigating or eliminating harm from pressure injuries may be more quickly achieved when accurate and consistent data are available for creating actionable interventions. The three aims of this project were to (1) confirm internally reported hospital acquired pressure injury data, (2) identify opportunities for improving the accuracy of internal reports, and (3) design and implement innovative quality informatics solutions for pressure injury reporting.","147":"Hypertension is a common problem and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether efforts to control blood pressure (BP) known to be effective in integrated healthcare systems can be successfully implemented in an academic setting. We describe our experience implementing a multistep quality improvement program within an academic general medicine practice aimed at improving BP among patients with uncontrolled hypertension. Ensuring medical assistants were correctly measuring BP provided the basis for accurate data entry into the electronic medical record (EMR); our EMR-based registry data allowed us to feedback primary care provider (PCP) level data on BP control for panel management, which resulted in improvements in BP for a substantial proportion of patients, particularly for those with more practice visits. However, due to PCP, patient, and system barriers, our initial attempt to integrate a pharmacist into our team for hypertension management was only successful for a small number of patients who engaged in pharmacist in-person visits. Future improvement efforts will focus on addressing the barriers to more intensive BP management, integrating lessons from this experience. As chronic disease management shifts to a population-based model, team change will be a necessary component for achieving clinical improvement.","148":"Inappropriate daily lab testing can have adverse effects on patients, including anemia, pain, and interruption of sleep. We implemented a student-led, multifaceted intervention featuring clinician education, publicity campaign, gamification, and system changes, including a novel nurse-driven protocol to reduce unnecessary daily lab testing in a teaching hospital. We applied a quasi-experimental interrupted time series design with a segmented regression analysis to estimate changes before and after our 14-month intervention with a comparison to a control surgical unit. There was an increasing trend in the baseline period, which was mitigated by the intervention (postintervention effect estimate -0.04 labs per patient day\/month, p &lt; .05), which was not seen in the control unit. Estimated cost savings was $94,269 ($6,734\/month). A student-led, multidisciplinary campaign involving nurse-driven pathway, education, publicity, gamification, and system changes was effective in reducing daily lab testing.","149":"Readmissions are an important quality measure for public reporting, payment, and collaborative research. Lack of measure standardization may lead to inconsistent reporting of outcomes across study sites. In this study, we examined the impact of measurement variability on reporting of a single readmission metric, 30-day all-condition readmission rates (ARRs). We conducted a secondary database analysis of 2006-2008 Medicaid Analytic eXtract data merged from four states of children younger than 21 years. We calculated 30-day ARRs for this cohort using three previously described models varying in their inclusions and exclusions of index hospitalizations and readmissions. The 30-day ARR was highest for the model allowing each readmission to serve as an index admission for subsequent readmissions (ARR: 7%); intermediate for the model allowing one index admission and more than one readmissions in each 30-day period (ARR: 6.2%); and lowest for the model allowing only one readmission in each 30-day period (ARR: 5.6%). Similar variation was seen when stratifying patients by individual diagnostic groups. In conclusion, measurement variability impacts reported outcomes of a single readmission metric. To improve the value of readmission as a quality metric, stakeholders engaged in multisite quality improvement or research should ensure that definitions are standardized across sites.","150":"Daily phlebotomy is often a standard procedure in hospitalized patients. Recently, this practice has begun receiving attention as a potential target for efforts focused on eliminating overuse. Several organizations have published their efforts in this arena. Interventions have included education, feedback, and changes to computerized provider order entry (CPOE) but have yielded mixed results. A quality improvement initiative to reduce the utilization of daily phlebotomy was conducted at a 505-bed Academic Medical Center. This project involved a combination of educational interventions and changes to CPOE. The primary end point evaluated was the daily performance of complete blood counts (CBCs) and basic metabolic profiles (BMPs) on medical and surgery units relative to the corresponding hospital census. Over the course of this project from August 1, 2013, to September 23, 2016, there was a 15.2% reduction in CBCs (p &lt; .001 for linear trend) and 13.1% reduction in BMPs. Our results suggest that layering multimodal interventions that involve both \"hard-wired\" changes to CPOE and education and performance feedback can result in decreased utilization of phlebotomy.

Local health department involvement in SUD-related policy during the past 2 years and provision of preventive care for behavioral health in the past year significantly reduced the probability of having a SUD-related ED visit by 11% and 6%, respectively, after controlling for individual characteristics (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89, p &lt; .001; OR = 0.93, p &lt; .001). After adjusting for the individual and contextual factors, LHD involvement in policy was still associated with 14% reduction in SUD-related ED visits (OR = 0.86, p &lt; .001). Results offer insights on the extent to which the LHD activities can possibly affect SUD-related ED visits and provide a foundation for future work to identify effective LHD interventions.","153":null,"154":null,"155":"Shared medical appointments (SMAs) have proven to be effective in improving patient access and education while augmenting productivity. In shifting from a traditional visit model, patient and interdisciplinary healthcare team (IHCT) member satisfaction is imperative. Predominantly seen in primary care, SMA use in orthopedics is limited. After identification of access and productivity concerns, the SMA was implemented as a quality improvement project in a rural clinic. The lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) population was chosen because of multiple preoperative appointments and costs on the healthcare system. To assess patients' and IHCT members' satisfaction levels in using an SMA for the preparation of LEJR. The SMA is an effective model offering an efficient, cost-effective methodology aligning with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Triple Aim. Twenty SMAs were conducted. Sixty-three patients and 14 ICHT members participated. Mean (M) satisfaction rating for SMA patients (M = 4.90, SD 0.26) was significantly higher than mean for traditional patients (M = 4.03, SD 0.39). Interdisciplinary healthcare team members' attitudes toward SMAs revealed a mean score of 4.58. Incidentally, cycle times improved as did lengths of stay. Lower extremity joint replacement patients and IHCT members reported high satisfaction with SMAs. ","156":"Communication failures between providers threaten patient safety. We developed, implemented, and formatively evaluated the ED-PACT Tool, which uses the Veterans Health Administration's (VA) electronic health record to send messages from emergency department (ED) providers to primary care patient-aligned care team (PACT) registered nurses (RNs) for Veterans discharged home from the ED with urgent or specific follow-up needs. We used Plan-Do-Study-Act quality improvement methodology. Between November 1, 2015, and November 30, 2017, the tool was used to send 4,899 messages in one local VA healthcare system (ED and associated primary care clinics). Formative evaluation revealed that providers and RNs perceive the tool as providing substantial benefit for coordinating post-ED care. Patient-aligned care team leaders reported that RN training and \"buy-in\" facilitated tool implementation, while insufficient staffing posed a barrier. Emergency department providers noted the advantage of having a standardized and reliable system for communicating with PACTs. The ED-PACT Tool encapsulates several best practices (standardized processes, \"closed-loop\" communication, embedding into workflow) to facilitate communication between VA ED and follow-up care providers. Our development process illustrates key lessons in quality improvement and innovation implementation including the value of using rapid-cycle improvement methodology, with interprofessional collaboration and representatives from intended spread sites. ","157":"Even though rapid response teams (RRTs) have been widely adopted, reports about their efficacy in reducing mortality have been conflicting, both in terms of outcomes, and standardization of measures. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to detect significant changes within the patient population while overall mortality rates appear not to change. Our focus will be on three indicators: unplanned transfers to the ICU as an RRT outcomes measure, changes in ICU patient utilization, and mortality. Between 2005 and 2008, RRT intervention had an impact on patient outcomes by reducing the rate of unplanned transfers to our ICU following an RRT event by 35.9%. With less severe patients able to remain on the medical wards, 12.5% of ICU beds were able to be utilized by more severe patients, and the Hospital-Standardized Mortality Ratio decreased 31.2%. The All Patient Refined Diagnostic-Related Groups (APR DRGs) risk of mortality (ROM) was used to stratify and group patients by severity, and revealed reductions in mortality among specific risk groups as well as shifts in the proportion of patient risk groups within the ICU population which were not readily apparent.","158":"Hospitals are encouraged to take steps to improve outcomes for patients with sepsis, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. A retrospective analysis examined data (n = 4,475) from three health systems to better determine the impact of a 10-month sepsis quality improvement program that consisted of clinical alerts, audit and feedback, and staff education. Compared with the control group, the intervention group significantly decreased length of stay and costs per stay. The intervention group increased sepsis bundle compliance by more than 40%. A sepsis quality improvement program may improve sepsis health outcomes and decrease costs.","159":"Barriers to early discharges include poor communication among the healthcare team and families, pending laboratory test results, delays in discharge orders, medical reconciliation list, and patient transport. The baseline data at our hospital in October 2017 (N = 1,021) showed that 5% of patients were discharged before 11 a.m., with the mean discharge processing time being 145 minutes. The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness of using an electronic predischarge order to discharge more than 40% of patients before 11 a.m. A predischarge order set was created in the electronic record, which notified the nurses, pharmacists, and case and social workers to complete all tasks related to discharge (medication reconciliation, complete laboratory test results and imaging, and arrange transport with family and nursing homes). The resident teaching service group (N = 381) from November 2017 to September 2018 discharged 22% of their patients before 11 a.m. (baseline: 5%, p value = 3.38638E-22), and the mean total discharge time was 77 minutes (baseline: 145 minutes; p value = 1.12013E-19). Our inability to discharge more than 40% of patients from the resident teaching service group before 11 a.m. was attributed to 3 limitations. We propose three viable recommendations to meet our goal in a future intervention.","160":null,"161":"Preventable causes of ophthalmology surgical case cancellations were identified, and interventions were implemented to improve operating room utilization at our Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center. A retrospective review of 269 patients with cancellations from 2013 to 2015 was performed. Interventions implemented from September 2014 to March 2015 were evaluated followed by in-depth chart reviews to identify demographics and wait-time intervals. Interventions included scheduling surgeries electronically, by specialty, and with predetermined attending coverage. In addition, the preoperative templates and technology to obtain preoperative measurements were updated. Cancellation rates dropped significantly from 35% to 7% (p = .014). Preventable causes of cancellations decreased from 28% to 5% (p = .005). Operating room utilization increased significantly with 264 more scheduled cases in 2015 than in 2013 (485 vs. 749, p &lt; .001), and surgery wait time trended downward. These findings may support the use of similar interventions at other VA medical centers or similar hospitals with the goal of improving quality of care through decreased cancellations and cost.","162":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening decreases CRC incidence; however, many patients are not successfully screened. To improve screening rates at our institution by decreasing the rate of rejected fecal immunochemical tests (FITs), a means of CRC screening, from 28.6% to &lt;10% by December 2017. Specimens were rejected for the following reasons: expired specimen, lack of recorded collection date\/time, lack of physician orders, incomplete patient information, and illegible handwriting. Multidisciplinary teams devised the following interventions: FIT envelope reminder stickers, automated FIT patient reminder phone calls, a laboratory standard operating procedure, an accessioning process at satellite laboratories, revisions to a clinical reminder when offering FIT, and provision of FIT-compatible printers to clinics. Total specimens received each month ranged from 647 to 970. Fecal immunochemical test rejection rates fell from 28.6% in June 2017 to 6.9% in December 2017 with a statistically significant decrease (p-value = .015) between the intervention period (May 2017-October 2017) and the postintervention period (November 2017-May 2018). Targeted interventions with stakeholder involvement are essential in reducing the rejection rate. The decreased rejection rate saves resources by decreasing the need to rescreen patients whose specimens were rejected, and may improve CRC screening rates.

We used text messaging to encourage caregivers to vaccinate. Participants were children (aged &gt;6 months), predominantly low income and Latino, with an asthma diagnosis attending a pediatric clinic. Interactive text messages that described the vaccine and how to make an appointment were sent to parents in English or Spanish, January 2016 to April 2017. Year 1 messages were evaluated by the investigators considering vaccination results and evidence in the literature. Improvements for Year 2 included timing of message, clarity of message, and using the family language of preference. Messages went to 398 (Year 1) and 485 (Year 2) families. Sixty-four percent of families preferred English; 35% preferred Spanish. Children in Spanish-speaking families were significantly more likely than children in English-speaking families to be vaccinated, 66% versus 46%. Text messaging is a straightforward, low-cost health promotion strategy with potential to improve child health. Quality improvement efforts in outpatient settings with low-income and limited English proficiency families are needed. mHealth strategies may help address the needs of vulnerable populations. SQUIRE V.2.0 guidelines were used for manuscript writing and reporting.","166":"There is growing evidence that shared care, where the oncologist, primary care physician, and\/or other specialty physicians jointly participate in care, can improve the quality of patients' cancer care. This cross-sectional study of breast and colorectal cancer patients (N = 534) recruited from the New Jersey State Cancer Registry examined patient and health system factors associated with receipt of shared care during cancer treatment into the early survivorship phase. We also assessed whether shared care was associated with quality indicators of cancer care: receipt of comprehensive care, follow-up care instructions, and written treatment summaries. Less than two-thirds of participants reported shared care during their cancer treatment. The odds of reporting shared care were 2.5 (95% CI: 1.46-4.17) times higher for colorectal than breast cancer patients and 52% (95% CI: 0.24-0.95) lower for uninsured compared with privately insured, after adjusting for other sociodemographic, clinical\/tumor, and health system factors. No significant relationships were observed between shared care and quality indicators of cancer care. Given a substantial proportion of patients did not receive shared care, there may be missed opportunities for integrating primary care and nononcology specialists in cancer care, who can play critical roles in care coordination and managing comorbidities during cancer treatment.","167":"Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (SABSI) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, and proper management is important to effect cure and prevent metastatic foci of infection. We aimed to utilize our antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) to improve practices at a large academic hospital system. Our ASP implemented a SABSI educational campaign directed at the hospital medicine, cardiology, and infectious diseases divisions. A stewardship intervention was then begun for all patients with SABSI recommending infectious diseases consultation, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), source control, and preliminary antibiotic changes. A retrospective review was performed for all SABSI cases 2 years before and after implementation of the SABSI intervention. Two hundred forty-three cases before intervention and 259 after intervention were included. An increase in obtaining follow-up negative blood cultures (79.8% vs. 89.6%), infectious diseases consultation (52.7% vs. 86.5%), TEE (25.5% vs. 54.8%), beta-lactam switch for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (55.2% vs. 74.4%), and source control (41.2% vs. 57.9%) was demonstrated. We demonstrated similar durations of bacteremia, length of stay, relapse, mortality, and rates of infective endocarditis. Adherence to standard of care for patients with SABSI can be dramatically improved through provider education, leveraging antimicrobial stewardship resources, and infectious diseases consultation. ","168":"The Model for Understanding Success in Quality (MUSIQ) is a framework of contextual factors for quality improvement (QI) projects. We sought to determine which MUSIQ contextual factors were associated with successful QI initiatives. In a cross-sectional survey study, at a 21-site, ambulatory, urban primary care network, a modified MUSIQ survey tool questionnaire was administered to QI team members. The primary analysis associated objective measures of QI success with MUSIQ contextual factors. Objective QI success was defined as reaching goal percentages of adult patients with diabetes achieving glycated hemoglobin less than 8% and\/or pediatric patients who had received combination toddler vaccines. Objective outcomes were compared with a subjective, self-reported outcome measure of QI success because previous literature found subjective outcomes were associated with specific MUSIQ factors. In the 143 survey responses collected, across 21 sites, no contextual factors from the MUSIQ survey were associated with either the adult or pediatric objective measure of QI project success. In a post hoc analysis, objective and subjective measures of success were often not associated and\/or negatively correlated. In conclusion, contextual factors were not associated with objective measures of QI outcomes, in contrast to previous studies finding associations with subjective QI outcome measures.","169":"Measurement-based care (MBC) is commonly used to manage medical illness, whereas only about 20% of psychiatric care providers use MBC. One aim of the partnership between the Birmingham Veterans Affairs Medical Center (BVAMC) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing (UAB SON) is to provide MBC to Veterans. The goal is to describe the efficacy of MBC in the treatment of Veterans by psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) residents. By teaching PMHNP residents evidence-based assessment, they gain tools to shorten time to remission of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Residents administered the Patient Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), an MBC tool that assesses depression, anxiety, trauma-related symptoms, and alcohol use, to patients of the Residency Continuity Clinic (RCC). Patient Stress Questionnaire scores from March 2016 to May 2018 were analyzed using paired t tests. Analysis revealed a downward trend in PSQ scores over time, suggesting improvement in psychiatric symptoms. Depressive and anxiety symptoms decreased significantly. This quality project highlights the utility of MBC by PMHNP residents in an RCC. Measurement-based care tools can be quickly and easily administered with little impact on workflow. Use of validated screening tools can enhance care, engage patients, and improve patient outcomes.

Oregon's Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) are the first statewide effort to use accountable care principles to pay for Medicaid benefits. We surveyed 8,864 Medicaid-eligible participants approximately 1 year before and 12 months after CCO implementation to assess the impact of CCOs on member-reported outcomes. We compared changes in outcomes over time between Medicaid CCO members, Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) members, and those who were uninsured. After 1 year, Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in CCOs reported better access to care, better quality care, and better connections to primary care than Medicaid FFS or uninsured persons. We did not find early evidence of improvements in preventive care and screenings or in ED utilization. Although these are early indicators, results suggest that Oregon's delivery system transformation is having a positive impact on patient experience outcomes.","172":"Although most suicides occur outside of medical settings, a critical and often overlooked subgroup of patients attempt and complete suicide within general medical and inpatient units. The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to perform a baseline assessment of the current practices for suicide prevention within medical inpatient units across eight Veterans Affairs medical centers throughout the nation, as part of the VA Quality Scholars (VAQS) fellowship training program. In conjunction with the VAQS national curriculum, the authors and their colleagues used multisite process mapping and developed a heuristic process to identify best practices and improvement recommendations with the hopes of advancing knowledge related to a key organizational priority-suicide prevention. Findings demonstrate a multitude of benefits arising from this process, both in relation to system-level policy change as well as site-based clinical care. This interprofessional and multisite approach provided an avenue for process literacy and consensus building, resulting in the identification of strengths including the improvement of prevention efforts and accessibility of supportive resources, the discovery of opportunities for improvement related to risk detection and response and the patient centeredness of current prevention efforts, and the provision of solutions that aim to achieve sustained change across a complex health system.","173":"The Choosing Wisely (CW) initiative provides recommendations for healthcare providers, aimed at reducing unnecessary or inappropriate tests and procedures. A clinical decision support (CDS) alert in the electronic health record was developed to reflect organizational CW guidelines regarding blood chemistry panel ordering in the primary care setting. An interrupted time series design was used to analyze the weekly proportion of inappropriate blood chemistry panel orders prior to and after implementation of the CDS alert in treatment and control groups. Implementation of the CDS alert significantly decreased the average weekly proportion of inappropriate blood chemistry panels from 28.64% to 15.69% in the treatment group (p &lt; .001). Apart from other efforts implemented simultaneously to reduce inappropriate lab ordering, the CDS alert produced a significant reduction in inappropriate lab ordering. We conclude that CDS alerts can be an effective strategy for healthcare organizations seeking to more closely adhere to CW guidelines.","174":"To describe falls causing injury, types of injuries, and the reporting of these falls. Administrative and incident reporting datasets between July 2012 and June 2017 were analyzed. Using both datasets, 5,653 falls were identified (3.7 per 1,000 bed-days). Administrative and incident datasets accounted for 40.8% (2,299) and 84.4% (4,752) of falls, respectively. More than half the falls in the administrative data required only observation\/examination (1,221 falls; 53.1%, 0.8 per 1,000 bed-days). The remaining 1,078 falls (46.9%; 0.7 per 1,000 bed-days) caused 1,533 injuries (1.0 per 1,000 bed-days). Most injuries happened in patients who were 65 years or older (73.9%), during the first episode of care (79.0%), in the acute care setting (70.4%), or on the same level (60.1%). The most common injuries were to the head (33.3%). Some injuries were serious (169; 11.0%; 0.11 per 1,000 bed-days). Falls resulting in injury in older patients, with a more severe medical condition and at smaller hospitals, were more likely to be recorded in the incident reporting system whereas subsequent falls were less likely to be recorded. Fewer than half of the falls recorded in administrative data resulted in injuries. A tenth of all falls caused serious injuries. ","175":"Up to 30%-40% of children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) have anemia, and approximately 15% receive packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusions. Current literature supports a pRBC transfusion threshold of hemoglobin less than or equal to seven for most PICU patients. Our objective was to determine pRBC transfusion rates, assess compliance with transfusion guidelines, understand patient-level variables that affect transfusion practices, and use cross-industry innovation to implement a practice strategy. This was a pre-post study of pediatric patients admitted to our PICU. We collected baseline data on pRBC transfusion practices. Next, we organized an innovation platform, which generated multi-industry ideas and produced an awareness campaign to effect pRBC ordering behavior. Innovative educational interventions were implemented, and postintervention transfusion practices were monitored. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed models. A p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. At baseline, 41% of pRBC transfusions met restrictive transfusion guidelines with a pretransfusion hemoglobin less than or equal to 7 g\/dl. In the postintervention period, 53% of transfusions met restrictive transfusion guidelines (odds ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.21-2.28). Implementation of a behavioral campaign using multi-industry innovation led to improved adherence to pRBC transfusion guidelines in a tertiary care PICU.","176":"To reduce unnecessary laboratory testing, a three-phase intervention was designed by students to decrease serum folate laboratory testing in the inpatient setting. These included an educational phase, a personalized feedback phase, and the uncoupling of orders in the electronic medical record. Average monthly serum folate ordering decreased by 87% over the course of the intervention, from 98.4 orders per month at baseline to 12.7 per month in the last phase of the intervention. In the segmented regression analysis, joint ordering of folate and vitamin B12 significantly decreased during the intervention ([INCREMENT]slope = -4.22 tests\/month, p = .0089), whereas single ordering of vitamin B12 significantly increased ([INCREMENT]slope = +5.6 tests\/month; p &lt; .001). Our intervention was successful in modifying ordering patterns to decrease testing for a deficiency that is rare in the U.S. population.","177":"Despite their value, comprehensive diabetes care and screening for common cancers remain underutilized. We examined the association between participation in a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) program with strong financial incentives and receipt of preventive care in the first 5 years after program launch. Using multivariate regression analysis, we compared outcomes for adults under the care of participating primary care providers (PCPs) with adults under the care of nonparticipating PCPs. Outcomes were breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screenings, and elements of diabetes care. The analytic sample included 818,623 adults living in Maryland, Virginia, or the District of Columbia, and enrolled with CareFirst for at least 1 year during 2010-2015. By Year 5, enrollees in the intervention group were 7.9 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.8-13.0), 6.1 (95% CI: 1.4-10.7), 3.1 (95% CI: 2.1-4.0), and 7.6 (95% CI: 7.0-8.2) percentage points more likely to undergo HbA1c tests, nephropathy examinations, breast, and cervical cancer screenings, respectively. We found no significant change in the propensity to receive colorectal cancer screening or an eye examination. Our study shows that a PCMH program with strong financial incentives can raise the provision of preventive care but could require additional adjustment.","178":"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Colonoscopy and fecal immunochemistry testing (FIT) are the primary recommended CRC screening modalities. The purpose of this study is to improve rates of CRC screening in Veterans and County hospital patients referred to gastroenterology fellow's clinics. A total of 717 patients between ages of 49 and 75 years were seen. Previous CRC screening was not performed in 109 patients (15.2%) because of not being offered (73.4%) or declining (26.6%) screening. Patients who received previous CRC screening compared with no previous screening were older (mean age 62.3 years vs. 60.3 years, p &lt; .003), white (88.6% vs. 78.3%, p &lt; .027), and more likely to be Veterans patients (90.8% vs. 77.5%, p &lt; .001). After systematically discussing options for screening with 78 of the 109 unscreened patients, 56 of them (71.8%) underwent screening with either colonoscopy (32) or FIT (24). Patients seen by fellows in their last year of training agreed to undergo screening more often than those seen by other fellows (100% vs. 66.2%, p &lt; .033). Systematic discussions about both colonoscopy and FIT can improve the overall rates of CRC screening.","179":null,"180":"Inpatient anticoagulation medication errors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) therapy are common. Our VTE Team identified frequent dosing and duplicate order errors for therapeutic-dose low molecular weight heparin, which (lacking computerized physician order entry) was ordered using blank forms. To decrease such errors, a nonmandatory order form with weight-based dosing and prechecked orders discontinuing existing injectable anticoagulation was developed using human-centered design innovation principles\/processes emphasizing end-user engagement in all phases: observation, exploring solutions, and rapid prototyping\/feedback. Three physicians independently reviewed ordering errors the year before versus after implementation. Before implementation, 11% of orders contained any error versus 10.5% after implementation (p = .82); 6.2% had a dosing or duplicate therapy error versus 4.2% after implementation (all made when the form was not used; p = .19). No dosing or duplicate therapy errors were made when the form was used. Were the form mandatory, all such ordering errors would likely have been eliminated, leaving 11% before versus 6.3% after implementation orders with any error (p = .015), and 6.2% before versus 0% after implementation orders with duplicate or dosing therapy errors (p &lt; .001). Human-centered design of an anticoagulation order form can reduce anticoagulation order errors; such principles can be applied to other health care innovations, including electronic order sets.","181":"Children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at a higher risk of adverse events when they live at a distance from a pediatric facility with specialty services specific to the disease process. At a children's hospital in the southeast, a dialysis unit provides care for 27 patients with chronic ESRD. Nineteen of the 27 patients live more than 1 hour away from the children's hospital. Over the past 3 years, adverse events have occurred in patients being treated at another hospital. These adverse events included sepsis, bacterial and fungal infections, and compromised residual glomerular filtration rate because of the administration of nephrotoxic medications. The purpose of this article is to describe the findings from an improvement effort aimed at decreasing adverse events in the pediatric patient population with ESRD who require urgent or emergent care using an emergency room dialysis card as a communication tool for patients, families, and providers.","182":"Severe sepsis and septic shock cause significant morbidity and mortality with health care costs approximating $17 billion annually. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2012 recommended time-sensitive care bundles to improve outcomes for patients with sepsis. At our community teaching hospital, a review of sepsis management for patients admitted to a medical intensive care unit (ICU) between December 2015 and March 2016 found 70.8% compliance with timing of lactate draw, 65.3% compliance for blood cultures, and 51.4% compliance with antibiotic administration recommendations. Thus, a quality improvement initiative to improve detection and time to bundle completion for ICU-level patients was designed. Previous studies suggest that utilization of sepsis alert systems and sepsis response teams in the emergency department setting is associated with improved compliance with recommended sepsis bundles and improved hospital mortality. Therefore, a \"sepsis alert\" protocol was implemented that used both an electronic alert and an overhead team alert that mobilized nursing, pharmacy, phlebotomy, and a senior internal medicine resident to bedside. In addition, a template to document sepsis diagnosis and bundle adherence was created. After implementation, we noted improvement in appropriately timed serum lactate, 88.6% versus 70.8% (p = .008) with no significant improvements in blood cultures, antibiotic administration, or mortality.","183":"Sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRHC) guidelines recommend the delivery of quality preventive SRHC to males beginning in adolescence. A quality of care (QOC) framework was used to examine factors associated with young male's perceptions of QOC and satisfaction with care, which can influence their engagement and use of SRHC. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted from August 2014 to September 2016 with 385 male patients aged 15-24 years, recruited from primary care and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics. Surveys measured QOC received, satisfaction with care, and domains of a QOC framework. Poisson regression analyses examined associations between domains of quality and perceived QOC as well as satisfaction with care. Over half of males reported QOC as excellent (59%) and were very satisfied with the services (56.7%). Excellent QOC and high satisfaction with services was associated with timely care, higher Clinician-Client Centeredness, and being a bisexual male. Excellent QOC was also associated with greater comfort in the clinic, being tested for human immunodeficiency virus\/STDs, attending primary care settings, and receipt of higher number of SRHC services. Using a QOC framework as part of providing SRHC to young males can be important in improving their perceptions of QOC and satisfaction with services. ","184":"Competency in interprofessional quality improvement and performance measurement is required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. We implemented an interprofessional quality improvement project to support trainee involvement in systems-level improvement to reduce hospital length of stay and engage trainees in efforts to improve the validity and reliability of clinical documentation contributing to risk-adjusted performance measures. The intervention had three components: daily interprofessional disposition huddles to discuss discharge needs, medical documentation curriculum to improve clinical data accuracy, and scheduled coding huddles to provide real-time feedback on documentation. Outcome measures included an unadjusted and risk-adjusted measure of hospital length of stay. Case severity index (CSI) served as a process measure. Statistical process control charts were used to measure change over time. The mean unadjusted length of stay decreased from 5.84 to 4.98 days. Both the unadjusted and the risk-adjusted length of stay measures exceeded the lower control limit of the statistical control chart. The CSI increased and exceeded the upper control limit of the statistical control chart. Improvements were sustained in the year following implementation. The intervention offers a model for academic institutions to satisfy new Common Program Requirements by engaging trainees in performance measurement and interprofessional improvement efforts.","185":"This department column highlights translation of research into healthcare quality practice. Achieving the highest quality in healthcare requires organizations to understand care delivery and to proactively mitigate risks in care delivery processes. The purpose of this article is to describe a quality initiative that used principles of high reliability to develop a zero tolerance culture for central line-associated bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit at an independent, nonprofit acute care community hospital.","186":"This study aims to investigate the readmission rates of major disease groups as stated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and to identify risk factors related to readmission in Korea. We studied 2,973 patients discharged from a 2,200-bed tertiary referral hospital in South Korea, from April 1, 2016, to March 31, 2017. Using electronic medical records, we calculated the 30-day readmission rates of seven diseases: acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure (HF), pneumonia, stroke, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and total hip arthroplasty\/total knee arthroplasty. We used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to identify risk factors affecting readmission in this retrospective, observational study. For 2,973 consecutively discharged patients, the 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 10.3%. The readmission rate of HF (19.0%) was the highest, followed by pneumonia (13.7%), CABG (12.0%), and COPD (10.5%). Factors associated with readmission were polypharmacy (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.60-2.64), hospitalization history in the previous 6 months (HR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.41-2.32), and comorbidity (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.11-1.23). Therefore, the discharge intervention program for high-risk discharge patients with polypharmacy, admission history, and comorbidity should include medication reconciliation.","187":"A subset of patients with ureteral stones who present to the emergency department (ED) will return with recurring symptoms and will receive unnecessary repeat imaging. We retrospectively identified 112 patients from 2012 to 2016 diagnosed with at least one ureteral stone on computerized tomography (CT) at our institution who returned to the ED within 30 days. Patients were stratified based on the presence or absence of repeat CT scan imaging. Mean values were compared with independent t-test and proportions with chi-square analysis. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine independent predictors of repeat imaging. Sixty-eight patients (60.7%) underwent repeat CT scan imaging upon representation to the ED within 30 days of being diagnosed with ureterolithiasis. Ureteral stone position changed in 34 patients (30.4%) who underwent repeat imaging. On univariate analysis, younger age, nondiabetics, narcotics prescribed on discharge from first ED visit, and longer mean time between ED visits were associated with repeat CT scan imaging being performed (p &lt; .05). Only prescription of narcotic pain medications was an independent predictor of repeat CT scan imaging (odds ratio: 3.18, 95% confidence interval: 1.22-8.28; p = .018). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or nonnarcotic pain medications, therefore, should primarily be used for pain control in these patients to avoid unnecessary testing.","188":null,"189":"To measure difference in median time to antibiotic administration in severe sepsis before and after making process changes and clinical outcomes such as duration of hospitalization and mortality. The study was carried out in the emergency department in children &lt;17 years of age with severe sepsis\/septic shock. In phase 1, data were collected and reasons for delayed antibiotic administration were identified. Following this, process changes like creating a triage tool, re-enforcing the severe sepsis protocol and increasing the number of nurses were made to correct the delay. In phase 2, we measured outcomes to compare the effect of the process changes. A total of 28 and 13 children each were included during phase 1 and phase 2 of the study respectively. The median interquartile range time to administration of antibiotics from the time of admission decreased significantly from 50 minutes (18, 65) to 20 minutes (15, 20) (p = .02). Duration of hospital stay was longer in phase 1 as compared to phase 2 (12 days vs. 6 days). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = .1). Use of a triage tool, severe sepsis protocol, and increasing the number of nurses resulted in earlier recognition and administration of first dose of antibiotics in children with severe sepsis. ","190":null,"191":"Massachusetts has one of the highest rates of 30-day readmissions in the country. To identify patient-reported factors that may contribute to readmissions, we conducted semi-structured interviews with patients with unplanned readmissions within 30 days of inpatient discharge from the medicine services at an urban medical center between June and August 2016. Interviews with patients and\/or proxies were conducted in English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Cantonese, then translated to English if necessary, transcribed verbatim, and deidentified. A team of four coders conducted the thematic analysis. Most patients did not identify factors associated with readmission beyond their underlying illness; however, a mismatch between the patient's clinical care needs and services available at postacute facilities, as well as poor communication between providers, facilities, and patients\/proxies, were identified as contributing factors to readmissions. Non-English speaking patients and their families reported confusion with written discharge instructions, even if an interpreter provided verbal instructions. Patients will benefit from future interventions that aim to improve transfers to postacute care facilities, develop written materials in languages prevalent in the local population, and improve communication among providers, facilities, and patients and their families.","192":"Veterans receiving primary care through the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) are at increased risk of adverse outcomes when transitioning from a non-VHA hospitalization to VHA primary care. We intervened to improve these care transitions through identifying Veterans at a partnered community hospital, use of a multidisciplinary patient-structured discharge information sheet for community case managers to effectively communicate with VHA clinics, and implementation of a VHA site process for receiving information. We evaluated the intervention on two endpoints: the percentage-relevant documentation was received at the VHA before follow-up appointment and the rate Veterans attended a follow-up appointment at the VHA. Rates for receiving transitions of care documents were as follows: 0% preintervention (N = 24), 16% in the first 6 months of intervention (N = 39), and 83% after plan-do-study-act cycles in the second 6 months (N = 41). Veteran follow-up attendance also improved 25% preintervention to 54% and 71%, respectively. This process could serve as a model for transitions of care improvement.","193":"This department column highlights translation of research into healthcare quality practice. Achieving the highest quality in healthcare requires organizations to understand care delivery and to develop and design process efficiencies. The improvement process may be enhanced through a partnership between the healthcare facility and an affiliated school of nursing. The purpose of this article was to describe the process for developing a large-scale improvement project focused on enhancing care transitions within an academic medical center using an academic-practice partnership model.","194":"Peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVCs) are common devices used across many healthcare settings. This quality improvement project aims to proactively remove PIVCs as soon as possible by empowering nurses and providers to clinically evaluate the necessity of every PIVC on a daily basis on a general hospital medical unit. Specific criteria were established to assess PIVC necessity. Cases of PIVCs not meeting established criteria are escalated to providers for a decision point. The PIVC removal times documented within the electronic medical record were analyzed to compare precriteria PIVC dwell times to postcriteria dwell times. The time between removal of a patient's last PIVC and patient discharge was analyzed to determine if more PIVCs are being removed sooner after becoming clinically unnecessary. Significantly fewer PIVCs (decrease of 14.4%) are being removed on the day of discharge in the postintervention time frame, whereas more PIVCs are being removed one (increase of 5.5%) or two (increase of 4.0%) days before the day of discharge. A strategic project to critically evaluate PIVCs on a daily basis and remove PIVCs not meeting criteria for use was successful in proactively removing PIVCs. Hospitals should evaluate PIVC practice, monitor daily usage, and strategically intervene to remove unneeded PIVCs.","195":"The purpose of this project was to: (1) develop a strategy for primary care quality measurement using an environmental scan and interviews to identify best practices and candidate measures; (2) present recommendations to facilitate successful measurement. Following stakeholder interviews and review of existing measures, we created a three-tiered recommendation system for selecting and implementing measures. We also developed a framework for reviewing and prioritizing measures and prepared a detailed project report. Interviews provided a broader perspective on measuring quality, including implementing measures, measuring value, and identifying measurement gaps. Our recommendations fall into three tiers: Tier 1 measures can be implemented quickly and include clinical processes and outcomes for preventive care and disease states. Tier 2 measures require modifications to electronic health record, workflows, and\/or staff preparation. Tier 3 (Strategic Vision) addresses topics that should be incorporated in the future to ensure high-quality primary care (adherence, patient activation, patient experience, teamness, staff satisfaction, and value), and infrastructure development to support ongoing quality measurement. Implementing a quality measurement strategy is challenging and labor-intensive but is necessary to improve healthcare quality. Our work demonstrates the effort and investment required to progress quality measurement and offers recommendations for successfully undertaking this type of endeavor. ","196":"Unresolved conflicts in health care threaten both clinician morale and quality of patient care. We piloted a training model that targeted clinicians' conflict resolution skills. Sixty clinicians from local hospitals were randomized into an intervention group (n = 30), completing a 3-hour conflict resolution training session, and a control group (n = 30) without training. The training included facilitated practice with actors, coaching, and feedback. Evaluation of 60 participants' conflict resolution skills was done in videotaped simulations with actors portraying interprofessional colleagues. Global ratings and checklist items developed for assessing clinicians' performance mirrored steps in the conflict communication model. The intervention group's performance exceeded the control group on global scores, 7.2 of 10 (SD = 1.6) versus 5.6 (SD = 1.5), p &lt; .05, and checklist scores, 9.3 of 11 (SD = 2.9) versus 7.9 (SD = 1.5), p &lt; .05. Two checklist items showed statistically significant differences: (1) subjects opened the dialogue on a neutral ground before jumping into conflict discussions (intervention: 97% and control: 73%, p &lt; .05) and (2) subjects elicited the colleague's story before sharing their own story (intervention: 70% and control: 27%, p &lt; .05). The pilot results suggest that a health care-specific approach to conflict resolution can be effectively taught through facilitated practice, coaching, and feedback. ","197":"Dehydration is a potentially preventable complication post-tonsillectomy and can result in an Emergency Department visit and\/or readmission. Our objectives were to identify risk factors for dehydration readmissions and develop interventions to prevent them. We used retrospective chart reviews to determine if increased intravenous (IV) hydration post-tonsillectomy prevented hospital readmissions for dehydration. All children aged 1-18 years who underwent tonsillectomy between July 1, 2007 and September 30, 2015 were included in this quality improvement study. Using the Pediatric Health Information System database, patients who experienced a readmission for dehydration within 72 hours of surgery were identified and validated with internal data. We analyzed the pre-implementation and post-implementation readmission rates after standardization of increased IV fluids (1.5 times maintenance). An interrupted time series analysis was used to estimate the effects of our hydration initiative. Of 11,157 patients who underwent tonsillectomy during the study period, 96 (0.9%) met the criteria for readmissions for dehydration. The pre-implementation readmission rate was 1% compared to 0.2% post-implementation, a reduction of 82%. The hydration initiative was associated with a significant decrease in hospital readmissions. This safe, low-cost, easy-to-implement approach to preventing dehydration post-tonsillectomy could be explored at other institutions. ","198":"The Acute Care for Elders (ACE) Unit model improves cognitive and functional outcomes for hospitalized elders but reaches a small proportion of patients. To disseminate ACE Unit principles, we piloted the \"Virtual ACE Intervention\" that standardizes care processes for cognition and function without daily geriatrician oversight on two non-ACE units. The Virtual ACE Intervention includes staff training on geriatric assessments for cognition and function and on nurse-driven care algorithms. Completion of the geriatric assessments by nursing staff in patients aged 65 years and older and measures of patient mobility and prevalence of an abnormal delirium screening score were compared preintervention and postintervention. Postintervention, the completion of the assessments for current functional status and delirium improved (62.5% vs. 88.5%, p &lt; .001) and (4.2% vs. 96.5%, p &lt; .001). In a subsample analysis, in the postintervention period, more patients were up to the chair in the past day (36.4% vs. 63.5%, p = .04) and the prevalence of an abnormal delirium screening score was lower (13.6% vs. 4.8%, p = .16). The Virtual ACE Intervention is a feasible model for disseminating ACE Unit principles to non-ACE Units and may lead to increased adherence to care processes and improved clinical outcomes.","199":"Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) is an initiative that rewards acute-care hospitals with incentive payments for the quality of care they provide. A hospital's trauma certification has the potential to influence HVBP scores as attaining the certification provides indication of the service quality offered by the hospital. As such, this study focuses on hospitals' level of trauma certification attainment through the American College of Surgeons and whether this certification is associated with greater HVBP. A retrospective review of the 2015 HVBP database, 2015 Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) database, and the 2015 American Hospital Association (AHA) database is utilized, and propensity score matching was employed to determine the association between level of trauma certification and scores on HVBP dimensions. Results reveal trauma certification is associated with lower HVBP domain scores when compared to hospitals without trauma certification. In addition, hospitals with a greater degree of trauma specialization were associated with lower total performance score and efficiency domain scores. Although payers attempt to connect hospital reimbursements with quality and outcomes, unintended consequences may occur. In response to these results, HVBP risk adjustment and scoring methods should receive further scrutiny. ","200":"Effecting improvement in the small, rural hospital setting is often challenging. Harris Regional Hospital (HRH) is a small, acute care hospital in rural western North Carolina acquired by Duke LifePoint Healthcare in August, 2014. Since that time, HRH has been on a quality journey characterized by a data-driven approach to reducing patient harm events. Using a framework that comprised leadership, performance improvement, and cultural development to cultivate an environment of mutual respect and trust, HRH has demonstrated sustained improvement in patient harm events over a 29-month period from January 2015 to June 2017. The purpose of this article is to provide examples of scalable, effective tactics contributing to quality improvement in the rural hospital environment.","201":"Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) occurring in the postoperative period are serious yet preventable conditions. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the risk of postoperative VTE can be successfully reduced with mechanical prophylaxis and\/or chemoprophylaxis. Patients are often noncompliant with mechanical prophylaxis in the postoperative period. We performed a prospective nonrandomized controlled study to determine if providing an educational pamphlet would increase knowledge and compliance with mechanical VTE prophylaxis. Patients receiving the educational pamphlet were more likely to rate their knowledge of VTE prophylaxis as \"very good\" when compared to the control group (73.1% vs. 30.2%, p &lt; .001). Patients were also more likely to be compliant with mechanical prophylaxis in the educational group (53.9% vs. 30.2%, p = .014). Our study demonstrated that providing a simple educational pamphlet increased patient knowledge regarding VTE prophylaxis and increased compliance with mechanical prophylaxis.","202":"","203":"Efficient clinical pathways are needed to meet the growing pressures in dermatology due to the significant rise in the number of suspected skin cancer referrals. Our hospital serves a wide geographical area and receives a large number of 2-week-wait (2WW) suspected skin cancer referrals. In the United Kingdom, approximately 10-12% of 2WW referrals are diagnosed as skin cancers fulfilling the 2WW criteria. We sought to assess the role of teledermatology in reducing hospital consultations for patients referred via the dermatology 2WW pathway. We piloted a teledermatology service and detailed the clinical outcomes of patients with solitary skin lesions of uncertain diagnosis triaged through this pathway. Seventy-six primary care referrals were reviewed by consultant dermatologists and analyzed against the British Association of Dermatologists' teledermatology audit standards. In 52\/76 (68%) of patients, confident benign diagnoses were made, avoiding the need for a face-to-face (FTF) consultation. Our results showed that with adequate image quality, teledermatology can be used to accurately diagnose skin lesions. Teledermatology can significantly reduce the number of urgent referrals necessitating FTF appointments, therefore providing a new solution to streamline care delivery. ","204":"Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) contributes greatly to patient mortality and healthcare costs. Studies have shown that aggressive oral care in intensive care units (ICUs) can significantly reduce pneumonia rates, and hospitals have implemented stringent protocols in this setting. However, little is known about the effectiveness of aggressive oral care in reducing HAP in non-intensive care wards, prompting us to conduct a nonrandomized controlled clinical trial. A structured toothbrushing program was provided to an experimental cohort of patients. A control group received usual care. Patient demographics, toothbrushing frequency, and pneumonia diagnosis were recorded over a 3.5-month period. Difference in pneumonia rates was computed using unadjusted and multivariate logistic regression analyses. No significant difference in pneumonia rates between control and experimental groups was found (1.7% versus 1.8%). Toothbrushing rates increased significantly in the experimental group (p = .002) but fell short of protocol frequency. It became apparent that aggressive toothbrushing program implementation requires nursing-led interdisciplinary involvement, more intensive training, a streamlined documentation system, and efficient compliance tracking. Lessons from this study should be used for future large-scale research. A secondary analysis of these data did, however, suggests that increasing toothbrushing rates may have the potential to reduce pneumonia in the non-ICU acute care setting.","205":"Because of osteoporosis, patients older than 50 years with fragility fractures are at risk of further fractures. We developed a quality improvement initiative based on an evidence-based Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) model of care to help prevent subsequent fractures. Previous to the implemented FLS model, less than 13% of patients with fragility fractures were assessed for osteoporosis at our institution. We created a registry tool to identify patients with fractures who were older than 50 years. Our interventions focused on identifying, contacting, and educating patients; and coordinating screening tests and an outpatient follow-up visit with an endocrinologist. Identification of patients older than 50 years with fragility fractures increased from 0% to 74.5%, with implementation of the fracture registry. Of those identified, 33.9% were screened and had a follow-up visit. The fragility fracture population older than 50 years is at risk of subsequent fractures and should be identified, contacted, educated, screened, and assessed for osteoporosis to prevent subsequent fractures.","206":"","207":"Severity of illness (SOI) measures are commonly used in adults for comparison of treatment and outcomes in similar populations. Less is known about the psychometric properties of measures available to providers and healthcare systems caring for pediatric patients. The purpose of this study was to (1) identify SOI measures used for pediatric patients admitted to acute care hospitals and (2) compare the ability of two SOI measures to predict mortality and length of stay (LOS). Twelve instruments were identified through literature search and one, the pediatric chronic complex condition (CCC), was retained. The CCC and the Charlson\/Deyo comorbidity score were applied to an 8-year retrospective, multi-institutional data set using logistic and zero-truncated negative binomial regression models. Records from 199,001 children were examined. The CCC performed better for predicting mortality (odds ratio = 3.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.20-3.53) and LOS (incidence rate ratio = 2.24; 95% CI: 2.22-2.26). The CCC may be preferable for predicting outcomes among pediatric inpatients. Pediatric SOI measures are not extensively developed and tested nor widely and freely available. The use of the CCC can predict mortality and LOS to guide care, resource allocation, and research for the pediatric population. ","208":"Patient safety culture (PSC) is an emerging construct in adult long-term care settings. No measures are validated to quantify PSC in pediatric long-term care (pLTC) settings despite the importance of safety for this vulnerable population. The study purposes are to (1) describe PSC in pLTC, (2) assess the relationship of PSC to facility recommendation and overall safety rating, and (3) test the stability and reliability of the PSC survey over time. A modified Nursing Home PSC (NHSPSC) survey was administered to employees at three pLTC facilities over 3 years; data were summarized and compared over time. In all, 208 surveys were completed. Staff perceptions on \"feedback and communication about incidents\" and \"overall perceptions of resident safety\" were most positive and associated with responses of recommending the facility and high overall ratings for child safety (p &lt; .05). The modified NHSPSC survey was reliable by Cronbach alpha and findings were consistent over time in these pLTC settings. This tool may be a useful adjunct to safety initiatives in pLTC. Knowledge derived from this survey can provide actionable information for consumers, pLTC employees, managers, and administrators. ","209":"Early evidence has shown that Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) have achieved some success in improving the quality of care and reducing Medicare costs. However, it has been argued that the ACO rewarding model may disproportionately affect relatively low-spending (LS; considered as efficient) organizations that have fewer options to cut unnecessary services compared with high-spending (HS; inefficient) organizations. We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study to compare ACO financial and quality of care performance between HS-ACO and LS-ACO. After adjusting for ACO organizational factors and beneficiary characteristics, we found that HS-ACOs generated greater savings per beneficiary than LS-ACOs ($501 vs. -$108, p &lt; .001); however, HS-ACOs had a lower quality of care performance (48.79 vs. 53.29, p = .002). Specifically, LS-ACOs had better quality performance than HS-ACOs in patient experience\/satisfaction (p = .02), preventive care services (p = .004), and hospitalization management (p = .001), whereas HS-ACOs better performed in routine checkup\/follow-up (p &lt; .001) and risk population management (p = .048). Our findings indicated that Medicare ACO rewarding model seems to be advantageous for HS-ACOs regardless of the overall quality of care performance.","210":"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimated that Medicare's Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HAC-RP) would reduce hospital payments by $364 million in fiscal year 2016. Although observers have questioned the validity of certain HAC-RP measures, less attention has been paid to the determination of low-performing hospitals (bottom quartile) and the reliability of penalty assignment. This study used publicly available data from CMS's Hospital Compare to simulate the consistency of hospitals' scores and the assignment of penalties under repeated measurement with no change in each hospital's underlying quality. The simulation showed that 64.0% of all hospitals and 40.6% of hospitals subject to payment penalty are statistically significantly different from the penalty threshold at the 95% confidence level. The proportion of hospitals statistically different from the threshold showed significant variation by ownership status, teaching status, bed size, and other factors. The simulation further showed that due only to chance, 18.0% of penalized hospitals would escape penalty on repeated measurement. Policymakers should consider alterations to the HAC-RP to improve its reliability.","211":"We compare hospital readmission rates by accountable care organization (ACO) status with national readmission averages, to determine whether ACO affiliation influences 30-day hospital-wide readmission rates. Data from the 2015 American Hospital Association Survey of Care Systems and Payment database were merged with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid's 2015 Hospital Compare Deaths and Readmissions data set. A multinomial logistic regression model is used to examine readmission rates, categorized as better, no different, or worse, in comparison to national averages, by ACO status. Compared with Non-ACO hospitals and holding the covariates constant, the relative risk of having better than national average readmissions was 1.85 in Medicare ACO hospitals (p = .36). Compared with facilities in the Northeast region, the relative risk of having better than national average readmissions was 2.21 for facilities in the West (p = .10). Facilities in the Midwest and Southern regions had a lower risk of having better than national average rates (Relative Risk: 0.90 and 0.23, respectively; p = .83 and .06, respectively). As hospital beds increase, facilities have significantly lower risks of having worse than national average readmissions. Overall, the ACO status did not significantly improve readmissions. However, Medicare ACOs performed better than non-Medicare ACOs and those hospitals without any reported ACO arrangements. ","212":"Discharging hospitalized children involves several different components, but their relative value is unknown. We assessed which discharge components are perceived as most and least important by clinicians. March and June of 2014, we conducted an online discrete choice experiment (DCE) among national societies representing 704 nursing, physician, case management, and social work professionals from 46 states. The DCE consisted of 14 discharge care components randomly presented two at a time for a total of 28 choice tasks. Best-worst scaling of participants' choices generated mean relative importance (RI) scores for each component, which allowed for ranking from least to most important. Participants, regardless of field or practice setting, perceived \"Discharge Education\/Teach-Back\" (RI 11.1 [95% confidence interval, CI: 11.0-11.3]) and \"Involve the Child's Care Team\" (RI 10.6 [95% CI: 10.4-10.8]) as the most important discharge components, and \"Information Reconciliation\" (RI 4.1 [95% CI: 3.9-4.4]) and \"Assigning Roles\/Responsibilities of Discharge Care\" (RI 2.8 [95% CI: 2.6-3.0]) as least important. A diverse group of pediatric clinicians value certain components of the pediatric discharge care process much more than others. Efforts to optimize the quality of hospital discharge for children should consider these findings. ","213":"Patient experience is becoming an area of interest in Emergency Medicine as more is understood about its impact on outcomes and the expectation that it will soon be tied to reimbursement. No study has investigated the predictors of emergency department (ED) patient satisfaction in over a decade. As the care environment, access to information, and consumer interests change, determinants of satisfaction have likely evolved. Our objective was to examine the factors that were most predictive of ED satisfaction. A retrospective cohort study at an urban, university-affiliated ED. The relationship between overall satisfaction and patients' responses to individual questions was assessed using a chi-square test and a multivariable logistic regression model. During the study period, 7,872 patients participated in a telephone interview. Logistic regression found 13 questions predictive of high overall ED rating and 9 questions predictive of low overall ED rating. Six questions appeared in both analyses, related to timeliness, cleanliness, the physician's ability to listen carefully, teamwork, and the perception of being helped by the care. There are strong predictors of overall ED satisfaction related to communication, wait time, environment, and perception that care was helpful. Further efforts should focus on identifying interventions in each of these domains. ","214":"As an innovative approach to improve quality of surgical care, we combined surgeon self-assessment and anonymized peer comparison with continuous quality improvement seminars using positive deviance (CQI\/PD) to identify surgeon(s) with the lowest rates of adverse events (AEs) to guide group practice recommendations. Our objective was to quantify the impact these interventions on postoperative AEs rates after major non-cardiac chest operations. All postoperative AEs after all thoracic operations (n = 1,084, March, 2013 to February, 2016, single-center) were prospectively collected using the thoracic morbidity and mortality system, based on Clavien-Dindo schema. Online software provided surgeons (n = 6) with self-evaluation and peer comparison at all times. In addition, quarterly CQI\/PD seminars (n = 8, September, 2013 to December, 2015) focused on common impactful AEs: atrial fibrillation (AFIB), prolonged alveolar air leak (PAAL), and anastomotic leak (AL). Impact was analyzed using univariate statistics 6, 9, and 12 months before and after implementation. We observed reductions of postoperative AEs after CQI\/PD: a decrease (all time periods) in AFIB, greatest at 6 months (10.1% vs. 6.7%; p = .36); a decrease (all time periods) in PAAL, greatest at 12 months (18.9% vs. 11.7%; p &lt; .05); and decrease (6 and 9 months) in AL, greatest at 6 months (11.1% vs. 8.3%; p = .82). Improvements in AE rates after individual surgeon self-evaluation and CQI\/PD seminars provide encouraging results that merit further investigation.","215":"Lack of collaboration between care teams and patients\/families has been associated with delayed discharge from the hospital. In this study, we determine whether patients' awareness of the estimated date of discharge (EDD) was associated with a decrease in delayed discharge, and determine the factors associated with a delayed discharge. A total of 221 patients admitted to the General Medicine service between July and September 2014 were included in the study. Estimated date of discharge was identified within 36 hours of admission. The bedside nurse communicated this EDD to the patient\/family. Patients were interviewed to identify whether they were aware of their EDD. Bedside nurses were interviewed to identify barriers to discharge. In our study, 49.8% of the patients had a delayed discharge. Patients who were aware of their EDD were less likely to have a delayed discharge (odds ratio [OR], 0.3 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.1-0.6], p &lt; .001). Patients who were discharged on Saturday or Sunday (OR, 4.8 [95% CI, 1.7-14.6], p &lt; .001) and patients who were waiting for physicians' consult (OR, 4.5 [95% CI, 1.6-14.4], p = .007) were more likely to have a delayed discharge. Early identification of the EDD and communicating it with the care team and the patient\/family, mobilizing resources for safe weekend discharges, and creating efficient process for consultations might decrease delayed discharges.","216":"To determine the association between management standards and clinical outcomes among patients with hip fracture (HF). Data from a prospective cohort study were linked with hospital administration data. In 2014 and 2015, 493 patients had surgery for HF. The proportion of patients meeting care standards ranged from 69% for surgery within 48 hours to 96% for being seen by a geriatrician. Thirty-nine per cent of patients received all the standards. The mean waiting time for surgery was 44 hours (median, 34 hours; interquartile range [IQR], 22-58 hours). The mean length of stay for patients who were alive at discharge was 17 days (median, 13 days; IQR, 6-24 days). Fifty-six patients were readmitted within 28 days of discharge (12%), and 40 patients died within 28 days of admission (8.1%). Patients who received all standards were less likely to be readmitted or die. Surgery within 48 hours and being seen by a physiotherapist were associated with a lower mortality rate. The management standards, collectively and in particular, assessment by a physiotherapist and surgery within 48 hours were significantly associated with better clinical outcomes. ","217":"This article describes the application of Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate operating room (OR) utilization at a small rural hospital in the province of Ontario, Canada. Using input factors that include the duration of procedures, the number of days of operation, and the shift duration, the simulation identifies ways of improving the capacity of the hospital's OR. The analysis was used to implement changes that led to a 38% increase in the number of procedures completed. The hospital also has created capacity for further growth and is adding both new service types and additional revenue-generating contract services. Moreover, based on the success of the analytic model, hospital staff have continued collecting real-time data on OR utilization to enable additional analysis. The findings suggest that rural hospitals can indeed apply currently available data to improve process flow. Furthermore, the lack of analytic resources inside the hospital should not be a barrier because it is possible to create partnerships with educational institutions.","218":"This department column highlights translation of research into healthcare quality practice. Achieving the highest quality in healthcare requires organizations to understand care delivery and to proactively mitigate risks in care delivery processes. The purpose of this article was to describe the process for using the failure modes and effects analysis process to provide evidentiary support and proactive risk mitigation for the establishment of a comprehensive vascular access team within an academic medical center.","219":"","220":"Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more women are insured with Medicaid, which should improve healthcare access. We sought to determine whether there are survival differences among patients with breast cancer undergoing surgery at facilities with varying proportions of Medicaid patients. We used New York State (NYS) Vital Statistics death records data linked with NYS discharge inpatient and ambulatory surgery databases to examine 90-day survival after surgery from 2008 to 2013. We used all Medicaid discharges to calculate and create quintiles of facilities based on Medicaid volume. We calculated survival hazard ratios using a marginal Cox model controlling for clustering of patients within hospitals, age, race, insurance, year of surgery, and comorbidities. Women who received surgery in facilities with the highest quintile of Medicaid volume had higher 90-day mortality (2.1% vs. 0.07%, p &lt; .001) compared with those treated in facilities with lowest Medicaid volume, even after adjusting for multiple confounders. Consequently, although the ACA may improve access, healthcare quality remains questionable because patients treated at facilities with high proportions of Medicaid volume appear to have worse 90-day survival, likely due to quality of surgical and postsurgical care. Policymakers must ensure that quality of care is not negatively impacted by programs to reduce costs.","221":"The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model is a multidisciplinary, team-based approach to healthcare that focuses on actively involving the patient in clinical decision making. The Veterans Health Administration (VA), while desiring to be a national leader in the delivery of primary care services, used the principles of the PCMH model to design the patient-aligned care team (PACT). The purpose of this study, was to explore the perception of the PACT members after integration of a clinical pharmacist to the PACT. This was a single-center cross-sectional study conducted at an integrated Veterans Health Administration system. We electronically surveyed PACT staff practicing within VA-Tennessee Valley Health Care System as of October 1, 2016 using a modified version of the Medicine Medication Use Processes Matrix (MUPM) containing 19 items on five theoretical grouping of processes (evaluation and management, monitoring, medication review, documentation, and education) and two groupings(clinician satisfaction and access). Ninety-one complete responses were received. Perceptions were positive, with 79% rated as either 4 (\"moderate contribution\") or 5 (\"major contribution\"). Individual responses based on discipline, with the exception of the medical support assistant were rated positive, specifically job satisfaction. This study evaluated the perceptions of clinical pharmacist integration into the PACT model. Respondents perceived clinical pharmacist beneficial. ","222":"With increasing electronic health record (EHR) use, providers are talking less with one another. Now, many rely on EHRs, informal emails, or texts, introducing fragmentation and new data security challenges with new communication strategies. We aimed to examine the impact of a physician champion educational outreach intervention to promote electronic provider-to-provider communication in a large academic multispecialty group. Physician champions provided educational outreach to 16 academic departments, using 10-minute case-based presentations. Online surveys assessed communication preferences and practices. Electronic health record queries counted EHR messaging use before and after intervention. Descriptive statistics compared responses by specialty (z-test). Paired responses with pre-post data were compared using chi-square tests. Time series analysis assessed EHR messaging rates before intervention versus after intervention. Five hundred seventeen providers responded to the postoutreach survey. Eighty-six percent were familiar with EHR messaging tool and 78% knew how to use it after intervention. Among practitioner groups, Family Medicine preferred EHR messaging the most (62%). Groups who declined outreach least preferred it (26%). Among 88 respondents with paired pre-post intervention surveys, familiarity rose (79-96%), and self-reported use increased (66-88%). Physician champion educational outreach increased the use of the secure provider-to-provider EHR messaging tool. ","223":"The treatment of patients in the emergency department (ED) with severe pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is challenging, and treatment process strategies that facilitate good outcomes are not well documented. The overall objective of this study was to identify factors that can affect the care process associated with pediatric TBI. This objective was achieved using a discrete-event simulation model of patients with TBI as they progress through the ED treatment process of a Level I trauma center. This model was used to identify areas where the ED length of stay can be reduced. The number of patients arriving at any given time was also varied in the simulation model to observe the impact to bed allocation policies and changes in staff and equipment. The findings showed that implementing changes in the ED (i.e., availability of two computerized tomography scanners, formation of resuscitation teams that included eight staff personnel, and modifying the bed allocation policy) could result in a 17% reduction in the mean ED length of stay. The study outcomes would be of interest to those (e.g., health administrators, health managers, and physicians) who can make decisions related to the treatment process in an ED.","224":"High adverse event rates are a signal of potentially low-quality care that imposes burdens on patients, families, and hospitals. In this article, we examine the relationship between the distinct characteristics of teaching hospitals with adverse event rates among pediatric patients, controlling for patient complexity and severity using 2009-2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. We hypothesize that adverse event rates increase with the availability of more complex services and technologies (transplantation and pediatric open-heart surgery); increase as experience of providers decreases (July effect); and increase with residents per bed, a measure of both average provider inexperience and congestion. Using multilevel analysis, we find empirical evidence in support of our three hypotheses. We find that in environments where more learning occurs, more mistakes are made. Identifying high-performing hospitals with large residency programs and complex service lines that have made progress in patient safety and then studying how they have done so should become a priority. These findings should then be adapted within other hospitals through publicly funded mechanisms to improve the quality of care for all children.","225":"Despite the increased emphasis on patient experience, little is known about whether there are meaningful differences in hospital satisfaction between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites. To determine if satisfaction differs, we used Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey data (2009-2010) reported by hospitals to compare responses between Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients. Clustered logistic regression models identified within-hospital and between-hospital differences in satisfaction. Of the 3,864,938 respondents, 6.2% were Hispanics, who were more often younger and females and less likely to have graduated from high school. Hispanics were overall more likely to recommend their hospital (74.1% vs. 70.9%, p &lt; .001) and to rate it 9 or 10 (72.5% vs. 65.9%, p &lt; .001) than whites. Increased satisfaction among Hispanics was more pronounced when compared with whites within the same hospitals, with significantly higher ratings on all HCAHPS measures. However, hospitals serving a higher percentage of Hispanics had lower satisfaction scores for both Hispanic and white patients than other hospitals. There were significant but only modest-sized differences in patient experience between Hispanic and white patients across U.S. hospitals. Hispanics tended to be more satisfied with their care but received care at lower-performing hospitals. ","226":"In 2013, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association updated the cholesterol guideline. Despite strong evidence supporting the recommendations, a discernible gap exists in the number of residents who practice them. Our study aimed to identify barriers hindering residents from guideline implementation. Twenty eight residents were administered a preintervention and postintervention questionnaire to identify barriers in guideline application. The questionnaire was categorized into three barriers: knowledge, attitude, and behavior. A multifaceted educational intervention consisting of directed teaching sessions and supervised patient encounters was conducted. Our analysis showed that our residents lacked awareness, familiarity, and self-efficacy in using the cholesterol guideline. The intervention led to significant improvements in awareness (79% vs. 43%, p = .0129), familiarity (61% vs. 29%, p = .0306), and self-efficacy (65% vs. 16%, p = .0018) and achieved a 31% increase in knowledge (p = .0001), 38% in attitude (p = .0001), and 20% in behavior (p = .019). The overall improvement in scores averaged 30% (p = .0001). Our quality improvement initiative successfully improved our resident's comprehension and applicability of the 2013 ACC\/AHA cholesterol guideline. We recommend a multifaceted educational approach tailored toward addressing specific barriers to improve the practice of evidence-based medicine. ","227":"Wait times for many chronic pain programs in Canada range from 6 months to 2 years. This project sought to determine the interest of primary care providers (PCPs) in using an electronic consult system for patient(s) waiting for a pain consultation. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the pain clinic of a Canadian tertiary academic health sciences center. Participants were PCPs who had submitted a referral to this clinic. Referrals received between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2014, were reviewed to determine their appropriateness for eConsult, and a letter providing information about eConsult and encouraging its use was sent to the referring PCP. Of the 585 referrals that were reviewed, 227 were appropriate for eConsult. Fifty-one (26%) of the 194 PCP responses received were positive. Technologies like eConsult may help address the growing demand for specialist advice. In addition to facilitating response to specific questions, the bidirectional nature of eConsult permits its use for educating PCPs about chronic pain treatment. Given that almost one third of responding PCPs indicated an interest in eConsult, its potential reach is vast. Additional study is needed to understand barriers to PCP acceptance and use of eConsult and the uptake of advice given.","228":"Physicians are responsible for delivering high quality of care. In cases of underperformance, hindsight knowledge indicates forewarning being potentially available in terms of concerns, signs, or signals. It is not known how the physicians involved perceive such signals. To openly explore how physicians perceive soft signals and react on them. In-depth interviews with 12 hospital-based physicians from various specialties and institutions following the interpretative phenomenological analysis approach. Physicians perceive soft signals as an observable deviation from a colleague's normal behavior, appearance, or communication. Once observed, they evaluate the signal by reflecting on it personally and\/or by consulting others, resulting in either an active (i.e., speaking up) or passive (i.e., avoidance) reaction. Observer sensitivity, closeness to the peer, and cohesion of the physician group influence this observation-evaluation-reaction process. Physicians perceive soft signals as indicators of well-being and collegiality, not as concerns about performance or patient safety. They feel it is their responsibility to be sensitive to and deal with expressed signals. Creating a psychological safe culture could foster such an environment. Because a threat to physicians' well-being may indirectly affect their professional performance, soft signals require serious follow-up. ","229":"Limited health literacy is a common but often unrecognized problem associated with poor health outcomes. Well-validated screening tools are available to identify and provide the opportunity to intervene for at-risk patients in a resource-efficient manner. This is a multimethod study describing the implementation of a hospital-wide routine health literacy assessment at an academic medical center initiated by nurses in April 2014 and applied to all adult inpatients. Results were documented in the electronic health record, which then generated care plans and alerts for patients who screened positive. A nursing survey showed good ease of use and adequate patient acceptance of the screening process. Six months after hospital-wide implementation, retrospective chart abstraction of 1,455 patients showed that 84% were screened. We conclude that a routine health literacy assessment can be feasibly and successfully implemented into the nursing workflow and electronic health record of a major academic medical center.","230":"Achieving the highest quality in health care requires organizations to develop clinical improvements that result in measurable outcomes for success. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate an example of clinical quality improvement through the use of data analytics to generate evidence for financial return on investment in two nurse-led, population-based clinics.","231":"HRSA supported health centers have a long history of participating in ambulatory care accreditation; however, there is a dearth of information on the relationship between accreditation and quality of care. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 1,202 health centers, using multivariate regression to estimate the association between accreditation and 14 clinical quality measures, controlling for patient and organizational characteristics. We also predicted national estimates of accreditation-related improvement in quality. Adjusted analyses show that accredited health centers achieved higher performance on adult weight screening and follow-up (coef = 0.037, p &lt; .05), tobacco cessation intervention (coef = 0.042, p &lt; .05), and use of lipid-lowering therapy (coef = 0.028, p &lt; .05). Study results show that universal accreditation could result in additional 552,087 adult patients receiving weight screening and follow-up, 157,434 receiving tobacco cessation intervention and 25,289 receiving lipid-lowering therapy. This is the first national study to examine the impact of accreditation on health center quality of care. Findings suggest that HRSA support for accreditation has the potential to improve quality of care and as a result, reduce health disparities in underserved communities across the United States. Further research is necessary to identify specific elements of accreditation that have the greatest impact on quality of care.","232":"Indwelling catheter placement is a modifiable risk factor for urethral trauma. We implemented a multidisciplinary Foley Project protocol in June 2015, which consisted of a system-wide catheter education program, difficult urinary catheterization (DUC) algorithm, and skilled catheter nursing team to improve patient outcomes. A retrospective review of male DUC consults between June 2014 and September 2015 was performed. The preprotocol group includes consults received from June 2014 to May 2015. The postprotocol group includes consults received from June 2015 to September 2015. There were 74 patients in the preprotocol and 18 patients in the postprotocol group. The overall incidence rates of catheter-associated trauma during placement were 41.1% in the preprotocol and 5.9% in the postprotocol groups (p = .005). In the preprotocol group, 53.4% required a procedure by a urologist, whereas only 11.8% of patients in the postprotocol group required a procedure (p = .002). The Foley Project protocol reduced the frequency of catheter-associated trauma and procedures.","233":"According to the American Cancer Society, 1 in 23 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) in their lifetime. Screening for CRC is an effective, yet underused preventive approach. This is especially true in rural areas, where only 35% of patients were found to be up to date on their screenings in 2014. Increasing CRC screening can produce positive patient outcomes by early recognition and removal of precancerous polyps. The purpose of this project was to use quality improvement (QI) interventions to increase CRC screening rates at a nurse-managed clinic in rural Indiana. Using Deming's Plan-Do-Study-Act QI model, multiple interventions were implemented which resulted in a 37% increase in the number of screenings ordered on eligible patients and an overall increase of 28% in the completion of the screenings. This project contributes to healthcare quality knowledge by also suggesting that the fundamental principles of encouraging staff feedback to gain buy-in, improving processes informed by patient data, and valuing frequent performance feedback to staff, strengthened this QI project and ensured adoption and sustainability of these results.","234":"Family-initiated rapid response (FIRR) empowers families to express concern and seek care from specialized response teams. We studied FIRRs that occurred in a pediatric tertiary hospital over a 3-year period. The main aims were to describe the characteristics and outcomes of FIRRs and compare them with clinician-activated RRs (C-RRs). Of the 1,906 RRs events reviewed, 49 (2.6%) were FIRRs. All FIRRs had appropriate clinical triggers with the most common being uncontrolled pain. Chronic conditions and previous admissions were present in 61%. More than half of FIRRs had a vital sign change that should have qualified C-RR activation. Seventy-six percent FIRRs needed at least one or more interventions. Twenty-seven percent of FIRRs needed transfer to intensive care unit compared with 60% transfer rate for C-RRs. Family-initiated rapid response events were activated for legitimate concerns and frequently needed clinical interventions. Enhanced information and awareness of FIRR can improve utilization of the system and enhance family satisfaction, patient safety, and outcomes. Disseminating the information on FIRR and the importance of family involvement will improve the care of children and empower family members. ","235":"The National Committee for Quality Assurance's (NCQA) measure \"Initiation and Engagement of Alcohol and Other Drug Dependence Treatment\" captures the proportion of substance use patients with (1) treatment initiation within 14 days and (2) treatment engagement within 30 days thereafter. The definition of treatment considers only counseling but not medication-assisted treatment (MAT), although MAT is supported by current guidelines. Our research question is whether this omission results in meaningful measurement error. We analyze claims data for members of commercial health plans to investigate whether including MAT would meaningfully change the measure rate and health plan rankings. Including MAT increased both the initiation and engagement rates. The initiation and engagement rates increased 2.4% (38.9-39.8%) and 9.9% (12.9-14%), respectively. These differences imply that 19% of health plans would change their ranking by at least one quintile for the initiation measure and 27% for the engagement measure. The current specifications result in erroneous conclusions about the quality of care provided by different health plans. Our results suggest that aligning the measure specifications with guideline recommendations, as recently proposed by NCQA, would result in more accurate information. ","236":"Meaningful improvement in patient safety encompasses a vast number of quality metrics, but a single measure to represent the overall level of safety is challenging to produce. Recently, Perla et al. established the Whole-Person Measure of Safety (WPMoS) to reflect the concept of global risk assessment at the patient level. We evaluated the WPMoS across an entire state to understand the impact of urban\/rural setting, academic status, and hospital size on patient safety outcomes. The population included all South Carolina (SC) inpatient discharges from January 1, 2008, through to December 31, 2013, and was evaluated using established definitions of highly undesirable events (HUEs). Over the study period, the proportion of hospital discharges with at least one HUE significantly decreased from 9.7% to 8.8%, including significant reductions in nine of the 14 HUEs. Academic, large, and urban hospitals had a significantly lower proportion of hospital discharges with at least one HUE in 2008, but only urban hospitals remained significantly lower by 2013. Results indicate that there has been a decrease in harm events captured through administrative coded data over this 6-year period. A composite measure, such as the WPMoS, is necessary for hospitals to evaluate their progress toward reducing preventable harm.","237":"Elevated hospital readmission rates from home care are an indicator of poor care quality, and rates are particularly high for patients with heart failure. Readmissions may be avoided by optimizing continuity of care. To explore perceptions among home care clinicians of the barriers they face and the information they need to improve care continuity for patients with heart failure. Focus groups were conducted with teams of home care clinicians at a large certified home healthcare agency in the Northeastern United states. In total, there were 61 participants across 6 focus groups. Three overarching themes emerged: continuity of care and communication on care transitions, maintaining continuity of care during a home care episode (with subthemes tracking signs and symptoms and patient teaching), and health information technology (HIT) characteristics to support communication and care continuity. Our study highlights areas of improvement for HIT solutions that could support care delivery for patients with heart failure in a home care setting. Home care agencies planning to introduce technology can use these findings to assess if and how potential systems can support nurses to provide continuity of care across healthcare organizations and home care visits. ","238":"Population health management (PHM) approaches to improve cost and quality remain limited. To address this gap, stakeholders within an integrated delivery and financing system in Western Pennsylvania designed, implemented, and tested a value-based care model for children with medically complex conditions that could be scaled across the broader pediatric population. The model included: (1) a multilevel, interdisciplinary infrastructure; (2) actionable analytics reports to guide continuous quality improvement; (3) alternative provider payments; (4) consumer-directed spending accounts; and (5) shared savings with practices. Four practices caring for 215 children (&lt;age 21) with medically complex conditions participated in the demonstration. Quality and cost outcomes were compared between the intervention group and a comparison group using propensity scores. The program generated cost savings over a 2-year performance period, although the difference between the intervention and comparison groups was not significant, likely because of the small N. Quality of care was maintained or improved for the intervention group from baseline to the end of the performance period. This model is an example of how real-world laboratories that leverage strong payer-provider partnerships can be a useful platform for testing value-based PHM models with the potential to reduce healthcare costs while maintaining or improving care quality.","239":"Opioid overdose is a leading cause of death from unintentional injury in the United States. When more opioids are prescribed than needed, leftover opioids may be misused if not properly disposed. The purpose of this study is to describe the opioid use of subjects (aged 13-21 years) after an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair. After obtaining IRB approval, we obtained consent from 100 subjects (over an 8-month period) undergoing ACL reconstructions performed by five sports medicine surgeons. The mean age of enrolled subjects was 16 years, most were female (60%) and white (72%). While in the hospital, many subjects received the following: a regional anesthetic technique through a single shot femoral nerve block (50%); ketorolac (89%); and acetaminophen (84%). One week after surgery, we interviewed subjects to determine the amount of opioid used (36%) as compared to the amount prescribed.","240":"Expert groups recommend annual chest computed tomography for lung cancer screening (LCS) in high-risk patients. Lung cancer screening in primary care is a complex process that includes identification of the at-risk population, comorbidity assessment, and shared decision making. We identified three key processes required for high-quality screening implementation in our academic primary care practice: (1) systematic collection of lifetime cumulative smoking history to identify potentially eligible patients; (2) visit-based clinical reminders and order sets embedded in the electronic health record (EHR); and (3) tools to facilitate shared decision making and appropriate test ordering. We applied quality improvement techniques to address gaps in these processes. Over 12 months, we developed and implemented a nurse protocol for collecting complete smoking history and entering that data into discrete EHR fields. We obtained histories on over 50% of the clinic's more than 2,300 known current and former smokers, aged 55-80 years. We then built and pilot tested an automated visit-based reminder (VBR) system, driven by the discrete smoking history data. The VBR included an order set and template for documentation of shared decision making. Physicians interacted with the VBR in approximately 30% of opportunities for use. Further work is needed to better understand how to systematically provide appropriate LCS in primary care environments.","241":"Health care systems are implementing a myriad of strategies to improve patient outcomes and reduce both adverse events and unplanned readmissions. These approaches include interventions related to people, processes, and technology. This article describes the development of a technology-based model in the form of an actionable risk profile, which was used by one inpatient surgical unit (people) during a daily care team briefing (process). The risk profile was evaluated for its perceived value to the care team as a method of organizing care and anticipating patients' needs. Preliminary findings of the proof of concept are presented along with recommendations for practice and research.","242":"Accountability for health system improvement is a requirement for nursing leadership in practice. However, to be accountable for organizational goals, nurse leaders need the tools to identify gaps in their microsystems of care. The purpose of this article was to provide a case study example of chief nursing officer (CNO) leadership in using a technology solution to develop a CNO accountability scorecard. This project highlights the HQ Essential for data analytics using an innovative technological approach to drive improvement at the front line of clinical care.","243":"To evaluate the short-term effectiveness of the Intermountain Healthcare (IH) Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) for patients with prediabetes (preDM) deployed within primary care clinics. A quasi-experimental study design was used to deploy the DPP within the IH system to identify patients with preDM and target a primary goal of a 5% weight loss within 6-12 months of enrollment. Adults (aged 18-75 years) who met the American Diabetes Association criteria for preDM were included for study. Patients who attended DPP counseling between August 2013 and July 2014 were considered as the intervention (or DPP) group. The DPP group was matched using propensity scores at a 1:4 ratio with a control group of patients with preDM who did not participate in DPP. Of the 17,142 patients who met the inclusion criteria for preDM, 40% had an in-person office visit with their provider. On average, patients were 58 years old, and greater than 60% were women. Based on multivariate logistic regression, the DPP group was more likely to achieve a 5% weight loss within 6-12 months after enrollment (OR = 1.70; 95% CI = 1.29-2.25; p &lt; .001) when compared with the no-DPP group. Diabetes Prevention Program-based lifestyle interventions demonstrated significant reduction in body weight and incident Type 2 diabetes mellitus when compared with nonenrollees. ","244":"This article describes the experiences of a quality improvement team that used small cycles of change to improve the emergency department (ED) of an academic medical center. The role of EDs in the provision of healthcare continues to increase in importance. ED bottlenecks contribute to long waits and diminished outcomes for ED patients as well as more system-wide issues, such as inefficiencies in inpatient admission processes. The purpose of this \"ED Operational Efficiency Project\" was to reduce lengths of stay (LOS) for low-acuity patients. The team used lean management techniques to both improve services and shift the ED culture to prioritize continuous quality improvement. The goal to reduce LOS by 30% was met as the result of several inter=related projects (or small cycles of change). Key lessons include monitoring metrics, communicating with teams and target populations, learning from initial failures, using small wins to increase momentum, and anchoring changes.","245":"A diverse universe of statistical models in the literature aim to help hospitals understand the risk factors of their preventable readmissions. However, these models are usually not necessarily applicable in other contexts, fail to achieve good discriminatory power, or cannot be compared with other models. We built and compared predictive models based on machine learning algorithms for 30-day preventable hospital readmissions of Medicare patients. This work used the same inclusion\/exclusion criteria for diseases used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In addition, risk stratification techniques were implemented to study covariate behavior on each risk strata. The new models resulted in improved performance measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, factors such as higher length of stay, disease severity index, being discharged to a hospital, and primary language other than English were associated with increased risk to be readmitted within 30 days. In the future, better predictive models for 30-day preventable hospital readmissions can point to the development of systems that identify patients at high risk and lead to the implementation of interventions (e.g., discharge planning and follow-up) to those patients, providing consistent improvement in the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system.","246":"Low-value healthcare services (LVHS) are defined as procedures delivered that provide little or no clinical benefit. Overuse of LVHS, or delivery when the risks exceed the benefits, contributes to excessive spending without improved outcomes. Furthermore, overuse contributes to healthcare waste. The primary purpose of this commentary is to (1) examine the problem of LVHS overuse and its impacts on quality care delivery and (2) propose factors to consider in developing quality measures to help reduce overuse and waste and thus improve patient outcomes. To inform and support this commentary, we conducted a limited review of the literature related to LVHS overuse, its consequences, and suggested solutions. Online search engines were used to identify research related to our primary areas of interest. This commentary demonstrates that overuse and associated healthcare waste is growing among selected LVHS. The factors of overuse are multidimensional and poorly understood. Meanwhile, overuse of LVHS has financial consequences and impacts quality of care and outcomes. Overuse of LVHS is common in the United States, leading to waste and suboptimal patient outcomes. Thus a need exists to address overuse and develop measures to capture a larger scope of services. ","247":"Novel measures of hospital quality are needed. Because quality improvement efforts seek to reduce variability in processes and outcomes, hospitals with higher variability in adverse events may be delivering poorer quality care. We sought to evaluate whether within-hospital variability in adverse events after a procedure might function as a quality metric that is correlated with facility-level mortality rates. We analyzed all percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) performed in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system from 2007 to 2013 to evaluate the correlation between within-hospital variability in 30-day postdischarge adverse events (readmission, emergency department visit, and repeat revascularization), and facility-level mortality rates, after adjustment for patient demographics, comorbidities, PCI indication, and PCI urgency. The study cohort included 47,567 patients at 48 VHA hospitals. The overall 30-day adverse event rate was 22.0% and 1-year mortality rate was 4.9%. The most variable sites had relative changes of 20% in 30-day rates of adverse events period-to-period. However, within-hospital variability in 30-day events was not correlated with 1-year mortality rates (correlation coefficient = .06; p = .66). Thus, measuring within-hospital variability in postdischarge adverse events may not improve identification of low-performing hospitals. Evaluation in other conditions, populations, and in relationship with other quality metrics may reveal stronger correlations with care quality.","248":"Persistent asthma requires a daily controller medication. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines and Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures are used to identify persistent asthma, the former method used by clinicians, and the latter by managed care organizations (MCOs). This study aims to determine the degree of agreement between these criteria in classifying pediatric persistent asthma. Asthmatic patients aged 5-18 years old in a university pediatric practice who were continuously enrolled with one MCO from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013 (Cohort 1: 329 patients) and January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2014 (Cohort 2: 212 patients) were identified. Subjects with at least one asthma visit were included. Independence of NHLBI and HEDIS criteria was determined by the McNemar test. Agreement was determined by confusion matrix analysis and Cohen kappa statistic with continuity correction. Agreement in controller assignment was 82% in Cohort 1 and 88% in Cohort 2. Agreement was fair in Cohort 1 (Cohen kappa = 0.364; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.217-0.511) and moderate in Cohort 2 (Cohen kappa = 0.447; 95% CI = 0.247-0.646). The HEDIS misclassified persistent asthma by 16.4% (95% CI: 11.5-21.2%) and 11.8% (95% CI: 6.8-16.7%) in Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. NHLBI and HEDIS criteria show fair to moderate agreement; however, the HEDIS consistently misclassified persistent asthma, suggesting that it is a poor measure of practice performance.","249":"Performance feedback is central to data-driven models of quality improvement, but the use of claims-based data for feedback has received little attention. To examine the challenges, uses, and limitations of quarterly Medicare claims-based performance feedback reports generated for practices participating in the Comprehensive Primary Care (CPC) initiative from 2012 to 2015. Mixed methods study of nearly 500 CPC practices in seven regions, combining pilot testing; systematic monitoring; surveys; in-depth interviews; user feedback; and input from data feedback team. Designing reports required addressing issues about timing, data completeness and reliability, variations in patient risk across practices, and use of benchmarks and metrics understandable to users. Practices' ability to use reports constructively depended on their experience, analytic resources, expectations, and perceptions about the role of primary care in improving reported outcomes. Generating claims-based feedback reports that support practices' quality improvement efforts requires a significant investment of analytic expertise, time, resources, continuous improvement, and technical assistance. Claims-based performance feedback can provide insight into patterns of patients' care across provider settings and opportunities for improvement, but practices need data from other sources to manage patients in real time or assess the short-term effects of specific changes in care delivery. ","250":"Patients with little or no health insurance are frequently readmitted to the hospital, yet few previous studies have listened to patients' explanations of why they returned to the hospital after discharge. Enhanced understanding of patient perspectives may facilitate targeted services and improve care. We enrolled 18 patients with Medicaid or no insurance during a hospital readmission within 30 days in a major metropolitan area, and conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews to explore the impact of patients' experiences around readmission using a grounded theory approach. We identified five themes contributing to readmission: (1) therapeutic misalignment; (2) accountability; (3) social fragility; (4) access failures; and (5) disease behavior. Medical conditions were complicated by social influences and insufficiently addressed by our health system. Patients understood the need to manage their own health but were unable to effectively execute care plans because of competing life demands and compromised relationships with health providers. Our study using interviews of readmitted Medicaid and uninsured patients revealed complex illnesses complicated by social instability and health system failures. Improved patient-provider trust and shared decision-making, while addressing social determinants and expanding care coordination with community partners, provide opportunity to better meet patients' needs and decrease hospital readmission in high-risk patients. ","251":"Consumer engagement is increasingly emphasized in healthcare initiatives and has been a priority in healthcare reforms. Consumer engagement takes multiple forms, including increased involvement of consumers in their own care, in organizational design, and in broader policy decision-making processes. Determining the effectiveness of such involvement requires both effective measurement and empirical study, both of which have yet to be standardized or fully explored. In this review, we examine both existing measurement tools for consumer engagement and current empirical knowledge regarding the outcomes associated with each of three levels of consumer engagement. Although measurement and results at the level of direct care are more established, measurement of consumer engagement, let alone its effects at the organizational design or policy level, is less well developed. Building on our review, we make suggestions for how to fill the current gaps in understanding the measurement and outcomes of consumer engagement.","252":null,"253":"Many factors contribute to medication nonadherence including psychological and memory disorders, aging, and pill burden. The Automated Home Medication Dispenser (AHMD) is a medication management system intended to help solve unintentional medication nonadherence. The purpose of this study was to determine if use of the AHMD improved medication adherence. We conducted a 6-month prospective, feasibility study assessing use of the AHMD in 21 patient-caregiver dyads. Patients were referred by their physician because of poor medication adherence and included if they resided in Rochester, NY and on at least two medications in pill form. Pill counts were performed at baseline to assess previous adherence. Prospective medication adherence was assessed using AHMD recorded dosing information. A paired t-test was used to compare previous and prospective adherence. The mean age of patients was 75.1 years. Fifteen patients (71.4%) and eight caregivers (38.1%) were women; half (47.6%) of caregivers lived with the patient. The most common patient comorbidities were hypertension (76.2%) and memory disorder (61.9%). Mean adherence increased from 49.0% at baseline to 96.8% after 6 months of AHMD use (p &lt; .001). In a cohort of unintentionally nonadherent patients, use of the AHMD for 6 months significantly improved medication adherence. ","254":null,"255":"As the healthcare environment continues to evolve, many community hospitals of all sizes are finding it difficult to thrive and grow in the headwinds of increasing regulatory requirements, decreased reimbursements amidst healthcare reform efforts, increased requirements for efficiency, demands for improvement in the patient experience, and increasing penalties for lagging performance in patient safety and quality metrics. A unique partnership, involving an organization built upon expertise in operating community hospitals and an academic center with expertise in patient safety, quality, innovation, and care delivery, has provided a successful solution for a growing number of challenged community facilities. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how using standardized patient safety, quality improvement processes, and high-reliability strategies in community hospitals has been supported and enhanced through the development of a healthcare affiliation network with an academic medical center. By developing this type of quality affiliation, hospitals across a broad spectrum of sizes and locations can achieve significant improvement in safety culture while demonstrating measureable advances in quality and safety and supporting their mission of \"making communities healthier, together.\"","256":"The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) developed Patient Safety Indicators (PSI) with the goal of detecting and preventing adverse events using administrative data. Use of PSIs to measure safety and quality of care raises questions since they rely heavily on coded data. The goal of this paper is to review literature on AHRQ PSIs, specifically their accuracy in detecting adverse events, and how recent coding changes affect the accuracy of these estimates. The Healthcare Utilization Project (HCUP) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) contains data on more than seven million hospital stays yearly. Trending these estimates over time indicate there has been a decrease in rates for the majority of PSIs, with Accidental Puncture or Laceration, Central Venous Catheter Blood Stream Infections, Iatrogenic Pneumothorax, and Deaths from complications decreasing significantly each year from 2008-2012. Birth Trauma, Retained Foreign Bodies, Post-op Sepsis and Post-Op Respiratory Failure PSIs show no improvement from 2008-2012. A literature review on accuracy of PSIs and the affect of the Present on Admission (POA) indicator on PSI estimates reveals mixed results. PSIs serve as a useful tool in identifying problem areas in quality of care but should be used cautiously in determining hospital performance.","257":"This study aims to determine the proportion of nonacute patients occupying acute care beds and to describe their needs, the appropriate level of alternative care, and reasons preventing discharge. Data from 952 patients hospitalized in an acute care unit for 30 days were obtained from their medical charts and by consulting with the medical team at two tertiary teaching hospitals. Among them, 333 (35%) were determined nonacute on day 30 of hospitalization. According to the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP), 55% had no medical, nursing, or patient needs. Among nonacute patients with AEP needs, 88% were related to nursing\/life-support services and 12% related to patient condition factors. Regarding alternative level of care, 186 (56%) were waiting for out-of-hospital resources, of which 36% were waiting for palliative care, 33% for long-term care, 18% for rehabilitation, and 12% for home care. For the remaining 147 (44%) nonacute patients, the alternative resources remained undetermined although acute care was no longer required. Main reasons preventing discharge included unavailability of alternative resources, ongoing assessment to determine appropriate resources, ongoing process with community care, and family\/patient education\/counseling. Available subacute facilities and community-based care would liberate acute care beds and facilitate their appropriate use.","258":"High-quality data are necessary to eliminate health disparities, and are necessary in cancer prevention and control. A pilot project to improve the collection of race and ethnicity data was undertaken. The approach included train-the-trainer and staff training, and racial and ethnic categories were expanded to include \"granular ethnicity\" or ancestry terms in the patient registration system at five acute care hospitals in Rhode Island. The self-reported racial and ethnic distribution of the patient population was examined for each pilot hospital. Two of the five pilot hospitals reported significant increases in the identification of Hispanic patients. At two other pilot hospitals, the proportion reporting unknown on either race or ethnicity was reduced. Evidence that Hispanics struggle to identify with existing racial categories is also highlighted. These results suggest that a modest program of staff training and resources can significantly increase the identification of racial and ethnic minorities, improving the quality of hospital and state cancer registry data. This has many possible benefits, including better alignment with language services for the patient population, better understanding of the healthcare needs of different racial and ethnic groups, and better strategies to not only address disparities, but also assess those efforts.","259":"This department column highlights leadership perspectives of quality and patient safety practice. The purpose of this article is to provide strategic direction for transformational quality and safety leadership as the chief nursing officer (CNO) within the academic medical center environment.","260":"The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) implemented a patient-centered medical home (PCMH) model, termed Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT), in 2010. We assessed the association between PACT and the use of health services among U.S. veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). VHA clinical and administrative data were obtained for the pre-PACT period of April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 and post-PACT period of June 1, 2011 to May 31, 2012. Outcomes included hospitalizations, primary, specialty and mental health visits, and emergency department and urgent care visits. We utilized negative binomial regression and extended estimating equation models for the full sample. The analysis contained 696,379 unique veterans in both pre- and post-PACT periods. We estimated the linear incremental effect of PACT on utilization outcomes. PACT were associated with a decrease in hospitalizations (incremental effect [IE]: -0.02; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.03, -0.01), a decrease in specialty care visits (IE: -0.45; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.23), and an increase in primary care visits (IE: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.25). The period following PACT implementation was associated with a lower rate of hospitalizations and specialty care visits, and a higher rate of primary care visits for veterans with PTSD, indicating enhanced access to primary care. ","261":"Implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) has historically been lower among obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) than many physician groups. This study described ob-gyns' adoption and use of EHR systems in practice, as well as barriers and benefits to implementation. Surveys asking about the physicians' use of EHR, satisfaction with systems, and what features they found most or least helpful were mailed to 1,200 ob-gyns. An overall response rate of 57.4% was achieved, with 559 returning completed surveys. Over three-quarters of responders reported that they used an EHR system or planned to implement one. Physicians without EHR tended to be older, were more likely to be male, have a solo practice, and describe themselves as Asian\/Pacific Islander. Over 63% of those physicians who use EHR reported being satisfied with their system, while 30.8% were not satisfied. Ob-gyns who reported satisfaction had a younger mean age (M = 52.98, SD = 8.87) than those not satisfied (M = 56.30, SD = 8.59; p = .002). Use of EHR systems among ob-gyns has increased in recent years and overall satisfaction with these systems is high. In spite of this, barriers to implementation are still present and increased outreach to certain groups of ob-gyns, including older practitioners and those in solo practices, is needed.","262":"Enhanced recovery programs (ERPs) can improve outcomes following bowel surgery, but implementing an ERP across a large healthcare system remains challenging. In this study, a simplified ERP that focused on two process steps, early and frequent ambulation and early alimentation, was evaluated to determine its impact on outcomes. Data were collected on 5,000 adult patients undergoing elective small and large bowel operations over a 3-year period. Complication, readmission, and mortality rates were evaluated before and after ERP implementation. A composite score was calculated based on the successful completion of the two process steps. Following implementation, there was a 35.1% increase in the composite score, which was associated with significant (p &lt; .05) reductions in overall complications, gastrointestinal complications, pulmonary complications, and readmissions. A system-wide ERP focusing on early and frequent ambulation and early alimentation is associated with decreased complications and readmissions in adult patients admitted for elective small or large bowel operations.","263":"The Chinese version of safety attitudes questionnaire is used to evaluate patient safety culture from the viewpoints of physicians and nurses of a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan in 2014. This study applies Mann-Whitney U test for two independent samples test and analysis of variance to observe if different demographic variables are perceived differently in patient safety culture in terms of eight dimensions. In addition, linear regression models are applied to take into account the confounding effects of demographic variables in eight dimensions. The results show that none of the eight dimensions is more important. Besides, supervisor\/manager and experience in position are the two critical demographic variables to influence the patient safety culture. The results imply that the hospital management needs to pay much attention to the employees who are not supervisors\/managers and\/or more experienced in position because they are less satisfied in patient safety culture.","264":"Patients who leave without being seen (LWBS) by a medical provider in emergency care settings are a concern because their urgent complaints remain unaddressed. This study aims to characterize the LWBS population in an ophthalmology-dedicated emergency room and to evaluate an intervention designed to decrease the number of these patients. A program of rounding and patient contact in the waiting room of our emergency room was initiated to this end. A patient database was used retrospectively to review 13,124 charts and collect clinical and demographic data on 71 LWBS patients. The percentage of LWBS patients decreased from 0.74% to 0.33% after the intervention (p = 0.00158). Of the LWBS patients, 27% were seen in an ophthalmology clinic within 2 weeks, and 4% were seen back in the emergency room. Of these patients, 49% had some ophthalmology follow-up after leaving. Among those with follow-up, 14% had concerning pathology. Of all LWBS patients, 63% had a primary care physician. We conclude that frequent rounding in an emergency room waiting room can decrease the number of LWBS patients and as such reduce morbidity. This strategy offers potential to improve healthcare outcomes in emergency settings.","265":null,"266":"We analyze the assembly of surgical trays in a hospital's sterile services department. The department assembles 520 different tray setups. However, tray assembly times are unknown, imposing a challenge to production planners. To respond to demand, workers from other departments are often called, leading to higher operational costs and more frequent quality problems due to workers' poor training and inconsistency. Conducting traditional time-motion studies is infeasible in such a high variety production setting. Thus, we used design of experiments to optimize the data acquisition. Assembly times of 36 trays were sampled using a 2-factor nested factorial design. Through regression analysis, we built a model to estimate completion times of trays not sampled in the experiment. A prediction model with 90.8% accuracy was obtained from the experimental data. The model was validated with assembly times from several trays not included in the experiment. Predicted assembly times had an absolute error of 7.83% on average compared with observed assembly times. Design of experiments and regression analysis combined were able to optimize time data acquisition using a small sample of trays, resulting in a model that predicted assembly times within an acceptable margin of error. ","267":"","268":"In the treatment of pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI), timely treatment of patients can affect the outcome. Our objectives were to examine the treatment process of acute pediatric TBI and the impact of non-value-added time (NVAT) on patient outcomes. Data for 136 pediatric trauma patients (age &lt; 18 years) with severe TBI from 2 trauma centers in the United States were collected. A process flow and value stream map identified NVATs and their sources in the treatment process. Cluster and regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between NVAT, as a percentage of the patient's length of stay (LOS), and the patient outcome, measured by their corresponding Glasgow outcome scale. There were 14 distinct sources of NVAT identified. A regression analysis showed that increased NVAT was associated with less favorable outcomes (relative ratio = 1.015, confidence interval = [1.002-1.029]). Specifically, 1% increase in the NVAT-to-LOS ratio was associated with a 1.5% increase in the chance of a less favorable outcome (i.e., death or vegetative state). The NVAT has a significant impact on the outcome of pediatric TBI, and every minute spent on performing non-value-added processes can lead to an increase in the likelihood of less favorable outcomes. ","269":"Adult immunization rates are consistently suboptimal, exacting significant human and financial burden of preventable disease. Practice-level interventions to improve immunization rates have produced mixed results. The context of change critically affects implementation of evidence-based interventions. We conducted a randomized controlled cluster trial of the 4 Pillars Practice Transformation Program to increase adult vaccination rates in primary care practices and used qualitative methods to test intervention effects and understand practice characteristics associated with implementation success. We conducted qualitative interviews with staff from 14 practices to assess implementation experiences. Thematic analysis of data pointed to the importance of quality improvement history, communication and practice leadership, Immunization Champion leadership effectiveness, and organizational flexibility. Practices were scored on these characteristics and grouped into four types: Low Implementers, Medium Implementers, High Implementers, and Public\/University Practices. Intervention uptake and immunization rate changes were compared, and a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates (3.9 percentage points [PPs]; p = .038) was observed for High Implementers only. Significant increases in Tdap vaccination rates were observed for High Implementers (9.3 PP; p = 0.006) and the Public\/University groups (6.5 PP; p = 0.012), but not other groups. Practice characteristics may be critical factors in predicting intervention success.","270":"Continuity of care (COC) is a fundamental component of primary care and particularly important to older adults who are managing multiple chronic conditions. Administrative measures of continuity are often used to evaluate care coordination interventions, but it is not known whether administrative continuity are correlated with patient reports of continuity among older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs). The objective of this study is to assess the concordance of administrative continuity indices and patient reports of continuity among older adults with MCCs. We use patient survey data collected from July to October 2011 linked to administrative claims data collected from July 2010 to December 2011 for 710 Medicare Advantage Chronic Care Special Needs Plan beneficiaries living in the US South. Among older adults with two or more conditions, the Usual Provider of Care Index was not associated with any patient experience measure; COC Index was associated with informational and management continuity items. These findings suggest that among older adults with MCCs, the administrative continuity measures have limited concordance with patient reported continuity measures.","271":"The discharge phone call (DPC) is an important initiative aimed at improving transitions of care and reducing readmissions. It is of added importance as financial penalties will be imposed on hospitals with \"excessive\" Medicare readmissions. This study examines the impact of DPCs on percentages of patients reached through the DPCs and hospital readmission rates based on the centralized or noncentralized mode of DPCs. The health system centralized the Studer Group Discharge Phone Call program into one central call center with the goals of reaching more discharged patients and to ultimately reduce hospital readmissions. The study analyzed hospital visits from 74,754 patient admissions that could result in an unplanned hospital readmission. Hospital discharge data were analyzed from August 2010 to January 2014. Primary outcomes included DPCs reaching discharged patients and effects on hospital readmission rates as a result of centralizing the DPC program. Centralized DPCs are significantly associated with increases in the percentage of patients reached by the DPC, which in turn reduces readmissions rates. Patients not reached were 1.32 times more likely to be readmitted than patients reached by centralized DPCs. Centralizing the DPC program within a call center helps reach more patients and reduce readmission rates further compared with noncentralized DPCs.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for unhealthy alcohol use but little is known about how best to do so. We used quality improvement techniques to implement a systematic approach to screening and counseling primary care patients for unhealthy alcohol use. Components included use of validated screening and assessment instruments; an evidence-based two-visit counseling intervention using motivational interviewing techniques for those with risky drinking behaviors who did not have an alcohol use disorder (AUD); shared decision making about treatment options for those with an AUD; support materials for providers and patients; and training in motivational interviewing for faculty and residents. Over the course of one year, we screened 52% (N = 5,352) of our clinic's patients and identified 294 with positive screens. Of those 294, appropriate screening-related assessments and interventions were documented for 168 and 72 patients, respectively. Although we successfully implemented a systematic screening program and structured processes of care, ongoing quality improvement efforts are needed to screen the rest of our patients and to improve the consistency with which we provide and document appropriate interventions.","274":"","275":"","276":"Postprocedure infection complicates nearly 5% of abortions. Multiple organizations endorse prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infection risk with surgical abortion, but the adherence rate remains unknown for women who obtain antibiotics at a pharmacy and take them at home before their procedure. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of quality improvement interventions on antibiotic utilization and preoperative documentation for women undergoing surgical abortion at our academic institution. An initial quality evaluation of antibiotic utilization by women who had abortions in our operating room between April 2012 and June 2013 revealed suboptimal antibiotic adherence and poor physician documentation. To address these issues, we recommended patients to fill prescriptions at the pharmacy located in the same building as our clinic and created a standard preoperative template for the medical record. We reexamined outcomes for women having abortions from April 2014 to June 2015. Antibiotic adherence increased from 81% to 90% (p &lt; .001). The proportion of patients not receiving antibiotics decreased from 2.4% to 0.5% (p = .01). Adherence documentation rates improved from 69% to 99% (p &lt; .001). Using an easily accessible pharmacy and a standard preoperative template improves utilization of prophylactic antibiotics for patients undergoing abortions in the operating room. ","277":"Patient perceptions of teamwork have been a relatively undiscovered domain. Our study investigated the use of the Patients' Insights and Views of Teamwork (PIVOT) survey on an acute cardiology unit in an academic teaching hospital with patients receiving Rounding with Heart, an interprofessional bedside rounding initiative, and others receiving traditional rounding processes. Sixty-three subjects were surveyed during their hospital stay. We found a significant difference (p = .006) in PIVOT scores between those receiving interprofessional rounding and those not receiving this rounding structure. In an item-by-item analysis, four specific items were found to be significant which were supported by analysis of qualitative data. Observations of the structured interprofessional rounding process by our research team reveal themes that emerged from observations: (1) openness\/inclusivity, (2) patient-centeredness, (3) attending role\/shared leadership, (4) nonconfrontational learning, (5) efficacy, and (6) team at bedside. Our results indicate that patients may be able to recognize the teamwork in the structured bedside rounding process and that interfacing with the team may be an important component to patients. We conclude that patient perceptions of teamwork are a valuable informant to modeling collaborative practices, and there are key observable components to the structured rounding model that may foster collaboration among different disciplines.","278":null,"279":"The 2014 United States Preventive Services Task Force systematic review found abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening decreased related mortality by close to half.

Using the quality improvement plan-study-do-act cycle, we retrospectively established poor adherence to AAA screening and poor documentation of smoking history in our resident clinic. An electronic reminder was prospectively implemented into our electronic medical record (EMR) with the goal of improving screening rates. After 1 year, a retrospective chart review was conducted. Comparisons of the pre- and post-electronic reminder intervention data were made using chi-square tests and odds ratios (OR). The purposeful AAA screening rate improved 27.8% during the intervention, 40.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.6-52.0%) versus 12.5% (95% CI: 3.1-21.9%), p = .002, suggesting patients were more likely to be screened as a result of the electronic reminder, OR = 4.73 (95% CI: 1.77-12.65). This improvement translates to a large effect size, Cohen's d = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.31-1.40). Electronic reminders are a simple EMR addition that can provide evidence-based education while improving adherence rates with preventive health screening measures.","280":"In September 2012, our institution implemented an emergency department (ED) and inpatient pathway for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on national guideline recommendations. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between standardizing ED and inpatient care for CAP and antimicrobial stewardship, clinical testing, and cost. We used descriptive statistics, statistical process control, and interrupted time series analysis to analyze measures 12 months before and after implementation. Six hundred thirty-two patients were included. We found an immediate sustained increase in narrow-spectrum antibiotic (ampicillin) use from a baseline of 8-54%. There was a shift toward more guideline-recommended diagnostic testing with an increase in blood cultures and respiratory viral testing among admitted patients (35-63% and 52-84%, respectively). We identified no significant change in ED chest radiography use, mean ED length of stay (LOS), percentage of CAP admissions, or mean inpatient LOS. Costs of care for admitted patients and for patients discharged from the ED were unchanged. Standardizing care for ED and inpatient management of CAP led to immediate and sustained improvements in antimicrobial stewardship and guideline-recommended testing without significantly affecting costs. ","281":"New technologies and procedures have the potential to improve outcomes; however, initial implementation is often associated with a steep learning curve, decreased efficiency, and patient safety implications. Implementation of a real-time, ultrasound-based prostate high-dose rate brachytherapy procedure involved a multidisciplinary team composed of approximately 6-8 team members and numerous complex tasks. To characterize time spent on various aspects of the procedure and improve efficiency, the team developed a detailed process map, time study, and team debriefings. A benchmark was created based on an experienced institution which has performed &gt;100 procedures annually. The process map was analyzed based on clinical tasks and treatment planning tasks. Over the course of 17 cases at a single institution, total procedure time ranged from 222 to 107 minutes. Implementation of the process map resulted in a reduction of total time by 52%. The implementation of a new procedure benefits from the integration and utilization of a process map. We were able to reduce procedure time significantly, which resulted in decreased time under general anesthesia, reduced risk of deep vein thrombosis, improved overall patient safety, patient throughput, and decreases in staffing demands.","282":"Despite the Affordable Care Act's push to improve the coordination of care for patients with multiple chronic conditions, most measures of coordination quality focus on a specific moment in the care process (e.g., medication errors or transfer between facilities), rather than patient outcomes. One possible supplementary way of measuring the care coordination quality of a facility would be to identify the patients needing the most coordination, and to look at outcomes for that group. This paper lays the groundwork for a new measure of care coordination quality by outlining a conceptual framework that considers the interaction between a patient's interdisciplinarity, biological susceptibility, and procedural intensity. Interdisciplinarity captures the degree of specialized medical expertise needed for a patient's care and will be an important measure to estimate the number of specialists a patient might see. We then develop a preliminary measure of interdisciplinarity and run tests linking interdisciplinarity to medical mistakes, as defined by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Patient Safety Indicators. Finally, we use our preliminary measure to verify that interdisciplinarity is likely to be statistically different from existing measures of comorbidity, like the Charlson score. Future research will need to build upon our findings by developing a more statistically validated measure of interdisciplinarity.","283":null,"284":"The Texas Medicaid 1115 Transformation Waiver reforms the state's safety net systems by creating a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment incentive pool for innovative healthcare delivery. The Waiver supports the design and implementation of transformative projects. As part of the Waiver requirements, regions created Learning Collaboratives to collaborate on project implementation and outcomes. This paper describes the experience of one region in adapting the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series (IHI BTS) model, as a framework for their Learning Collaborative. Implementation of the Learning Collaborative was systematic, multidimensional, and regularly evaluated. Some features of the IHI model were adapted, specifically longer Plan-Do-Check-Act cycles and the lack of a single clinical focus. This experience demonstrates the ability of a region to improve health from a more diverse perspective than the traditional IHI BTS Collaboratives. Within the region, organizations are connecting, agencies are building continuums of care, and stakeholders are involved in healthcare delivery. The initial stages show a remarkable increase in communication and enhanced relationships between providers. At the end of the 5-year Waiver, evaluation of the impact of the regional and cohort Learning Collaboratives will determine how well the adapted IHI BTS model facilitated improvements in the community's health.","285":"Current risk-stratification models insufficiently identify readmission risk. Academic medical center in Boston, MA. One hundred seventy-seven medicine inpatients. We prospectively interviewed clinicians about whether they would be surprised if patients scheduled for discharge were readmitted within 30 days and to identify one patient at the highest risk. Multivariate models examined the impact of clinicians' judgment on readmission. The 30-day same-hospital readmission rate was 10.7%. The number of hospitalizations (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.30), emergency department visits (1.10, 1.02-1.19), and discharge medications (1.07, 1.00-1.14) were associated with readmission in bivariate models. The negative-predictive value when clinicians would be surprised about a readmission was high (95%). Clinicians are better at predicting those not readmitted than those who are. ","286":"National performance measurement programs used to improve quality and\/or accountability are prevalent. Professional society-based programs largely assess practice or provider performance. We tested the limitations of the Quality Oncology Practice Initiative (QOPI), a well-established program. We investigated the potential limitations of the QOPI limited sampling strategy and end-of-life (EOL) metrics through a retrospective review of all decedents meeting the QOPI eligibility criteria at a large three-site community oncology practice. Relative precision for each EOL metric was measured and simulated scenarios modeled via log-normal distributions were compared. A total of 246 deaths were identified; only 14% of decedents were included in the QOPI limited sample. Important differences in relative precision between samples were evident. Chemotherapy administered at the EOL was 2.8 times greater among the full cohort compared to the sample. The limited sampling strategy demonstrated the lack of precision explained by sampling variability confounded in smaller sample sizes. Our analyses demonstrated that practices reporting the same metric may stem from very different underlying distributions, which limits the ability to understand complex practice patterns and improve care. These findings may be of significance to other performance measurement programs that utilize similar testing strategies. ","287":"Severe sepsis and septic shock are global issues with high mortality rates. Early recognition and intervention are essential to optimize patient outcomes. Automated detection using electronic medical record (EMR) data can assist this process. This review describes automated sepsis detection using EMR data. PubMed retrieved publications between January 1, 2005 and January 31, 2015. Thirteen studies met study criteria: described an automated detection approach with the potential to detect sepsis or sepsis-related deterioration in real or near-real time; focused on emergency department and hospitalized neonatal, pediatric, or adult patients; and provided performance measures or results indicating the impact of automated sepsis detection. Detection algorithms incorporated systemic inflammatory response and organ dysfunction criteria. Systems in nine studies generated study or care team alerts. Care team alerts did not consistently lead to earlier interventions. Earlier interventions did not consistently translate to improved patient outcomes. Performance measures were inconsistent. Automated sepsis detection is potentially a means to enable early sepsis-related therapy but current performance variability highlights the need for further research.","288":"Parenteral prostacyclin is the most-effective therapy for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Administration is complex, and administration errors are potentially life threatening. Hospital policies to minimize the risk to patients are necessary, but their effectiveness has not been well studied. We quantified the adverse event incident rate per at-risk patient day in a tertiary care hospital with an established parenteral prostacyclin policy. Patients on parenteral prostacyclin including new initiations from January 2003 to January 2013 were identified, encompassing 386 discrete admissions. Reports of adverse events were obtained from the inpatient risk feedback-reporting process and detailed chart review. Policy-divergent events were analyzed both categorically and by the degree of severity. Overall, 153 total policy-divergent events were identified. Data analysis indicated an incident rate of 45.9 per 1,000 patient days. In total, 21 of 153 potential errors reached the patient, translating to an incident rate of 6.3 per 1,000 patient days. Incident rate for \"serious symptomatic\" or \"catastrophic\" policy-divergent events was 3.3 per 1,000 patient days. Even with specific prostacyclin training and administration policy, there remains a small risk of adverse events in hospitalized pulmonary hypertension patients receiving parenteral prostacyclin.","289":"Although variation in-patient outcomes based on hospitals' geographic location has been studied, altitude of hospitals above sea level may also affect patient outcomes. Possibly, because of negative physical and psychological effects of altitude on hospital employees, hospital efficiency may decline at higher altitudes. Greater focus on hospital efficiency, despite decreasing efficiency at higher altitudes, could increase demands on hospital employees and further deteriorate patient outcomes. Using data envelopment analysis on a sample of 840 hospital-year observations representing 95,504 patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the United States, and controlling for patient, hospital, and county characteristics and controlling for hospital, state, and year fixed effects, we find support for the negative association between hospital altitude and efficiency; for 1 percentage point increase in efficiency and every 1,000 feet increase in altitude above the sea level, the mortality of patients with AMI increases by 0.66 percentage points. The findings have implications for hospital performance at increasing geographic elevation and introduces to the literature the notion of \"health economics of elevation,\" to suggest that elevation of a hospital may be an important criterion for consideration for policy makers and insurance firms.","290":"Nurse practitioner (NP) co-management involves an NP and physician sharing responsibility for the care of a patient. This study evaluates the impact of NP co-management for clinically complex patients in a home-based primary care program on hospitalizations, 30-day hospital readmissions, and provider satisfaction. We compared preenrollment and postenrollment hospitalization and 30-day readmission rates of home-bound patients active in the Nurse Practitioner Co-Management Program within the Mount Sinai Visiting Doctors Program (MSVD) (n = 87) between January 1, 2012, and July 1, 2013. Data were collected from electronic medical records. An anonymous online survey was administered to all physicians active in the MSVD in July 2013 (n = 13).After enrollment in co-management, patients have lower annual hospitalization rates (1.26 vs. 2.27, p = .005) and fewer patients have 30-day readmissions (5.8% vs. 17.2%, p = .004). Eight of 13 physicians feel \"much\" or \"somewhat\" less burned out by their work after implementation of co-management. The high level of provider satisfaction and reductions in annual hospitalization and readmission rates among high-risk home-bound patients associated with NP co-management may yield not only benefits for patients, caregivers, and providers but also cost savings for institutions.","291":"Recommendations for the evaluation of quality improvement interventions have been made in order to improve the evidence base of whether, to what extent, and why quality improvement interventions affect chosen outcomes. The purpose of this article is to articulate why these recommendations are appropriate to improve the rigor of quality improvement intervention evaluation as a research endeavor, but inappropriate for the purposes of everyday quality improvement practice. To support our claim, we describe the differences between quality improvement interventions that occur for the purpose of practice as compared to research. We then carefully consider how feasibility, ethics, and the aims of evaluation each impact how quality improvement interventions that occur in practice, as opposed to research, can or should be evaluated. Recommendations that fit the evaluative goals of practice-based quality improvement interventions are needed to support fair appraisal of the distinct evidence they produce. We describe a current debate on the nature of evidence to assist in reenvisioning how quality improvement evidence generated from practice might complement that generated from research, and contribute in a value-added way to the knowledge base.","292":"Occupational injuries and illnesses in healthcare can cause great human suffering, incur high cost, and have an adverse impact on the quality of patient care. One of the most effective solutions for addressing health and safety issues and improving decisions at the point of care rests in raising employees' safety awareness to recognize, avoid, or respond to potential problems before they arise. In this article, the DMAIC Six Sigma model (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) is used as a systematic program to measure, improve, and sustain employees' safety awareness in healthcare organizations. We report on a case study using the model, which was implemented and validated at a local hospital. First, the occupational health and safety knowledge that each job requires was identified. Next, the degree of competence of jobholders to meet these requirements was assessed. Based on the assessment, different awareness-raising efforts were proposed and implemented. The results showed significant improvement in the overall safety awareness compliance assessed: from 74.2% to 84.4% (p &lt; .001) after the intervention. The proposed model ensures that the organization's awareness-raising efforts serve its actual needs and produce optimized and sustained results that eventually lead to safer healthcare service.","293":"Medication use among Canadian seniors is widespread and increases with the number of comorbidities. Limited evidence exists on medication knowledge among seniors, especially in home care. The purpose of this retrospective cohort study was to describe medication knowledge and ability to take medication among seniors admitted to home care in Ontario. Ten percent had little or no knowledge of what medication to take (n = 1,389\/14,004) or an understanding of the purpose of their medications (n = 1,396\/14,004). Increasing numbers of medications prescribed was associated with decreased knowledge of medications. The strongest predictor of limited knowledge and ability to take medication was dementia (odds ratio &gt; 5.0). Among Ontario seniors living at home, knowledge about medications decreases as the number of medications increases. Therefore, this group may be at high risk of medication errors. Better systems are required to allow healthcare professionals to review with patients, any medications with patients and caregivers, to assist in addressing the decreased knowledge of medications. Such a system would provide the capacity to target those individuals at high risk for a medication error, as well as the medications and drug-drug interactions that seem most likely to be harmful among older adults. ","294":"Improving the quality of care delivered by the U.S. health care system is a topic of important policy and political debate. Although public opinion surveys have shown concerns regarding the state of quality of care nationally, the majority of Americans are satisfied with the quality of care they personally receive. Studies have shown that Republicans and Democrats may differ in these views. We used a 2012 national survey of 1,508 American adults that captured perceptions of quality, political party, medical experiences, and self-reported interactions with the health care system due to an illness to examine these differences. Regardless of having a recent illness or hospitalization, Democrats generally expressed greater concerns about the country's state of health care quality relative to Republicans. Partisan differences also emerged when identifying the most important problems contributing to quality-of-care deficiencies in the nation. However, partisan differences were nonexistent on measures related to self-reported experiences with quality of care. Although their individual experiences with quality of care do not differ, Republicans and Democrats differ in their views on national quality-of-care issues. This may have implications for efforts to improve quality of care in the current polarized healthcare environment. ","295":"We created and tested an educational intervention to support implementation of an institution wide QI project (the HEART Pathway) designed to improve care for patients with acute chest pain. Although online learning modules have been shown effective in imparting knowledge regarding QI projects, it is unknown whether these modules are effective across specialties and healthcare professions. Participants, including nurses, advanced practice clinicians, house staff and attending physicians (N = 486), were enrolled into an online, self-directed learning course exploring the key concepts of the HEART Pathway. The module was completed by 97% of enrollees (469\/486) and 90% passed on the first attempt (422\/469). Out of 469 learners, 323 completed the pretest, learning module and posttest in the correct order. Mean test scores across learners improved significantly from 74% to 89% from the pretest to the posttest. Following the intervention, the HEART Pathway was used for 88% of patients presenting to our institution with acute chest pain. Our data demonstrate that this online, self-directed learning module can improve knowledge of the HEART Pathway across specialties-paving the way for more efficient and informed care for acute chest pain patients.","296":"Healthcare waste-the inappropriate use of healthcare resources that provides no benefit to patients yet contributes to cost and even harm-is a potentially significant contributor to high healthcare costs. This project aimed to apply a new locally modified Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI)-developed waste identification tool to measure the prevalence of and reason for the inappropriate use of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, one type of potential waste. Unnecessary days (i.e., waste) and their causes in a 16-bed \"closed\" medical ICU (MICU) and a 10-bed \"semi-closed\" transplant surgical ICU (TSICU) were identified by physicians over a 3-month period. Data on 513 patients admitted to both ICUs for a total of 1,631 patient-days demonstrated that 15% of MICU days and 25.8% of TSICU days were unnecessary. Although causes of waste in each ICU differed, delays in transfer of patients out of the ICU, end-of-life decision-making, and delays in procedures were among the commonest. Determination of waste also varied among physicians, ranging from 4.5% to 27.7% in the MICU and 0%-37.5% in the TSICU. This study found that the IHI waste tool can be effectively used to identify waste in the ICU, which is common and varies based on the ICU type and physician perceptions.","297":null,"298":"This study aims to use lean techniques and evaluate the impact of increasing the use of premixed IV solutions and increased IV production frequency on IV waste. Study was conducted at a tertiary hospital pharmacy department in three phases. Phase I included evaluation of IV waste when IV production occurred three times a day and eight premixed IV products were used. Phase II increased the number of premixed IV products to 16. Phase III then increased IV production to five times a day. During Phase I, an estimate of 2,673 IV doses were wasted monthly, accounting for 6.14% of overall IV doses. This accounted for 688 L that cost $60,135. During Phase II, the average monthly IV wastage reduced significantly to 1,069 doses (2.84%), accounting for 447 L and $34,003. During Phase III, the average monthly IV wastage was further decreased to 675 doses (1.69%), accounting for 78 L and $3,431. Hence, a potential annual saving of $449,208 could result from these changes. IV waste was reduced through the increased use of premixed solutions and increasing IV production frequency. ","299":null,"300":"After more than two decades of research focused on care transition improvement and intervention development, unfavorable outcome measures associated with care transitions across healthcare settings persist. Readmissions rates remain an important outcome to target for intervention, adverse events associated with care transitions continue to be an issue, and patients are often dissatisfied with the quality of their care. Currently, interventions to improve care transitions are disease specific, require substantial financial investments in training allied healthcare professionals, or focus primarily on hospital-based discharge planning with mixed results. This complex situation requires a method of evaluation that can provide a comprehensive, in-depth, and context-driven investigation of potential risks to safe care transitions across healthcare settings, which can lead to the creation of effective, usable, and sustainable interventions. A systems' approach known as Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) evaluates the factors in a system that affect human performance. This article describes how HFE can complement and further strengthen efforts to improve care transitions.","301":"To determine the level of sustainability of rapid response teams (RRTs) among a group of hospitals that participated in a statewide collaborative to implement and sustain RRTs. Fifty-six hospitals located in a southeastern state in the United States participated in a statewide 9-month collaborative that provided organization leaders with resources to implement and sustain RRTs. Thirty-three of these hospitals completed the electronic survey. Two hospitals were excluded because of missing data. The RRT-Institutionalization Scale (RRT-IS), adapted from the Level of Institutionalization Scale, measured the degree of institutionalization (i.e., passages, routines, and niche saturation) across four subsystems: production, maintenance, supportive, and managerial. Thirty-one hospitals participated (response rate 55%). Rapid response team sustainability levels ranged from 1.0 to 5.98 (mean = 3.78, 95% CI = 3.40-4.17). The highest sustainability score was reported in the managerial subsystem (median = 5.3, IQR = 4.5-7.33), and the lowest score was reported in the supportive subsystem (median = 1.0, IQR = 1.0-2.0). Rapid response team sustainability levels varied across hospitals in the collaborative. Different levels of sustainability were also observed across organizational subsystems. The lack of resources, staff, and dedicated funds hampered organizations' sustainability efforts. ","302":"There is evidence that systems-based factors influence surgical outcomes of intraoperative and postoperative morbidity. The goal of this study was to provide an exploratory analysis of systems-based variables and their associations with surgical outcomes in gynecologic oncology patients. We merged electronic records from operating room software with billing claims from major surgeries performed from 2011 to 2013, at a tertiary care academic medical center. Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between baseline demographic and clinical covariates (age, comorbidity, procedure type, and surgeon volume), the main exposure variables (case start time, case order, and personnel handoffs), and the primary outcome of 30-day postoperative complications. Multiple logistic regression models were created to analyze the contributing effect of each systemic variable on postoperative complications. The overall rate of postoperative complications among patients was 31.4% (n = 182). Although traditional risk factors of comorbidity, procedure type, and case length were the strongest primary drivers of complication risk, there was a significant relationship between handoffs among surgical scrub technicians and postoperative complications (odds ratio: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.00-4.47). As a novel finding in surgical quality and safety research, this supports greater efforts into integrating key staffing information into studies of systemic variables and surgical outcomes.","303":"Despite federal laws that mandate equal access and communication in all healthcare settings for deaf people, consistent provision of quality interpreting in healthcare settings is still not a reality, as recognized by deaf people and American Sign Language (ASL)-English interpreters. The purpose of this study was to better understand the work of ASL interpreters employed in healthcare settings, which can then inform on training and credentialing of interpreters, with the ultimate aim of improving the quality of healthcare and communication access for deaf people. Based on job analysis, researchers designed an online survey with 167 task statements representing 44 categories. American Sign Language interpreters (N = 339) rated the importance of, and frequency with which they performed, each of the 167 tasks. Categories with the highest average importance ratings included language and interpreting, situation assessment, ethical and professional decision making, manage the discourse, monitor, manage and\/or coordinate appointments. Categories with the highest average frequency ratings included the following: dress appropriately, adapt to a variety of physical settings and locations, adapt to working with variety of providers in variety of roles, deal with uncertain and unpredictable work situations, and demonstrate cultural adaptability. To achieve health equity for the deaf community, the training and credentialing of interpreters needs to be systematically addressed.","304":"Communication breakdown is viewed as a significant contributor to preventable patient harm. Interprofessional rounding (IPR) is one method of communication supporting the evidenced-based care delivery. The purpose of this paper is to explore the benefits of IPR for patients, clinicians, and the healthcare system. Interprofessional rounding supports collaboration, discussion, and timely intervention to prevent miscommunication leading to adverse patient events. Adherence to evidence-based care suggests a positive impact on patient, process, and financial outcomes. Statistically significant IPR-related improvements are seen in reducing mortality, lengths of stay, medication errors, and hospitalization costs as well as improved staff and patient satisfaction. One IPR-related gap in the literature is integrative care delivery, a strategy that provides a unified plan to meet the complex needs of patients and produce optimal outcomes. Activation and standardization with active participation in IPR support a collaborative integration of care. Embracing IPR and advocating for collaboration across the care continuum is a crucial process in preventing adverse events. Integrated care delivery through IPR provides a unified plan to meet the complex needs of patients, prevent harm, and produce best possible outcomes. ","305":"Reducing readmissions after orthopedic surgery is important for decreasing hospital costs and patient morbidity. Our goals were to establish national rates and reasons for 30-day readmissions after common elective orthopedic procedures. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, posterior lumbar fusion, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, or total shoulder arthroplasty were identified from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. Thirty-day readmission rates, timing, and reasons were recorded for each procedure. Multivariate analysis was used to identify risk factors of readmissions. A total of 3.8% of patients had an all-cause readmission, 3.6% had an unplanned readmission, and 2.4% had an unplanned readmission related to surgery (URRS). The most common reason was surgical site complication followed by venous thromboembolism and bleeding. Only 3.2% of all patients with a URRS were readmitted because of a predischarge complication. Independent predictors of URRS were current smoking, any inpatient complication, and non-home discharge. Unplanned readmissions were a proxy for new postdischarge complications rather than a re-exacerbation of previous inpatient events. Emphasis should be on more effective prevention strategies for surgical site infections, continuing to prevent inpatient complications and focusing on home discharge. ","306":"Recent policies call for healthcare organizations to consistently document patients' disability status for the purpose of tracking the quality of care experienced by patients with disabilities. The purpose of the study was to explore patients' attitudes toward healthcare organizations collecting disability status. We surveyed a convenience sample of patients in three outpatient clinics, including primary care and rehabilitation clinics. A total of 303 patients participated; 49% self-identified as disabled, 59% were female and the mean age was 52 years. The majority of participants (88%) either agreed or strongly agreed that it is important for healthcare organizations to collect information about disabilities; 77% stated that they were comfortable or very comfortable with healthcare organizations collecting this information. By contrast, we found that almost a quarter of participants had concerns with front desk staff collecting disability status information. When we presented disability questions endorsed by the Health and Human Services Department, over a quarter of participants (28%) felt that the questions were not inclusive of all disability categories. Although patients are supportive of healthcare organizations collecting disability status information, concerns exist regarding how the information is collected and which categories are included, suggesting the need for continued development of evidence-based, patient-centered methods and questions.","307":null,"308":"There is growing appreciation that significant improvements in healthcare quality cannot be achieved by organizations working in isolation. To that end, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q) initiative provides multistakeholder alliances-groups of payers, purchasers, providers, and consumers that work together-with funding and technical assistance to improve healthcare community wide. Reducing readmissions was one of the several AF4Q goals. Alliances crafted their own interventions, tailored to address the communities' unique needs, and took advantage of local resources. Our objective was to determine whether readmission rates declined more in AF4Q communities than in non-AF4Q communities by year 7 of the 10-year initiative. We conducted a quasiexperimental study using zip code-level demographics and 30-day readmission rates for all medical and surgical discharges using Medicare claims data for 2008 through 2012. This interim analysis found that AF4Q was not associated with significant reductions in medical or surgical readmissions, suggesting that AF4Q's multistakeholder approach was no more effective at reducing readmissions than other national efforts, such as the Hospital Reduction Program under the Affordable Care Act.","309":"Utilization of pharmacologic venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients seems to be suboptimal with reported rates as low as 50% in some studies. Implementation of an electronic alert system seems to be an effective tool for increasing VTE prophylaxis rates in medical inpatients. To date, no studies have assessed whether this approach is associated with improved rates of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis specifically in IBD patients. To determine the efficacy of an electronic alert in improving VTE prophylaxis rates in hospitalized IBD patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 576 hospitalized IBD patients. The medical record of each patient was then examined to determine whether pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis was both ordered and administered, the timing of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, and reasons for any missed doses. The VTE pharmacologic prophylaxis rate was improved from 60% to 81.2% following the implementation of the electronic alert system (p &lt; .001). An increase in prophylaxis rates was seen in both medical (26.3% vs. 62.8%, p &lt; .001) and surgical services (83.7% vs. 95.5%, p &lt; .001). In patients who received pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, 16% of all ordered doses were not administered and 57.3% of missed doses were the result of patient refusal. Hospitalization after implementation of the electronic alert system (odds ratio [OR] 4.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.94-7.57) and admission to a surgical service (OR 14.3, 95% CI 8.62-24.39) were predictive of VTE pharmacologic prophylaxis orders. The introduction of an electronic alert system was associated with a significant increase in rates of pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis. However, orders were often delayed and doses not always administered. The most common reason that ordered doses were not given was patient refusal. ","310":"This study examined whether self-reported, facility-based data validation practices for claims submissions of cases flagged as Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) match professional and regulatory standards. The National Association of Healthcare Quality members who work in an inpatient setting were invited to complete an anonymous survey to self-report their practices around facility-based data validation of PSI cases. The authors found widespread variation in how PSI administrative data are internally validated; inconsistency in the education and training required of staff who participate in this process; and relatively poor compliance with physician query guidelines and documentation amendment standards. The self-described wide variation and nonadherence to professional and regulatory standards within the facility-based validation process for PSIs raise concerns about the use of these data to make meaningful judgments about quality and safety. The authors recommend a standardized approach to reporting and validation be implemented for use of PSIs in public reporting and pay-for-performance programs. ","311":"Clinical schedules drive resource utilization, cost, and patient wait time. Accurate appointment duration allocation ensures appropriate staffing ratios to daily caseloads and maximizes scarce resources. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) infusion appointment duration is adjusted by regimen using a consensus method of experts including pharmacists, nurses, and administrators. Using real-time location system (RTLS), we examined the accuracy of observed appointment duration compared with the scheduled duration. Appointment duration was calculated using RTLS at DFCI between August 1, 2013, and September 30, 2013. Duration was defined as the total time a patient occupied an infusion chair. The top 10 administered infusion regimens were investigated (n = 805). Median observed appointment durations were statistically different than the scheduled durations. Appointment durations were shorter than scheduled 98% (C), 95% (I), and 75% (F) of the time and longer than scheduled 77% (A) and 76% (G) of the time. Fifty-six percent of the longer than scheduled (A) appointments were at least 30 minute longer. RTLS provides reliable and unbiased data to improve schedule accuracy. Replacing consensus with system-based data may improve clinic flow, relieve staff stress, and increase patient satisfaction. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate factors that impact variation in appointment duration.

Prospective observational work sampling design. Tertiary care academic Children's Hospital Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Multidisciplinary PICU teams. None. Intensive care unit rounds were observed as part of an initiative to improve efficiency over a 2-month period. The number of observations required was determined by Neibel's work sampling method. Rounds were broken into various constituent events and then later classified as \"value-added\/essential,\" \"value-added\/nonessential,\" and \"nonessential\" based on whether the observed event was essential to the core mission of PICU rounds. The mean time spent per patient for all observed teams was 17.9 min (SD 1.3 min). Teams spent 64% of their time doing value-added\/essential tasks (11.2 min, SD 2.2 min) and 13% of their time doing value-added\/nonessential tasks (2.4 min, SD 0.9 min). Teams spent 23% of their time on non-value-added activities (4.1 min, SD 2.3 min). The top three non-value-added activities conducted during rounds were travel, waiting, and interruptions regarding care of other patients. Given the consistency of time spent on value-added activities among attendings, these non-value-added activities might explain the significant variability observed among attendings in total time spent rounding. This was an observational study to characterize the activities that occur during the course of a routine PICU work rounds. Although there was significant consistency in the time spent per patient in value-added activities, there was significant disparity in time spent on nonessential activities, such as travel and waiting. A dedicated attempt to reduce time spent on nonessential activities can substantially reduce rounding times and improve the efficiency and value of rounds. ","313":"Operating rooms (ORs) are costly to run, and multiple factors influence efficiency. The first case on-time start (FCOS) of an OR is viewed as a harbinger of efficiency for the daily schedule. Across 26 ORs of a large, academic medical center, only 49% of cases started on time in October 2011. The Perioperative Services Department engaged an interdisciplinary Operating Room Committee to apply Six Sigma tools to this problem. The steps of this project included (1) problem mapping, (2) process improvements to preoperative readiness, (3) informatics support improvements, and (4) continuous measurement and feedback. By June 2013, there was a peak of 92% first case on-time starts across service lines, decreasing to 78% through 2014, still significantly above the preintervention level of 49% (p = .000). Delay minutes also significantly decreased through the study period (p = .000). Across 2013, the most common delay owners were the patient, the surgeon, the facility, and the anesthesia department. Continuous and sustained improvement of first case on-time starts is attributed to tracking the FCOS metric, establishing embedded process improvement resources and creating transparency of data.

However, to improve population health performance, it is necessary to leverage relevant data and information using new technology solutions, such as pervasive diabetes mobile technology solution of Inet International Inc., which offers the potential to facilitate patient empowerment with gestational diabetic care. Hence, this article examines the pilot study outcomes of a small clinical trial focusing on pregnant patients affected by gestational diabetes mellitus, in an Australian not for profit healthcare context. The aims include establishing proof of concept and also assessing the usability, acceptability, and functionality of this mobile solution and thereby generate hypotheses to be tested in a large-scale confirmatory clinical trial. ","318":"The National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, an organization cofounded by the American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has set an aggressive goal to achieve an 80% colon cancer screening rate by the year 2018 to reduce the burden of colon cancer in the United States. This goal is in alignment with the primary care movement to focus on prevention and population health. However, colon cancer screening has been proven as an especially challenging preventive measure to get traction on with patients. Oakland Family Medicine, a medium primary care practice in Maine, has engaged in a quality improvement project to increase the colon cancer screening rates from 28%, when the project started, to 80.3%. To achieve these results, it required a redesign of the primary care team, including the use of team extenders like community health workers. In addition, it requires understanding the data and its flaws, knowing the workflow and working to simplify it, and finally, to be clear what problem you are trying to solve. The Oakland Family Medicine project shows that closing the gaps in care for colon cancer screening is not only possible but that the new national goal is attainable also. ","319":"This study is a systematic review of a national sample of hospital-led population health programs in place at essential hospitals and academic medical centers in the US from 2012 to 2014. We conducted a content analysis of abstracts describing 121 population health initiatives to understand how hospital leaders are translating population health objectives into action. Intended patient population, services provided, and outcomes measured are described. The programs' relationship to an adapted conceptual model of population health as part of a culture of health was assessed. Nearly all programs in the study were hybrids, in that they possessed features belonging to each of the model's two program types (healthcare system and health community system). The majority were focused on patients already attributed to a particular hospital system, but many involved partnerships with community-based or social service resources. This finding reflects the missions of essential hospitals and academic medical centers to improve the lives and care of patients, while recognizing the fundamental need to improve the health of the broader population. ","320":"","321":"","322":"Spirometry performed in the ambulatory setting is an invaluable tool for diagnosis, monitoring, and evaluation of respiratory health in patients with chronic lung disease. If spirometry is not performed according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, unnecessary repeated testing, increased expenditure of time and money, and increased patient and family anxiety may result. Two respiratory therapists at Mission Health System in Asheville, NC, identified an increase in patients arriving at the pulmonary function testing (PFT) laboratories with abnormal spirometry results obtained in the ambulatory setting. These abnormal results were due to incorrect testing procedure, not chronic lung disease. Three training methods were developed to increase knowledge of correct spirometry testing procedure in the ambulatory setting. The therapists also created a plan to educate offices that do not perform spirometry on the importance and availability of PFT services at our hospital for the population of patients with chronic lung disease. Notable improvements in posttraining test results were demonstrated. The education process was evaluated by a leading respiratory expert, with improvements suggested and implemented. Next steps are listed. ","323":"Patient safety continues to be a national challenge not only for providers but for patients and families as well. In an attempt to standardize processes and systems, we have lost opportunities for improvement. For instance, current patient safety reporting systems tend to favor capturing details around events that are classified as highly clinically significant (i.e., sentinel-level and never events); yet little to no effort is spent on capturing information about less evident errors or near misses, nor simply about concerns that are more experiential in nature. As a result, patients' experiences and observations are relegated to the notion of satisfaction, real-time reporting remains illusive, and the ability to learn across incidents remains anecdotal rather than systematic. Herein we propose an alternative, real-time, innovative model that merges syndromic surveillance and patient engagement to embrace patient-initiated reporting of patient safety events and concerns. The result would be a patient safety system where patients are partners, in both the conduct of their care, and in the quality of the healthcare delivered. ","324":"Hospitalized adult Medicaid recipients with chronic disease are at risk for rehospitalization within 90 days of discharge, but most research has focused on the Medicare population. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of population-based care management intensity on inpatient readmissions in Medicaid adults with pre-existing chronic disease. Retrospective analyses of 2,868 index hospital admissions from 2012 New York State Medicaid Data Warehouse claims compared 90-day post-discharge utilization in populations with and without transitional care management interventions. High intensity managed care organization interventions were associated with higher outpatient and lower emergency department post-discharge utilization than low intensity fee-for-service management. However, readmission rates were higher for the managed care cases. Shorter time to readmission was associated with managed care, diagnoses that include heart and kidney failure, shorter length of stay for index hospitalization, and male sex; with no relationship to age. This unexpected result flags the need to re-evaluate readmission as a quality indicator in the complex Medicaid population. Quality improvement efforts should focus on care continuity during transitions and consider population-specific factors that influence readmission. Optimum post-discharge utilization in the Medicaid population requires a balance between outpatient, emergency and inpatient services to improve access and continuity. ","325":"","326":"Health information technology is increasingly utilized within healthcare delivery systems today. Two examples of this type of technology include the capture of patient-specific information within an electronic health record and intravenous medication infusion devices equipped with dose error reduction software known as drug libraries. Automatic integration of these systems, termed intravenous (IV) interoperability, should serve as the goal toward which all healthcare systems work to maximize patient safety. For institutions lacking IV interoperability, we describe a manual approach of querying the electronic health record to incorporate medication administration information with data from infusion device software to optimize drug library settings. This approach serves to maximize utilization of available information to optimize medication safety provided by drug library software.","327":"We assessed if use of an online clinical decision support tool improved standardization and quality of care in hospitalized patients with lower extremity cellulitis (LEC). This was a 14-month preintervention and postintervention study of 85 LEC admissions. There was significantly higher usage of the online LEC care process model (CPM) in the postintervention phase (p &lt; .001). There was a trend toward higher rates of appropriate antibiotic regimen in the postintervention group both initially and at discharge (p = .063 for both). A sensitivity analysis of CPM users versus nonusers demonstrated a significantly higher rate of appropriate initial antibiotics prescribed when the CPM was used (p &lt; .001). Use of this online CPM was associated with improved standardization, as demonstrated by increased ordering of an appropriate initial antibiotic regimen for hospitalized patients with LEC.","328":"What is the complication rate for Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) performing fluoroscopic guided lumbar epidural steroid injections (LESIs)? CRNA pain practitioners responded to questionnaires regarding their education level, experience, and practice locations. Participants also collected data on number of fluoroscopic guided LESIs performed and each of 20 complications for a 6-month period, and answered a poll regarding satisfaction with the data collection process. Participants represented urban (23%) and rural (77%) practices; as well as office\/clinic (31%) hospital (62%) and mixed (7%) practice settings. Both Masters (62%) and Doctoral prepared (38%) CRNAs participated. Their experience in performing fluoroscopic guided LESIs ranged from 1 to 17 years and 50 to 12,000 procedures. Rate of occurrence for each complication was below 1%. Participants had higher rates of bruising and vasovagal reactions than other complications. No paralysis or death occurred. Neither practice setting nor experience level was related to complication rates. Participants expressed interest in participating in additional studies of complication rates. CRNAs were able to safely and effectively perform fluoroscopic guided LESIs with complication rates similar to physician rates cited in the literature. Additional study of definitions of complications and CRNA complication rates for other pain management procedures is recommended. ","329":"The Department of Rehabilitation Services, within the University of Maryland Medical Center's 650-bed academic medical center, was experiencing difficulty in meeting productivity standards. Therapists in the outpatient division believed they were not spending enough time performing billable patient care activities. Therapists in the inpatient division had difficulty keeping pace with the volume of incoming referrals. Collectively, these issues caused dissatisfaction among referral sources and frustration among the staff within the rehabilitation department. The department undertook a phased approach to address these issues that included examining the evidence, using Lean process improvement principles, and employing transformational leadership strategies to drive improvements in productivity and efficiency. The lessons learned support the importance of having meaningful metrics appropriate for the patient population served, the use of Lean as an effective tool for improving productivity in rehabilitation departments, the impact of engaging staff at the grassroots level, and the importance of having commitment from leaders. The study findings have implications for not only rehabilitation and hospital leadership, but CEOs and managers of any business who need to eliminate waste or increase staff productivity.","330":"This article presents an evaluation of a multifaceted fall prevention initiative. The main element of this initiative was the creation and implementation of a Falls Wheel--a visual communication tool of a patient's fall injury risk for all care team members placed on every patient door throughout the health system. The Falls Wheel allows for patient categorization along two dimensions simultaneously: risk of fall and risk of injury from a fall. During the yearlong implementation, the rate of falls with harm dropped by almost 50%. A process audit revealed that there was high fidelity to the intervention components, including displaying the wheel correctly 95% of the time, and the Falls Wheel was updated to match the risk level in the electronic health record 70% of the time. The goal of this article was to share the experience of one health system and encourage others to adopt and rigorously test the Falls Wheel. Replication and extension of this program at other hospitals and health systems will enable staff and empower patients to reduce falls with harm and their unintended consequences.","331":"The Minimizing Error, Maximizing Outcome (MEMO) study of clinics in New York City, Chicago, and Wisconsin linked primary care work experiences to physician stress. We analyzed MEMO data to determine how chaos in the clinic was associated with work conditions and quality of care measures. Surveys and medical record audits determined practice characteristics and medical errors, respectively. Physicians rated clinic atmosphere on a scale of 1 (calm) to 5 (chaotic). Chaotic clinics were defined as practices rated either 4 or 5 by greater than 50% of clinic physicians. Forty of 112 MEMO clinics (36%) were chaotic. Compared with nonchaotic practices, these clinics served more minority and Medicaid patients and had a greater likelihood of clinic bottlenecks such as phone access (both p &lt; .01). Physicians in chaotic clinics reported lower work control and job satisfaction, less emphasis on teamwork and professionalism, more stress and burnout, and a higher likelihood of leaving the practice within 2 years (all p &lt; .05). Chaotic clinics had higher rates of medical errors and more missed opportunities to provide preventative services (both p &lt; .05). More research should examine the effectiveness of organizational interventions to decrease chaos in the clinic and to mitigate its effects on patient safety.","332":"While use of robotic-assisted surgery has increased rapidly, little is known about the attitudes and beliefs of practicing gynecologists regarding the utility of the technology. We surveyed a large sample of gynecologists to examine their attitudes and beliefs about the benefits, utility, and factors driving use of robotic-assisted gynecologic surgery. A 51-item survey was mailed to 600 fellows or junior fellows of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The survey included questions on use of robotic surgery, decision-making, and beliefs regarding the technology. Responses were stratified based on whether the respondent used robotic surgery or not. A total of 310 responses were received including 27.8% who used robotic surgery in their practices. Hysterectomy was the most commonly performed procedure. Opinions about the use and effectiveness of robotic procedures varied based on whether an individual was a robot user. Eighty-two percentage of robot users and 21% of nonrobot users believed robotic surgery provided benefits over laparoscopic (p &lt; .0001). Among both groups, the ability to increase access to minimally invasive surgery and marketing were believed to be the greatest drivers of use of robotic surgery. Attitudes and beliefs about the effectiveness of robotic gynecologic surgery are highly variable among clinicians.","333":"The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Inpatient Quality Indicators (IQIs) include inpatient mortality for selected procedures and medical conditions. They have assumed an increasingly prominent role in hospital comparisons. Healthcare delivery and policy-related decisions need to be driven by reliable research that shows associations between hospital characteristics and quality of inpatient care delivered. To systematically review the literature on associations between hospital characteristics and IQIs. We systematically searched PubMed and gray literature (2000-2012) for studies relevant to 14 hospital characteristics and 17 IQIs. We extracted data for study characteristics, IQIs analyzed, and hospital characteristics (e.g., teaching status, bed size, patient volume, rural vs. urban location, and nurse staffing). We included 16 studies, which showed few significant associations. Four hospital characteristics (higher hospital volume, higher nurse staffing, urban vs. rural status, and higher hospital financial resources) had statistically significant associations with lower mortality and selected IQIs in approximately half of the studies. For example, there were no associations between nurse staffing and four IQIs; however, approximately 50% of studies showed a statistically significant relationship between nurse staffing and lower mortality for six IQIs. For two hospital characteristics-higher bed size and disproportionate share percentage-all statistically significant associations had higher mortality. Five hospital characteristics (teaching status, system affiliation, ownership, minority-serving hospitals, and electronic health record status) had some studies with significantly positive and some with significantly negative associations, and many studies with no association. We found few associations between hospital characteristics and mortality IQIs. Differences in study methodology, coding across hospitals, and hospital case-mix adjustment may partly explain these results. Ongoing research will evaluate potential mechanisms for the identified associations. ","334":"Transforming Care at the Bedside (TCAB) is a program designed by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to engage frontline staff in change processes to improve the work environment and patient care on nursing units. Originally designed and piloted in a small number of hospitals, TCAB is being disseminated through large-scale quality improvement (QI) collaboratives facilitated by professional organizations, such the New Jersey Hospital Association's Institute for Quality and Patient Safety (NJHA). This article presents the results of an evaluation of the NJHA dissemination effort. The evaluation team used an observational mixed-method evaluation design and multiple data sources to assess implementation of TCAB by nursing units in these facilities. The results show that most of the participating units successfully implemented the TCAB improvement processes. Nursing teamwork and three nursing-sensitive outcomes improved significantly over the course of TCAB, and TCAB unit managers attributed important improvements to their unit's participation. These findings suggest that TCAB is a viable mechanism for engaging frontline nursing staff in valuable QI activities. Other hospitals interested in furthering the culture and capacity for QI among frontline nursing unit staff should consider a TCAB collaborative for achieving these goals.","335":null,"336":"Depression reduces quality of life for nursing home (NH) residents and places them at greater risk for disability, medical morbidity, and mortality. However, accumulating evidence suggests that interventions for early detection and treatment can mitigate symptoms of clinical and subclinical levels of depression. The Promoting Positive Well-Being (PPW) program is a quality improvement (QI) intervention that features tools and strategies to assist NHs in early identification, assessment, treatment, and monitoring of residents with depressive symptoms. The PPW was evaluated in 40 NHs through an 8-month QI collaborative that provided participants with tools, webinar training, and technical support. Results showed a significant group by time interaction effect with facility quality rating as a covariate; the active group (n = 18 NHs) outperformed the waitlist control group (n = 19 NHs). In all, there was a 58% relative reduction in the percentage of residents with self-reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. Most NHs reported that they were satisfied with the collaborative (97%) and would recommend it to others (86%); only 15% reported significant challenges. The rate of webinar attendance and data submission compliance was 92%. Results suggest that PPW is a promising approach that should be further evaluated in larger NH initiatives and other settings.","337":"With the advent of effective treatments for hepatitis C virus (HCV), it has become a public health priority to increase the identification of HCV carriers and link them to systems of care. As a result, in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that all adults born between 1945 and 1965 should receive one-time testing for HCV. In response to this mandate, we sought an effective nonintrusive means to increase HCV screening rates in our busy primary care practices. We designed an HCV testing decision support module that was integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) and triggered an automatic test order for eligible patients at the time of visit. Rates of HCV screening for eligible patients were measured before and after implementation. Hepatitis C virus screening rates increased by 254% after implementation of this tool. Incorporating a clinical reminder into the EHR effectively and appropriately increased the hepatitis C testing rates among primary care patients with no previous testing. Such tools can be an effective means to operationalize health system-wide testing efforts. ","338":"Applying a log-logistic accelerated failure time mixed effects model to a sample of 95,504 in-hospital patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) between 2005 and 2010 in the United States, we measured the relative contribution of hospitals (vs. patients) in explaining in-hospital AMI mortality. Before adjusting for age, race, income, 29 comorbidities of AMI patients, and primary payer, hospital characteristics explained 19.93% of the variance in AMI in-hospital mortality. After controlling for these, variance explained declined by 5.65%, to 14.28%. These findings have implications for policymakers in assessing hospitals' \"responsibility\" for AMI patient mortality, for hospitals in allocating resources toward improving AMI patient care, and for medical intermediaries in making liability judgments and payment allocations to hospitals. ","339":"Glycemic control in hospitalized patients is challenging but important for optimal outcomes. Insulin dosing through carbohydrate counting may address patient, provider, and institutional factors that complicate hospital glycemic management. On two surgical units at a tertiary care teaching hospital, we pilot tested postmeal insulin dosing based on carbohydrate counting (plus basal insulin) rather than the current process of ordering scheduled premeal insulin without knowledge of the patient's consumption. Analysis assessed hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, insulin orders, and nurse and provider satisfaction and confidence. On general surgery, mean glucose level improved from 188 to 137 mg\/dl (p &lt; .001). On cardiovascular surgery, mean glucose improved only mildly from 177 to 175 mg\/dl (p &lt; .28). No hypoglycemia was reported. Efficiency of mealtime insulin dosing improved through reduced average number of insulin orders per meal from 1.1 to 0.09. Process satisfaction improved for providers (preintervention, 60%; postintervention, 100%), general surgery nurses (preintervention, 72%; postintervention, 100%), and cardiovascular surgery nurses (preintervention, 69%; postintervention, 84%). Confidence in insulin dose accuracy improved for providers (preintervention, 50%; postintervention, 100%), general surgery nurses (preintervention, 59%; postintervention, 100%), and cardiovascular surgery nurses (preintervention, 48%; postintervention, 84%). Carbohydrate counting is effective and efficient and improved staff satisfaction and confidence in hospital mealtime insulin dosing. ","340":"Despite venous thromboembolism (VTE) policy initiatives, gaps exist between guidelines and practice. In response, hospitals implement clinical decision support (CDS) systems to improve VTE prophylaxis. To assess the impact of a VTE CDS on reducing incidence of VTE, this study used a pretest\/posttest, longitudinal, cohort design incorporating electronic health record (EHR) data from one urban tertiary and level 1 trauma center, and one suburban hospital. VTE CDS was embedded into the EHR system. The study included 45,046 admissions; 171,753 patient days; and 110 VTE events. The VTE rate declined from 0.954 per 1,000 patient days to 0.434 comparing baseline to full VTE CDS. Compared to baseline, patients benefitting from VTE CDS were 35% less likely to have a VTE. VTE CDS utilization achieved 78.4% patients assessed within 24 hr from admission, 64.0% patients identified at risk, and 47.7% patients at risk for VTE with an initiated VTE interdisciplinary plan of care. CDS systems with embedded algorithms, alerts, and notification capabilities enable physicians at the point of care to utilize guidelines and make impactful decisions to prevent VTE. This study demonstrates a phased-in implementation of VTE CDS as an effective approach toward VTE prevention. Implications for future research and quality improvement are discussed as well. ","341":"The care coordination program described here evolved from 5 years of trial and learning related to how to best serve our high-cost, high-utilizing, chronically ill, urban core patient population. In addition to medical complexity, they have daily challenges characteristic of persons served by Safety-Net health systems. Many have unstable health insurance status. Others have insecure housing. A number of patients have a history of substance use and mental illness. Many have fractured social supports. Although some of the best-known care transition models have been successful in reducing rehospitalizations and cost among patients studied, these models were developed for a relatively high functioning patient population with social support. We describe a successful approach targeted at working with patients who require a more intense and lengthy care coordination intervention to self-manage and reduce the cost of caring for their medical conditions. Using a diverse team and a set of replicable processes, we have demonstrated statistically significant reduction in the use of hospital and emergency services. Our intervention leverages the strengths and resilience of patients, focuses on trust and self-management, and targets heterogeneous \"high-utilizer\" patients with medical and social complexity.

An important factor affecting transfusion practice is recognition of the importance of teams in cardiac surgery care delivery. This article reports an evidenced-based practice (EBP) initiative constructed using the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) 2011 Blood Conservation Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) to standardize transfusion practice across the cardiac surgery team at a large academic medical center. Project outcomes included: a) Improvement in clinician knowledge related to the STS Blood Conservation CPGs; and b) Decreased blood product utilization for patients undergoing cardiac surgical procedures. Participants' scores reflected an improvement in the overall knowledge of the STS CPGs noting a 31.1% (p = 0.012) increase in the number of participants whose practice reflected the Blood Conservation CPGs post intervention. Additionally, there was a reduction in overall blood product utilization for all patients undergoing cardiac surgery procedures post intervention (p = 0.005). Interdisciplinary education based on the STS Blood Conservation CPGs is an effective way to reduce transfusion practice variability and decrease utilization of blood products during cardiac surgery.","344":"In 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released revised recommendations for routinization of HIV testing in healthcare settings. Health professionals have been challenged to incorporate these guidelines. In March 2013, a routine HIV testing initiative was launched at a large urban academic medical center in a high prevalence region. The goal was to routinize HIV testing by achieving a 75% offer and 75% acceptance rate and promoting linkage to care in the inpatient setting. A systematic six-step organizational change process included stakeholder buy-in, identification of an interdisciplinary leadership team, infrastructure development, staff education, implementation, and continuous quality improvement. Success was measured by monitoring the percentage of offered and accepted HIV tests from March to December 2013. The targeted offer rate was exceeded consistently once nurses became part of the consent process (September 2013). Fifteen persons were newly diagnosed with HIV. Seventy-eight persons were identified as previously diagnosed with HIV, but not engaged in care. Through this process, patients who may have remained undiagnosed or out-of-care were identified and linked to care. The authors propose that this process can be replicated in other settings. Increasing identification and treatment will improve the individual patient's health and reduce community disease burden.","345":"Evidence indicates that the largest volume of hospital readmissions occurs among patients with preexisting chronic conditions. Identifying these patients can improve the way hospital care is delivered and prioritize the allocation of interventions. In this retrospective study, we identify factors associated with readmission within 30 days based on claims and administrative data of nine hospitals from 2005 to 2012. We present a data inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify potentially preventable readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazards extension are used to estimate the readmission risk for 4 chronic conditions (congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], acute myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes) and pneumonia, known to be related to high readmission rates. Accumulated number of admissions and discharge disposition were identified to be significant factors across most disease groups. Larger odds of readmission were associated with higher severity index for CHF and COPD patients. Different chronic conditions are associated with different patient and case severity factors, suggesting that further studies in readmission should consider studying conditions separately.","346":"Despite an unprecedented urgency to control healthcare costs while simultaneously improving quality, there are many barriers to investing in quality improvement. Traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models fail to reward providers whose improved processes lead to decreases in billable clinical activity. In addition, providers may lack the necessary skills for improvement, or the organizational infrastructure to conduct these activities. Insurance firms lack incentives to invest in healthcare delivery system improvements that lead to benefits for all patients, even those covered by competitors. In this article, we describe a novel program in its sixth year of existence that funds ambulatory care improvements through a collaborative partnership between a local academic healthcare delivery system and an insurance firm. The program is designed as a competitive grant program and the payer and healthcare organization jointly benefit from completed improvement projects. Factors contributing to the ongoing success of the program and lessons learned are discussed in order to inform the potential development of similar programs in other markets. ","347":"To assess nonclinical factors delaying hospital discharge of guardianship patients. Utilization review data over 3 years. Retrospective cohort study. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare patients' medically unnecessary days (MUD) of hospitalization with additional subcategories of delays-defined as beyond clinicians' control. Overall median number of MUD was 19.5; 14 of 48 patients were additionally delayed while awaiting long-term care Medicaid approval (N = 7, 50%), pending insurance (N = 3, 21%), social or transportation difficulties (N = 3, 21%), or preadmission review (N = 1, 7%). The median number of MUD for the 14 delayed patients was 63, a difference of 53 days compared with the routine guardianship cohort (P &lt; .0001) and $5.5M in net revenue opportunity. Nonclinical discharge delays for guardianship patients are costly and potentially unavoidable. Further exploration into policy change is therefore recommended. ","348":"Quality improvement research skills are not commonplace among quality improvement practitioners, and research on the effectiveness of quality improvement has not always kept pace with improvement innovation. However, the Lean tools applied to quality improvement should be equally relevant to the advancement of quality improvement research. We applied the Lean methods to develop a simplified quality improvement publication pathway enabling a small research methodology group to increase quality improvement research throughout the institution. The key innovations of the pathway are horizontal integration of the quality improvement research methods group across the institution, implementation of a Lean quality improvement research pathway, and application of a just-in-time quality improvement research toolkit. This work provides a road map and tools for the acceleration of quality improvement research. At our institution, the Lean quality improvement research approach was associated with statistically significant increases in the number (annual mean increase from 3.0 to 8.5, p = .03) and breadth of published quality improvement research articles, and in the number of quality improvement research projects currently in process. Application of Lean methods to the quality improvement research process can aid in increasing publication of quality improvement articles from across the institution. ","349":"Accuracy in scheduling complex procedures is improved through technology to aid nonmedically trained allied health professionals. We used a new computer technology to assess whether a single coordinator could schedule endoscopic procedures across sites of a multisite academic medical institution, thus improving efficiency within the clinic overall. A multidisciplinary team designed a cross-site scheduling model. The first phase involved accurately identifying those procedures that were appropriate for nontrained coordinators to schedule. A pilot study with gastroenterology staff was implemented and evaluated and then rolled out to non-gastroenterology staff. A significant decrease in call volumes occurred which in turn led to a decrease from &gt;100 to 38 seconds in average speed to answer (ASA). A total of 115 hours of manpower was saved with the efficiency of being able to schedule without the need for a second coordinator. Efficiencies in call volume and ASA led to substantial time and money savings. Because of the continued involvement of multiple work groups, changes were seen as favorable rather than burdensome. Such technology could be used across other disciplines where routine procedures or tests require specific scheduling knowledge. ","350":"Current race\/ethnicity categories established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget are neither reliable nor valid for understanding health disparities or for tracking improvements in this area. In Hawaii, statewide hospitals have collaborated to collect race\/ethnicity data using a standardized method consistent with recommended practices that overcome the problems with the federal categories. The purpose of this observational study was to determine the impact of this collaboration on key measures of race\/ethnicity documentation. After this collaborative effort, the number of standardized categories available across hospitals increased from 6 to 34, and the percent of inpatients with documented race\/ethnicity increased from 88 to 96%. This improved standardized methodology is now the foundation for tracking population health indicators statewide and focusing quality improvement efforts. The approach used in Hawaii can serve as a model for other states and regions. Ultimately, the ability to standardize data collection methodology across states and regions will be needed to track improvements nationally.","351":"Communication practices around interhospital transfer have not been rigorously assessed in adult medicine patients. Furthermore, the clinical implications of such practices have not been reported. This case-control study was designed to assess the quality of communication between clinicians during interhospital transfer and to determine if posttransfer adverse events (PTAEs) are associated with suboptimal communication. Cases included patients transferred to a Medicine Hospitalist Service from an outside hospital who subsequently experienced a PTAE, defined as unplanned transfer to an intensive care unit or death within 24 hours of transfer. Control patients also underwent interhospital transfer but did not experience a PTAE. A blinded investigator retrospectively reviewed the recorded pretransfer phone conversations between sending and receiving clinicians for adherence to a set of 13 empiric best practice communication elements. The primary outcome was the mean communication score, on a scale of 0-13. Mean scores between PTAE (8.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6-8.9) and control groups (7.9; 95% CI, 7.1-8.8) did not differ significantly (p = .50), although suboptimal communication on a subset of these elements was associated with increased PTAEs. Communication around interhospital transfer appears suboptimal compared with an empiric set of standard communication elements. Posttransfer adverse events were not associated with aggregate adherence to these standards.","352":"From November 2010 to August 2013, 161 adults with acquired brain injury in Massachusetts transitioned from long-term care settings to the community through a Medicaid-funded waiver. Most participants transitioned with minimal risk; for some, the transition resulted in an increase in risk incidents above the rest. Specifically, despite risk mitigation efforts, 11% of the participants accounted for more than 75% of the reported first year incidents. A registered nurse Care Manager was engaged in a pilot program to address the needs of participants at the highest risk. Based on incidents or potential for incidents, 30 participants were enrolled in care management (CM). Secondary data analysis, interviews, and surveys assessed whether CM was associated with a decrease in incidents and to what extent participants and providers were satisfied with CM. Care management was significantly associated with a decrease in incidents including hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Participants, Case Managers, and service providers were highly satisfied with the Care Manager. Focusing on a specific population with increased risk, clearly explaining the purpose of CM, and remaining flexible when addressing the complex and individual nature of risk management are important strategies to ensure an effective CM program. ","353":"Healthcare information technology (HIT) has been examined and shown to be a tool to improve patient healthcare quality. This study seeks to define the relationship between HIT applications such as computerized physician order entry, clinical decision support systems, and handheld device use and select Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) measures (doctor and nurse communication, discharge instructions, and whether the patient would highly recommend the hospital). Several control variables were used that represent the hospital level and contextual hospital service area level. The analysis had mixed results: the aforementioned HIT applications may add and support certain HCAHPS measures (Always Given Discharge Information), whereas there were no significant findings for the more interpersonal quality measures (nurse and doctor communication, recommendation). These results show that although patients may not score doctors and nurses significantly higher for their communication in hospitals that use HIT, they did receive discharge instructions significantly at a higher rate than the non-HIT hospitals.","354":"To determine the extent to which it is feasible to implement quality measures on electronic health records (EHRs) as currently implemented in pediatric health centers. A survey of information technology professionals at 10 institutions that provide primary care services to adolescents. The survey asked whether data about care was being captured electronically across the nine domains relevant to adolescent well care: Screening, Health Risks, Sexual Health, Diagnosis and History, Laboratory Results, Prescriptions, Referrals, Forms Management, and Patient Demographics. For each domain, we developed a scale of the extent to which the EHR makes quality measurement feasible. Overall feasibility scores varied across centers from 34% to 85% and from 53% to 80% across care domains. One centre reported 100% feasibility for 8 of 10 care domains. Electronic health records can facilitate quality improvement, but the feasibility of such use depends on the presence, validity, and accessibility of the quality data in the EHR. Even among the largest and most sophisticated pediatric EHR systems, quality of care measurement is not possible yet for all aspects of adolescent well care without manual effort to review and code data. Nevertheless, almost all quality measures were reported to be feasible in some systems. ","355":null,"356":"Older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) typically have risk factors (e.g., functional deficits, social barriers) that complicate the management of their healthcare, often with devastating human and economic consequences. Finding new ways to provide patient-centered care to community-based older adults with MCCs is essential. Two current models of care, the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) and the Transitional Care Model (TCM), have demonstrated improvements in the outcomes of high-risk older adults at different points on the chronic illness trajectory. However, neither care management approach has optimally engaged vulnerable patients to address needs throughout both acute and more stable transitions in health. In this article, we summarize the development of the PCMH plus TCM (hereafter, PCMH + TCM), an innovative approach to care, and the experience of the providers involved in testing the feasibility of implementing the PCMH + TCM. Using content analyses to code open-ended survey responses from transitional care nurses and PCMH clinical leaders', two major themes, collaboration and communication, emerged as critical to the process of implementing the PCMH + TCM. Barriers and facilitators to implementing the PCMH + TCM are presented. Findings support that the TCM can be adapted and integrated into the PCMH with meticulous planning and implementation.","357":"Building upon their previous collective success and a clinical imperative for rapid improvement, the eight tertiary pediatric referral centers in Ohio sought to dramatically decrease the most serious types of harm that occur to hospitalized children by collectively employing high reliability methods focused on safety culture. With the support of the hospitals' executives, the Ohio collaborative obtained legal protection and built will by clearly identifying types and frequency of harm events that occur in each participating hospital and across the state. The improvement efforts were divided among task forces designed to incorporate the principles of high reliability organizations into the work of all employees, focusing primarily on the consistent application of error prevention behaviors. Between January 2010 and October 2012, the serious safety event rate among the participating hospitals decreased by 55%, equating to 70 fewer children per year who experienced this most severe type of event in the participating hospitals. Between January 2011 and October 2012, all events of serious harm were decreased by 40%, meaning 18 fewer children per month suffered serious harm. Rapid and significant improvement in pediatric patient safety is possible through collaboration of children's hospitals dedicated to the application of high reliability principles and the noncompetitive sharing of outcomes and best practices. ","358":"This study assesses whether geographic localization of housestaff patients contributes to improved patient knowledge of diagnosis, patient satisfaction, provider satisfaction, and workplace culture of safety. Due to national changes to graduate medical education, housestaff patients were localized to a single general medicine ward. Ninety-three patients prelocalization, 64 patients postlocalization, 26 localized physicians, and 10 localized nurses were surveyed. Validated questionnaires assessed patients' experiences during hospitalization, and physician and nurse job satisfaction. Fifty-seven percent of patients knew their diagnosis prior to localization, compared to 80% postlocalization (p &lt; .0001). Prior to localization, 39% of patients who reported experiencing anxieties or fears during hospitalization felt physicians frequently discussed these emotions with them compared to 85% after localization (p &lt; .0001). Before localization, 51% of patients stated that doctors spent 4 min or more daily with them discussing care, compared to 91% after localization (p &lt; .0001). Both physician and nurse opinion significantly improved regarding some but not all aspects of collaboration, teamwork, patient safety, appropriate handling of errors, and culture of safety. The average length of stay was unchanged and the change in 30-day readmission rate was not statistically significant. Localization of patients to a single inpatient ward improved patient knowledge and satisfaction, and some aspects of interprofessional communication and workplace culture of safety. ","359":"Hospital readmission is an adverse patient outcome that is serious, common, and costly. For hospitals, identifying patients at risk for hospital readmission is a priority to reduce costs and improve care. The purposes were to validate a predictive algorithm to identify patients at a high risk for preventable hospital readmission within 30 days after discharge and determine if additional risk factors enhance readmission predictability. A retrospective study was conducted on a randomized sample of 598 patients discharged from a Southeast community hospital. Data were collected from the organization's database and manually abstracted from the electronic medical record using a structured tool. Two separate logistic regression models were fit for the probability of readmission within 30 days after discharge. The first model used the LACE index as the predictor variable, and the second model used the LACE index with additional risk factors. The two models were compared to determine if additional risk factors increased the model's predictive ability. The results indicate both models have reasonable prognostic capability. The LACE index with additional risk factors did little to improve prognostication, while adding to the model's complexity. Findings support the use of the LACE index as a practical tool to identify patients at risk for readmission. ","360":"To determine the prevalence and characteristics of national clinical registries. Review of clinical registries through the following: (1) PubMed search using MeSH term \"registries,\" (2) clinical trials database search using the term \"registry,\" (3) review of the American Medical Association (AMA) recognized specialty societies for registry affiliation, and (4) consultation with a panel representing the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Outcomes that characterize registries (type, participants, specialty affiliation, funding), reflect data quality (risk adjustment, auditing practices), and indicate transparency (public reporting). We identified 153 clinical registries of which 47.7% (73) were health services registries, 43.1% (66) were disease registries, and 9.2% (14) were combination registries. The mean number of hospitals per registry was 1,693 (interquartile range [IQR] = 45-230), and the mean number of patients per registry was 1,160,492 (IQR = 2,150-10,045). Among the 117 AMA specialty societies, 16.2% (19) were affiliated with a registry. Government funding was associated with 26.1% (40\/153) of registries. Of the 153 registries, 23.5% (36) risk adjusted outcomes and 18.3% (23) audited data. Mandatory public reporting of hospital outcomes for all participating hospitals was associated with 2.0% (3\/153) of registries. There is substantial opportunity to develop more specialty-specific clinical registries with publicly available data. ","361":"Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have a higher prevalence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and worse outcomes. Research has highlighted the inconsistent care that is provided to patients with IBD, and at our institution, the CDI testing rate was 41%. The present quality improvement intervention sought to increase CDI testing for inpatients with IBD with a flare. Eighty-nine patients admitted to our gastrointestinal unit over a 9-month period with IBD flare were eligible for the study. If a patient did not have a test for CDI ordered, the floor nurse collected stool and alerted the provider to order the test. The primary outcome was percent of eligible patients receiving a test. Secondary outcomes included rate of CDI, length of hospital stay, and readmission rate within 6 months. There was a significant increase in testing for CDI to 75% (p = .0151). Patients who received a test were more likely to have CDI (p = .0316), shorter hospital stays (p = .0095), and fewer readmissions (p = .0366). This study used the nursing admission workflow to increase the rate of CDI testing. Future studies should further characterize inconsistencies in IBD care and implement quality improvements. ","362":"The Re-Engineered Discharge (RED) program is a hospital-based initiative shown to decrease hospital reutilization. We implemented the RED in 10 hospitals to study the implementation process. We recruited 10 hospitals from different regions of the United States to implement the RED and provided training for participating hospital leaders and implementation staff using the RED Toolkit as the basis of the curriculum followed by monthly telephone-based technical assistance for up to 1 year. Two team members interviewed key informants from each hospital before RED implementation and then 1 year later. Interview data were analyzed according to common and comparative themes identified across institutions. Readmission outcomes were collected on participating hospitals and compared pre- versus post-RED implementation. Key findings included (1) wide variability in the fidelity of the RED intervention; (2) engaged leadership and multidisciplinary implementation teams were keys to success; (3) common challenges included obtaining timely follow-up appointments, transmitting discharge summaries to outpatient clinicians, and leveraging information technology. Eight out of 10 hospitals reported improvement in 30-day readmission rates after RED implementation. A supportive hospital culture is essential for successful RED implementation. A flexible implementation strategy can be used to implement RED and reduce readmissions. ","363":"Under the Affordable Care Act, the Congress has mandated that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reduce payments to hospitals subject to their Inpatient Prospective Payment System that exhibits excess readmissions. Using hospital-coded discharge abstracts, we constructed a readmission measure that accounts for cross-hospital variation that enables hospitals to monitor their entire inpatient populations and evaluate their readmission rates relative to national benchmarks. Multivariate logistic regressions are applied to determine which patient factors increase the odds of a readmission within 30 days and by how much. This study uses deidentified discharge abstract data from a database of approximately 15 million inpatient discharges representing 611 acute care hospitals from Premier healthcare alliance over a 2-year period (2008q4-2010q3). The hospitals are geographically diverse and represent large urban academic centers and small rural community hospitals. This study demonstrates that meaningful risk-adjusted readmission rates can be tracked in a dynamic database. The clinical conditions responsible for the index admission were the strongest predictive factor of readmissions, but factors such as age and accompanying comorbid conditions were also important. Socioeconomic factors, such as race, income, and payer status, also showed strong statistical significance in predicting readmissions. Payment models that are based on stratified comparisons might result in a more equitable payment system while at the same time providing transparency regarding disparities based on these factors. No model, yet available, discriminates potentially modifiable readmissions from those not subject to intervention highlighting the fact that the optimum readmission rate for any given condition is yet to be identified. ","364":"The decline in anaerobic infections in the past 15 years has resulted in healthcare professionals questioning the need for routine anaerobic blood cultures. In this study, we extracted baseline aerobic and anaerobic blood culture rates over the past 10 years (2001-2010) from our pediatric wards. A questionnaire survey of doctors was conducted to gather their views regarding anaerobic blood cultures. Interventions such as physician education were introduced over 6 months to reduce unindicated anaerobic blood cultures. Furthermore, the rates of blood cultures were tracked over time after intervention. Before intervention, 85% of doctors surveyed routinely ordered anaerobic blood cultures, 90% were unaware of any guidelines for anaerobic blood cultures, and 100% were unaware of the costs. The combination of physician education and restrictive interventions resulted in an 80% reduction in the number of anaerobic blood cultures performed and processed, which translated into savings of USD $2,883 per week, with projected savings of USD $145,560 annually. ","365":"Hypothetical choice studies suggest that physicians often take more risk for themselves than on their patient's behalf. To examine if physicians recommend more screening tests than they personally undergo in the real-world context of breast cancer screening. Within-subjects survey. A national sample of female obstetricians and gynecologists (N = 135, response rate 54%) from the United States. In total, they provided breast care to approximately 2,800 patients per week. Personal usage history and patient recommendations regarding mammography screening and breast self-examination, a measure of defensive medicine practices. Across age groups, female physicians were more likely to recommend mammography screening than to have performed the procedure in the past 5 years (86% vs. 81%, p = .10). In respondents aged 40-49 this difference was significant (91% vs. 82%, p &lt; .05), whereas no differences were detected for younger or older physicians. Among respondents in their 40s, 18% had undergone annual screenings in the past 5 years, compared to 48% of their colleagues above 50. Respondents were as likely to practice breast self-examination (98%) as to recommend it (93%), a pattern that was consistent across age groups. A logistic regression model of personal use of mammography significantly predicted recommending the procedure to patients (OR = 15.29, p = .001). Similarly, number of breast self-examinations performed over the past 2 years positively predicted patient recommendations of the procedure (OR = 1.31, p &lt; .001). Obstetricians and gynecologists tended to recommend early mammography screening to their patients, though their personal practices indicated later start than their own recommendations and lower frequency of screening than peers in recent studies have recommended. ","366":"Ionizing radiation is an essential component of the care process. However, providers and patients may not be fully aware of the risks involved, the level of ionizing radiation delivered with various procedures, or the potential for harm through incidental overexposure or cumulative dose. Recent high-profile incidents demonstrating the devastating short-term consequences of radiation overexposure have drawn attention to these risks, but applicable solutions are lacking. Although various recommendations and guidelines have been proposed, organizational variability challenges providers to identify their own practical solutions. To identify potential failure modes and develop solutions to preserve patient safety within a large, national healthcare system, we assembled a multidisciplinary team to conduct a comprehensive analysis of practices surrounding the delivery of ionizing radiation. Workgroups were developed to analyze existing culture, processes, and technology to identify deficiencies and propose solutions. Six focus areas were identified: competency and certification; equipment; monitoring and auditing; education; clinical pathways; and communication and marketing. This manuscript summarizes this comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and systemic analysis of risk and provides examples to illustrate how these focus areas can be used to improve the use of ionizing radiation. The proposed solutions, once fully implemented, may advance patient safety and care. ","367":"In 2001, the Committee on Quality in Health Care in America found it took 17 years for evidence from randomized controlled trials to be applied to practice, with little improvement over the last decade. Even abbreviated and summarized evidence fails to be consistently implemented at the bedside. More emphasis needs to be placed on understanding which Implementation Methods are most effective in successfully implementing evidence-based practice at the bedside. The purpose of the study was to explore the use of 20 Implementation Methods by 57 Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) participating in the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NACHRI, 2011) collaborative to eliminate central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI) in critically ill children. This descriptive research study was conducted using a Likert survey to determine the intensity of use of 20 Implementation Methods by PICUs. PICUs were also asked to identify any additional Implementation Methods that were used, but not included in the survey. Most Implementation Methods had high or very high use across the 57 PICUs. The 20 Implementation Methods identified as part of this study, represented the vast majority of Implementation Methods used by PICUs. ","368":"Poorly executed transitions in care from hospital to home are associated with increased vulnerability to adverse medication events and hospital readmissions, and also excess healthcare costs. Efforts to improve care coordination on hospital discharge have been shown to reduce hospital readmission rates but often rely on interventions that are not fully integrated within the primary care setting. The Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model, whose core principles include care coordination in the posthospital setting, is an approach that addresses transitions in care in a more integrated fashion. We examined the impact of multicomponent transition management (TM) services on hospital readmission rates and time to hospital readmission among 118 patients enrolled in a TM program that is part of Care By Design, the University of Utah Community Clinics' version of the PCMH. We conducted a retrospective analysis comparing outcomes for patients before receiving TM services with outcomes for the same patients after receiving TM services. The all-cause 30-day hospital readmission rate decreased from 17.9% to 8.0%, and the mean time to hospital readmission within 180 days was delayed from 95 to 115 days. These findings support the effectiveness of TM activities integrated within the primary care setting.","369":"Residencies are required to have a standardized process for transitioning patient care. This study was designed to assess a novel method of training and evaluating handoffs using both a lecture format and standardized patient (SP) interactions. Matched group design was used to randomly assign interns to trained versus control groups, with the trained group receiving formal handoff training before SP encounters. The residents evaluated three ER SPs and read four written scenarios and then transitioned patients to an SP acting as a resident. All handoffs were videotaped and scored by two blind raters using a rating scale developed based on specialist's interviews. Thirty-two interns were included in the study. The trained interns performed significantly better with lower scores on patient handoffs (mean = 10.08, SD = 2.46) than the untrained interns (mean = 16.56, SD = 2.79). There was also a significant effect for case, with the ER SP cases (mean = 12.23, SD = 14.41) resulting in better performance than the written cases in both surgery and pediatrics (mean = 14.41, SD = 4.29). A protocol was designed and implemented for training residents to perform handoffs, with initial results showing that the curriculum is effective. ","370":"Unplanned hospital readmissions are common and often preventable. A review of Medicare discharge data identified a geographical area with higher than expected readmission rates. The state Medicare quality improvement organization (QIO) used community organizing techniques to assess provider engagement and hypothesized that a small workgroup of high impact providers could address some root causes for preventable readmissions, achieve quick wins, and reinvigorate the broader community-wide coalition. Seven of the eight facilities targeted by the QIO actively engaged and began rapid cycle initiatives to improve the patient transfer process between providers. Monthly, 2-hr structured meetings were supplemented by additional ad hoc meetings convened by participants. Effectiveness of the intervention was measured by workgroup functioning, the implementation of multiple initiatives spread from the small workgroup to the broader provider coalition, and reductions in readmissions to the anchor hospital system from the participating skilled nursing facilities. The community impact of the workgroup initiative is shown by a decline in community readmission rates for Medicare beneficiaries. ","371":"The \"siloed\" approach to healthcare delivery contributes to communication challenges and to potential patient harm when patients transfer between settings. This article reports on the evaluation of a demonstration in 10 rural communities to improve the safety of nursing facility (NF) transfers to hospital emergency departments by forming interprofessional teams of hospital, emergency medical service, and NF staff to develop and implement tools and protocols for standardizing critical interfacility communication pathways and information sharing. We worked with each of the 10 teams to document current communication processes and information sharing tools and to design, implement, and evaluate strategies\/tools to increase effective communication and sharing of patient information across settings. A mixed methods approach was used to evaluate changes from baseline in documentation of patient information shared across settings during the transfer process. Study findings showed significant improvement in key areas across the three settings, including infection status and baseline mental functioning. Improvement strategies and performance varied across settings; however, accurate and consistent information sharing of advance directives and medication lists remains a challenge. Study results demonstrate that with neutral facilitation and technical support, collaborative interfacility teams can assess and effectively address communication and information sharing problems that threaten patient safety. ","372":"Evaluating implementation of complex interventions to improve care transitions and comparison across studies is challenging due to issues such as variation in methods and lack of reporting key evaluation elements. This article describes a framework for evaluating implementation of hospital to ambulatory care transitions interventions and application to a case study. We searched published and gray literature for relevant frameworks. We adapted the general Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, adding elements relevant to other complex interventions. We refined these adaptations through structured expert input and application to case studies. Key adaptations included conceptualization around organizations, not just settings, and around patient- and caregiver-centeredness. Although these interventions are often oriented toward institutional outcomes such as readmissions, tailoring interventions to specific patient needs strengthens effectiveness. Coordination and communication are important between organizations and providers and with patients and caregivers. Roles of those involved in the intervention--providers, administrators, and facilitators from different organizations--are also key constructs. Finally, as these interventions often are tailored to specific settings and adapt over time, assessing intervention design--which components are implemented as part of the bundle, how they are actually implemented, and their differential impact on effectiveness--is critical.","373":"Since the implementation of Value-Based Purchasing, hospital readmissions now effect Medicare reimbursement. This creation of a financial incentive, along with the inherent medical incentives to reduce those readmissions forces hospitals to examine their practices on the subject. Using the Donabedian model for healthcare quality, this study examined the relationship between discharge instructions and nurse\/doctor communication with the patient and lower readmissions. The readmissions variable (30-day medical) along with the discharge instruction, nurse communication, and doctor communication variables came from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Hospital Compare dataset. Zip code-level contextual variables (aggregated to the hospital service area) were used as control variables. Results suggest that while each of the independent variables of nurse communication, doctor communication, and discharge instructions were significant in predicting lower readmissions, the strongest association came from discharge instructions, while controlling for other hospital-level and contextual factors. These results call for an increased focus on patient-centeredness by making sure that the patient understands the scope and content of their discharge instructions.

To explore facilitators and challenges family caregivers face in assuming postdischarge family caregiving roles and completing complex care tasks. A qualitative study recruited 32 participants from 4 sites. Participants were unpaid family caregivers whose loved one was recently discharged from an acute care hospital. A modified Grounded Theory approach was used. Five central themes emerged from the analysis: (1) family caregivers' contributions to the care of their loved one unfold along on a spectrum where the readiness, willingness, and ability of both parties are often dynamic; (2) family caregivers have unique and potentially incongruent goals from those of the patient; (3) family caregivers feel unprepared for postdischarge medication management; (4) family caregivers encouragement to assert an identity; (5) family caregivers often assume the responsibility for the sequencing of posthospital care plan tasks and anticipating next steps. Family caregivers provided valuable insights into the challenges they face facilitating their loved ones' transitions. These findings may directly inform the design and testing of an evidence-based intervention to enhance their roles. ","376":"Family caregivers play a central role in ensuring the execution of the discharge care plan. To enhance an evidence-based model-the Care Transitions Intervention (CTI)-and to make it more responsive to the needs of family caregivers and determine its impact on a measure of activation. Prospective cohort of 83 patient-family caregiver partnerships discharged from hospital. The domains of the CTI were modified to incorporate those areas that family caregivers identified as wanting to feel better prepared and more confident. Family caregivers experienced a mean improvement in activation of 6 points on a 0-10 scale (p &lt; .0001). Sixty-four percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 52-75%) of family caregivers met or exceeded self-identified goals. Transitions Coaches identified 71% (95% CI, 60-80%) of patients as having medication discrepancies or errors after hospital discharge and coached family caregivers on how to respond. The mean 3-item Care Transitions Measure score on a 0-100 scale was 80.89 (95% CI, 76.62-85.16). Almost all (99%) (95% CI, 92-100%) participants would recommend the model to a friend of family member. The enhanced family caregiver CTI significantly improved activation, quality, goal achievement, satisfaction, and medication safety. The enhanced family caregiver CTI may have application in improving the hospital discharge experience. ","377":"In this retrospective cohort study, 100 records were randomly selected from the intervention period (April 2012) and the control period (April 2011). The hospital's institutional database was queried to compare mortality, length of stay, and patient satisfaction, in the year prior to and the year after the integration of the new process. A chart review was performed to determine if the reengineered process was associated with an improvement in documentation. A scoring system was developed to gauge the quality and timeliness of the process. Institutional data regarding length of stay, mortality, patient satisfaction, and core measures compliance were compared for the pre- and postimplementation of the new process. The reengineered discharge process was associated with an improvement in patient satisfaction and in the quality of the discharge materials as measured by the \"patient-centered transitions of care (PCTC) score.\" These improvements occurred without a significant increase in the time to complete a discharge.A redesigned discharge process resulted in system-wide improvements in the quality of information provided to the patient and their outpatient providers.

Aims were as follows: (1) to describe the CALNOC MA accuracy assessment, (2) to examine nurse adherence to six safe practices during MA, (3) to examine the prevalence of MA errors in adult acute care, and (4) to explore associations between safe practices and MA accuracy. Using a cross-sectional design, point in time, and convenience sample, direct observation data were collected by 43 hospitals participating in CALNOC's benchmarking registry. Data included 33,425 doses from 333 observation studies on 157 adult acute care units. Results reveal that the most common MA safe practice deviations were distraction\/interruption (22.89%), not explaining medication to patients (13.90%), and not checking two forms of ID (12.47%). The most common MA errors were drug not available (0.76%) and wrong dose (0.45%). The overall percentage of safe practice deviations per encounter was 11.40%, whereas the overall percentage of MA errors was 0.32%. Findings predict that for 10,000 MA encounters, 27,630 safe practice deviations and 770 MA errors will occur. A 36% reduction in practice deviation per encounter prevents 4.4% MA errors. Ultimately, reliably performing safe practices improves MA accuracy. ","379":"Patient beliefs about their illness can motivate behaviors consistent with good disease management. Perceived high-quality chronic care would be expected to increase likelihood of having such beliefs. Associations between perceived quality of chronic care and illness representations, and associations between patient centeredness and illness representations were assessed among persons with diabetes. A mail survey of diabetic patients visiting a multispecialty physician network serving urban and suburban populations in a large midwestern city was conducted. The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care-5A questionnaire was used to assess perceived chronic care quality and patient centeredness. The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire was used to assess illness representations. Of 500 mailed surveys, 89 completed surveys were returned. The sample consisted mostly of retirees (61%), Whites (81%), and women (60%). Higher perceived chronic care quality was associated with better disease understanding of diabetes (0.24, p = .05). Patients reporting higher patient centeredness (or lower patient-centeredness scores) indicated better disease understanding (-0.26, p = .04) and those reporting higher patient centeredness (or lower patient-centeredness scores) perceived less impact of illness (0.29, p = .02). Chronic care quality as defined in the Chronic Care Model and consistency of chronic care with patient expectations (patient centeredness) was associated with illness representations favorable for good self-care management. ","380":"The Joint Commission requires hospitals to report on Children's Asthma Care (CAC) measures, although their relationship to outcomes is not clear. The objective of this study was to (1) characterize metrics hospitals use for asthma, and to (2) determine if the number and type of metrics used is associated with readmission rates. Pediatric hospital quality leaders were asked to identify asthma metrics utilized by their respective organizations via an online survey. \"Use\" of metrics was defined as periodically measuring data regardless of performance. Linear regression was used to determine if the number or domain of metrics grouped by topic used was associated with 7-, 30-, and 90-day same-cause readmission rates obtained from the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS). Among respondents (n = 27, 62.7%), the mean number of metrics used was 20.5 (SD = 9.1, range = 4-38). There was no association between the number or domain type of metrics used and 7-, 30-, or 90-day readmission rates. Despite using a wide variety of asthma metrics, there was no association between use of any metric or domain of metrics and asthma-related readmission rates. Additional work should identify asthma process measures that are associated with meaningful outcomes. ","381":"On a day-to-day basis, doctors must decide which treatments are most beneficial for their patients, and which make the most sense in terms of costs. In medical decision making, factors such as efficiency and cost-effectiveness can be particularly challenging to navigate because many of the most expensive procedures encountered in medical practice are also high-stake treatments for patients. One-hundred-six obstetricians-gynecologists (Obs\/Gyns) completed a survey asking them to allocate the following resources in scenarios in which they are scarce: human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations, mammograms, and in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. Additional questions focused on how fairness and cost-effectiveness factored into the allocation decisions of each group. Results indicated that Obs\/Gyns were more efficient in their distribution of HPV vaccinations and mammograms than in their distribution of IVF treatments. More efficient responding was associated with placing less emphasis on fairness in decision making. This study demonstrates the differences that exist in the emphasis that physicians place on medical evidence, cost, outcomes, and perceptions of fair (equal) allocation when faced with different costs and health impacts.","382":"Hypertension is a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality. Our objective was to describe the quality outcomes associated with physicians' completion of hypertension Performance in Practice Modules (PPMs) as part of Maintenance of Certification (MOC). Descriptive study of all hypertension PPMs completed by family physicians from July 2006 to 2013. Descriptive statistics characterized physician demographics and quality outcomes; linear regression determined characteristics associated with improvement. In total, 7,319 hypertension PPMs were completed by family physicians that had a mean age of 47.9 years and 14.2 years of practice experience. Most (52.4%) chose lipid control as their quality improvement (QI) focus. Performance on all quality measures improved except mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol values; however, percentage of patients with LDL &lt; 130 mg\/dl improved. Improvement was seen in blood pressure control (87.4% to 92.6%, p &lt; .05), low sodium diet counseling (74.1% to 92.7%, p &lt; .05), and exercise counseling (82.4% to 94.4%, p &lt; .05). In regression models, no variable was consistently associated with improvement. Family physicians improved the quality of care for patients with hypertension through MOC. Leveraging MOC across all specialties may become an important support for improving management of conditions that cause considerable morbidity and mortality. ","383":"Patient satisfaction is a commonly used measure of healthcare quality. Limited research exists among psychiatric inpatients, especially adolescents, who pose unique challenges. This study sought to (1) concurrently assess adolescents' and parents' satisfaction with treatment and (2) compare their perspectives' association with treatment outcomes. This exploratory study assessed discharged adolescents from a specialty psychiatric hospital. Adolescent patients and parents completed the Perceptions of Care survey (POC), a measure of patient satisfaction. Patients also completed the Youth Self-Report measure, while parents also completed the Child Behavior Checklist-both are used as measures of mental health treatment outcomes. Adolescents and parents gave favorable overall ratings of care. Adolescents were more critical than their parents, and there was little agreement between them. Adolescents' ratings on the POC frequently related to outcomes, whereas parents' ratings rarely did. Ratings of satisfaction with adolescent healthcare can vary depending on whether patients or caregivers are assessed. The discrepancy between them contains value: adolescents' perception may be a better gauge of treatment outcomes and may affect treatment adherence. Future research should examine adolescent-specific concerns in the context of satisfaction with care and relate them to longer term treatment outcomes. ","384":"Risk-adjusted hospital-wide mortality has been proposed as a key indicator of system-level quality. Several risk-adjusted measures are available, and one-the hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) - is publicly reported in a number of countries, but not in the United States. This paper reviews potential uses of such measures. We conclude that available methods are not suitable for interhospital comparisons or rankings and should not be used for pay-for-performance or value-based purchasing\/payment. Hospital-wide mortality is a relatively imprecise, crude measure of quality, but disaggregation into condition- and service-line-specific mortality can facilitate targeted improvement efforts. If tracked over time, both observed and expected mortality rates should be monitored to ensure that apparent improvement is not due to increasing expected mortality, which could reflect changes in case mix or coding. Risk-adjusted mortality can be used as an initial signal that a hospital's mortality rate is significantly higher than statistically expected, prompting further inquiry.","385":"Patient safety and professional liability are major concerns worldwide. Despite the pervasive influence of catastrophic malpractice payouts, little is known about the specific characteristics and the overall relevance and characteristics of these payouts, especially outside U.S. borders. Five hundred fifty claims led to a payout among 2,236 claims from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2010, in Catalonia (Spain). We analyzed data on patient, provider, and claim characteristics. Accordingly to our sample, Spanish catastrophic payouts (SCP) were defined as payouts over &amp;OV0556;200,000, which was found in 32 cases (5.8%). Diagnostic errors and patient death were not as relevant as previously reported. However, it is remarkable that the literature emanating from different countries shows similar trends besides contextual differences: patients suffering minor injuries are not likely to receive a catastrophic payout, catastrophic payouts are associated with patient age less than one; SCP are most associated with anesthesiology and resuscitation, general surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology; and SCP were more likely to occur when a case went to trial compared to when a case was settled out of court. Studies, such as this, provide a wider picture of the medical liability worldwide reality and helps avoiding isolated discourses.","386":"Direct observation was used to detect medication errors and Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) workarounds on two pediatric units and one neonatal unit at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital. The study (1) measured the frequency of nursing medication administration-related errors, (2) characterized the types of medication errors, (3) assessed compliance with the institution's six medication administration safety processes, and (4) identified observed workarounds following BCMA implementation. The results of the direct observation were compared to medication administration-related incident reports (IRs) for the same period. The frequency of medication errors was 5% for the three units. Compliance with the process measures was achieved 86% of the time (range 23-100%). Seven medication administration-related IRs were submitted during the same observation period. Three BCMA workarounds were identified; (1) failure to visually confirm patient's identification, (2) failure to compare the medication to the electronic medication administration record at least twice before administration, and (3) charting administration of medication before actual administration. The direct observation methodology identified a low frequency of medication administration errors (MAEs) consistent with post-BCMA implementation. The incident reporting system identified different MAEs than direct observation suggesting that both methods should be used to better characterize the scope of MAEs.","387":"Healthcare organizations use Pneumonia Core Measures (PCMs) to ensure delivery of high-quality care. In this study, a multidisciplinary team was organized to optimize care and enhance compliance in a comprehensive cancer emergency center. We performed a four-phase study, three of which were interventional: intense education regarding PCM; microbiologic analysis of the pathogens responsible for the pneumonias; development and implementation of an institutional pneumonia algorithm and order set. In phase 4, we analyzed five PCMs. The percentage of pneumonia patients from whom blood cultures were obtained increased from 73% to 91% after intervention (p &lt; .001); sputum cultures increased from baseline 24.6% to 51% (p = .004) post order-set implementation, and order-set utilization increased from 40% to 77%. We achieved the benchmark for only one PCM, PN 3a. More than 80% of patients met clinical and microbiological criteria for healthcare-associated pneumonia. We identified a gap between our patient population and some PCMs that relates to antibiotics selection. The treatment of cancer patients and pneumonia falls outside established guidelines for treating community-acquired pneumonia. Although the algorithm and order set implemented optimized care and minimized variation, national benchmarks for four of the PCMs were not met. Our findings provide information for policymakers considering pneumonia measurements for antibiotic selection in a cancer care setting. ","388":"Since the 1999 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report To Err is Human, progress has been made in patient safety, but few efforts have focused on safety in patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). This article describes the development, content, and testing of two new evidence-based Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) tools for LEP patient safety. In the content development phase, a comprehensive mixed-methods approach was used to identify common causes of errors for LEP patients, high-risk scenarios, and evidence-based strategies to address them. Based on our findings, Improving Patient Safety Systems for Limited English Proficient Patients: A Guide for Hospitals contains recommendations to improve detection and prevention of medical errors across diverse populations, and TeamSTEPPS Enhancing Safety for Patients with Limited English Proficiency Module trains staff to improve safety through team communication and incorporating interpreters in the care process. The Hospital Guide was validated with leaders in quality and safety at diverse hospitals, and the TeamSTEPPS LEP module was field-tested in varied settings within three hospitals. Both tools were found to be implementable, acceptable to their audiences, and conducive to learning. Further research on the impact of the combined use of the guide and module would shed light on their value as a multifaceted intervention. ","389":"The Health Resources and Services Administration has supported the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) by federally funded health centers for over a decade; however, little is known about health centers' current EHR adoption rates, progress toward Meaningful Use, and factors related to adoption. We analyzed cross-sectional data from all 1,128 health centers in 2011, which served over 20 million patients during that year. As of 2011, 80% of health centers reported using an EHR, and high proportions reported using many advanced EHR functionalities. There were no indications of disparities in EHR adoption by census region, urban\/rural location, patient sociodemographic composition, physician staffing, or health center funding; however, there were small variations in adoption by total patient cost and percent of revenue from grants. Findings revealed no evidence of a digital divide among health centers, indicating that health centers are implementing EHRs, in keeping with their mission to reduce health disparities. ","390":"Intravenous (IV) acetaminophen has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption, which may lead to increased patient satisfaction. To determine the effect IV acetaminophen has on patient satisfaction, a pooled analysis from methodologically homogenous studies was conducted. We obtained patient-level data from five randomized, placebo-controlled studies in adults undergoing elective surgery in which patient satisfaction was measured using a 4-point categorical rating scale. The primary endpoint was \"excellent\" satisfaction and the secondary endpoint was \"good\" or \"excellent\" satisfaction at 24 hr after first study drug administration. Bivariate analyses were conducted using the chi-square test and Student's t-test and multivariable analyses were conducted using logistic regression analysis. Patients receiving IV acetaminophen were more than twice as likely as those who received placebo to report \"excellent\" patient satisfaction ratings (32.3% vs. 15.9%, respectively). Of all variables that remained statistically significant in the multivariable analysis (i.e., type of surgery, duration of anesthesia, last pain rating, and opioid consumption), IV acetaminophen had the strongest positive effect on \"excellent\" patient satisfaction with an odds ratio of 2.76 (95% CI 1.81-4.23). Results for \"excellent\" or \"good\" satisfaction were similar. When given as part of a perioperative analgesic regimen, IV acetaminophen was associated with significantly improved patient satisfaction. ","391":"Healthcare providers have increased the use of quality improvement (QI) techniques, but organizational variables that affect QI uptake and implementation warrant further exploration. This study investigates organizational characteristics associated with clinics that enroll and participate over time in QI. The Network for the Improvement of Addiction Treatment (NIATx) conducted a large cluster-randomized trial of outpatient addiction treatment clinics, called NIATx 200, which randomized clinics to one of four QI implementation strategies: (1) interest circle calls, (2) coaching, (3) learning sessions, and (4) the combination of all three components. Data on organizational culture and structure were collected before, after randomization, and during the 18-month intervention. Using univariate descriptive analyses and regression techniques, the study identified two significant differences between clinics that enrolled in the QI study (n = 201) versus those that did not (n = 447). Larger programs were more likely to enroll and clinics serving more African Americans were less likely to enroll. Once enrolled, higher rates of QI participation were associated with clinics' not having a hospital affiliation, being privately owned, and having staff who perceived management support for QI. The study discusses lessons for the field and future research needs. ","392":"The National Quality Forum (NQF) has endorsed the process performance measure Perioperative Temperature Management, which is used by the Joint Commission and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Compliance requires either using active warming intraoperatively or achieving normothermia near the end of anesthesia. Compliance may actually be achieved by using forced-air warming incorrectly and without maintaining normothermia. The aim of this study was to determine to what extent compliance with the NQF-endorsed quality performance measure, is congruent with normothermia at the end of the surgical procedure. This study describes the relationship between compliance with this measure and the outcome of normothermia upon admission to the postanesthesia care unit. A retrospective review was undertaken of patients undergoing surgery with general or neuraxial anesthesia during a 48-month period of time in a community hospital. A total of 5.8% of patients for whom the quality performance measure was met were hypothermic upon admission to the postanesthesia care unit. The greatest gaps between compliance with the measure and normothermia were found in urology (8.5%) and orthopedics (7.7%). Patients who receive care compliant with the quality performance measure by receiving active warming are still at risk for hypothermia. ","393":"Concerns surround discontinuity of care and poor communication during transitions of care between inpatient and outpatient settings. This study was designed to examine the differences in medication discrepancies during these transitions between an outpatient clinic with admitting privileges (PCP-AD) and another without admitting privileges (PCP-NOAD). Retrospective, chart review of patients admitted to the hospital between January and July 2009, who stated their primary care provider (PCP) was from either one of the outpatient clinics. Charts were evaluated for medication discrepancies on admission and discharge and follow-up with PCP after discharge. On both admission and discharge, PCP-AD had a rate of unacceptable discrepancies less than that of PCP-NOAD, 63.4% versus 90.3% (p &lt; .001) and 44.9% versus 84.1% (p &lt; .001) respectively. Patients prescribed more than 10 medications were more likely to have a medication discrepancy compared with those on fewer medications (p = .003). Additionally, 85% of patients from PCP-AD followed up after discharge compared with 62.7% from PCP-NOAD (p &lt; .001). The differences between the two groups in medication discrepancies and follow-up are suggestive of increased continuity of care with fewer discrepancies when PCPs are directly involved in inpatient care. A comprehensive and accurate medication history is imperative regardless of practice model. ","394":"The Internet provides easier access to health information and has become a powerful resource for managing one's health. In addition to websites that provide general health information, physicians create personalized websites to give patients an overview of their practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate characteristics of family physician websites to determine the type of content provided. Over 900 family physicians from the US News &amp; World Reports' best doctors list were reviewed to determine if a website existed. Then, each website was measured against seven main categories: information about the practice, medical information provided, communication, functionality, links, advertisements, and advanced tools. Although the majority provided basic information, only 21.4% had a website and most failed to provide additional information such as medical education, staff details, and accepted insurance. Furthermore, most physician websites were devoid of web 2.0 applications, despite the popularity of more tech-savvy services such as booking online appointments, social networking platforms, and patient portals. Because patients are becoming more consumer-centric about their health, physicians must keep up with technology in order to match patient expectations and preferences. Doing so will help attract new patients and has the ability to enhance the patient-provider relationship. ","395":null,"396":"Individuals with disabilities are at a greater risk of experiencing healthcare disparities. To address these disparities, healthcare organizations (HCOs) need to consistently and accurately document patients' disability status. Unfortunately, the evidence base does not yet exist to guide HCOs in determining what data to collect or the best method to collect the data. The authors propose a research agenda for developing and administering disability status questions. To determine what data to collect, researchers need to addresses the following challenges: disability is a complex concept, a wide range of types of disabilities exists, severity levels of disability can differ and, finally, patients might use assistive devices or aids to mitigate or ameliorate their disability. Additionally, research is needed to determine the frequency with which to administer questions due to the dynamic nature of disability, and to develop protocols for assessing the most appropriate person to answer disability status questions. Targeted research will lead to disability status questions that accurately and consistently identify individuals with disabilities and produce actionable data that HCOs can use to detect and address potential disparities in care. ","397":"To improve quality of healthcare, patient information must be thorough and easy to understand. This is important in day surgery where patients are seen less often by health practitioners. We looked at the impact of improving patient information in the setting of day-case hemorrhoidectomy in terms of patient satisfaction and whether medical attention was sought after the operation. A retrospective, comparative study was performed on 60 patients undergoing day-case hemorrhoidectomy and on 60 patients undergoing the same operation with improved patient information. Comparisons were made between the groups regarding patient satisfaction scores, those seeking medical attention, the numbers of patients requesting a 6-week outpatient follow-up and the reasons for seeking medical advice. There was a significant improvement in the patient satisfaction scores in the second study group who received the improved information. This group sought medical attention significantly less and they felt less need for a routine follow-up. This study has shown that by improving the quality of patient information for day-case hemorrhoidectomy, patient satisfaction was higher and fewer patients sought medical attention, which has beneficial financial indications for the NHS Trust and improvement of healthcare for the patient. ","398":"Sign-out of patient data at change of shifts is vulnerable to errors that impact patient safety. Although sign-outs are complex in intensive care units (ICU), a paucity of studies exists evaluating optimal ICU sign-out. Our prospective interventional study investigated the use of a standard verbal template in a Pediatric ICU to improve the sign-out process. We designed and validated a survey tool to measure 10 items of optimal sign-out. The survey and analysis of sign-out information exchanged was performed pre- and postintervention. Forty-eight clinicians participated, with a survey response rate of 88% and 81% in the pre- and postintervention phases, respectively. Seventy-nine percent clinicians identified the need for sign-out improvement. Clinician satisfaction with sign-out increased postintervention (preintervention survey scores: 3.26 (CI: 3.09-3.43), postintervention 3.9 (CI: 3.76-4.04) [p &lt; .01]). Three scorers analyzed the verbal and written sign-out content with good inter-rater reliability. After the intervention, sign-out content revealed increased patient identification, background description, account of system-based clinical details [p = .001] and notation of clinical details, code status, and goals [p &lt; .002]. Interruptions decreased [p = .04] without any change in sign-out duration [p = .86]. The standard verbal template improved clinician satisfaction with sign-out, augmented the amount of information transferred and decreased interruptions without increasing the duration of sign-out. ","399":"In 2008, we conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study to determine the test characteristics of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality patient safety indicator (PSI) for hospital-acquired pressure ulcer (PU). We sampled 1,995 inpatient records that met PSI 3 criteria and 4,007 records assigned to 14 DRGs with the highest empirical rates of PSI 3, which did not meet PSI 3 criteria, from 32 U.S. academic hospitals. We estimated the positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity of PSI 3 using both the software version contemporary to the hospitalizations (v3.1) and an approximation of the current version (v4.4). Of records that met PSI 3 version 3.1 criteria, 572 (PPV 28.3%; 95% CI 23.6-32.9%) were true positive. PU that was present on admission (POA) accounted for 76% of the false-positive records. Estimated sensitivity was 48.2% (95% CI 41.0-55.3%) and specificity 71.4% (95% CI 68.3-74.5%). Reclassifying records based on reported POA information and PU stage to approximate version 4.4 of PSI 3 improved sensitivity (78.6%; 95% CI 62.7-94.5%) and specificity (98.0; 95% CI 97.1-98.9%). In conclusion, accounting for POA information and PU staging to approximate newer versions of the PSI software (v4.3) moderately improves validity. ","400":"Advances in surgical instrumentation allow surgeons to treat patients with less morbidity and shorter recovery time. However, the increasing complexity also adds to surgical risk, and to operating room supply chain burden. To improve the quality and efficiency of operating room instrument availability, we developed and validated a Lean 5S approach consisting of sort (determining instrument usage and waste), simplify (removing unnecessary instruments), sweep (confirm availability of needed instruments), standardize (all trays the same for a given procedure), and self-discipline (monitor success). The primary outcome was reduction in unnecessary instruments delivered to the operating room. As a secondary analysis, we evaluated the effect of the Lean instrument intervention on surgery times. We reduced the number of instruments for minimally invasive spine surgery by 70% (from 197 to 58), and setup time decreased 37% (13.1-8.2 min, p = .0015). We also report subsequent validation of the approach on deep brain stimulator cases. We conclude that complex surgical procedures offer opportunities for substantial waste reduction, simplification, and quality improvement, with potential institutional annual cost savings of $2.8 million. We demonstrate that Lean methodology can improve quality at lower cost. ","401":"The discharge process is a transitional period when the patient's care is shifted from the hospital to the home and can be stressful for patients. One technique used to improve the quality and continuity of care is the discharge phone call (DPC). A large, metropolitan hospital implemented the DPC program to improve quality of care and decrease readmission rates. Qualitative interviews were performed with 24 hospital leaders, managers, and staff to determine the impact of the DPC program on the quality of care during the discharge process. Interviewees responded that the main benefits to the DPCs related to patient's medication management, follow-up appointment reminders, and answering questions. From a hospital perspective, the DPC can provide feedback to help improve the care delivery process related to discharge planning through improved discharge instructions and reinforcement of prescribed steps upon the patient's return home. ","402":"The purpose of this study was to determine whether development of a hospital-acquired condition (HAC) affected responses to Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey questions. HCAHPS is a national, standardized satisfaction survey. Patient responses form, in part, the basis for Medicare reimbursement to hospitals via the value-based purchasing system established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. We hypothesized that patients who developed an HAC would be less satisfied with their care. We randomly distributed the HCAHPS survey, a validated, standardized measure of patient satisfaction, to 6,056 patients discharged from our institution for any orthopedic admission over a 2-year period. All patients who develop HACs are logged by our hospital quality assurance monitoring system. We reviewed the HCAHPS database, identified completed surveys associated with patients who had developed an HAC, and compared satisfaction scores between patients with HACs and patients without HACs. Survey scores were normalized to a 100-point scale. Univariate analysis was performed for two global ratings, and six specific satisfaction categories. Subgroup analysis was performed for surgical site infections (SSIs) and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE). A total of 2,876 controls and 159 HAC cases were identified from completed surveys. The cases and controls were similar in terms of race, however, the HAC group contained significantly more women (p &lt; .001). Patients in the HAC group also were, on average, significantly older, with a mean age of 66.84 versus 58.65 (p &lt; .001). There was no difference in satisfaction scores in patients' mean rating of communication by nurses (p = .81), communication by doctors (p = .31), communication about medications (p = .69), pain control (p = .66), the cleanliness of the hospital environment (p = .54), and the quietness of the hospital (p = .589). The mean normalized score for overall satisfaction was 93.99 (out of 100) for controls and 94.84 for HAC cases (p = .61). The mean normalized score for overall willingness to recommend the hospital to others was 90.22 for controls and 90.65 for HAC cases (p = .77). There was no statistically significant difference in satisfaction for patients with SSI versus VTE versus all other HACs (p &gt; .05). Performance on HCAHPS is an area that demands hospital attention both to provide patient-centered care and to maximize revenue. Development of an HAC was not associated with decreased satisfaction scores in a population of orthopedic surgery patients at a private, university-affiliated specialty center. The lack of any statistically significant difference in patient satisfaction may be attributable to patient satisfaction with care in response to complications, the decreased sensitivity inherent to using a general satisfaction survey, or a homogeneity among orthopedic surgery patients and their expectations of care. ","403":"Wireless technology in healthcare has been associated with communication-related improvements in workflow; however, there are barriers to adoption. This study examined predictors of use of wireless communication devices (WCDs) in environments with unique needs (i.e., intensive care unit [ICU]). Nurses were recruited in the ICU to complete a paper questionnaire to assess their willingness to use WCDs. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was used to assess attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control, and behavioral intent. Responses included Likert scale scores and open-ended questions. Data were collected before and following the implementation of WCDs in ICU. The combined effects of attitudes, perceived control and subjective norms on behavioral intent were tested using the general linear model. The narrative data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Attitudes and subjective norms were predictors of behavioral intent to use WCDs preimplementation but not postimplementation. Differences in the factors affecting intent to use WCDs between the ICU and the surgical unit may be related to the unique nature of the critical care environment, and to the lack of a comprehensive preimplementation strategy. A study examining predictors of use on a general inpatient unit where a comprehensive implementation strategy was not employed would provide insight into whether these findings are related to the implementation strategy or the unique nature of the critical care environment. Improved understanding of the function and application of innovative technology at the point of care, and attention to the process of implementation may improve adoption of this potentially beneficial device. ","404":"The feedback loop of incident reporting is essential in improving patient care. Few studies have followed the loop around its cycle and little data are available concerning the impact of interventions. We investigated the feedback loop before and after the implementation of an electronic reporting system. Data were collected before and after our intervention. Data were analyzed in terms of the percentage of incidents evaluated, the percentage of incidents resulting in action, whether correlations demonstrated an increased rate of action taken as incident risk score increased. Prior to our intervention, 43% and 40% of incidents reported were evaluated and acted upon, respectively. Postintervention, the number of incidents reported increased by 198%. All incidents were evaluated and 66% were acted upon. Both pre- and postintervention, no correlations demonstrated an increase in action taken as incident severity increased. Our intervention resulted in a considerable increase in the number of incidents reported, evaluated, and acted upon. Such an effect would be expected to improve patient safety, although further studies are needed to definitively confirm this. We therefore recommend the use of electronic systems and further studies to evaluate their impact on patient safety. ","405":null,"406":"The purpose of our pre-post intervention study was to reduce the number of near-miss events pertaining to wrong-site surgery, including incorrectly sided surgical bookings and incorrectly performed preoperative time-out procedures. Pre- and postintervention, incorrectly booked cases, and improperly performed presurgical time-out procedures were recorded. We then educated each surgeon and their staff regarding the importance of and proper way to perform these tasks. Subsequently, the monthly percentage of incorrectly booked surgical procedures and improperly performed time-outs were significantly decreased. In 2004, the Joint Commission published comprehensive guidelines to prevent wrong-site surgery. Seven years have passed, and the incidence has not declined. The Joint Commission estimates that in the United States, wrong-site procedures including surgeries occur at least 40 times a week. \"Near misses\" are events that could have harmed a patient, but did not due to chance or mitigation. Improperly performed time-out procedures and inaccurate surgical bookings are considered near misses and could ultimately lead to \"never events,\" such as wrong-site surgery. Near-miss analysis is a highly effective method of preventing rare, \"never events.\" We hypothesize that proper education of surgeons and staff will be effective in reducing the number of near misses. All cases analyzed were performed at an academic, orthopedic surgery specialty institution. From August 2010 to May 2011, near misses were identified and stored in Patient Safety Net (PSN), an electronic database. We tracked these cases and educated each offending attending physician and his or her staff about the importance of accurate surgical bookings. Additionally, we began an observational program to carefully review presurgical time-out procedures as they occurred. We tracked the percentage of these improperly performed time-outs and counseled offenders (attending surgeon, or any member of the operating room staff who made the error) regarding the deficiencies that caused the time-out to be ineffective. The number of near misses that occurred before and after the interventions were recorded and analyzed. Of the 12,215 cases included in this study, 6,126 cases formulated the \"pre-education\" cohort, while a total of 6,089 cases formulated the \"post-education\" cohort. In the first four months of the study, the monthly rate of incorrectly booked cases was 0.75%. Since the intervention, the rate decreased to 0.41% (p = .0139). The percentage of improperly performed time-out procedures decreased from 18.7% to 5.9% after the educational interventions were performed (p &lt; .0001). A program designed to educate physicians to the importance of decreasing near misses for wrong-site surgery is effective. When analyzing the literature, it is clear that the reduction in near misses observed in this study decreases the likelihood of a wrong-site surgery. ","407":"Hospitals typically restrict visiting hours to ensure a restful environment for patients and to allow clinical staff to work. With increased public reporting focused on patient satisfaction and renewed efforts to improve patient and family engagement, hospitals may want to consider evaluating their current restrictions on visitation. Liberal visitation practices can decrease patient anxiety and benefit patients and families. Morristown Medical Center, a 690-bed tertiary acute care facility and a 78-bed rehabilitation hospital, initiated a 24-h visitation policy. With input from nurses, physicians, administrators, and security, we developed a policy that emphasizes patient and staff safety and places the patient at the center of decision making. Comparison of patient satisfaction scores before and after the open visitation policy was implemented, which was made using the chi-square test. In the first 8 months of the open visitation policy, the medical center received 14,444 \"after-hours\" (8:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.) visitors. During this period, there was no increase in the number of complaints from patients or visitors. Incidence of security events did not change, despite the higher number of visitors. Patient satisfaction scores rose on both a commercial satisfaction survey and on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. Unit staff received fewer phone calls for patient updates and acknowledged that the experience had been positive. Our experience suggests that implementation of open visitation at acute care and long-term care institutions can be accomplished with little disruption, is well utilized by visitors, improves the patient and family experience, and is generally accepted by hospital staff. ","408":"This study compares rates of completion of client intake forms (CIFs) collected via three interview modes: audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI), face-to-face interview (FFI), and self-administered paper-based interview (SAPI). A total of 303 clients served through the Avon Breast Health Outreach Program (BHOP) were sampled from three U.S. sites. Clients were randomly assigned to complete a standard CIF via one of the three interview modes. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that clients were significantly more likely to complete the entire CIF via ACASI than either FFI or SAPI. The greatest observed differences were between ACASI and SAPI; clients were almost six times more likely to complete the CIF via ACASI as opposed to SAPI (AOR = 5.8, p &lt; .001). We recommend that where feasible, ACASI be utilized as an effective means of collecting client-level data in healthcare settings. Adoption of ACASI in health centers may translate into higher completion rates of intake forms by clients, as well as reduced burden on clinic staff to enter data and review intake forms for completion. ","409":"Recognizing the inconsistencies in sedation practices, the Society for Pediatric Sedation convened this meeting to begin the process of defining quality as it relates to the field of pediatric sedation. Millions of procedures are performed each year on children. Caring for children, even for routine procedures, can be challenging. Children may not have the ability to follow commands, tolerate painful stimuli, or even lie still for a diagnostic study. Therefore, pharmacologic sedation with medications designed to blunt the awareness of the patient and provide relief of pain and anxiety is necessary. A multidisciplinary group of sedation providers and quality methodology experts met in November 2011. Through 2 days of didactics, small workgroups, and consensus discussions, the attendees met the objectives of exploring quality in pediatric sedation around the Institute of Medicine's () six aims of quality: Safe, Effective, Patient Centered, Timely, Efficient, and Equitable. The conference findings outlined in this document address the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) mission of improving quality healthcare for all Americans, especially for underrepresented groups such as children. The conference outlines a key next step in defining and achieving quality in pediatric procedural sedation. ","410":"Hospitalized patients frequently have an incomplete understanding of important aspects of their care. Patient-facing technologies, increasingly used in outpatient settings to exchange information between patient and provider, may have utility in the hospital setting. We conducted structured interviews of hospitalized medical patients to assess current use of information technology, gauge interest in receiving information electronically, and prioritize potential content options. Overall, 150 of 175 (86%) eligible patients completed interviews. A majority (69%) of patients used the Internet prior to hospital admission. One third (32%) of patients had used the Internet during their hospitalization with half of those reporting use for health information. Overall, nearly half (42%) reported interest in receiving health information electronically during hospitalization and a majority (59%) were interested in receiving health information electronically after hospitalization. Patients expressed high interest in receiving information to help them learn more about diagnoses and treatments, medication lists, lists of planned tests, and summaries of completed tests and procedures. Many general medical patients are interested in receiving health information electronically from hospital providers. Our findings support the development of hospital-based patient-facing health information technologies and prioritize content options patients find most beneficial. ","411":"The primary study objective is to assess how three major health reform care coordination initiatives (Accountable Care Organizations, Independence at Home, and Community-Based Care Transitions) measure concepts critical to care coordination for people with multiple chronic conditions. We find that there are major differences in quality measurement across these three large and politically important programs. Quality measures currently used or proposed for these new health reform-related programs addressing care coordination primarily capture continuity of care. Other key areas of care coordination, such as care transitions, patient-centeredness, and cross-cutting care across multiple conditions are infrequently addressed. The lack of a comprehensive and consistent measure set for care coordination will pose challenges for healthcare providers and policy makers who seek, respectively, to provide and reward well-coordinated care. In addition, this heterogeneity in measuring care coordination quality will generate new information, but will inhibit comparisons between these care coordination programs. ","412":"The patient-centered care (PCC) model and the use of health information technology (HIT) are major initiatives for improving U.S. healthcare quality and delivery. A lack of published data on patient perceptions of Internet-based care makes patient-centered implementation of HIT challenging. To help ascertain patients' perceptions of an online intervention, patients completing a 1-year web-based lifestyle intervention were asked to complete a semistructured interview. We used qualitative methodology to determine frequency and types of interview responses. Overall satisfaction with program features was coded on a Likert-type scale. High levels of satisfaction were seen with the online lifestyle coaching (80%), self-monitoring tools (57%), and structured lesson features (54%). Moderated chat sessions and online resources were rarely used. Frequently identified helpful aspects were those that allowed for customized care and shared decision-making consistent with the tenets of PCC. Unhelpful program aspects were reported less often. Findings suggest that despite challenges for communicating effectively in an online forum, the personalized support, high-tech data management capabilities, and easily followed evidence-based curricula afforded by HIT may be a means of providing PCC and improving healthcare delivery and quality. ","413":null,"414":"The Care Transitions Measure (CTM) was designed to assess the quality of patient transitions from the hospital. Many hospitals are using the measure to inform their efforts to improve transitional care. We sought to determine if the measure would have utility for home healthcare providers by predicting newly admitted patients at heightened risk for emergency department use, rehospitalization, or increased home health nursing visits. The CTM was administered to 495 home healthcare patients shortly after hospital discharge and home healthcare admission. Follow-up interviews were completed 30 and 60 days post hospital discharge. Interview data were supplemented with agency assessment and service use data. We did not find evidence that the CTM could predict home healthcare patients having an elevated risk for emergent care, rehospitalization, or higher home health nursing use. Because Medicare\/Medicaid-certified home healthcare providers already use a comprehensive, mandated start of care assessment, the CTM may not provide them additional crucial information. Process and outcome measurement is increasingly becoming part of usual care. Selection of measures appropriate for each service setting requires thorough site-specific evaluation. In light of our findings, we cannot recommend the CTM as an additional measure in the home healthcare setting. ","415":"Hospitals often have limited ability to obtain primary clinical data from electronic health records to use in assessing quality and safety. We outline a new model that uses administrative data to gauge the safety of care at the hospital level. The model is based on a set of highly undesirable events (HUEs) defined using administrative data and can be customized to address the priorities and needs of different users. Patients with HUEs were identified using discharge abstracts from July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2010. Diagnoses were classified as HUEs based on the associated present-on-admission status. The 2-year study population comprised more than 6.5 million discharges from 161 hospitals. The proportion of hospitalizations including at least one HUE during the 24-month study period varied greatly among hospitals, with a mean of 7.74% (SD 2.3%) and a range of 13.32% (max, 15.31%; min, 1.99%). The whole-patient measure of safety provides a global measure to use in assessing hospitals with the patient's entire care experience in mind. As administrative and clinical datasets become more consistent, it becomes possible to use administrative data to compare the rates of HUEs across organizations and to identify opportunities for improvement. ","416":"This quality improvement initiative was designed to increase clinical prevention performance rates in 11 Austin Regional Clinic primary care facilities as part of an accountable care initiative. The initiative was conducted between January 2011 and December 2011. The principal interventions included implementation of a care coordinator and care gap summary tool. The care gap summary includes recommended preventive healthcare services and serves as a prompt for healthcare providers. These interventions led to improvement in clinical prevention performance rates as demonstrated by aggregate organizational data. This initiative demonstrates that quality improvement initiatives including care gap summaries, workflow changes, and provider feedback can increase performance rates for clinical preventive services. ","417":"","418":"Since its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has grown with expanding indications. One factor used to expand indications is device-related complications. We designed a study to evaluate device-related robotic surgery complications reported to FDA. We searched the FDA device-related complication database, LexisNexis, and PACER (Public Access to Court Electronic Records) to identify robotic surgery-related complications over a 12-year period (January 1, 2000 to August 1, 2012). Cases from LexisNexis and PACER were cross-referenced with the FDA database to determine cases where an FDA report was inaccurate, filed late or not filed. A total of 245 events were reported to the FDA during the study period, including 71 deaths and 174 nonfatal injuries. Median time to report an event to the FDA was 30 days (range = 0-930 days). Eight cases were identified from the LexisNexis and PACER searches where FDA reports were improperly filed. In five of these, no report was filed with a mean follow-up of 4.1 years (range = 2.3-5.8 years). In the three cases where a report was filed, the mean time between the event and the FDA report was 20.4 months (611 days, range = 292-930 days). It is important that the true incidence of complications with robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery be known to ensure continued safe innovation. ","419":"Dr. Combes is senior vice president at the American Hospital Association (AHA) and president and COO of the Center for Healthcare Governance. The Interview with Dr. John Combes on Boards and Governance provides a perspective on key changes, issues, competencies, and metrics that hospital boards must address. The role of quality professionals to be effective with boards is also described. ","420":"As part of ongoing efforts to improve quality of care through clinical education of our medical assisting staff, we developed a competency-based training and assessment program. At the time of program implementation, we assessed clinical skills of 111 certified medical assistants and found that 10% were unable to accurately measure blood pressure, 9% were unable to correctly perform an intradermal injection, and 48% were unable to correctly draw specified volumes into syringes. More than 10 years after program implementation, we continue to detect and remediate clinical skills in newly hired employees. This case study report describes the evolution of the program and assessment findings. ","421":"Quality measurement is an important issue for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). In this study, we piloted the use of an informatics tool, the Multithreaded Clinical Vocabulary Server (MCVS), which extracted automatically whether the VA Office of Quality and Performance measures of quality of care were met for the completion of discharge instructions for inpatients with congestive heart failure. We used a single document, the discharge instructions, from one section of the medical records for 152 patients and developed a reference standard using two independent reviewers to assess performance. When evaluated against the reference standard, MCVS achieved a sensitivity of 0.87, a specificity of 0.86, and a positive predictive value of 0.90. The automated process using the discharge instruction document worked effectively. The use of the MCVS tool for concept-based indexing resulted in mostly accurate data capture regarding quality measurement, but improvements are needed to further increase the accuracy of data extraction. ","422":"Low health literacy is more prevalent in persons with limited education, members of ethnic minorities, and those who speak English as a second language, and is associated with multiple adverse diabetes-related health outcomes. This study examined the effectiveness of a low health literacy and culturally sensitive diabetes education program for economically and socially disadvantaged adult patients with type 2 diabetes. A pre-post prospective study design was used to examine outcomes over 12 months. Outcome measures included diabetes knowledge, self-efficacy, and self-care, measured using reliable and valid survey tools, and A1C. Over this period of time 277 patients were enrolled in the program, with 106 participants completing survey data. At the completion of the program patients had significant improvements in diabetes knowledge (p &lt; .001), self-efficacy (p &lt; .001), and three domains of self-care including diet (p &lt; .001), foot care (p &lt; .001), and exercise (p &lt; .001). There were no significant improvements in the frequency of blood glucose testing (p = .345). Additionally, A1C values significantly improved 3 months after completing the program (p = .007). In conclusion, a diabetes education program designed to be culturally sensitive and meet the needs of individuals with low health literacy improves short-term outcomes. ","423":null,"424":"Public demand for safer care has catapulted the healthcare industry's efforts to understand relationships between patient safety and hospital performance. This study explored linkages between staff perceptions of safety culture (SC) and ongoing measures of hospital nursing unit-based structures, care processes, and adverse patient outcomes. Relationships between nursing-sensitive measures of hospital performance and SC were explored at the unit-level from 9 California hospitals and 37 nursing units. SC perceptions were measured 6 months prior to collection of nursing metrics and relationships between the two sets of data were explored using correlational and regression analyses. Significant relationships were found with reported falls and process measures for fall prevention. Multiple associations were identified with SC and the structure of care delivery: skill mix, staff turnover, and workload intensity demonstrated significant relationships with SC, explaining 22-45% of the variance. SC was an important factor to understand in the quest to advance safe patient care. These findings have affordability and care quality implications for hospital leadership. When senior leaders prioritized a safety culture, patient outcomes may have improved with less staff turnover and more productivity. A business case could be made for investing in patient safety systems to provide reliably safe care. ","425":"Transfer of intensive care unit (ICU) patients to the operating room (OR) is a resource-intensive, time-consuming process that often results in patient throughput inefficiencies, deficiencies in information transfer, and suboptimal nurse to patient ratios. This study evaluates the implementation of a coordinated patient transport system (CPTS) designed to address these issues. Using data from 1,557 patient transfers covering the 2006-2010 period, interrupted time series and before and after designs were used to analyze the effect of implementing a CPTS at Mayo Clinic, Rochester. Using a segmented regression for the interrupted time series, on-time OR start time deviations were found to be significantly lower after the implementation of CPTS (p &lt; .0001). The implementation resulted in a fourfold improvement in on-time OR starts (p &lt; .01) while significantly reducing idle OR time (p &lt; .01). A coordinated patient transfer process for moving patient from ICUs to ORs can significantly improve OR efficiency, reduce nonvalue added time, and ensure quality of care by preserving appropriate care provider to patient ratios. ","426":"The well-known \"learning by doing\" may operate in reverse as \"forgetting after not doing.\" If so, patient outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) or mortality may be affected after a surgeon returns from a month-long vacation or break from surgery. In a small, exploratory and hypothesis-screening study, we examined all 56,956 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) in California in 2003-2005. We compared the outcomes of patients operated on by surgeons who had or had not performed any isolated CABG procedures in the calendar month prior to the month of their own surgery. Sensitivity analyses considered surgeons who had performed less than their own typical monthly workload, rather than none at all. We used multivariate regressions and controlled for patient risk factors and long-run surgeon average monthly volume. Patients operated on by surgeons who had not performed isolated CABG in the prior calendar month stayed in hospital 0.5 day longer (p = .037). This LOS difference was not robust to corrections for skewed data and in models correcting for clustering of patients within the practices of surgeons. There were no significant differences in hospital or 30-day mortality. These preliminary findings from a small, exploratory study suggest that short breaks by cardiac surgeons do not affect key patient outcomes. However, the patient safety ramifications of the underlying question deserve more research and more granular data to more convincingly rule out \"forgetting\" effects among physicians taking short breaks from practice. ","427":"After investing significant amounts of time and money in conducting formal risk assessments, such as root cause analysis (RCA) or failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), healthcare workers are left to their own devices in generating high-quality risk control options. They often experience difficulty in doing so, and tend toward an overreliance on administrative controls (the weakest category in the hierarchy of risk controls). This has important implications for patient safety and the cost effectiveness of risk management operations. This paper describes a before and after pilot study of the Generating Options for Active Risk Control (GO-ARC) technique, a novel tool to improve the quality of the risk control options generation process. The quantity, quality (using the three-tiered hierarchy of risk controls), variety, and novelty of risk controls generated. Use of the GO-ARC technique was associated with improvement on all measures. While this pilot study has some notable limitations, it appears that the GO-ARC technique improved the risk control options generation process. Further research is needed to confirm this finding. It is also important to note that improved risk control options are a necessary, but not sufficient, step toward the implementation of more robust risk controls. ","428":"Routine HIV testing in primary care is now recommended in the United States. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has increased the number of patients tested for HIV, but overall HIV testing rates remain low. A promising intervention for increasing HIV testing is nurse-initiated rapid testing (NRT). The purpose of this study was to build upon our previous research by implementing NRT in primary care clinics at two geographically distinct VA medical centers, and then conduct an evaluation to identify the barriers and facilitators to implementing and sustaining it. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with providers and stakeholders at two VA medical centers, one each on the East Coast and in the Southwest. Fieldnotes were developed following each interview and qualitatively coded for emerging themes. Findings indicate NRT was well integrated in both settings. NRT took little time to conduct, was well received by patients, and did not disrupt clinical scheduling. However, there were some sustainability challenges, including difficulties using the electronic medical record, and the challenges of new care practice structures. Implementing NRT is feasible in VA primary care settings. However, organizational challenges should be taken into account for subsequent efforts to implement NRT in VA primary care settings. ","429":"To assess the effect of having a physician or physician's assistant (PA) as patients' first point of contact in our emergency department (ED) on the rate of leaving without being seen (LWBS) and wait time. In before and after intervention conducted in the ED at a 265-bed community hospital, data were collected on all patients presenting to the ED during a 70-month period. A physician or PA was stationed in triage 16 hr a day. The screening process included measurement of vital signs, a brief history and physical examination, and computerized physician order entry. During the study period, volume increased from 86,000 to 102,000 patients per year. Monthly averages for ED visits increased 16%, admissions increased 5%, and ambulance visits increased 18%. The rate of LWBS decreased from 3.1% to 1.7%. Door-to-doctor time decreased by 14 min. Despite an increase in patient census, the LWBS rate and door-to-doctor time decreased. This study of one solution to the issue of ED crowding demonstrates how a process redesign can lead to successful changes in throughput metrics. ","430":"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections pose a significant challenge to U.S. healthcare facilities, but there has been limited study of initiatives to reduce infection and increase patient safety in community hospitals. To address this need, a multifaceted program for MRSA infection prevention was developed for implementation in 159 acute care facilities. This program featured five distinct tools-active MRSA surveillance of high-risk patients, enhanced barrier precautions, compulsive hand hygiene, disinfection and cleaning, and executive champions and patient empowerment-and was implemented during 1Q-2Q 2007. Postintervention (3Q 2007-2Q 2008), 10.2% of patients with high-risk for infection or complications due to MRSA had nasal colonization. Volume of disposable gown and alcohol-based hand sanitizer use increased substantially following program implementation. Self-reported rates, based on NHSN definitions, of healthcare-associated central line-associated bloodstream infections and ventilator-associated pneumonia due to MRSA decreased 39% (p &lt; .001) and 54% (p &lt; .001), respectively. Infection rates continued to decrease during the follow-up period (1Q-4Q 2009). This sustained improvement demonstrates that reducing healthcare-associated MRSA infections in a large number of diverse facilities is possible and that a \"bundled\" approach that translates science into clinical and executive performance expectations may aid in overcoming traditional barriers to implementation.","431":"To assess obstetrician-gynecologists' (ob-gyns') use of multiple conflicting guidelines assess after the release of the 2009 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) breast cancer screening recommendations. A nationally representative sample of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Fellows were invited to complete a survey. A total of 235 of 399 ob-gyns responded (59% response rate). Twenty percent and 89% indicated that USPSTF and ACOG guidelines influence their practice, respectively, 84% are influenced by more than one guideline. The plurality of respondents was able to correctly identify ACOG and USPSTF guidelines on 10 of 12 questions. One-third agreed with both ACOG's and USPSTF's recommendations regarding mammography screening for women 40-49 years old. A total of 42% of the sample made at least one change in their practice after the release of the 2009 USPSTF breast cancer screening guidelines. Some ob-gyns made changes to their practices after the release of the USPSTF guidelines. When multiple guidelines exist, as in the case with breast cancer screening, physicians utilize multiple, and at times conflicting, guidelines. More research will be needed to better understand the impact (negative or positive) of multiple guidelines on the quality of healthcare. ","432":"","433":"The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of a novel quality-improvement (QI) program designed to incorporate multiple robotic surgical sub-specialties in one health care system. A robotic surgery quality assessment program was developed by The Ohio State University College of Medicine (OSUMC) in conjunction with The Ohio State University Medical Center Quality Improvement and Operations Department. A retrospective review of cases was performed using data interrogated from the OSUMC Information Warehouse from January 2007 through August 2009. Robotic surgery cases (n=2200) were assessed for operative times, length of stay (LOS), conversions, returns to surgery, readmissions and cancellations as potential quality indicators. An actionable and reproducible framework for the quality measurement and assessment of a multidisciplinary and interdepartmental robotic surgery program was successfully completed demonstrating areas for improvement opportunities. This report supports that standard quality indicators can be applied to multiple specialties within a health care system to develop a useful quality tracking and assessment tool in the highly specialized area of robotic surgery.","434":"Several years ago, our community teaching hospital identified a need to improve patient care by streamlining the study performance workflow and hastening communication of critical study results to clinicians. \"STAT\" studies are a carefully selected subset of imaging studies that are prioritized due to their utility in assessing for emergent conditions including cerebrovascular accidents, pneumoperitoneum, and cardiac arrest. We describe the multiyear process of data collection, analysis, and departmental and hospital-wide system changes that significantly improved result times. Relatively simple policy changes, such as the distribution of STAT beepers to the team members and creating color-coded worklists, drastically reduced delays.","435":"Historically, California's 17 public hospital systems-those that are county owned and operated, and those University of California medical centers with the mandate to serve low income, vulnerable populations-have struggled to implement Palliative Care Consultation Services (PCCS)-this, despite demonstrated need for these services among the uninsured and Medicaid populations served by these facilities. Since 2008, through a collaborative effort of a foundation, a palliative care training center, and a nonprofit quality improvement organization, the Spreading Palliative Care in Public Hospitals initiative (SPCPH) has resulted in a 3-fold increase in the number of California public hospitals providing PCCS, from 4 to 12. The SPCPH leveraged grant funding, the trusted relationships between California public hospitals and their quality improvement organization, technical assistance and training, peer support and learning, and a tailored business case demonstrating the financial\/resource utilization benefits of dedicated PCCS. This article describes the SPCPH's distinctive design, features of the public hospital PCCS, patient and team characteristics, and PCCS provider perceptions of environmental factors, and SPCPH features that promoted or impeded their success. Lessons learned may have implications for other hospital systems undertaking implementation of palliative care services.","436":"Preventable deaths occur when signs and symptoms of risk and decline are not detected yet are present many hours prior to a deteriorating course. Rapid responses teams (RRTs), also referred to as medical emergency teams (METs) were introduced to improve patient safety by preventing code arrests and death. This research using a case study methodology describes a nurse-led RRT, developed at a large, safety net, teaching hospital in California. Safety-net hospitals are challenged to deliver care and meet the complex needs of vulnerable patient populations. This hospital is a mission driven organization that is focused on the patient and the needs of underserved populations. To respond to the call for reform for patient safety and reduce adverse events, the organization adopted RRTs, early recognition rounds by RRT registered nurses (RNs) and the use of trigger alerts by nursing assistants (NAs) to expand the surveillance and identification of patients most at risk of clinical deterioration. Collaboration with interns and residents (house staff) facilitated their involvement and response to RRT calls. Using quality data from 2005 to 2010, findings from this patient safety innovation address RRT utilization, frequency of non-ICU code arrests, hospital mortality, and post-arrest survival outcomes.","437":"Over 24 million individuals in the United States speak English \"less than very well\" and are considered limited English proficient (LEP). Due to challenges inherent in patient-provider interactions with LEP patients, LEP individuals are at risk for a wide array of negative health consequences. Evidence suggests that having an interpreter present to facilitate interactions between LEP patients and health professionals can mitigate many of these disparities. This article presents the results and lessons learned from Speaking Together: National Language Services Network, a quality improvement (QI) collaborative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to improve the quality of language services (LS) in hospitals. Using five LS performance metrics, hospitals were able to demonstrate that meaningful improvement was possible through targeted QI efforts. By the end of the collaborative, each of the hospitals demonstrated improvement by more than five percentage points on at least one of the five recorded quality metrics. Lessons learned from this work, such as the helpful use of quality metrics to track performance, and the engagement of physician champions and executive leadership to promote improvement can be utilized in hospitals across the country because they seek to improve care for LEP patients.","438":"The Institute of Medicine has identified the need for healthcare organizations to collect standardized demographic data as a step toward reducing healthcare disparities. This observational study of patients discharged from a large academic medical center between 2005 and 2009, evaluates an organizational effort to standardize demographic data collection, characterizes limitations of the implementation, and assesses its utility in quality improvement and disparity reduction efforts. Primary measures include percentages of inpatient discharges with unknown race, ethnicity, and language data. Secondary measures include \"ideal\" cardiovascular care and readmission rates. From 2005 to 2009, the proportion of discharges with unknown race, ethnicity, or preferred language data decreased significantly. Among discharges with known ethnicity in 2009, Hispanic\/Latino patients were significantly more likely to decline to specify their race or designate their race as a \"Multiracial: Other Combination.\" No significant differences in ideal cardiovascular care were observed across demographic groups. Differences in readmission rates were observed among some groups. A provider organization can effectively standardize demographic data collection practices for use in quality improvement efforts. Current federal race categories are of limited utility for persons of Hispanic\/Latino ethnicity, and performance measurement approaches that exclude demographic variables may fail to address healthcare disparities.","439":"Disparities in the quality of cardiovascular care provided to minorities have been well documented, but less is known about the use of quality improvement methods to eliminate these disparities. Measurement is also often impeded by a lack of reliable patient demographic data. The objective of this study was to assess the ability of hospitals with large minority populations to measure and improve the care rendered to Black and Hispanic patients. The Expecting Success: Excellence in Cardiac Care project utilized the standardized collection of self-reported patient race, ethnicity, and language data to generate stratified performance measures for cardiac care coupled with evidence-based practice tools in a national competitively selected sample of 10 hospitals with high cardiac volumes and largely minority patient populations. Main outcomes included changes in nationally recognized measures of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure quality of care and 2 composite measures, stratified by patient demographic characteristics. Quality improved significantly at 7 of the 10 hospitals as gauged by composite measures (p &lt; .05), and improvements exceeded those observed nationally for all hospitals. Three of 10 hospitals found racial or ethnic disparities which were eliminated in the course of the project. Clinicians and institutions were able to join the standardized collection of self-reported patient demographic data to evidence-based measures and quality improvement tools to improve the care of minorities and eliminate disparities in care. This framework may be replicable to ensure equity in other clinical areas.","440":"Most healthcare quality improvement and cost reduction efforts currently focus on care processes, or transitions-for example, the hospital discharge process. While identification and adoption of best practices to address these aspects of healthcare are essential, more is needed for systems that serve vulnerable populations: to account for social factors that often inhibit patients' ability to take full advantage of available healthcare. Our urban safety net healthcare system developed and implemented an innovative quality improvement approach. The programs, Guided Chronic Care(TM) , and Passport to Wellness, use Assertive Care and provide social support for patients between medical encounters, enabling patients to make better use of the healthcare system and empowering them to better manage their conditions. The majority of patients reported problems with mobility and nearly half reported anxiety or depression. Early indications show improved quality of care and significant reduction in costs. Challenges encountered and lessons learned in implementing the programs are described, to assist others developing similar interventions. ","441":"","442":"","443":"Reducing medical error is critical to improving the safety and quality of healthcare. Physician stress, fatigue, and excessive workload are performance-shaping factors (PSFs) that may influence medical events (actual administration errors and near misses), but direct relationships between these factors and patient safety have not been clearly defined. This study assessed the real-time influence of emotional stress, workload, and sleep deprivation on self-reported medication events by physicians in academic hospitals. During an 18-month study period, 185 physician participants working at four university-affiliated teaching hospitals reported medication events using a confidential reporting application on handheld computers. Emotional stress scores, perceived workload, patient case volume, clinical experience, total sleep, and demographic variables were also captured via the handheld computers. Medication event reports (n = 11) were then correlated with these demographic and PSFs. Medication events were associated with 36.1% higher perceived workload (p &lt; .05), 38.6% higher inpatient caseloads (p &lt; .01), and 55.9% higher emotional stress scores (p &lt; .01). There was a trend for reported events to also be associated with less sleep (p = .10). These results confirm the effect of factors influencing medication events, and support attention to both provider and hospital environmental characteristics for improving patient safety. ","444":"Catastrophic medical malpractice payouts, $1 million or greater, greatly influence physicians' practice, hospital policy, and discussions of healthcare reform. However, little is known about the specific characteristics and overall cost burden of these payouts. We reviewed all paid malpractice claims nationwide using the National Practitioner Data Bank over a 7-year period (2004-2010) and used multivariate regression to identify risk factors for catastrophic and increased overall payouts. Claims with catastrophic payouts represented 7.9% (6,130\/77,621) of all paid claims. Factors most associated with catastrophic payouts were patient age less than 1 year; quadriplegia, brain damage, or lifelong care; and anesthesia allegation group. Compared with court judgments, settlement was associated with decreased odds of a catastrophic payout (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22-0.42) and lower estimated average payouts ($124,863; 95% CI, $101,509-144,992). A physician's years in practice and previous paid claims history had no effect on the odds of a catastrophic payout. Catastrophic payouts averaged $1.4 billion per year or 0.05% of the National Health Expenditures. Preventing catastrophic malpractice payouts should be only one aspect of comprehensive patient safety and quality improvement strategies. Future studies should evaluate the benefits of targeted interventions based on specific patient safety event characteristics.","445":"The team functioning assessment tool (TFAT) has been shown to be a reliable behavioral marker tool for assessing nontechnical skills that are critical to the success of ward-based healthcare teams. This paper aims to refine and shorten the length of the TFAT to improve usability, and establish its reliability and construct validity. Psychometric testing based on 110 multidisciplinary healthcare teams demonstrated that the TFAT is a reliable and valid tool for measuring team members' nontechnical skills in regards to Clinical Planning, Executive Tasks, and Team Functioning. Providing support for concurrent validity, high TFAT ratings were predicted by low levels of organizational constraints and high levels of group potency. There was also partial support for the negative relationships between time pressure, leadership ambiguity, and TFAT ratings. The paper provides a discussion on the applicability of the tool for assessing multidisciplinary healthcare team functioning in the context of improving team effectiveness and patient safety for ward-based hospital teams. ","446":"Clinic no shows (NS) create a lost opportunity for provider-patient interaction and impose a financial burden to the healthcare system and on society. We aimed to: (1) to determine the clinical and demographic factors associated with increased NS rates at a children's hospital's subsubspecialty clinics and (2) to estimate the direct institutional financial costs associated with NS events. A comprehensive database was generated from all clinic encounters for 15 subspecialty outpatient clinics (five surgical and 10 medical) between September 12, 2005 and December 30, 2010. Multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify the variables associated with NS events. Direct costs of NS events were estimated using annual revenue for each clinic. A total of 284,275 encounters and 17,024 NS events were available for analysis. Public insurance coverage (Medicaid and Title V), compared to private insurance or self-pay status, was associated with an increased likelihood NS (OR 2.19, 95% CI 2.10-2.28, p &lt; 0.0005 for Medicaid; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.50-1.62, p &lt; 0.0005 for Title V). Compared to patients 21-30 years of age, patients &lt;12 years (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.77-2.45, p &lt; 0.0005) had increased likelihood of NS. Scheduled visits with medical subspecialists were more likely than surgical subspecialty visits to result in a NS (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.63-1.75, p &lt; 0.0005). The predicted annualized lost revenue associated with NS visits was estimated at $730,000 from the 15 clinics analyzed, approximately $210 per NS event. Pediatric subspecialty NS events are common, costly, and potentially preventable. ","447":"The course of sepsis is rapid. Patient outcomes improve when sepsis is diagnosed and treated quickly. The clinical goals of the evidence-based bundled strategies from the International consortium Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) include optimizing timeliness in the delivery of care and creating a continuum for sepsis management that runs from the emergency department (ED) to the acute and critical care settings. Successful implementation of processes that integrate sepsis bundles can improve patient mortality and hospital costs. Improving interprofessional education and collaboration are necessary to facilitate the effective use of bundled strategies. An intervention that included interprofessional education resulted in a statistically significant difference between the three phases studied. There was a statistically significant improvement between the phases for lactate completion X(2) = 16.908 (p &lt; .01) after education. Frequency of blood cultures being obtained before antibiotic administration was nearing statistical significance (p &lt; .054). There was an improvement in time to antibiotic administration between phase 2 (182.09 mean average minutes, SD = 234.06) and phase 3 (91.62 mean average minutes, SD = 167.99).","448":"A strong and inverse relationship between patient satisfaction and wait times in ambulatory care settings has been demonstrated. Despite its relevance to key medical practice outcomes, timeliness of care in primary care settings has not been widely studied. The goal of the quality improvement project described here was to increase patient satisfaction by minimizing wait times using the Dartmouth Microsystem Improvement Curriculum (DMIC) framework and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) improvement process. Following completion of an initial PDSA cycle, significant reductions in mean waiting room and exam room wait times (p = .001 and p = .047, respectively) were observed along with a significant increase in patient satisfaction with waiting room wait time (p = .029). The results support the hypothesis that the DMIC framework and the PDSA method can be applied to improve wait times and patient satisfaction among primary care patients. Furthermore, the pretest-posttest preexperimental study design employed provides a model for sequential repetitive tests of change that can lead to meaningful improvements in the delivery of care and practice performance in a variety of ambulatory care settings over time.","449":"Patient safety is positively influenced by widespread seasonal influenza vaccination of healthcare workers, but yearly vaccination rates have been unacceptably low. As a result, mandatory vaccination programs have been widely discussed as a means of increasing vaccination rates. In the HCA Inc. healthcare system, the multifaceted Influenza Patient Safety Program was designed to encourage the vaccination of over 160,000 employees across the United States. This program included human resources policies, various patient safety strategies, and a vaccination policy featuring the choice of free seasonal influenza vaccination or wearing a mask. With 100% compliance with the policy, the vaccination rate increased from a mean of 58% to over 90% for three consecutive influenza seasons. As healthcare worker vaccination is part of a larger culture of accountability related to quality and infection prevention, this program was resource intense, required a multidisciplinary approach, and was not without challenges to implementation. Essential components included steadfast leadership support, continuous education and communication efforts, and consistent data collection and feedback. This manuscript describes the approach and processes used in this program as well as lessons learned over three seasons in order to aid other providers in developing patient safety programs that include influenza vaccination for healthcare workers. ","450":"Pediatric obesity treatment programs report high attrition rates, but it is unknown if family experience and satisfaction contributes. This review surveys the literature regarding satisfaction in pediatric obesity and questions used in measurement. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Medline, PsychINFO, and CINAHL. Studies of satisfaction in pediatric weight management were reviewed, and related studies of obesity were included. Satisfaction survey questions were obtained from the articles or from the authors. Eighteen studies were included; 14 quantitative and 4 qualitative. Only one study linked satisfaction to attrition, and none investigated the association of satisfaction and weight outcomes. Most investigations included satisfaction as a secondary aim or used single-item questions of overall satisfaction; only one assessed satisfaction in noncompleters. Overall, participants expressed high levels of satisfaction with obesity treatment or prevention programs. Surveys focused predominantly on overall satisfaction or specific components of the program. Few in-depth studies of satisfaction with pediatric obesity treatment have been conducted. Increased focus on family satisfaction with obesity treatment may provide an avenue to lower attrition rates and improve outcomes. Enhancing measurement of satisfaction to yield actionable responses could positively influence outcomes, and a framework, via patient-centered care principles, is provided. ","451":"Central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) are a significant cause of preventable harm. A collaborative project involving a multifaceted intervention was used in the Michigan Keystone Project and associated with significant reductions in these infections. This intervention included the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program, a multifaceted approach to CLABSI prevention, and the monitoring and reporting of infections. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the multifaceted intervention from the Michigan Keystone program could be implemented in Connecticut and to evaluate the impact on CLABSI rates in intensive care units (ICUs). The primary outcome was the NHSN-defined rate of CLABSI. Seventeen ICUs, representing 14 hospitals and 104,695 catheter days were analyzed. The study period included up to four quarters (12 months) of baseline data and seven quarters (21 months) of postintervention data. The overall mean (median) CLABSI rate decreased from 1.8 (1.8) infections per 1,000 catheter days at baseline to 1.1 (0) at seven quarters postimplementation of the intervention. This study demonstrated that the multifaceted intervention used in the Keystone program could be successfully implemented in another state and was associated with a reduction in CLABSI rates in Connecticut. Moreover, even though the statewide baseline CLABSI rate in Connecticut was low, rates were reduced even further and well below national benchmarks. ","452":"The incidence, severity, and associated costs of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infection (CDI) have dramatically increased in hospitals over the past decade, indicating an urgent need for strategies to prevent transmission of C. difficile. This article describes a multifaceted collaborative approach to reduce hospital-onset CDI rates in 35 acute care hospitals in the New York metropolitan region. Hospitals participated in a comprehensive CDI reduction intervention and formed interdisciplinary teams to coordinate their efforts. Standardized clinical infection prevention and environmental cleaning protocols were implemented and monitored using checklists. Monthly data reports were provided to hospitals for facility-specific performance evaluation and comparison to aggregate data from all participants. Hospitals also participated in monthly teleconferences to review data and highlight successes, challenges, and strategies to reduce CDI. Incidence of hospital-onset CDI per 10,000 patient days was the primary outcome measure. Additionally, the incidence of nonhospital-associated, community-onset, hospital-associated, and recurrent CDIs were measured. The use of a collaborative model to implement a multifaceted infection prevention strategy was temporally associated with a significant reduction in hospital-onset CDI rates in participating New York metropolitan regional hospitals. ","453":"The passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) may create an estimated 16 million new Medicaid enrollees. This underscores the need to develop innovative strategies to provide efficient care to this population without compromising quality. To address concerns that consumer-driven health plans (CDHPs) and cost sharing discourage individuals from seeking needed care, we examined the Healthcare Effectiveness Data Information Set (HEDIS) measures of secondary prevention for a CDHP offered to uninsured, non-Medicaid eligible adults with incomes under 200% of the federal poverty level and compared them to the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) benchmarks achieved by national Medicaid and commercially insured health plans. Results suggest that the cost-sharing component in the CDHP plan did not deter these low-income enrollees from pursuing or receiving appropriate care when compared to either Medicaid or commercially insured populations. As these results are only descriptive and not statistical measures, further research is needed with comparable populations and more detailed data for hypothesis testing. ","454":"The number of total knee and hip arthroplasty is predicted to rise 174% and 673%, respectively, over the next 20 years due to the expected rise in the baby boomer population. Along with increased numbers or procedures performed is the rise in cost and potential medical complications from hospitalizations. The purpose of this study is to describe one rural hospital's facility-wide procedure to streamline processes and standardize care without compromising patient medical needs prior to, and during, the acute phase of total knee and hip arthroplasty. Data were compared before and after the facility-wide procedure was implemented. Results found shorter length of hospital stay and significantly more discharges directly home all without increasing medical complications after the facility-wide procedure was implemented.

Implementing an hourly rounding protocol involves a major change in nursing staff workflow and a substantial training and education program to ensure the success of the program. This quasi-experimental study aimed to determine if a standardized hourly rounding process (SHaRP), implemented through a formal education program, would result in improved efficiency, quality, safety, and patient satisfaction metrics when compared to a less standardized process introduced through the traditional train-the-trainer method. Data were collected over a 6-month period and results were trended for an additional 6 months later to determine if significant gains were sustained over time. Significant reductions in call light use during the study period (p = .001) and the number of steps taken by the day-shift staff (p = .02) were seen on the intervention unit. Differences in the number of patient falls, 30-day readmission rates, and patients' perception of care were not statistically significant. ","458":"Heart failure (HF) accounts for 6.5 million hospital days per year. It remains unknown if socioeconomic factors are associated with hospital length of stay (LOS). We analyzed predictors of longer hospital LOS [mean (days), 95% confidence interval (CI)] among participants with incident hospitalized HF (n = 1,300) in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort from 1987 to 2005. In a statistical model adjusted for median household income, age, gender, race\/study community, education level, hypertension, alcohol use, smoking, Medicaid status, and Charlson comorbidity index score, Medicaid recipients experienced a longer LOS (7.5, 6.3-8.9) compared to non-Medicaid recipients (6.2, 5.7-6.7), and patients with a higher burden of comorbidity had a longer LOS (7.5, 6.4-8.6) compared to patients with a lower burden (6.2, 5.7-6.9). Median household income and education were not associated with longer LOS in multivariable models. Medicaid recipients and patients with more comorbid disease may not have the resources for adequate, comprehensive, out-of-hospital management of HF symptoms, and may require a longer LOS due to the need for more care during the hospitalization because of more severe HF. Data on out-of-hospital management of chronic diseases as well as HF severity are needed to further elucidate the mechanisms leading to longer LOS among subgroups of HF patients. ","459":"To assess labor productivity, perceived effectiveness, and sustainability of a national quality program that sought to stimulate efficiency gains through increased labor productivity while maintaining quality through implementing small-scale innovation projects. Longitudinal measures of labor productivity and quality were collected at baseline and after completion of the innovation projects. Perceived effectiveness and sustainability (measured by routinization) were assessed cross-sectionally after project completion. This study was conducted in The Netherlands. Ninety-eight improvement projects in long-term care organizations. A national quality program to stimulate innovative approaches in long-term care. Labor productivity, perceived effectiveness, and sustainability were the main outcome measures. Labor productivity data were available for only 37 (38%) of the 98 projects, 33 (89%) of which demonstrated significantly improved efficiency. Perceived effectiveness was significantly associated with sustainability (0.29; p &lt; .05), but not labor productivity. To achieve sustainability in long-term care, developers of innovative projects must collect better quality information on efficiency gains in terms of labor productivity and focus more on efficiency improvement. More research is necessary to explore relationships between labor productivity, perceived effectiveness, and sustainability. ","460":"This study tested the feasibility of a quality improvement (QI) program that provided first and second year medical students with education in QI processes and demonstrate their utility within the framework of a real-world QI project. Medical students assessed the use of the Surgical Safety Checklist at The Ohio State University Medical Center. Before performing audits students were required to complete a self-paced online program that provided preliminary education in QI, patient safety, leadership, teamwork, and patient-centered care. A 2.5-hr orientation introduced basic operating room protocol, and the surgical checklist audit tool. Orientation included a multimedia simulation of checklist usage and a role-playing exercise simulating its use. Students completed pre- and postparticipation assessments. Results included an increased knowledge of QI methodology, an improved understanding of the evidence supporting the need for QI projects within health systems, and a greater awareness of available QI projects. Students' perspectives changed to indicate an increased belief that QI is the responsibility of all health professionals including physicians, administrators and other staff. This study concluded that QI education can be effectively disseminated to medical students early in their education using existing online tools and experiential QI projects, and can result in actionable QI data supporting hospital improvement initiatives.","461":"The process of quality improvement may involve enhancing or revising existing practices or the introduction of a novel element. Principles of Implementation Science provide key theories to guide these processes, however, such theories tend to be highly technical in nature and do not provide pragmatic nor streamlined approaches to real-world implementation. This paper presents a concisely comprehensive six step theory-based Implementation Science model that we have successfully used to launch more than two-dozen self-sustaining implementations. In addition, we provide an abbreviated case study in which we used our streamlined theoretical model to successfully guide the development and implementation of an HIV testing\/linkage to care campaign in homeless shelter settings in Los Angeles County.","462":null,"463":"Incentives to improve performance are emerging as revenue or financial penalties are linked to the measured quality of service provided. The HCA \"Getting to Green\" program was designed to rapidly increase core measure performance scores. Program components included (1) the \"business case for quality\"-increased awareness of how quality drives financial performance; (2) continuous communication of clinical and financial performance data; and (3) evidence-based clinical protocols, incentives, and tools for process improvement. Improvement was measured by comparing systemwide rates of adherence to national quality measures for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia (PN), and surgical care (SCIP) to rates from all facilities reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). As of the second quarter of 2011, 70% of HCA total measure set composite scores were at or above the 90th percentile of CMS scores. A test of differences in regression coefficients between the CMS national average and the HCA average revealed significant differences for AMI (p = .001), HF (p = .012), PN (p &lt; .001), and SCIP (p = .015). This program demonstrated that presentation of the financial implications of quality, transparency in performance data, and clearly defined goals could cultivate the desire to use improvement tools and resources to raise performance. ","464":"Legislation requires the healthcare industry to directly engage patients through technology. This paper proposes a model that can be used to review hospital websites for features that engage patients in their healthcare. The model describes four levels of patient engagement in website design. The sample consisted of 130 hospital websites from hospitals listed on 2010 and 2011 Most Wired Hospitals. Hospital websites were analyzed for features that encouraged patient interaction with their healthcare according to the levels in the model. Of the four levels identified in the model, websites ranged from \"informing\" to \"collaborative\" in website design. There was great variation of features offered on hospital websites with few being engaging and interactive. ","465":"Despite the recognized relevance of symptom burden in colorectal cancer, there has been limited exploration of whether an individual patient's assessment of the overall quality-of-care received might influence outcome. We evaluated the relationship between patient-reported experience with service quality and survival in 702 returning colorectal cancer patients treated at our institution between July 2007 and December 2010. Overall patient experience \"considering everything, how satisfied are you with your overall experience?\" was measured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from completely dissatisfied to completely satisfied. It was dichotomized into two categories: top box response (7) versus all others (1-6). Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between patient experience and survival. Of 702 patients, 506 were \"completely satisfied\" while 196 were not. On univariate analysis, \"completely satisfied\" patients had a significantly lower risk of mortality compared to those \"not completely satisfied\" (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.98; p = .04). Similarly, on multivariate analysis controlling for stage at diagnosis, treatment history, age, and gender, \"completely satisfied\" patients demonstrated significantly lower mortality (HR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58-0.95; p = .02). Patient experience with service quality was an independent predictor of survival in colorectal cancer, a novel finding in the literature. ","466":"Physician shortages and healthcare reform are important topics in the healthcare field today. The utilization of the skills and professional competencies of nonphysician healthcare providers, as well as collaboration between physicians and nonphysician healthcare providers may in part provide a solution to some current healthcare concerns. The purposes of this study were to describe the range of services provided by nonphysician women's healthcare providers (WHCPs), and to begin to explore the collaborative relationship between obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) and WHCPs. Questionnaires were sent to ob-gyns, certified nurse-midwives, certified midwives, nurse practitioners (NPs), and physician's assistants (PAs) with questions regarding the types of services WHCPs provide, as well as collaboration between ob-gyns and WHCPs. Overall, 62.1% of ob-gyns employ WHCPs. NPs are the most common type of WHCP employed in our sample. WHCPs are more likely to be younger than ob-gyns, and an overwhelming majority of WHCPs in our sample are female. Most reported that they are anticipating an expansion in the roles and services they provide over the next 5 years. In an era of healthcare reform, WHCPs may in part provide a solution to the growing physician shortage. Collaboration between ob-gyns and WHCPs is a key aspect of the changing healthcare environment. ","467":"Care coordination has been a key theme in national forums on healthcare quality, design, and improvement. This article describes the characteristics of a care coordination program aimed at supporting families in building care coordination competencies and providers in the coordination of care across multiple specialties. The program included implementation of a Care Coordination Counselor (CC Counselor) and several supporting tools-Care Binders, Complex Scheduling, Community Resources for Families Database, and a Care Coordination Network. Patients were referred by a healthcare provider to receive services from the CC Counselor or to receive a Care Binder organizational tool. To assess the impact of the counselor role, we compared patient experience survey results from patients receiving CC Counselor services to those receiving only the Care Binder. Our analysis found that patients supported by the CC Counselor reported greater agreement with accessing care coordination resources and identifying a key point person for coordination. Seventy-five percent of CC Counselor patients have graduated from the program. Our findings suggest that implementation of a CC Counselor role and supporting tools offers an integrative way to connect patients, families, and providers with services and resources to support coordinated, continuous care. ","468":"To achieve sustainable reductions in healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), the University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC) deployed a collaborative, systems-level initiative. With the sponsorship of senior leadership, multidisciplinary teams were established to address healthcare-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and respiratory virus infections. The goal of the initiative was to eliminate these four HAIs among medical center inpatients by 2012. In the first 24 months of the project, the number of healthcare-associated MRSA cases decreased 58%; CLABSI cases decreased 54%. Staff and provider compliance with infection prevention measures improved and remained strong, for example, 96% compliance with hand hygiene, 98% compliance with the recommended influenza vaccination program, and 100% compliance with the VAP bundle. Achieving these results required an array of coordinated, systems-level interventions. Critical project success factors were believed to include creating organizational alignment by declaring eliminating HAIs as an organizational breakthrough goal, having the organization's executive leadership highly engaged in the project, coordination by an experienced and effective project leader and manager, collaboration by multidisciplinary project teams, and promoting transparency of results across the organization.","469":"It is often difficult to maintain quality improvement change. Many behavioral strategies have been used to improve uptake of new practices and knowledge. One effective way of changing medication prescribing is audit and feedback with specific educational feedback. The challenge however is to maintain ongoing quality improvement activities. In Australia, unique downloadable \"toolkits\" are now available to assist hospitals to maintain prescribing quality improvement activities. The first designed to improve the management of acute postoperative pain (APOP toolkit) has been piloted. The toolkit includes data collection and educational tools, an automated feedback report on key indicators, with complete instructions for use. The APOP toolkit has been used in 73 hospitals, in two facilitated \"snapshot\" audits. There was continued improvement in performance, assessed by increases in the percentage of patients with measured pain and sedation scores and in those with documented pain management plans at discharge, compared with earlier APOP project audits. Using this example of the APOP toolkit and \"snapshot\" audits, we have now demonstrated that hospitals nationwide are able to undertake quality improvement activities voluntarily to maintain optimal performance. Encouragement, guidance, and availability of ready-made tools developed by a national team facilitate opportunities for ongoing quality improvements.","470":null,"471":"Despite the estimated 1.8 million children admitted to hospitals annually, little is known about the quality of care and the adequacy of resources in hospitals that care for acutely ill infants and children. Using survey data from 3,819 pediatric nurses working in 498 hospitals, we found that nursing resources vary significantly across different types of hospitals that care for children. Nurses working in a children's hospital within a hospital, and on a pediatric unit in a general hospital were more likely than nurses in freestanding children's hospitals to report inadequate nursing resources. We also found that inadequate nursing resources were associated with surveillance left undone and missed changes in patients' condition. These findings have implications for the quality and safety of pediatric care. ","472":"Peer review of the quality of care of the medical staff in a healthcare delivery system, properly executed and utilized, can bring about changes that improve the quality and safety of patient care, enhance clinical performance, and augment physician education. Although all healthcare facilities are mandated to conduct peer reviews, the process of how it is conducted, reported, and utilized varies widely. In 2007, our institution, a large public teaching acute care facility, developed and implemented an electronic Medical Staff Peer Review System (MS-PRS) that replaced the existing paper-based system and created a centralized database for all peer review activities. Despite limited resources and mounting known challenges, we have developed and implemented a system that includes 100% mortality reviews, an ongoing random review for reappointment and operative procedures, and morbidity peer reviews. Parallel to the 4-year implementation of the system, we observed a steady, significant downward trend in the medical malpractice claim rate, which can be attributable in part to the implementation of MS-PRS. In this paper, we share our experiences in the development, outcomes, challenges encountered, and lessons learned from MS-PRS and provide our recommendations to similar institutions for the development of such a system.

For 6 years, Liberty Healthcare Corporation reviewed the survey results on an annual basis to analyze positive and negative trends, monitor company progress toward targeted goals and develop new initiatives to address emerging areas for improvement. As such, the survey provided a simple and inexpensive methodology to gain useful information from employees at all levels and from multiple service sites and business sectors. In particular, it provided a valuable framework for assessing and improving the employees' commitment to the company's mission and values, high standards and ethics, quality of work, and customer satisfaction. The methodology also helped the company to incorporate the philosophy and principles of continuous quality improvement in a unified fashion. Corporate and local leadership used the same measure to evaluate the performance of individual programs relative to each other, to the company as a whole, and to the \"best practices\" standard of highly successful companies that received the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.

We conducted a prospective observational study of MMCs conducted in a teaching hospital between November 2007 and May 2008. Two observers attended the conferences and collected data on the structure of MMCs, the discussion between attendees, and the decisions or actions for quality improvement. Twenty-four MMCs were studied including 146 cases. A majority of the senior physicians present (87.7%) took part in debating the cases; the participation of residents was lower (32.6%) and varied between departments (p &lt; .001). Few paramedical professionals and other attendees participated in the debate. Shortcomings were sought in 91% of cases, but a structured method was used in less than 10% of cases. An analysis of underlying factors contributing to these shortcomings was observed in 75% of cases, with 4% considered structured and thorough. Eighty-five decisions or actions to improve quality of care or patient safety were listed, with 28 of them (33%) planned for implementation. Discussion of adverse events appears to lack a structured method and although a large number of decisions for quality improvement were declared, fewer actions were planned with a timeline. ","476":"More healthcare institutions are using bleach products which are sporicidal to reduce Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). There may be patient and employee concerns about the appearance of bleach residue left on surfaces, odors, and respiratory tract irritation. The intervention used bleach wipes for daily and terminal patient room cleaning to reduce transmission of CDI and was implemented on patient care units with a relatively high incidence of CDI. Both patients and Environmental Services (ES) staff were surveyed to assess their satisfaction of the bleach wipe product used during room cleaning. Patients (n = 94) (91%) continued to be very satisfied with how well their rooms were cleaned every day. Bleach wipes were well tolerated by patients (n = 44) (100%) surveyed on the medical units and less tolerated by patients (n = 50) (22%) on the hematology-oncology units. ES staff (6) reported less satisfaction and more respiratory irritation from using the bleach wipes; however, later their satisfaction improved. ","477":"Severe preeclampsia\/eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are serious obstetric problems worldwide. Quality improvement of care measured by evidence-based indicators is recommended as a recent important strategy; however, the indicators for quality of care of these two conditions have not been established. This study aimed to develop such indicators and assess their validity, reliability, and feasibility at different contextual levels. Of 32 initially valid indicators for care of severe preeclampsia\/eclampsia, after two rounds of Delphi technique, 21 and 30 indicators were agreed to be suitable to monitor care at district and referral hospitals. Of 13 initial indicators for PPH, 8 and 13 indicators were selected, respectively. The interrater reliability of indicators varied from 0.28 to 0.63. At least three-fourths of all indicators rated by local doctors and nurses were assessed as feasible in terms of relevance, measurability, and improvability. The process identified reliable and feasible performance indicators to monitor quality of care in severe preeclampsia\/eclampsia and PPH for either basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric care (EmOC). The informative applicability of these indicators in clinical practice needs further evaluation.","478":"Patient recognition of hospital providers is low and may affect patient knowledge and satisfaction with care. Our study aimed to determine the association between patient knowledge of their inpatient providers' face, name, or role with knowledge of their diagnosis, satisfaction with care, and 30-day readmission rate. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of inpatients discharged from medicine housestaff teams from 2008 to 2009. Patients identified providers by face, name, and role and stated their reason for hospitalization. The Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey assessed patient satisfaction with care. Eighty-nine of 95 patients (94%) participated. Seventy-five percent of patients recognized one provider face, 28% knew at least one provider name, and 21% correctly stated provider roles. Fifty-seven percent of patients knew their diagnosis. Satisfaction with care via HCAHPS varied: 78% always felt treated with courtesy and respect; 75% felt doctors always listened; and 67% felt complete involvement in care decisions. In bivariate and multivariate analyses, knowledge of providers by face, name, or role was not associated with knowledge of diagnosis, satisfaction, or 30-day readmission rates (all p&gt;.05). Thus, patient recognition of providers was not associated with their knowledge, satisfaction, or readmission.","479":"The purpose of this study was to assess malpractice concerns, career satisfaction, defensive medicine, experience with liability lawsuits, and changes in breast care practices among obstetricians and gynecologists (ob-gyns) who provide breast care. Four hundred ACOG Fellows were randomly selected and invited to participate, 247 (62%) responded. A majority of responders had increased the number of referrals for the diagnosis of breast abnormalities (58.9%) and treatment of breast disease (53.6%) due to fears and concerns regarding malpractice. On average, there was a high level of career satisfaction (M=8.5 [SD=2.5] on a scale from 0 to 10); however, those who had been sued were significantly less satisfied than those who had not. Physicians who had decreased breast surgical procedures and increased referrals for diagnosis and treatment of breast disease reported practicing defensive medicine more frequently. In a regression analysis, having been sued was a significant predictor of practicing defensive medicine more often. Physicians from states with malpractice crisis reported practicing defensive medicine more frequently and more lawsuits than physicians from stable states. Malpractice fears and defensive medicine continue to affect the practices of ob-gyns, most specifically, as this study shows, ob-gyns who provide breast care.","480":"Previous investigation at our resident-teaching, family medicine clinics determined that &gt;80% of adult patients have body mass index (BMI) recorded in the electronic medical record. The quality of this measure, however, is not known. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of documented BMI. We used an observational study design to determine the means by which clinic staff obtain height and weight values from patients. We found that staff only obtained 35.4% of these measurements according to protocol. The major reason for noncompliance with protocol was that shoes were not removed for the measurements. Our investigation indicated that providers, quality improvement teams, and researchers should not assume the accuracy of the recorded BMI. Future investigation is warranted to improve the quality of these measurements in the outpatient setting.","481":"Suzanne F.

There are no national requirements for measuring or reporting hospital SSI rates and state-level monitoring occurs with little coordination between states. We designed a study to describe the current status of SSI reporting in the United States. We reviewed SSI monitoring and reporting legislation in all 50 states in September 2010. Data collected included whether SSI monitoring and reporting legislation exists, if public reporting is required, how the data are accessible, and for which procedures SSI data are reported. Twenty-one (42%) states have legislation for SSI monitoring and reporting. All 21 of these states require public release of findings. Of the states with legislation, eight (38%) currently have SSI data available publicly. A range of two to seven procedures were reported for SSI measurement by individual states. Eighteen (86%) states use state agency websites to make their data publicly available. There is wide variation in state monitoring and reporting of SSI rates.

We describe our experience of using FMEA as a prospective risk-management technique in radiation oncology at a national network of oncology hospitals in the United States, capitalizing not only on the use of a team-based tool but also creating momentum across a network of collaborative facilities seeking to learn from and share best practices with each other. The major steps of our analysis across 4 sites and collectively were: choosing the process and subprocesses to be studied, assembling a multidisciplinary team at each site responsible for conducting the hazard analysis, and developing and implementing actions related to our findings. We identified 5 areas of performance improvement for which risk-reducing actions were successfully implemented across our enterprise. ","486":"The transmission of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is evident in healthcare facilities across the country and poses a risk for patients and communities. A comprehensive infection control program along with an active surveillance process was developed and implemented in a 50-bed long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) in the southeastern United States. Patients are admitted from surrounding hospitals, have an expected stay of at least 25 days, and are acutely ill. The majority of the patient population is ventilator dependent, immunocompromised, and treated with antimicrobials. The program, implemented in December 2009, utilized a tiered approach that included environmental cleaning and disinfection, diagnostics and surveillance, and infection control measures including antibiotic stewardship. The goal of this study was to decrease the incidence rate of CDI 15% by June 2010. Based upon year-end results, the facility achieved a 27.61% decrease in the CDI rate. During the following 12 months, the program continued to demonstrate sustainability resulting in a 23.0% decrease in the CDI rate. This program was successful in decreasing the incidence of CDI in the LTACH creating a safe and cost-effective environment for patients, families, and the community.","487":"The Obstetrician-Gynecologist Statistical Literacy Questionnaire (OGSLQ) was designed to examine physicians' understanding of various number tasks that are relevant to obstetrician-gynecologists (ob-gyns) practice. Forty-seven percent of the nationally representative, practicing ob-gyns responded. Physicians did poorly on the questions about numerical facts (e.g., number of women living with HIV\/AIDS), better on questions about statistical concepts (e.g., incidence, prevalence), and best on questions about numerical relationships (e.g., convert frequency to percentage) with 0%, 7%, 36%, answering all correctly, respectively. Only 19% correctly estimated the number of U.S. women with cancer. Sixty-six percent were able to use sensitivity and specificity to choose a test option. Around 90% could translate between frequency and probability formats. Forty-nine percent of respondents were able to calculate the positive predictive value of a mammography screening test. Physicians lack some understanding of statistical literacy. It is important that we monitor physicians' statistical literacy and provide training to students and physicians. ","488":"The appropriate handover of patients, whereby responsibility and accountability of care is transferred between healthcare providers, is a critical component of quality healthcare delivery. This paper examines data from recent incidents relating to clinical handover in acute care settings, in order to provide a basis for the design and implementation of preventive and corrective strategies. A sample of incidents (n = 459) relating to clinical handover was extracted from an Australian health service's incident reporting system using a manual search function. Incident narratives were subjected to classification according to the system safety and quality concepts of failure type, error type, and failure detection mechanism. The most prevalent failure types associated with clinical handover were those relating to the transfer of patients without adequate handover 28.8% (n = 132), omissions of critical information about the patient's condition 19.2% (n = 88), and omissions of critical information about the patient's care plan during the handover process 14.2% (n = 65). The most prevalent failure detection mechanisms were those of expectation mismatch 35.7% (n = 174), clinical mismatch 26.9% (n = 127), and mismatch with other documentation 24.0% (n = 117). The findings suggest the need for a structured approach to handover with a recording of standardized sets of information to ensure that critical components are not omitted. Limitations of existing reporting processes are also highlighted.","489":"Improving outcomes is a central theme in the national healthcare reform discussions and the ongoing debate centers on ways to limit escalating costs while maintaining excellent patient outcomes. Facilities need to be able to make sense of their \"numbers,\" implement appropriate change in practice, evaluate the impact of this change, and understand what the new numbers are really conveying to the public. The need for a dynamic, longitudinal data system that allows rapid response to new insights and discoveries must be available on a local level. Atrial fibrillation, an electrical conduction disorder of the heart that carries significant morbidity with its onset, is a chronic condition that currently affects over 2 million people in the United States. Our institute has performed over 450 surgeries for atrial fibrillation and is one of the few facilities nationwide that offers surgery for atrial fibrillation. As an exemplar, we describe our experience with the establishment of a database process that links hospital databases together as well as creates a patient's longitudinal record of follow-up that includes later events, interventions, and outcomes out to 5 years. Furthermore, we discuss how these data have changed our practice and go beyond the reporting of just numbers.","490":"In response to concerns regarding delays in transferring critically ill patients to intensive care units (ICU), a quality improvement project, using the Six Sigma process, was undertaken to correct issues leading to transfer delay. To test the efficacy of a Six Sigma intervention to reduce transfer time and establish a patient transfer process that would effectively enhance communication between hospital caregivers and improve the continuum of care for patients. The project was conducted at a 714-bed tertiary care hospital in Staten Island, New York. A Six Sigma multidisciplinary team was assembled to assess areas that needed improvement, manage the intervention, and analyze the results. The Six Sigma process identified eight key steps in the transfer of patients from general medical floors to critical care areas. Preintervention data and a root-cause analysis helped to establish the goal transfer-time limits of 3 h for any individual transfer and 90 min for the average of all transfers. The Six Sigma approach is a problem-solving methodology that resulted in almost a 60% reduction in patient transfer time from a general medical floor to a critical care area. The Six Sigma process is a feasible method for implementing healthcare related quality of care projects, especially those that are complex. ","491":"Using data from an improvement collaborative, we examined whether facility-specific conclusions regarding the success of efforts to improve timely access could vary depending on the type of measure used. The sample was drawn from 21 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) medical facilities participating in a collaborative on timely diagnostic evaluation following positive fecal occult blood tests (FOBT+). We identified FOBT+ cases from participating facilities between September 2004 and August 2005 (precollaborative), and September 2006-August 2007 (postcollaborative). Dates of FOBT+ results, colonoscopy, and death were extracted from VHA medical records. We estimated the cumulative proportion receiving colonoscopy within 2 months of the FOBT+ (target measure established by collaborative), and compared facility-specific results regarding improvement on this measure to results from measures of the cumulative proportion receiving colonoscopy within 12 months, and average time-to-colonoscopy. In 12 facilities (57%), all measures suggested consistent results regarding pre-post collaborative changes in colonoscopy rates. In four facilities (19%), the target measure suggested less favorable change, and in five (24%), more favorable change than one or both other measures. Because conclusions drawn about the success of QI efforts can vary by the measure used, multiple measures should be employed to track progress toward timeliness goals.","492":"Finding the optimal geographic location for a medical service is a common challenge for healthcare organizations. However, there is limited use or description of methods to determine the optimal location of a medical service. We describe a case study of how location-allocation techniques used by industrial engineers assisted a regional healthcare network develop a plan for optimal location of sleep medicine services within its network.","493":"Several studies have found poor or mixed performance by safety net hospitals on national measures of quality. The study's purposes were to determine whether safety net hospital performance is similar to the average U.S. hospital, both currently and during earlier reporting periods, and to summarize features commonly used to assess performance, including definition of safety net and patient characteristics. This study reviewed quality performance data for the Joint Commission's accountability measures for hospitals that are members of the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems (NAPH)-safety net hospitals that serve a large proportion of Medicaid and uninsured patients. Analyses of quality performance on the earliest data show that on average there was no statistically significant difference in performance between NAPH members and other hospitals on 6 of 15 measures. According to the most recent data, NAPH hospitals on average had no statistically significant differences as other hospitals on 13 of 18 measures and had statistically significantly better scores on two measures. These results are an important addition to the literature regarding safety net hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicaid, low income, and uninsured patients, and support the case that quality of care at safety net hospitals is equivalent to that of non-safety net hospitals.","494":"Emergency Departments (EDs) face significant challenges in providing efficient, quality, safe, cost-effective care. Lean methodologies are a proposed framework to redesign ED practices and processes to meet these challenges. We outline a systematic way that lean principles can be applied across the entire ED patient experience to transform a high volume ED in a safety net hospital. We review the change in ED performance metrics prior to and after lean implementation. We discuss critical insights and key lessons learned from our lean transformation to date. The steps to implementing lean principles across the patient's ED experience are described with specific attention to executive planning of rapid improvement experiments and the subsequent roll-out of lean transformation over an 18-month time frame. Basic ED performance data were compared to the year prior. Results of the exploratory analysis (using median and interquartile ranges and nonparametric tests for group comparisons) have shown improvement in several performance metrics after initiating lean transformation. The approach, lessons learned, and early data of our transformation can provide critical insights for EDs seeking to incorporate continuous improvement strategies. Key lessons and unique challenges encountered in safety net hospitals are discussed.","495":"The objectives of this study were to describe state policies for the frequency of adverse event reporting and follow-up that occurs in U.S. nursing homes, and to identify the health information technology used to facilitate these processes. The study was conducted using a mailed survey to the Departments of Health (DOH) in all 50 states, specifically the department that is responsible for the oversight and regulation of nursing home care. Thirty-two state DOH representatives participated. The primary variables examined were (1) which incidents were most commonly reported to state DOH and (2) whether or not they were followed up with a surveyor visit to the nursing home. There was wide variation in incident reporting processes across all states and lack of a standardized process. Abuse is the only adverse event that almost always is required to be reported to the state DOH and has the highest incidence of follow-up with a surveyor visit. Improving and standardizing adverse event reporting systems is a necessary strategy to enhance patient safety in nursing homes. This study provides an important step by increasing our knowledge base of the current state of adverse event reporting policies and processes at the state level.","496":"To address the high incidence of infusion errors, manufacturers have replaced the development of standard infusion pumps with smart pump systems. The implementation and ongoing optimization processes for smart pumps are more complex, as they require larger coordinated efforts with stakeholders throughout the medication process. If improper implementation\/optimization processes are followed, hospitals invest in this technology while extracting minimal benefit. We assessed the processes hospitals employed when migrating from standard to smart infusion systems, and the extent to which they leveraged their investments from both a systems and resource perspective. Twenty-nine hospitals in Ontario, Canada, were surveyed that had either implemented smart pump systems or were in the process of implementing, representing a response rate of 69%. Results demonstrated that hospitals purchased smart pumps for reasons other than safety, did not involve a multidisciplinary team during implementation, made little effort to standardize drug concentrations or develop drug libraries and dosing limits, seldom monitored how nurses use the pumps, and failed to ensure wireless connectivity to upgrade protocols and download use data. Consequently, they are failing to realize the safety benefits these systems can provide.","497":"The Institute of Medicine released a consensus report in October 2010, titled The Future of Nursing (FON): Leading Change, Advancing Health, which concluded significant change was needed in nurses' roles, responsibilities, and education to meet the increased demand for care that will be created by health care reform and to advance improvements in America's increasingly complex health system (http:\/\/www.iom.edu\/Reports\/2010\/The-Future-of-Nursing-Leading-Change-Advancing-Health.aspx). Dr. Donna Shalala, Chair of the study, and Dr. Linda Burnes Bolton, Vice Chair of the study, spoke about the Future of Nursing (FON) at the Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC) conference to a predominately nursing and quality professional audience. This follow-up interview expands the discussion specifically for quality professionals, many of whom are nurses.","498":"A growing body of evidence suggests that patients who receive coordinated and uninterrupted health care services have better outcomes, more efficient resource utilization, and lower costs of health care. However, limited research has considered whether attributes of continuity in home health care service delivery are associated with improved patient outcomes. The present study examines the relationship between one dimension of continuity of care, consistency in nursing personnel, and three patient outcomes: hospitalization, emergent care, and improvement in activities of daily living. Analyses of data from a large population of home health patients (N=59,854) suggest that greater consistency in nursing personnel decreases the probability of hospitalization and emergent care, and increases the likelihood of improved functioning in activities of daily living between admission and discharge from home health care. These results provide preliminary evidence that efforts to decrease dispersion of nursing personnel across a series of home visits to patients may lead to improved outcomes. The implications of these findings for clinical practice and further research are discussed in the paper.","499":"Application of Six-Sigma methodology and Change Acceleration Process (CAP)\/Work Out (WO) tools to track pap smear results in an outpatient clinic in a hospital-based residency-training program. Observational study of impact of changes obtained through application of Six-Sigma principles in clinic process with particular attention to prevention of sentinel events. Using cohort analysis and applying Six-Sigma principles to an interactive electronic medical record Soarian workflow engine, we designed a system of timely accession and reporting of pap smear and pathology results. We compared manual processes from January 1, 2007 to February 28, 2008 to automated processes from March 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009. Using the Six-Sigma principles, CAP\/WO tools, including \"voice of the customer\" and team focused approach, no outlier events went untracked. Applying the Soarian workflow engine to track prescribed 7 day turnaround time for completion, we identified 148 pap results in 3,936, 3 non-gynecological results in 15, and 41 surgical results in 246. We applied Six-Sigma principles to an outpatient clinic facilitating an interdisciplinary team approach to improve the clinic's reporting system. Through focused problem assessment, verification of process, and validation of outcomes, we improved patient care for pap smears and critical pathology.","500":"Provisions within the recently passed health reform law provide support for new approaches to reducing the high cost of care for clinically complex patients. This article describes the characteristics of a recent transitional care pilot initiative that aims to reduce hospital readmissions among high-risk heart failure patients. The program was designed and implemented through a joint collaboration between a Certified Home Healthcare Agency and regional hospital. As a preliminary assessment of the impact of this program on patient outcomes, we compare the odds of rehospitalization among patients who received the transitional care services (n = 223) and a similar group of patients who received usual home care services (n = 224). Analyses indicated that patients who received the transitional care services were significantly less likely to be readmitted to the hospital than the patients in the control group. Although preliminary, our findings suggest that providing transitional care services to high-risk heart failure patients can be an effective deterrent against patterns of rehospitalization. The opportunities and challenges associated with implementing this pilot program are discussed.","501":"To explore whether hospital discharge practices meets the needs of the family carer of a person with dementia. Qualitative methodology utilizing semistructured interviews with the primary family carer of a person with dementia after hospital discharge. Purposive sampling methods were used to recruit family carers within 2 months of discharge from hospitals in the state of Victoria, Australia. Twenty-five family carers were interviewed. Key issues that families found problematic include: coordination of discharge planning, the ability of the staff to address family members' needs, poor engagement with family, and perceived lapses in care delivery. Findings suggest that a number of changes to hospital processes and health professionals' practices are needed in order to better meet the transitional needs of family carers of people with dementia. Considerations for practice to improve the quality of hospital discharge preparation for family carers of people with dementia are provided.","502":"To identify an approach to summarizing publicly reported hospital performance data for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or heart failure (HF) that best predicts current year hospital mortality rates. A total of 1,868 U.S. hospitals reporting process and outcome measures for AMI and HF to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) from July 2005 to June 2006 (Year 0) and July 2006 to June 2007 (Year 1). Observational cohort study measuring the percentage variation in Year 1 hospital 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rate explained by denominator-based weighted composite scores summarizing hospital Year 0 performance. Data were prospectively collected from hospitalcompare.gov. Percentage variation in Year 1 mortality was best explained by mortality rate alone in Year 0 over other composites including process performance. If only Year 0 mortality rates were reported, and consumers using hospitals in the highest decile of mortality instead chose hospitals in the lowest decile of mortality rate, the number of deaths at 30 days that potentially could have been avoided was 1.31 per 100 patients for AMI and 2.12 for HF (p &lt; .001). Public reports focused on 30-day risk-adjusted mortality rate may more directly address policymakers' goals of facilitating consumer identification of hospitals with better outcomes. ","503":"Dr. Verna Gibbs describes the \"NoThing Left Behind\" Program designed to eliminate retained devices from surgical procedures. She explains the genesis of the program along with adjuncts to counting including computer-assisted sponge count, radiofrequency detection system, radiofrequency identification system, and the Sponge ACCOUNTing system. She provides comments on the use of these adjuncts with responses on their effectiveness on improving safety.","504":"The aim of this review is to evaluate the application of value-added processes in healthcare, with an emphasis on their effects on bedside nursing. Literature relevant to Lean methodology and inpatient care was reviewed, excluding all research related to other service lines (i.e., surgical services, emergency services, laboratory, radiology, etc.). Increased value is also an important tenet of transforming care at the bedside (TCAB), an initiative launched by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). Therefore, articles concerning TCAB were also included in this review. A systematic study of the literature revealed varied applications of Lean principles in practice, ranging from the implementation of a single tool, to full organizational restructuring. All articles reviewed reported positive results, although the majority lacked strong supporting evidence for claims of improvement. Even though there is some indication that the application of Lean principles to nursing processes is successful in improving specific outcomes, the authors cannot conclude that the implementation of Lean methodology or TCAB greatly influences direct patient care, or increases time spent at the bedside.","505":"Sepsis is recognized as an often-lethal disease. Recommended guidelines are complex and time sensitive. Response teams (RTs) have demonstrated success in implementation of quality initiatives. The purpose of this study was to evaluate variations in noncompliance with recommended sepsis guidelines overall and between a sepsis-focused RT and standard care. This retrospective chart review categorized septic patients based on treatment by a sepsis response team (SRT) versus standard care (non-SRT). Guideline compliance was based upon the Surviving Sepsis evaluation and treatment guidelines. Patient records for 123 identified septic patients post first-year implementation were evaluated. Overall, compliance rates were low and there were variations in compliance between the treatment providers. The SRT was more compliant than the non-SRT. SRT noncompliance was more often due to failure to achieve therapeutic goals within the recommended time. Mortality benefit was not statistically significant between groups; however mortality was higher in the non-SRT group. Noncompliance is more complex than simple failure to initiate, especially in time-dependent therapies. The development and education of an RT demonstrates improvement in application of sepsis-focused therapies over standard care. ","506":"Because the economic crisis in the United States continues to have an impact on healthcare organizations, industry leaders must optimize their decision making. Discrete-event computer simulation is a quality tool with a demonstrated track record of improving the precision of analysis for process redesign. However, the use of simulation to consolidate practices and design efficiencies into an unfinished medical office building was a unique task. A discrete-event computer simulation package was used to model the operations and forecast future results for four orthopedic surgery practices. The scenarios were created to allow an evaluation of the impact of process change on the output variables of exam room utilization, patient queue size, and staff utilization. The model helped with decisions regarding space allocation and efficient exam room use by demonstrating the impact of process changes in patient queues at check-in\/out, x-ray, and cast room locations when compared to the status quo model. The analysis impacted decisions on facility layout, patient flow, and staff functions in this newly consolidated practice. Simulation was found to be a useful tool for process redesign and decision making even prior to building occupancy.","507":"Hospitalist services are increasing in popularity and fewer primary care providers (PCPs) are caring for patients while hospitalized. Due to concerns with discontinuity of care, this study evaluated communication and medication discrepancies on admission and discharge between PCPs without admitting privileges and hospitalist physicians. This retrospective analysis evaluated patients from a PCP office admitted to hospitalist services from January 2009 through July 2009. Patient charts were evaluated for PCP, age, gender, insurance, modes and timeliness of PCP notification, medications on admission and discharge, and medication discrepancies. A total of 120 charts were evaluated. Physicians were contacted by receipt of admission summaries for 93% of patients and by phone for 5.8% of patients. Twenty-one percent of admission summaries were received by the PCP after the patient was discharged from the hospital and 7% of discharge summaries were received after the first hospital follow-up with the PCP. Medication errors occurred frequently and the rate increased in patients at least 65 years old, if they had Medicare, Medicaid, or were without insurance coverage. Better communication and documentation of medication regimens are needed to improve continuity of care of patients between outpatient and inpatient settings and avoid potentially harmful medication errors. ","508":"The goal of this article is to provide a succinct scan of the literature as it relates to the current thinking and practice in large-scale improvement initiatives in healthcare. We employed a scan of the literature using a modified Delphi technique. A standard review form was used. The scan was limited to large-scale spread efforts in hospitals and healthcare systems. Each of the main factors that emerged during the scan was linked to secondary factors and organized using a driver diagram. Four primary drivers (factors) emerged during our scan that inform large-scale change initiatives in healthcare: Planning and Infrastructure; Individual, Group, Organizational, and System Factors; The Process of Change; and Performance Measures and Evaluation. Our scan identified a tremendous amount of work being done around the world to improve healthcare. In general, our findings suggest these initiatives tend to be fragmented from an implementation standpoint. We identified primary and secondary drivers (factors) that can be used by those responsible for implementing large-scale improvement initiatives both at a strategy level and in their daily work. These drivers could serve as a \"checklist\" of ideas to consider in different testing and implementation situations. ","509":"This was an evaluation of the efforts of five hospitals that participated in a collaborative aimed at improving patient flow and reducing emergency department (ED) crowding. Interviews with hospital implementation team members were conducted at two separate times, and multivariate linear regression models and bivariate logistic models were constructed to assess changes in ED length of stay (LOS) and left without being seen (LWBS). By the end of the collaborative, four of the five hospitals had at least one fully implemented improvement strategy. Those hospitals experienced modest improvements in patient flow: a hospital that implemented front-end improvements and devoted additional resources to fast track had a 51-min reduction in ED LOS, another that implemented only front-end improvements had a 9-min reduction in LOS, a third hospital that improved communication between the ED and inpatient units to facilitate admissions decreased LWBS from 0.6% to 0.4%, and a fourth hospital reduced LOS by 59 min for mid-acuity patients by establishing a new care process for them. Results suggest that relatively small changes may lead to improvements in measures of patient flow that are modest, at best.","510":"The purpose of this study was to examine falls as an outcome measure at 12 months for two-group comparison (delirium cases and noncases) and five-group comparison (noncases, hypoactive, hyperactive, mixed delirium cases, and subsyndromal delirium cases). Three hundred and twenty patients enrolled in the Delirium in Rural Long-Term Care Facilities Study, which examined subjects for delirium during a 28-day surveillance period, were followed longitudinally for fall events for 12 months. Fall events were recorded and data analyzed using date of \"first fall\" as the referent for statistical analysis. Fall reports were completed for all subjects for 12 months following delirium surveillance. Fall records were reviewed and the number of days until the first fall event was calculated. Data were censored for deaths that occurred during the 12-month period. Five group analysis of variance (noncases, hyperactive delirium, hypoactive delirium, mixed delirium, and subsyndromal delirium) showed significant differences in Functional Independence Measure scores (p = .001) and number of medications (p = .001). The percentage of patients who fell was higher in all delirium subtypes than in noncases at 12 months and was statistically significant for subsyndromal subjects. Two patients, one each from the subsyndromal and mixed delirium subtypes, died from injuries sustained during falls. Delirium appears to increase the risk for falls. Increased surveillance and fall prevention strategies are needed for patients who experience transient cognitive changes such as delirium and subsyndromal delirium, even after delirium resolution.

The quality rating system consists of three domains: nursing home inspection results, staffing, and quality measures (QMs) and an overall rating calculated from the three domains. The Five-Star System has both advocates and detractors. One source of criticism about the rating system is its lack of input from consumer surveys. Although different dimensions of quality have been recognized as important by the experts and studied in the literature, how these dimensions are linked with each other is largely unknown. This article describes an analysis of the relationship between overall experience of care ratings from a family survey and ratings obtained on the CMS Five-Star Quality Rating for Maryland nursing homes. The results indicated a strong positive correlation between family experience of care score and two five-star domains, namely health inspections and nurse staffing, and no relationship with the quality domain. The lack of relationship between the quality domain and the family score may be due to inadequate risk adjustment or that each rating system measures different aspects of quality.","513":"Despite the growing literature on health care quality, few patient satisfaction studies have focused upon the public health setting; where many Hispanic patients receive care. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in satisfaction between English and Spanish-speaking patients in a local health department clinical setting. We conducted a paper-based satisfaction survey of patients that visited any of the seven Jefferson County Department of Health primary care centers from March 19 to April 19, 2008. Using Chi-squared analyses we found 25% of the Spanish-speaking patients reported regularly having problems getting an appointment compared to 16.8% among English-speakers (p &lt; .001). Results of logistic regression analyses indicated that, despite the availability of interpreters at all JCDH primary care centers, differences in satisfaction existed between Spanish and English speaking patients controlling for center location, purpose of visit, and time spent waiting. Specifically, Spanish speaking patients were more likely to report problems getting an appointment and less likely to report having their medical problems resolved when leaving their visit as compared to those who spoke English. Findings presented herein may provide insight regarding the quality of care received, specifically regarding patient satisfaction in the public health setting.","514":"Performance of nurses has a direct effect on the quality and safety of care that is delivered. Fatigue has been identified as a factor that leads to performance decrements in healthcare workers, especially nurses. Determining associations between dimensions of fatigue and performance is imperative to better understanding fatigue in nurses and the potential implications for both patient and provider safety. This article identifies associations between ranges of fatigue levels and significant differences in perceived performance, and analyzes interactions between fatigue dimensions in relation to perceived performance scores. Overall, mental fatigue tended to have higher perceived performance decrements than physical and total fatigue in the highest fatigue ranges. As physical fatigue begins to develop in nurses, physical exertion rather than discomfort is more critical to perceived performance. As acute fatigue levels increase, perceived performance levels continue to decrease, whereas the role of chronic fatigue is relatively constant. Minimizing the development of acute fatigue may help in maintaining higher performance levels. The findings from this study provide valuable information in quantifying the changes in perceived performance with regard to specific fatigue levels, as well as an initial understanding of how the individual dimensions and states of fatigue vary in their association with perceived performance decrements.","515":"Individuals living with serious mental illness (SMI) experience excess mortality due to natural causes. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes are twice as prevalent in SMI populations as in the general population, and this may be partly related to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and the use of antipsychotic medications. This review examined comparative studies of quality of care in SMI and non-SMI populations, and studies investigating cardio-metabolic screening in patients prescribed antipsychotics. We identified that individuals with SMI are around 30% less likely than those without SMI to receive hospital care for CVD and diabetes complications, to receive blood glucose, lipid, and other diabetes tests, to undergo invasive procedures, and to be prescribed medications known to be effective in the treatment of CVD and diabetes. In addition, less than 30% of individuals with SMI may receive examinations for weight, blood glucose, and lipids, before or during treatment with antipsychotics. Evidence from studies within the U.S.' Veteran Affairs health care system indicates that the integration of physical and mental health services may be beneficial in reducing disparities in health care for individuals with SMI. Clear policies, which identify practitioner responsibilities for cardio-metabolic screening in patients receiving antipsychotic therapy must be disseminated.","516":"Multidisciplinary cancer centers require an integrated, collaborative, and stream-lined workflow in order to provide high quality of patient care. Due to the complex nature of cancer care and continuing changes to treatment techniques and technologies, it is a constant struggle for centers to obtain a systemic and holistic view of treatment workflow for improving the delivery systems. Project management techniques, Responsibility matrix and a swim-lane activity diagram representing sequence of activities can be combined for data collection, presentation, and evaluation of the patient care. This paper presents this integrated methodology using multidisciplinary meetings and walking the route approach for data collection, integrated responsibility matrix and swim-lane activity diagram with activity time for data representation and 5-why and gap analysis approach for data analysis. This enables collection of right detail of information in a shorter time frame by identifying process flaws and deficiencies while being independent of the nature of the patient's disease or treatment techniques. A case study of a multidisciplinary regional cancer centre is used to illustrate effectiveness of the proposed methodology and demonstrates that the methodology is simple to understand, allowing for minimal training of staff and rapid implementation.","517":"A comprehensive perinatal safety initiative (PSI) was incrementally introduced from August 2007 to July 2009 at a large tertiary medical center to reduce adverse obstetrical outcomes. The PSI introduced: (1) evidence-based protocols, (2) formalized team training with emphasis on communication, (3) standardization of electronic fetal monitoring with required documentation of competence, (4) a high-risk obstetrical emergency simulation program, and (5) dissemination of an integrated educational program among all healthcare providers. Eleven adverse outcome measures were followed prospectively via modification of the Adverse Outcome Index (MAOI). Additionally, individual components were evaluated. The logistic regression model found that within the first year, the MAOI decreased significantly to 0.8% from 2% (p&lt;.0004) and was maintained throughout the 2-year period. Significant decreases over time for rates of return to the operating room (p&lt;.018) and birth trauma (p&lt;.0022) were also found. Finally, significant improvements were found in staff perceptions of safety (p&lt;.0001), in patient perceptions of whether staff worked together (p&lt;.028), in the management (p&lt;.002), and documentation (p&lt;.0001) of abnormal fetal heart rate tracings, and the documentation of obstetric hemorrhage (p&lt;.019). This study demonstrates that a comprehensive PSI can significantly reduce adverse obstetric outcomes, thereby improving patient safety and enhancing staff and patient experiences.","518":"Using the classical process improvement framework of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), the diagnostic radiology department of a tertiary hospital identified several patient cycle time reduction strategies. Experimentation of these strategies (which included procurement of new machines, hiring of new staff, redesign of queue system, etc.) through pilot scale implementation was impractical because it might incur substantial expenditure or be operationally disruptive. With this in mind, simulation modeling was used to test these strategies via performance of \"what if\" analyses. Using the output generated by the simulation model, the team was able to identify a cost-free cycle time reduction strategy, which subsequently led to a reduction of patient cycle time and achievement of a management-defined performance target. As healthcare professionals work continually to improve healthcare operational efficiency in response to rising healthcare costs and patient expectation, simulation modeling offers an effective scientific framework that can complement established process improvement framework like PDSA to realize healthcare process enhancement.","519":null,"520":"Several highly visible quality improvement (QI) projects led to controversy over their ethical oversight, attracting attention from institutional review boards (IRBs) and the Office for Human Research Protection. While QI research has increased dramatically, there is limited empirical evidence regarding how multiple IRBs review the same study. This paper describes the variations in local IRB reviews for the same a multicenter QI study. The study, entitled \"Locating Errors through Networked Surveillance\", used multiple data collection methods to identify patient safety risks in cardiovascular operating room services. This study involved 2-day site visits to 5 hospitals by the research team to observe cardiac surgery procedures and interview staff regarding clinical practice and hazards. Surveys were self-administered. The IRB process varied widely across the 5 hospitals. Reviews ranged from full committee review and approval with verbal consent required from patients and operating room staff, to an IRB determining the study exempt from review and participant consent. The time to IRB approval ranged from 6 weeks to 6 months. This variation suggests there is wide interpretation of the Federal regulations put in place to guide IRBs. The adoption of uniformity would not only reduce inefficiencies but also attenuate the perceived arbitrary nature of current IRB review processes that often inappropriately influence hypothesis-generation and study design.","521":"To examine the prevalence and content of robotic surgery information presented on websites of U.S. hospitals. We completed a systematic analysis of 400 randomly selected U.S. hospital websites in June of 2010. Data were collected on the presence and location of robotic surgery information on a hospital's website; use of images or text provided by the manufacturer; use of direct link to manufacturer website; statements of clinical superiority; statements of improved cancer outcome; mention of a comparison group for a statement; citation of supporting data and mention of specific risks. Forty-one percent of hospital websites described robotic surgery. Among these, 37% percent presented robotic surgery on their homepage, 73% used manufacturer-provided stock images or text, and 33% linked to a manufacturer website. Statements of clinical superiority were made on 86% of websites, with 32% describing improved cancer control, and 2% described a reference group. No hospital website mentioned risks. Materials provided by hospitals regarding the surgical robot overestimate benefits, largely ignore risks and are strongly influenced by the manufacturer.","522":"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are major causes of preventable complications for hospitalized patients worldwide. The National Quality Forum (NQF) recommends that all patients be assessed for DVT\/PE risk upon admission, periodically thereafter, and receive evidence-based pharmacologic prophylaxis. Objectives of this study were to capture information about hospital practices related to detection, prevention, and treatment of DVT\/PE and to explore relationships between hospital characteristics and an applicable patient safety indicator (PSI) #12 postoperative DVT\/PE. Two study phases were conducted in the south-central region of the United States. First, a survey tailored to gather information about the study objectives from subject matter experts was administered, and then, using the subject matter expert results, an online survey of performance improvement professionals was deployed. Using this 5-point Likert scale online survey, respondents at each hospital reflected their DVT\/PE prevention practices approach and status. Results provided insight for trends in hospital-based DVT\/PE prevention practice, associated hospital characteristics, relationship among domains of prevention practice, and how electronic DVT\/PE order sets related to DVT\/PE outcomes. Relationship of all these characteristics to hospital overall PSI #12 postoperative DVT\/PE rates were compared. Future study and survey development recommendations were discussed.","523":"We describe our experience with the Advanced Cardiac Admission Program (ACAP) at our institution. The ACAP program is a hospital-wide implementation of critical pathways-based management of all cardiac patients. Data review of patients admitted for acute coronary syndromes from the ACAP-PAIN database and a comparative study of outcomes before and after implementation of the pathways-based assessment and treatment protocols. In the pre-ACAP and post-ACAP patient groups, antiplatelet use at admission improved from 50% to 75% (p&lt;.01), ACE-I use improved from 32% to 54% (p&lt;.0001), statins use increased from 35% to 62% (p&lt;.0001), and smoking cessation awareness increased from 15% to 86% (p&lt;.0001). At 1-year follow-up, 84% of patients with CAD were treated with statins, and 47% had LDL cholesterol &lt;100 mg\/dL, compared with 20% and 9%, respectively, with conventional treatment before ACAP implementation (p&lt;.0001). Recurrent angina symptoms and nonfatal myocardial infarction rates decreased from 28.5% to 13% (p = .02), and 15% to 5% (p = 0.03), respectively. Pathway-based programs like ACAP significantly enhance administration of guidelines-based cardioprotective medications both during hospital stay and at 1-year follow-up.","524":"A proven method to increase vaccination rates in primary care is a standing orders program (SOP) for nonphysician staff to assess and vaccinate eligible individuals without a specific written physician order. This study describes a mixed methods approach to examining physicians' beliefs and attitudes about and adoption of SOPs for adult immunizations, specifically, influenza and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Focus groups and in-depth interviews of physicians, nurses, practice managers, and the medical director of a managed care health plan were conducted. Results were used to enrich a concise survey based on the Awareness-to-Adherence model of physician behavior and previous research, which was mailed to 1,640 general internists and family physicians nationwide. Barriers to SOPs identified through qualitative methods were lack of interest in changing the status quo, a physician-dominated hierarchy, and fear of malpractice. Facilitators included having an electronic medical record and a practice culture that was open to change. The survey (response rate 67%) confirmed the facilitators and further identified patient, physician, and practice factors that served as barriers to establishing and maintaining SOPs. This mixed methods approach provided the opportunity to develop a tailored and practice-oriented survey for examining the contextual factors influencing clinical providers' decisions to implement SOPs for adult immunization.","525":"This evaluation assessed a model of care for pediatric asthma patients that aimed to promote health and reduce their preventable and avoidable use of acute hospital services. Pediatric asthma patients (n=223) were allocated care facilitators who provided assistance in the promotion of carer\/self-management, education and linkage to an integrated healthcare system, comprising of acute and community-based healthcare providers. Patients' use of acute hospital services (emergency department [ED] presentations, admissions, and bed-days) pre- and postrecruitment were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. The pediatric asthma care givers quality of life questionnaire' was used to assess changes in health and quality of life. The patients displayed a 57% reduction in ED presentations, 74% in admissions, and a 71% reduction in bed-days. Whereas a comparator group displayed 27%, 32%, and 14% increases, respectively. Patients also reported significant improvements in quality of life domains of activity limitation (+5.6, p&lt;.001) and emotional function (+9.1, p&lt;.001). The reduction in the use of hospital services was attributed to the aversion of preventable presentations and admissions, via the enhancement of carer\/self-management and access to community health services. These outcomes were supported by indicators of improved patient health and quality of life, and comments by the participant's carers.","526":"Interventions such as mandatory \"time-outs\" have contributed to intraoperative safety but improvements are still necessary. We present data provided by 3 professions always present in the intraoperative setting that suggest next steps in the quest for improvements. We describe the differences and similarities in operating room (OR) nurses', anesthesia providers', and surgeons' beliefs about team function, case difficulty, nonroutine event (NRE), and error causation using a qualitative design at 3 Veterans' Administration hospitals. Intraoperative errors are costly in lives, suffering, and dollars. A quality improvement tenet states that workers are a rich information source regarding the context within which quality can be improved. Identifying and describing OR providers' beliefs are necessary steps in devising novel approaches to quality improvement. Intraoperative NRE and error prevention opportunities exist within and outside of the OR. There may be \"cascade\" and \"perfect storm conditions\" before and during operative procedures that increase the likelihood of NREs. Confirmation of these phenomena could improve prediction and prevention of NREs. Exploration of differences in team definition and team performance ratings by provider type may also identify avenues for improvement.","527":"In their provision of acute care services, emergency department (ED) providers in critical access hospitals (CAHs) are uniquely challenged by limitations in personnel, facility resources, and available expertise. We sought to define the impact of team behaviors among ED staff in CAHs on clinical performance by studying the relationship between team and clinical performance scores across 100 simulated scenarios. Team and clinical performance scores were calculated for each scenario using standardized checklists to quantify goal achievement and aggregated across teams and scenario types. These scores were compared using bivariate analysis and correlated with clinical and team performance outcomes using Pearson's correlation (r coefficient). There was a positive correlation between team and clinical performance across all scenarios; the relationship was statistically significant (p&lt;.05) in 3 scenarios: acute coronary syndrome (r=.69; p=.027); abdominal aortic aneurysm (r=.77; p=.009); and nonaccidental trauma (r=.75; p=.013). The wide correlation between clinical and team performance may be a function of the critical care event itself or the unique characteristics of CAHs that make them more vulnerable when faced with high acuity, complex, and infrequently encountered clinical scenarios.","528":null,"529":"One of the most challenging problems facing healthcare providers is to determine the actual cost for their procedures, which is important for internal accounting and price justification to insurers. The objective of this paper is to find suitable categories to identify the diagnostic outpatient medical procedures and translate them from functional orientation to process orientation. A hierarchal task tree is developed based on a classification schema of procedural activities. Each procedure is seen as a process consisting of a number of activities. This makes a powerful foundation for activity-based cost\/management implementation and provides enough information to discover the value-added and non-value-added activities that assist in process improvement and eventually may lead to cost reduction. Work measurement techniques are used to identify the standard time of each activity at the lowest level of the task tree. A real case study at a private hospital is presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology.","530":"Evidence-based guidelines exist for the management of patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), yet adherence is suboptimal. The Discharge Management of Acute Coronary Syndrome project used a quality improvement approach, with targeted intervention strategies to optimize: prescription of guideline-recommended medications; education regarding lifestyle modifications, including cardiac rehabilitation (CR); and communication between hospital staff, patients, and general practitioners. Hospitals across Australia participated in a quality improvement cycle of audit, feedback, intervention, and reaudit. Interventions involved educational meetings, academic detailing and point-of-care reminders, and feedback of baseline audit results. Outcome measures included prescription of guideline-recommended medications, referral to CR, and documentation and communication of management plan. At baseline, 49 hospitals recruited 1,545 patients, and postintervention, 45 hospitals remained active in the project and recruited 1,589 patients. Three thousand and thirty-four hospital staff attended group education or academic detailing sessions. Postintervention, there was a significant increase in the prescription of all four guideline-recommended medications (69% vs. 57%; p&lt;.0001); short-acting nitrates (68% vs. 56%; p&lt;.0001); and documented referral to CR (68% vs. 57%; p&lt;.0001). There were significant increases in documented discharge medication counselling, smoking cessation counselling, and communication of management plans. Targeted educational interventions used as part of a quality improvement cycle can enhance adherence to evidence-based guidelines for the management of patients with ACS.","531":"Measuring and, ultimately, addressing disparities in long-term care quality continue to be a challenge. Although literature suggests that disparities in healthcare quality exist and nursing homes remain relatively segregated, healthcare professionals and policymakers stand to benefit from improvements in measuring both racial segregation and healthcare disparities. This paper quantifies the relationships between healthcare disparities and racial segregation using the disparities quality index and dissimilarity index. Results suggested that the more segregated the nursing homes, the greater the observed disparities. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the proportion of Black residents in nursing homes is the variable that best predicts disparities.","532":"Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers in the United States were estimated to cost US$2.2 to US$3.6 billion per year in 1999. In the early 1990s clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers were introduced. The purpose of this study was to examine the epidemiology of pressure ulcers in acute care in Canada. The current study is based on 12,787 individuals who were inpatients during a 1-day annual census conducted in an acute care facility in Ontario between 1994 and 2008. The prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcer decreased slightly over time while the risk of pressure ulcer increased. The coccyx sacrum (~27%), heel (13%), ankle (~12%), and ischial tubersosity (~10%) were the most common ulcer sites. The implementation of clinical practice guidelines appears to have improved the quality of patient care, as demonstrated by increasing pressure ulcer risk while the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers has remained somewhat constant. From a policy perspective the importance of monitoring and tracking the risk and occurrence of this adverse event provides a general indicator of care, considering the many organizational aspects that may ameliorate risk.","533":"To demonstrate how the American College of Radiology, Quality Research in Radiation Oncology (QRRO) process survey database can serve as an evidence base for assessing quality of care in radiation oncology. QRRO has drawn a stratified random sample of radiation oncology facilities in the USA and invited those facilities to participate in a Process Survey. Information from a prior QRRO Facilities Survey has been used along with data collected under the current National Process Survey to calculate national averages and make statistically valid inferences for national process measures for selected cancers in which radiation therapy plays a major role. These measures affect outcomes important to patients and providers and measure quality of care. QRRO's survey data provides national benchmark data for numerous quality indicators. The Process Survey is \"fully qualified\" as a Practice Quality Improvement project by the American Board of Radiology under its Maintenance of Certification requirements for radiation oncology and radiation physics. ","534":"In this study, we introduce a social networks enabled coordination model for exploring the effect of network position of \"patient,\" \"physician,\" and \"hospital\" actors in a patient-centered care network that evolves during patient hospitalization period on the total cost of coordination. An actor is a node, which represents an entity such as individual and organization in a social network. In our analysis of actor networks and coordination in the healthcare literature, we identified that there is significant gap where a number of promising hospital coordination model have been developed (e.g., Guided Care Model, Chronic Care Model) for the current healthcare system focusing on quality of service and patient satisfaction. The health insurance dataset for total hip replacement (THR) from hospital contribution fund, a prominent Australian Health Insurance Company, are analyzed to examine our proposed coordination model. We consider network attributes of degree, connectedness, in-degree, out-degree, and tie strength to measure network position of actors. To measure the cost of coordination for a particular hospital, average of total hospitalization expenses for all THR hospital admissions is used. Results show that network positions of \"patient,\" \"physician,\" and \"hospital\" actors considering all hospital admissions that a particular hospital has have effect on the average of total hospitalization expenses of that hospital. These results can be used as guidelines to set up a cost-effective healthcare practice structure for patient hospitalization expenses. ","535":"Most older adults are admitted to home health care with some functional impairment related to chronic illness and\/or hospitalization. This article describes: (1) the impact of a quality improvement initiative (QI) on functional outcomes of older, chronically ill patients served by a large homecare organization; and (2) key implementation challenges affecting intervention outcomes. Over 6,000 patients were included in two dissemination phases. Phase 1 randomly assigned service delivery teams to intervention (QI) or usual care (UC). Phase 2 spread the intervention to UC teams. Phase 1 yielded statistically significant, albeit modest, functional improvements among intervention team patients relative to UC. Phase 2 improvements in the original intervention group were smaller, suggesting some regression to the mean. UC teams did not \"catch up\" when exposed to the intervention in Phase 2. Analysis of the implementation process suggested that modification of improvement strategies and \"dilution\" of peer-to-peer communication hindered additional Phase 2 improvements. The findings highlight the challenges of relying on peer-to-peer spread, and of distinguishing the core elements of an effective improvement strategy that must be spread consistently from those that can be adapted to variations within and across organizations. ","536":"Dr. Coleman serves as the founding Director of The Care Transitions Program, a national program with a mission to improve quality and safety at times of transitions or care \"hand-offs\" across settings for persons with complex care needs. This program recognizes that a multifaceted strategy is needed and has taken action to address the problem from multiple angles, including supporting patients and their family caregivers, articulating the key roles and competencies for practitioners, developing and testing quality performance measures, creating new tools to identify medical errors, promoting the role of health information technology, and working directly with policy makers. To date, over 400 leading healthcare organizations have adopted the Care Transitions Intervention. The National Quality Forum endorsed and subsequently re-endorsed the Care Transitions Measure for use in performance measurement and public reporting and over 3,500 organizations in 15 countries have requested permission for its use. To meet this demand, the Care Transitions Measure is available in seven languages. Dr. Coleman is currently a Professor of Medicine at the University of Colorado, Denver. He is currently the Primary Investigator for seven active grants.","537":"Based on the successful pilot implementation of a Veterans Affairs Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (QUERI) aimed at increasing HIV testing throughout four local facilities and their associated satellite clinics, we expanded our efforts to deploy our methods to substantially more sites spanning six states. Our goal was to implement and examine the cost effectiveness of a distance-learning model to offer provider education to geographically remote (sub)facilities. We developed and implemented an equivalent interactive online version of our in-person presentation. Handouts were shipped to each site before the day of the in-service. Remote participants were receptive to this cost-effective form of provider activation. The technology functioned dependably; no presentation anomalies were encountered. Participants rated in-person presentations higher than online, however, mean scores for both methods were &gt;80%. Online presentations were found to be considerably more affordable than in-person. These findings suggest that this alternate approach may offer a feasible alternative for a variety of subjects. ","538":"Even though rapid response teams (RRTs) have been widely adopted, reports about their efficacy in reducing mortality have been conflicting, both in terms of outcomes, and standardization of measures. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to detect significant changes within the patient population while overall mortality rates appear not to change. Our focus will be on three indicators: unplanned transfers to the ICU as an RRT outcomes measure, changes in ICU patient utilization, and mortality. Between 2005 and 2008, RRT intervention had an impact on patient outcomes by reducing the rate of unplanned transfers to our ICU following an RRT event by 35.9%. With less severe patients able to remain on the medical wards, 12.5% of ICU beds were able to be utilized by more severe patients, and the Hospital-Standardized Mortality Ratio decreased 31.2%. The All Patient Refined Diagnostic-Related Groups (APR DRGs) risk of mortality (ROM) was used to stratify and group patients by severity, and revealed reductions in mortality among specific risk groups as well as shifts in the proportion of patient risk groups within the ICU population which were not readily apparent. ","539":"Avoidable hospitalizations represent a key indicator for access to, and the quality of, primary care. Therefore, understanding their behavior is essential in terms of management of healthcare resources and costs. This analysis examines the affect of 2 healthcare strategies on the rate of avoidable hospitalization, managed care and the healthcare safety net. The avoidable hospitalizations definition developed by Weissman et al. (1992) was used to identify relevant inpatient episodes. A 2-stage simultaneous equations multivariate regression model with instrumental variables was used to estimate the relative influence of HMO penetration and the composition of local hospital markets on the rate of avoidable hospitalizations. Control variables in the model include healthcare supply and demand, demographic, socioeconomic, and health status characteristics. Increased market presence of public hospitals significantly reduced avoidable hospitalizations. HMO penetration did not influence the rate of avoidable hospitalizations. The results suggest that public investments in healthcare facilities and infrastructure are more effective in reducing avoidable hospitalizations.","540":"Knowledge of the patient's perspective on medical error is limited. Research efforts have centered on how best to disclose error and how patients desire to have medical error disclosed. On the basis of a qualitative descriptive component of a mixed method study, a purposive sample of 30 community members told their stories of medical error. Their experiences focused on lack of communication, missed communication, or provider's poor interpersonal style of communication, greatly contrasting with the formal definition of error as failure to follow a set standard of care. For these participants, being a patient was more important than error or how an error is disclosed. The patient's understanding of error must be a key aspect of any quality improvement strategy.","541":"Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been shown to decrease morbidity and mortality in heart failure (HF) patients in randomized-controlled trials; observational studies have confirmed this benefit among patients discharged with HF. Investigating the benefit of ACEIs or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) among general HF patients has important implications for quality-of-care measurement and quality initiatives. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of receipt of ACEIs\/ARBs among patients with HF on hospitalization, emergency care, and healthcare cost during the following year. Using administrative data, we identified HF patients between 2000 and 2005 in a large health plan (n=2,396 patients). We conducted multivariate analysis to assess the impact of receipt of an ACEI\/ARB on likelihood of hospitalization and emergency care, and on total healthcare cost. We found that patients who received ACEIs\/ARBs were less likely to be hospitalized (odds ratio [OR]=0.82, p&lt;.05) or use emergency care (OR=0.82, p&lt;.05) in the following year. Receipt of ACEIs\/ARBs was not associated with significantly increased cost. Incentivizing the receipt of ACEIs\/ARBs in a general population with HF may be a suitable target for pay-for-performance programs, disease management programs, or newer complementary frameworks, such as value-based insurance design.","542":"The aim of this study was to identify what outcome measures or quality indicators are being used to evaluate advanced and new roles in nine allied health professions and whether the measures are evaluating outcomes of interest to the patient, the clinician, or the healthcare provider. A systematic search strategy was used. Medical and allied health databases were searched and relevant articles extracted. Relevant studies with at least 1 outcome measure were evaluated. A total of 106 articles were identified that described advanced roles, however, only 23 of these described an outcome measure in sufficient detail to be included for review. The majority of the reported measures fit into the economic and process categories. The most reported outcome related to patients was satisfaction surveys. Measures of patient health outcomes were infrequently reported. It is unclear from the studies evaluated whether new models of allied healthcare can be shown to be as safe and effective as traditional care for a given procedure. Outcome measures chosen to evaluate these services often reflect organizational need and not patient outcomes. Organizations need to ensure that high-quality performance measures are chosen to evaluate the success of new health service innovations. There needs to be a move away from in-house type surveys that add little or no valid evidence as to the effect of a new innovation. More importance needs to be placed on patient outcomes as a measure of the quality of allied health interventions.","543":"The use of temporary staff in healthcare is on the rise due in part to work-force shortages and perceived cost savings. They may present an increased risk of errors from insufficient training and orientation, and less familiarity with local culture and practice. However, their impact, particularly in the emergency department where the risk of preventable medication errors is high, has not been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether temporary staff medication errors would be associated with more severe harm than permanent staff medication errors. We used a national Internet-based medication error reporting system (MEDMARX) and did a cross-sectional study of the dataset between the years 2000 and 2005. After adjusting for clustering by facility, temporary staff errors were more likely than permanent staff errors to reach the patient (odds ratio [OR] 1.42, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.97-2.09), require patient monitoring (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.21-3.03), result in temporary harm (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.13-8.59), and be life-threatening (OR 8.63, 95% CI 1.22-61.0). In conclusion, emergency department medication errors associated with temporary staff were more harmful than those associated with permanent staff.","544":"","545":"This paper explores the link between utilization of ambulatory care and the likelihood of rehospitalization for an avoidable reason in veterans served by the Veteran Health Administration (VA). The analysis used administrative data containing healthcare utilization and patient characteristics stored at the national VA data warehouse, the Corporate Franchise Data Center. The study sample consisted of 284 veterans residing in Florida who had been hospitalized at least once for an avoidable reason. A bivariate probit model with instrumental variables was used to estimate the probability of rehospitalization. Veterans who had at least 1 ambulatory care visit per month experienced a significant reduction in the probability of rehospitalization for the same avoidable hospitalization condition. The findings suggest that ambulatory care can serve as an important substitute for more expensive hospitalization for the conditions characterized as avoidable.","546":"The timely coordination of care in clinics that require frequent assessments by multiple specialists can be challenging for both patients and providers. The cornerstone of care at cystic fibrosis (CF) centers with superior clinical outcomes, as with reduced acuity of episodic disease and incidence of hospitalizations, is frequent clinical encounters coupled with aggressive therapies. However, inefficiencies in the clinical practice structure prevent optimal utilization of resources. To decrease non-value-added time, defined as time a patient spends alone in an examination room, without altering the time providers spend caring for a patient, the application of Lean methods was used to see whether reducing variation could significantly decrease lead time, considered the length of a patient visit, within a CF clinic setting. Baseline capability analyses revealed only 19.3% of patient visits were completed in 60min or less, with mean and median visit times of 84 and 81min, respectively. Final capability analyses demonstrated that 41.5% of patient visits were completed in 60min or less, 23% greater than the baseline capability. Mean and median visit times decreased by 10min per visit. Research efforts increased the available capacity by 500 patient visits per year, representing additional revenue of over US$165,000 annually with no additional administrative costs incurred.","547":"As part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) Validation Pilot Project, we evaluated the criterion validity of PSI 7. At the time of this study, PSI 7 was entitled \"Selected Infections Due to Medical Care\" and targeted catheter-related infections and inflammatory reactions. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of 23 volunteer U.S. hospitals, where trained abstractors reviewed a sample of records that met PSI 7 criteria from October 1, 2005 to March 31, 2007. Of the 191 cases that met PSI 7 criteria, 104 (positive predictive value = 54%, 95% confidence interval: 40-69%) represented true infections. Of these cases, 77 (74%) were associated with central venous catheters, 15 (15%) were associated with peripheral intravenous (n=13) and or or arterial catheters (n=6), and 12 (11%) were associated with unknown catheters. Of the 87 (46%) false-positive cases, 41 (47%) did not have a qualifying infection identified by the abstractor, 38 (44%) had an infection present on admission, and 8 (9%) had an exclusionary diagnosis. PSI 7 has a low positive predictive value compared with other PSIs recently studied. Present on admission diagnoses and improved coding for infections related to central venous catheters (implemented October 2007) may improve validity.","548":"Patient waiting time and waiting room congestion are quality indicators that are related to efficiency of ambulatory care systems and patient satisfaction. Our main purpose was to test a program to decrease patient visit cycle time, while maintaining high-quality healthcare in a high-volume inner-city hospital-based clinic in New York City. Use of patient flow analysis and the creation of patient care teams proved useful in identifying areas for improvement, target, and measure effectiveness of interventions. The end result is reduced visit cycle time, improved provider team performance, and sustained patient care outcomes.","549":"The inpatient medication delivery system used at a large regional acute care hospital in the Midwest had become antiquated and inefficient. The existing 24-hr medication cart-fill exchange process with delivery to the patients' bedside did not always provide ordered medications to the nursing units when they were needed. In 2007 the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS) were applied to the system. Project objectives were to improve medication safety and reduce the time needed for nurses to retrieve patient medications. A multidisciplinary team was formed that included representatives from nursing, pharmacy, informatics, quality, and various operational support departments. Team members were educated and trained in the tools and techniques of TPS, and then designed and implemented a new pull system benchmarking the TPS Ideal State model. The newly installed process, providing just-in-time medication availability, has measurably improved delivery processes as well as patient safety and satisfaction. Other positive outcomes have included improved nursing satisfaction, reduced nursing wait time for delivered medications, and improved efficiency in the pharmacy. After a successful pilot on two nursing units, the system is being extended to the rest of the hospital.","550":"The purpose of the current study was to examine the role of communication competence in terms of predicting conflict style, job satisfaction, job stress, and job burnout among 221 healthcare workers. The results indicated that higher communication competence scores were predictive of integrating and obliging conflict styles among healthcare workers although lower communication competence scores were predictive of dominating and avoiding conflict styles. In addition, an integrating conflict style was predictive of reduced stress and increased job satisfaction whereas dominating and avoiding conflict styles were predictive of increased job burnout among the participants. The implications of these findings as well as study limitations are discussed.","551":"This paper describes the process of developing a set of private practice management standards to support Australian psychologists and promote high quality services to the public. A review of the literature was conducted to identify management standards relevant to psychology, which were further developed in consultation with a panel of experts in psychology or in the development of standards. Forty-three psychologists in independent private practice took part in either a survey (n=22) to provide feedback on the relevance of, and their compliance with, the identified standards, or a 6-month pilot study (n=21) in which a web-based self-assessment instrument evaluating the final set of standards and performance indicators was implemented in their practice to investigate self-reported change in management procedures. The pilot study demonstrated good outcomes for practitioners when evaluation of compliance to the standards was operationalized in a self-assessment format. Study results are based on a small sample size. Nevertheless, relevance and utility of the standards was found providing an initial version of management standards that have relevance to the practice of psychology in Australia, along with a system for evaluating psychological service provision to ensure best practice in service delivery.","552":"This paper describes the work of a front-line team at a 200-bed hospital in southern California to improve the patient transfer process between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and the Medical\/Surgical floors. Using a phased approach of assessing the problem, identifying opportunities, testing ideas, and then implementing successful ideas, the team was able to improve patient transfer time from the ICU to the Medical\/Surgical Floor once the bed is assigned from 6 to &lt; 2 hr and to reduce the number of patients experiencing extreme delays (more than 12 hr waits since the bed is assigned) from 15% to 0%. Also, as a corollary of this work, nursing overtime was reduced by 25% year to year between March 2008 and March 2009 and patient satisfaction scores were improved. A key success factor of the front-line team was the implementation of a sustainability plan where metric and process accountability is specified, together with alert flags for the metrics and actions to take if the alert flags are triggered.","553":"Recent attention has focused on validity and feasibility of different approaches to developing performance indicators for the purposes of quality improvement and value-based purchasing. This paper presents the methodology used to develop a comprehensive set of performance indicators that will be used for a national evaluation of the mental healthcare provided by the Veterans Health Administration. The paper report on the indicators' technical specifications and the United States Public Health System Task Force defined strength of supporting evidence. Indicators were reviewed iteratively for meaningfulness, utility, feasibility, and supporting evidence until a final set of measures of acceptable validity and feasibility was produced with technical specifications. Fifty-seven mental health performance indicators that use information from both the medical record and administrative data (hybrid indicators) and 31 administrative-data only indicators are presented. Of the 57 hybrid indicators, 13 indicators are supported by Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality grade I evidence, 5 indicators are grade II, and 39 indicators are grade III. This paper describes the methodology used to develop 88 performance indicators of the quality of mental health and substance abuse treatment, and presents the technical specifications associated with each indicator.","554":"Ecological momentary assessment methods were used to examine real-time relationships between work environment factors and stress in a sample of 119 registered nurses (RNs) in acute and critical care settings of three hospitals. The RNs carried handheld computers for 1 week of work shifts and were randomly surveyed within 90-min intervals to self-report work activity, perceived workload, and stress. Mixed effects linear regression analyses were completed to predict the stress score in the sample. The number of patients assigned significantly predicted stress; the greater the number of assigned patients, the higher the reported stress (p&lt;.01). Age, gender, adult versus pediatric facility type, familiarity with patients, and proportion of direct care tasks were not significant predictors of stress. Further research is needed to link work environment factors and stress with errors among nurses.","555":"In Morocco, injuries account for 11% of total burden of disease. Better organization of emergency care can improve the outcome of trauma patients. In Morocco, these services have been reorganized recently, but were never evaluated. The objective was to assess actual structure and processes of emergency trauma care in a Moroccan region. This comparative qualitative study was carried out in the region of Fez. The process and structure of contacting emergency care and prehospital emergency care were compared with the French 2002 standards. Emergency care at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) was compared with World Health Organization 2005 Essential Trauma Care guidelines. Predefined care items were categorized as conforming to the standards or not. An emergency call center with a dedicated dial-up number has been established in the region since January 2007. Compared with the standards, this center was not protected by any legislation and was run by interns only. The center was underutilized during triage to help transportation of severe trauma patients. At the prehospital care level, only 3 out of 15 ambulances were equipped with resuscitation equipment and were used rarely. Only one of the ambulance staff out of three was trained in required skills. At the UTH, emergency care equipment and staff was nearly adequate. This study identified several opportunities for improvement in organizing trauma care in Fez particularly at emergency call center and ambulance service. A quality assurance program would be useful to further identifying improvements in this system.","556":"To address concerns about the quality of care, health plans have used varying approaches to support quality improvement (QI). Pay-for-performance (P4P) is the most commonly used and discussed approach. P4P programs have many challenges in design and execution, particularly for Medicaid providers. In order to find an alternative to P4P, CareOregon--a nonprofit health plan serving Medicaid and Medicare enrollees--developed the Care Support and System Innovation (CSSI) Program. An evaluation was conducted to assess the overall affect of the CSSI Program in promoting comprehensive improvements in quality of care and the extent to which it has the potential to offer a viable alternative to P4P. The evaluation found that the CSSI Program successfully addressed many challenges inherent in P4P. The CSSI Program engaged providers, fostered a culture of QI within CareOregon's network, and provided practices with the opportunity to develop sustainable and innovative solutions to address quality concerns. Success of the program was attributed to CareOregon's focus on building relationships while providing technical assistance and responsive funding. While health outcome data were not available to assess impact on CareOregon's members, evaluation findings highlight the importance of collaboration in QI efforts, and suggest that the model has the potential to overcome many of the challenges faced by P4P.","557":"Combining the use of employee perception surveys with sound analytical techniques and models is critical to capturing high quality data from which effective decisions can be made in complex healthcare settings. This study used the Baldrige Award companion surveys with an analysis of variance (ANOVA) framework to identify discordant perceptions of hospital staff and leadership in the areas of customer focus, knowledge management, and results that were significant at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels. Senior leaders in the organization found the ANOVA framework helpful as they interpreted results from the Baldrige companion surveys and planned future improvement activities. During the execution of our study a number of difficulties and challenges arose that are not uncommon to survey administration in smaller settings, such as community hospitals, or in larger hospital settings with no research staff or research staff with relevant psychometric expertise. Our experience suggests that the Baldrige companion survey process would be enhanced by providing organizations with general guidance and protocols for optimal survey administration and data analysis. The purpose of this article is to outline the ANOVA model we used with the Baldrige companion surveys and to provide guidance related to the administration and analysis of these companion surveys for those that use them.","558":null,"559":"Dr. Jha is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. The major themes of his research are: 1. Quality of care provided by healthcare systems, with a focus on healthcare disparities as a marker of poor care. 2. Information technology among other tools as potential solutions for reducing medical errors and disparities while improving overall quality. 3.Organizations that provide care for minorities and underserved populations and the role clinical information systems can play in improving their care.","560":"Fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) is recommended by national guidelines for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and has been shown to reduce both the incidence and mortality of CRC. FOBT screening is a complex process and little is known concerning the best methods for implementing FOBT screening in primary care clinics. The purpose of this study was to determine if direct gastroenterology (GI) service notification of all positive FOBT results in improved time for provider response and colonoscopy. The secondary aims were to determine to what extent implementation of FOBT screening was appropriate in a large primary care clinic and correlate this with findings from colonoscopy. Data were collected prospectively following implementation of a direct referral strategy and compared with two retrospective time periods during which the ordering practitioners were responsible for follow-up of all positive FOBT. Implementation of immediate GI referral of positive tests eliminated improper and neglected follow-up, and resulted in shorter delays in provider response time and colonoscopy completion. Inappropriate use of FOBT was observed in 49% of patients, indicating that further interventions in primary care clinics to improve the quality of FOBT screening are necessary.","561":"Where minorities receive their care may contribute to disparities in care, yet, the racial concentration of care in the Veterans Health Administration is largely unknown. We sought to better understand which Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals treat Black veterans and whether location of care impacted disparities. We assessed differences in mortality rates between Black and White veterans across 150 VA hospitals for any of six conditions (acute myocardial infarction, hip fracture, stroke, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and pneumonia) between 1996 and 2002. Just 9 out of 150 VA hospitals (6% of all VA hospitals) cared for nearly 30% of Black veterans, and 42 hospitals (28% of all VA hospitals) cared for more than 75% of Black veterans. While our findings show that overall mortality rates were comparable between minority-serving and non-minority-serving hospitals for four conditions, mortality rates were higher in minority-serving hospitals for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pneumonia. The ratio of mortality rates for Blacks compared with Whites was comparable across all VA hospitals. In contrast to the private sector, there is little variation in the degree of racial disparities in 30-day mortality across VA hospitals, although higher mortality among patients with AMI and pneumonia requires further investigation.","562":"Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) are a national concern due to patient morbidity, treatment cost, and reimbursement issues. Stages III and IV pressure ulcers (PUs) that occur during hospitalization are among the conditions considered preventable by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Harborview Medical Center (HMC), located in Seattle, WA, is a Level 1 trauma\/burn center and safety net hospital serving diverse populations. HMC is committed to providing excellence in care including optimal skin care and PU prevention to people from all walks of life. At HMC a new system for monitoring daily PU incidence, completing monthly multidisciplinary intensive reviews on HAPUs, and application of an algorithm used to determine if HAPUs were avoidable was developed and implemented. This system has assisted HMC in addressing PU tracking, prevention, compliance with regulatory mandates and has improved skin-related outcomes.","563":"In this paper we present the conceptual framework and research design of a national evaluation of the quality of mental healthcare provided to veterans by the Veterans Health Administration, and present results on the reported availability of evidence-based practices. We used the Donabedian paradigm to design a longitudinal evaluation of the quality of mental healthcare. To evaluate the structure of care we used a combination of survey and administrative data and designed a web-based facility survey to examine the availability and characteristics of 12 evidence-based practices and other mental health services. We identified 138 unique facilities that provided mental healthcare to 783,280 veterans. With the exception of opiate substitution therapies, every evidence-based practice was reported in at least one location in each service network. We use maps to estimate the maximum number of veterans that might benefit from expanding the availability of an evidence-based practice. We demonstrate the feasibility of overcoming several major challenges typically associated with measuring the quality of healthcare systems. This framework for evaluation of mental healthcare delivery provides a model upon which other stakeholders can continue to build and expand.","564":"Even though the expression \"Patient and Family-Centered Care (PFCC)\" is widely used, there remains a lack of clarity regarding how the fundamental tenets of PFCC fit with our current model of healthcare. The purpose of this manuscript was to describe the first step in developing an organizational understanding of the operational construct for PFCC utilizing a concept map and the fundamental concept mapping learning theories. The overall goals were to build a more robust organization-wide understanding of the basic PFCC tenets guided by the philosophy of concept mapping. The long-range aspirations of this process are to improve safety and quality of life by incorporating the PFCC philosophy in the career development path of our students and healthcare professionals.","565":"Surgeons have been slow to incorporate industrial reliability techniques. Process control methods were applied to surgeon waiting time between cases, and to length of stay (LOS) after colon surgery. Waiting times between surgeries were evaluated by auditing the operating room records of a single hospital over a 1-month period. The medical records of 628 patients undergoing colon surgery over a 5-year period were reviewed. The average surgeon wait time between cases was 53 min, and the busiest surgeon spent 291\/2 hr in 1 month waiting between surgeries. Process control charting demonstrated poor overall control of the room turnover process. Average LOS after colon resection also demonstrated very poor control. Mean LOS was 10 days. Weibull's conditional analysis revealed a conditional LOS of 9.83 days. Serious process management problems were identified in both analyses. These process issues are both expensive and adversely affect the quality of service offered by the institution. Process control mechanisms were suggested or implemented to improve these surgical processes. Industrial reliability and quality management tools can easily and effectively identify process control problems that occur on surgical services.","566":"Benchmarking expedites the quest for best practices and is crucial to hospitals' effective, reliable, and superior performance. Comparative performance data are used by accrediting and regulatory bodies to evaluate performance and by consumers in making decisions on where to seek healthcare. Nursing-sensitive quality measures affirmed by the National Quality Forum are now used in public reporting and pay-for-performance in addition to traditional medical outcome metrics. This report provides hospital nursing-sensitive benchmarks from medical\/surgical, critical care, and step-down units drawn from 196 hospitals during six quarters in 2007 and 2008. Outcome measures include pressure ulcer prevalence rates and fall\/falls with injury rates. Additional indicators that describe nursing care (nurse staffing care hours, skill mix, nurse\/patient ratios, workload intensity, voluntary turnover, and use of sitters) and patient descriptors (age, gender, and diagnosis description) were also included. Specific benchmarks are provided using the 10th and the 90th percentiles, as well as quartiles to allow hospitals an opportunity to understand comparative performance with specificity. The purpose of this article is to provide hospitals not currently participating in comparative benchmarking databases with nursing-sensitive data from the Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes for use in performance improvement processes.","567":"Delays, omissions, and inaccuracy of discharge information are common at hospital discharge and put patients at risk for adverse outcomes. We assembled an interdisciplinary team of stakeholders to evaluate our current discharge process between hospitalists and primary care providers (PCPs). We used a fishbone diagram to identify potential causes of suboptimal discharge communication to PCPs. Opportunities for improvement (leverage points) to achieve optimal transfer of discharge information were identified using tally sheets and Pareto charts. Quality improvement strategies consisted of training and implementation of a new discharge process including: (1) enhanced PCP identification at discharge, (2) use of an electronic discharge order and instruction system, and (3) autofaxing discharge information to PCPs. The new discharge process's impact was evaluated on 2,530 hospitalist patient discharges over a 34-week period by measuring: (1) successful transfer of discharge information (proportion of discharge information sheets successfully faxed to PCPs), (2) timeliness (proportion of sheets faxed within 2 days of discharge), and (3) content (presence of key clinical elements in discharge sheets). Postintervention, success, and timeliness of discharge information transfer between pediatric hospitalists and PCPs significantly improved while content remained high.","568":"Despite a good general understanding of the need to ensure provider adoption and use of electronic health record (EHR) systems, many implementations fall short of expectations, and little is known about effective approaches in the ambulatory care area. We aimed to comprehensively study and synthesize best practices for ambulatory EHR system implementation in healthcare organizations, emphasizing strategies that maximize physician adoption and use. Following an extensive literature review, we held 47 key informant interviews with representatives of six U.S. healthcare organizations purposively selected based on reported success with ambulatory EHR system implementation. We interviewed both administrative and clinical informants in order to improve our understanding of ambulatory EHR implementation from both perspectives. We found that while all 6 sites studied were reported to have strong EHR implementation practices, we were able to characterize \"good\" versus \"great\" approaches across the sites. Specifically, \"great\" implementations included a key element focused on optimization and improvement over time that helped healthcare organizations support physician adoption and use of the EHR system. The \"great\" implementation approaches we saw also included explicit considerations of improved data capture and quality of care in their focus on optimization in order to maximize the value of the EHR.","569":"A healthcare organization's commitment to quality and the patient experience requires senior leader involvement in improvement strategies, and accountability for goals. Further, improvement strategies are most effective when driven by data, and in the world of patient satisfaction, evidence is growing that nurse leader rounding and discharge calls are strategic tactics that can improve patient satisfaction. This article describes how The Ohio State University Medical Center (OSUMC) leveraged health information technology (IT) to apply a data-driven strategy execution to improve the patient experience. Specifically, two IT-driven approaches were used: (1) business intelligence reporting tools were used to create a meaningful reporting system including dashboards, scorecards, and tracking reports and (2) an improvement plan was implemented that focused on two high-impact tactics and data to hardwire accountability. Targeted information from the IT systems enabled clinicians and administrators to execute these strategic tactics, and senior leaders to monitor achievement of strategic goals. As a result, OSUMC's inpatient satisfaction scores on the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey improved from 56% nines and tens in 2006 to 71% in 2009.","570":"There is a growing recognition among health services researchers and policy makers that Health Information Technology (HIT) has the potential to address challenging issues that face patients and providers of healthcare. The Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY), a large not-for-profit home healthcare agency, has integrated technology applications into the service delivery model of several programs. Case studies, including the development and implementation, of three informatics initiatives at VNSNY are presented on: (1) Quality Scorecards that utilize process, outcomes, cost, and satisfaction measures to assess performance among clinical staff and programs; (2) a tool to identify patients at risk of being hospitalized, and (3) a predictive model that identifies patients who are eligible for physical rehabilitation services. Following a description of these initiatives, we discuss their impact on quality and process indicators, as well as the opportunities and challenges to implementation.","571":"The continuing problem of inaccurate medication records and resultant harm from medication errors has prompted the Institute of Medicine and others to encourage information technology (IT) solutions to improve medication list accuracy. There are few studies on how ambulatory care documentation contributes to medication list inaccuracies and medication reconciliation failures. To address medication reconciliation issues in ambulatory care, office-based physicians in a region with a high adoption rate for electronic medical records (EMRs) were surveyed about current reconciliation practices, the need for redesigning reconciliation processes, and acceptable IT solutions for improving availability of medication information. Physicians selected from a list of potential IT platforms that would create a single reconciled record of prescription medications, nonprescription medications, and supplements accessible wherever patients go. The two most popular platforms were either an aggregated list within existing EMRs accessible by inpatient and outpatient providers regardless of their EMR system, or a web-based repository that was not integrated into an EMR. Respondents felt that implementation of such platforms would not require major changes to clinical workflow, perhaps due to the region's existing familiarity with health IT. Leveraging community acceptance of health IT could result in rapid implementation of universally accessible medication list platforms.","572":"","573":"A low hand hygiene compliance rate by healthcare workers increases hospital-acquired infections to patients. At Presbyterian Healthcare Services in Albuquerque, New Mexico a Lean Six Sigma team identified the reasons for noncompliance were multifaceted. The team followed the DMAIC process and completed the methodology in 12 months. They implemented multiple solutions in the three areas: Education, Culture, and Environment. Based on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) mortality research the team's results included an estimated 2.5 lives saved by reducing MRSA infections by 51%. Subsequently this 51% decrease in MRSA saved the hospital US$276,500. For those readers tasked with increasing hand hygiene compliance this article will provide the knowledge and insight needed to overcome multifaceted barriers to noncompliance.","574":"Benchmarking is an indispensable tool as hospital leaders face challenges to balance efficiency with safe and effective care. Selection of appropriate \"like\" hospitals is critical to the benchmarking aim of understanding comparative performance. Based on 10 years of observed outcome differences between small and large hospitals, the Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes (CALNOC) sought to empirically define small hospitals, and to determine if there were statistical differences between small and large hospitals for selected nursing sensitive outcome indicators. This article reports the examination of hospital size as a proxy characteristic to define \"like\" hospitals for the purpose of benchmarking outcomes. Findings suggest that optimal classifications into small and large hospital size based on the outcome indicators of falls, falls with injury, and hospital-acquired pressure ulcers stage 2 or worse (HAPU 2+) were not consistent with historical administrative categories based on average daily census and not consistent by outcome. Statistical differences were only found with HAPU 2+ in critical care units, with no differences in the fall outcomes. These data did not support the use of size-based categories to define like hospitals for benchmark comparisons.","575":"Healthcare has long looked at decreasing risk in communication and patient care processes. Increasing the simplicity in communication and patient care process is a newer concept contained in Lean methodology. Lean is a strategy for achieving improvement in performance through the elimination of steps that use resources without contributing to customer value.

For cancer patients, psychosocial care can affect overall outcomes. In this article, we outline the efforts that a national comprehensive cancer center is using to bring psychosocial care to the same level of awareness, importance, and integration as clinical care. Improving all aspects of patient care, psychosocial as well as biological, must be pursued if progress in overall quality of cancer care is to be achieved.","580":"","581":"The prevalence of medical errors and malpractice claims has been attributed to deficits in error reporting and disclosure. Increasingly, states are adopting error reporting and apology laws to reduce these information gaps thereby instituting error-transparent medical cultures. At the same time, doubts have been expressed about the capacity for legislation to influence medical professionals. In order to assess legislative potential to establish error transparency, a cross-sectional research design compared differences in malpractice claim rates among states adopting different legislative approaches. Two one-way analysis of variance tests were performed. The first analysis indicated that there are no significant mean differences in claims rates between states enacting only an apology law, only an error reporting law, both laws, and neither law, F (3,47)=1.13, p=.34. The second analysis indicated that there are no significant mean differences in claims rates between states enacting both laws, either law, and neither law, F (2,48)=1.08, p=.35. The findings show that legislation does not have a significant capacity to regulate malpractice claims rates. This suggests that laws governing error transparency are too remote from the delivery of healthcare services to regulate disclosure behavior and that fundamental changes in our medical culture should be initiated at an organizational level.","582":"Kathleen Jennison Goonan, MD, is Executive Director of the Mongan Institute for Health Policy, Center for Performance Excellence (CPE) at Massachusetts General Hospital.

A generally accepted measurement model of patient-centeredness is still nonexistent, current operational definitions lack sufficient specificity to inform providers how it relates to outcomes, and the influence of patient-centeredness on pediatric patients and families has not been quantified. This study demonstrates that patient-centeredness is a measurable ability of pediatricians that increases family trust. As an ability, it is teachable. The study offers an evidence-based model for future research with specific implications for quality measurement and improvement in the outpatient pediatrician's office.","584":"In order to improve health outcomes, healthcare providers need to base practice on current evidence. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore and compare the understanding and experiences with evidence-based practice (EBP) in three different disciplines. Researchers conducted individual interviews with psychiatrists, nurses, and dental hygienists. The majority of study participants demonstrated an understanding of EBP and were able to identify enhancers and barriers to implementing EBP. Using a grounded theory approach, several major themes acting as enhancers and barriers to EBP emerged and revealed both differences and similarities within and across the three health disciplines. While saturation was not attempted, this exploratory research is important in contributing to understanding the cultural practice milieu in relation to individual characteristics in implementing evidence into practice with the overall aim of improving healthcare delivery and outcomes.","585":"This study is a retrospective analysis of medical claims of individuals with diabetes enrolled in managed Medicaid as well as a diabetes management program. The sample consists of 695 individuals who had at least two hospitalizations in one calendar year. This study had two related aims. The first was to examine factors associated with an increased risk of repeat hospitalizations. The second was to determine an appropriate alternative to rehospitalization. Using negative binominal regression, we find that members most likely to be rehospitalized have congestive heart failure or psychosis. We suggest that rehospitalizations in this population may be mitigated by providing home healthcare.","586":"The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a group-based program on glucose control for adults with diabetes. Ninety-two adults completed the program aimed at identifying and overcoming barriers to diabetes self-management with the use of behavioral strategies. A comparison group consisted of 275 adults with diabetes not participating in the program matched for age, gender, type of insurance coverage, and initial hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) result. Members completing the program demonstrated significant improvements in HbAlc results at both the first and second postgroup measurements. Regression analyses identified initial HbAlc result and the interaction of condition and initial HbAlc as significant predictors of improvement in HbAlc. The quality of diabetes care and treatment outcomes can be enhanced with the inclusion of a low-cost, structured program led by a behavioral health professional.","587":"Influenza vaccination of health care personnel (HCP) is a patient safety issue, but the national rate is only 42%. Following an intervention in 2006-2007, HCP in a large health system were surveyed. Self-reported influenza vaccination rate was 61.6% overall, did not differ by race, education level, or employment status but was higher for older HCP (&gt; or =50 years; p=.002). In logistic regression, the strongest predictor of vaccination was receiving influenza vaccine the previous year, although other factors were significantly associated for younger and older HCP groups. Establishing the influenza vaccination habit using age-based targeted messages may be the most effective way to increase rates for HCP without mandates.","588":"We describe a multipronged, multidisciplinary effort to improve the safety of blood transfusion in our hospital.

Risk-adjusted Patient Safety Indicators (PSIs) were calculated for 558 general adult medical\/surgical hospitals participating in the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research's Nationwide Inpatient Sample. When compared using mean risk-adjusted PSI rates, no significant differences in performance for specific PSIs were observed between hospitals affiliated with the \"Most Wired\" label and those without the designation using objective measures of safety.","591":"In healthcare facilities, patient falls have been a major contributing factor associated with patient injuries that result in increased costs and increased length of stay. Recent actions by the Department of Health and Human Services, enacted through the Department of Medicare and Medicaid Services, now hold healthcare facilities financially responsible for injury to patients that result from falls (CMS Hospital Acquired Conditions). Because of these rulings, costs associated with patient falls are now a greater threat to the survival of rural healthcare facilities. The rate of patient falls at Wise Regional Health System was unacceptably high. As a result of statistically analyzing the demographics of previous fall victims, and initiating additional interventions for identified patients, Wise Regional Health System has been successful in drastically decreasing their inpatient fall rate.","592":"The healthcare arena, much like the manufacturing industry, benefits from many aspects of the Toyota lean principles. Lean thinking contributes to reducing or eliminating nonvalue-added time, money, and energy in healthcare. In this paper, we apply selected principles of lean management aiming at reducing the wasted time associated with drug dispensing at an inpatient pharmacy at a local hospital. Thorough investigation of the drug dispensing process revealed unnecessary complexities that contribute to delays in delivering medications to patients. We utilize DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) and 5S (Sort, Set-in-order, Shine, Standardize, Sustain) principles to identify and reduce wastes that contribute to increasing the lead-time in healthcare operations at the pharmacy understudy. The results obtained from the study revealed potential savings of &gt; 45% in the drug dispensing cycle time.","593":"Little is known about the effect of a pay-for-performance system (P4P) on primary medical care providers and even less is known about its potential impact in dentistry. Based on the growing acceptance of performance-based reimbursements in medicine and the dissemination of innovative technologies, structures, and processes of care from medical to dental services, it is likely that the dental profession will face performance-based payments in the not-too-distant future. In this paper, we present the current experience of P4P in primary medical care that has relevance to dentistry and discuss the dental performance-based programs to date. Taking into consideration these lessons, the structure of dental service delivery in the United States, and the paucity of evidence-based quality indicators in dentistry, we provide several guidelines for the design of P4P pilot programs for dental services. We conclude that large-scale implementation of P4P for dentistry may not be a realistic option before significant progress is achieved in quality of dental care indicators.","594":"Long Island Health Network developed a provider-initiated pay-for-performance (PI-PFP) program beginning in 2004 and operated by 10 clinically integrated hospitals. The PI-PFP administrative processes, length of stay, patient satisfaction, and Hospital Quality Alliance measures are elaborated. PI-PFP has evolved over time and supports best practice sharing. We document how the risk amount is determined and then allocated to the Network and the individual hospitals based on performance, and we quantify the success of the program in achieving the goal of improved performance. A PI-PFP can prepare physicians and management for pay-for-performance or value-based purchasing programs operated by payers. Being self-administered, such a program can go beyond payer-run programs to focus attention on issues that are considered important by the hospitals and medical staffs, and that may not be feasible to measure or to include in a mandatory payer-run program.","595":"Electronic health records (EHRs) have experienced slow adoption rates but play an important role in improving ambulatory quality of care. Sustained use of EHRs is closely related to physician satisfaction, however little research exists on this issue. We focused on physician EHR users to determine factors that are related to satisfaction with the level of computerization in their office practice. After controlling for various factors, physicians with more robust EHRs, and those who adopted their system two or more years ago, were more likely to be satisfied. Lastly, several individual EHR functionalities were independently related to improved satisfaction.","596":"Hospitals have wrestled with balancing quality, service, and cost for years--and the visibility and urgency around measuring and communicating real metrics has grown exponentially in the last decade. However, even today, most hospital leaders cannot articulate or demonstrate the \"value\" they provide to patients and payers. Instead of developing a strategic direction that is based around a core value proposition, they focus their strategic efforts on tactical decisions like physician recruitment, facility expansion, and physician alignment. In the healthcare paradigm of the next decade, alignment of various tactical initiatives will require a more coherent understanding of the hospital's core value positioning. The authors draw on their experience in a variety of healthcare settings to suggest that for most hospitals, quality (i.e., clinical outcomes and patient safety) will become the most visible indicator of value, and introduce a framework to help healthcare providers influence their value positioning based on this variable.","597":"Healthcare providers are challenged by forces that are driving change at an accelerated rate. Unfortunately, organizational structures, system inertia, and the lack of shared values in many organizations thwart change. Systems that do not understand the principles of change management for complex adaptive systems (CAS) continue to apply change models that have little chance of success. An understanding of the principles and actions that enable change in CAS and the use of a formal process to frame and focus change are essential for long-term success.","598":"Studies have shown that the lowest performing physicians in pay-for-performance (P4P) programs improved the most; however, it is unclear whether this would occur without the P4P program or be sustained. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of P4P in a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) on low performing physicians over a 4-year period. We used administrative claims data from a PPO health plan in Hawaii, which implemented a P4P program, and a PPO plan in the South, which did not implement a P4P program. The difference-indifference model was used to compare the quality scores between the two physician groups in preventive measures, a heart failure measure, and an HbA1c testing measure. We found that P4P programs may be effective in incentivizing low performing physicians to improvement quality of care and sustain improvement, and the positive benefit of the P4P program may not be realized until the 3rd or 4th year of the program.","599":"Michael is the president of Bailit Health Purchasing, LLC, and has worked with a wide array of employer purchasers, government agencies, and purchasing coalitions across the United States since founding the firm in 1997.

Only 32% of patients with STEMI receive this procedure within the recommended 90 min for door-to-balloon time (DTB). We reviewed all STEMI cases that presented to our institution before and after the implementation of a STEMI Code protocol. Before the STEMI Code protocol, 27.1% of weekday cases and 6.3% of weekend cases were performed within 90 min. After the STEMI Code protocol, there was a threefold increase in the number of patients who received PCI within 90 min (p&lt;.0001). A STEMI Code protocol dramatically improves DTB and equalizes disparities between weekday and weekend care.","604":"Guidelines for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) include secondary prevention (SP) strategies, but little is known about patients' recall of instructions following hospital discharge. We conducted telephone interviews to assess recall of risk-reduction information among patients discharged with AMI. Results indicated similar proportions of documented and patient recall of discharge instructions. However, lifestyle recommendations were documented and recalled less frequently than pharmacologic therapy. Many patients were unable to name their diagnosis or link known risk factors as contributing causes, which may contribute to low adherence to SP therapies. Quality improvement strategies are needed to guide more effective provider-patient communication.","605":"Many emergency department (ED) patients require urgent follow-up in primary care. The most effective way to help patients obtain their needed after-visit care is to secure the appointment on their behalf prior to their departure from the ED. This study describes the development, implementation, and outcomes of an appointment assignment system that facilitates patient follow-up at two community hospitals in an integrated healthcare system. This patient-centered system resulted in a high rate of compliance and a very low rate of unscheduled ED recidivism. Improving access in this manner will likely strengthen the continuum of care, improve quality, and increase patient satisfaction.","606":"This article is the second in a two-part series focusing on catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

Yet exposure to this learning process is usually limited to those events occurring in one's own institution. Virtual Safety Rounds expands this learning opportunity to multiple hospitals. Twice each month physicians; nurses; and quality, risk, and patient safety staff participate in a discussion about a recent safety event within the healthcare system. Within this safe collegial environment experiences, plans of correction and lessons learned are shared. Hospitals are learning from each other without having to experience the patient safety issue directly.","610":"Baby-friendly certification recognizes hospitals that promote early physical bonding between mother and infant, immediately after birth. Most births can accomplish physical bonding without increased risk to mother or infant. When mother or infant have complications and each have intravenous (i.v.) lines and are receiving medications, the physical bonding post-birth may also inadvertently put the patients at risk. A baby-friendly community hospital in New England found that early bonding put an infant at higher risk for medication error when the two i.v. lines were not properly identified and the infant received a medication intended for the mother. The growing body of literature on i.v. medication safety does not address this particular type of error, and this was an error that technology would not have prevented. The \"5 rights\" of medication safety are not as effective as physical separation of the two individuals during medication administration. A brief separation does not diminish bonding, and the practice has prevented subsequent errors.","611":"Successful management of obstetrical emergencies such as shoulder dystocia requires the coordinated efforts of a multidisciplinary team of professionals. Simulation education provides an opportunity to learn and master simple as well as complex technical skills needed in emergent situations. Team training has been shown to improve the quality of communication among team members and consequently has an enormous impact on human performance. In the healthcare environment, especially obstetrics where the stakes are high, integrating team training into simulation education can advance efforts to create and sustain a culture of safety. With over 7,100 deliveries annually, our 1,100-bed, two-hospital regional healthcare system embarked on this journey to advance the culture of safety.","612":"As the malpractice crisis in Obstetrics continues to spiral, safety initiatives within Obstetrics have grown to include simulation as a primary risk reduction strategy. Starting a simulation program requires careful planning and the commitment of all nursing and physician providers to promote a culture of patient safety.

EBP processes framed the study. Evaluation methods for intervention effectiveness and study outcomes integrated both quantitative and qualitative strategies. Staff transferred evidence, knowledge, and skills into practice to achieve enhanced communication, collaboration, satisfaction, and patient safety outcomes meeting the study goal.","614":"Effective communication and teamwork among the healthcare team has a profound impact on patient care; in the Delivery Room it means the best possible outcome for moms and babies. With that goal in mind, our obstetrics team, partnered with Harvard Risk Management Strategies Foundation Team Performance Plus (TPP), implemented an initiative in May 2006. The primary goal of the initiative was to improve patient care through improved communication between disciplines, situation monitoring throughout the continuum of care, mutual support and respect among care givers, and effective team leadership. Through education and implementation of specific communication tools and behaviors, we realized better patient outcomes as well as improved patient and staff satisfaction.","615":"The department of Women's and Children's Services at the Hospital of Saint Raphael (HSR) in New Haven, CT, has initiated several different and successful approaches to reducing patient risk within the department. The department purchased a computerized fetal monitoring and documentation program that has improved the ability to provide high-level antepartal care for mothers and fetuses with automatic patient data management and continuous fetal heart rate surveillance. A Risk Reduction Grant offered through the hospital malpractice insurance program provided the financial assistance for all medical providers to become certified in electronic fetal monitoring. The certification is now a required educational standard for nurses, certified nurse midwives, and for physicians who work in the labor and delivery unit. Infant and pediatric security is incorporated into policy and practice measures that include hospital-wide drills for the prevention of infant abduction. The Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB\/GYN) Quality Improvement Committee supports systematic reviews of identified clinical risks and works to find viable solutions to these problems. The hospital has supported specialized obstetrical care through the Maternal Fetal Medicine Unit (MFMU), Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU), the Inpatient Pediatric Unit, and the labor and delivery unit.

It is unclear how much information is available for assisted living facilities (ALFs). In this investigation, an internet search was performed to determine what information is available in each state. It was found that most states have a number of descriptive indicators. The way in which the information is displayed varies substantially among different states, as well as the detail and depth of information. While a variety of useful information was found, it was not necessarily found easily. It is important to enable consumers to make a direct comparison between ALFs, and in order to do that there needs to be obvious standardization of presented information among the different states.","619":"This quality improvement project was designed to improve rates of referral for colonoscopy screening in the Utah Health Research Network, University of Utah Community Clinics. This study was conducted between October 2004 and June 2007 with the main intervention being a clinic workflow modification using computerized screening reminders embedded in the electronic medical record (EMR). The intervention led to sustained improvement, largely driven by the performance of two network clinics. This study demonstrates that a robust EMR, with decision prompts, accompanied by clinic workflow changes and feedback to providers, can lead to sustained change in the rates of colonoscopy referral.","620":"Economic forces have created a revolution in health care. Traditional models of practice are changing. The care of the patient is being split between the hospitalist and the primary care physician in the ambulatory setting. Increasingly there are physicians that no longer come to the hospital except to attend meetings, yet departmental chairpersons must credential and privilege these physicians and vouch for their competence. This article discusses ways to be able to credential and privilege ambulatory physicians or physicians that rarely see patients in the hospital (low volume admitters) by using the core competencies designed by ACGME that are currently used to evaluate residents.","621":"An initiative by the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh radiology department to reduce sedations of pediatric patients undergoing computerized tomography scanning has resulted in a significant decline in sedation rates, reduced rates of sedation-related complications, a significant productivity gain as a result of increased procedural volume, improved patient and family satisfaction, and no diminution of image quality. The techniques used to implement this initiative are applicable in any healthcare setting in which pediatric patients are routinely sedated for medical procedures.","622":"Assessment of the hospital environment is integral to improving the organ donation process in healthcare organizations. This paper introduces a novel approach to the assessment and improvement of donation processes: the Rapid Assessment of hospital Procurement barriers in Donation (RAPiD). The RAPiD is a qualitative needs assessment tool for identifying barriers to donor identification and referral, and family requests for donation. Improving the donation process has become a national priority and can potentially save or improve the lives of thousands of Americans each year. The RAPID yields a rich description of the hospital environment that is readily translated into action-oriented recommendations for change.","623":"This project raised awareness of various factors influencing the risk of developing deep sternal wound infection, postoperative cerebravascular accident, and adverse cardiac events. It elevated attention to evidence-based research and improved outcomes relating to parameters of surgical antibiotic prophylaxis on risks of surgical site infection (SSI) following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Analysis of patient outcomes revealed CABG improvements were statistically significant and showed improvement after implementing improvement strategies. The project suggests improvement projects in hospitals to prevent CABG SSI should focus on a team approach and incorporate evidence-based practices as effective interventions and solutions.","624":"Sepsis is well described in the literature as a leading cause of possibly preventable death in the United States. Analysis of baseline data indicated capacity to reduce mortality, significant variation in clinical practice patterns and opportunities for reducing cost per case.

Systematic improvements in recognizing sepsis and standardizing care resulted in a dramatic reduction in mortality and a significant reduction in direct variable cost.","625":"Managing the delivery of healthcare in a turbulent environment is challenging. In this article, Joel T. Allison shares his knowledge, experiences, and best practices on healthcare technology and quality care.","626":"Nonclinical healthcare processes are sometimes created on an ad hoc basis and hence over time may grow unnecessarily complex and difficult to assess, teach, improve, or transfer. Intentionally designing processes are more likely to yield an efficient and effective process. Originally developed in industry, Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) is a method for planning new processes applicable to healthcare. Benefits from using DFSS include well-defined process steps and documentation that makes processes easier to teach, monitor, control, and transfer to other units. We describe the DFSS process and provide an example of its application to an employee influenza vaccination program at a New England hospital.","627":"Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a structured methodology for transforming processes, but it does not fully consider the complex social interactions that cause processes to form in hospital organizations. By combining LSS implementations with the concept of Realistic Evaluation, a methodology that promotes change by assessing and considering the individual characteristics of an organization's social environment, successful and sustainable process improvement is more likely.","628":"The Federal government has initiated an executive order to address quality measurements and incentives promoting quality and efficiency. Healthcare organizations are using Toyota Production System's Lean continuous quality improvement to provide a framework for this. Though large healthcare organizations have the resources to embrace Lean, few rural hospitals have been known to use Lean's process improvement philosophy. This paper discusses the journey a 99-bed rural hospital took to integrate Lean into its organization and the outcome.","629":"The nation's emergency rooms are overflowing with patients who endure increasingly long waits to be examined and treated. When our large metropolitan adult acute care hospital adopted LEAN as its standard operating procedure, we began to examine our processes from the customers' perspective and identified a significant opportunity to reduce the emergency department length of stay. Using LEAN tools we designed and implemented a Rapid Assessment and Disposition process to decrease the amount of time patients waited in the emergency department, reduce diversion time, and reduce the number of patients who left without being seen. We have succeeded in reducing the average length of stay for all emergency department patients by 45 minutes, diversion by 55%, and patients who left without being seen by 28%.","630":"A patient's access to healthcare resources often begins with scheduling an appointment with a medical doctor or other provider. An inefficient scheduling system leads to unnecessary delays in providing care for patients and frustration for referring physicians.

Key questions are whether the two interact and if so, how can that relationship be leveraged to obtain maximum gains in both employee and patient satisfaction. This article examines the experience of a large, nonprofit home care agency in exploring these issues. The agency found that organizational commitment to patient care and customer service are fundamental to patient satisfaction. The more employees perceived that the organization is focused on quality and customers, the more patient satisfaction increased. Among nurses, work-life balance, fair compensation, and regard for employees all influenced patient satisfaction.","635":"The aging population and the associated rise in the prevalence of chronic conditions suggest that the home health population is increasingly complex and challenging to manage. The purpose of this study was to use national administrative data (Outcome and Assessment Information Set assessments of persons discharged in 2004 and 2005) to examine the clinical complexity of older adults admitted to home healthcare. Our descriptive analyses confirm that multiple chronic conditions and cognitive impairment are common and result in longer lengths of stay. The findings support the need for geriatric home healthcare practices that effectively address multiple morbidities and cognitive function.","636":"Although a growing body of literature supports the expansion of patient and family involvement in healthcare processes, little attention has thus far been directed at activating geriatric home care patients and\/or families to be more effective in managing health-related activities. In this manuscript we consider the unique needs, attributes, and circumstances of the geriatric home care population in conjunction with patient, family, provider, and organizational interventions with a primary or secondary objective of activating patients and\/or families. We summarize what has been learned from these efforts, with attention to feasibility and potential applicability to geriatric home care.","637":"The post-acute and long-term care systems are changing rapidly, with an increasingly important role being played by home care. Under the current system, home care does not consistently meet the needs of older people living in the community. This problem is caused, in large part, by the existing system of financing and regulating home care. This paper examines how the current system funded by Medicare, Medicaid, state programs, private insurance, and out-of-pocket spending affects the delivery and quality of home care services. Specifically, this paper analyzes how financing, coverage of services, reimbursement, quality regulation and assurance, and information coordination affects the quality of home care. The paper concludes by drawing implications for policy.","638":"Home healthcare agencies frequently strive to improve quality of care through the use of guidelines to promote best practices.

Pharmacists and industrial engineers identified areas for improvement, including a reduction in the interruption of regular pharmaceutical operations for the expedited preparation of chemotherapy treatments and the development of more robust drug preparation procedures that would ensure medication safety. The establishment of a satellite hematology\/oncology pharmacy was also examined. Procedural changes were proposed in an effort to increase the safety and service levels of chemotherapy treatments for patients with hematological and oncological disorders.","666":"The need for measures of the quality of healthcare provided to children and adolescents is well documented. However, children have been underrepresented in national healthcare quality measurement and reporting efforts. The Pediatric Data Quality Systems (Pedi-QS) Collaborative is addressing this gap. Two consensus measure sets and an assessment of nursing-sensitive indicators in pediatric care have been produced through the collaborative. The framework and measure set development process are described. Lessons learned from applying the process are summarized, and future directions are suggested. Voluntary collaborative efforts are vital for advancing children's measures, and national support and funding are also needed.","667":"","668":"","669":"The American College of Cardiology-National Cardiovascular Data Registry was used to assess the impact of a community education campaign related to heart disease in women on the number of women, relative to men, receiving diagnostic catheterization prior to initiation of the campaign and at 2-year follow-up. Catheterizations fell 7.03% in men and 0.96% in women. Although there was no increase in catheterizations, the relative change in the number of women receiving diagnostic catheterization versus men receiving diagnostic catheterization was 6.07% (p = .04). This finding was associated with a structured educational intervention targeted at healthcare providers and women at the intervention hospital.","670":"Most quality management initiatives in behavioral healthcare have focused on adverse events, clinical processes, or cost variables. Considerably less attention has been paid to indices of clinical improvement, likely because of a lack of agreed-upon measures of improvement, a lack of availability of simple methods for data collection and analysis, and an inability to provide timely feedback regarding clinical improvement, among other reasons. A computerized system was designed to collect relevant psychiatric symptom ratings in a manner that allows for real-time feedback at the patient and clinician Levels regarding clinical improvement and for higher-level, administrative evaluation of overall clinic performance. The costs and benefits of this system are discussed.","671":"Consistent monitoring for quality indicators as adverse events or missed screening opportunities remains a difficult proposition for most healthcare organizations. Much of the clinical data needed for quality reports is imbedded in narrative reports in the electronic health record. Narrative data most often require costly retrieval by manual data extraction. NUD*IST, a qualitative research computer program, was used as an automated natural Language processing tool to extract and code data for analysis of screening and treatment for breast cancer. The study method demonstrated acceptable Levels of precision and recall compared to large-scale natural Language processing programs.","672":"Kevin B.

Four leading national pediatric organizations recently came together to form the Alliance for Pediatric Quality (the Alliance), an organization that works to identify and encourage the adoption of pediatric quality measures suitable for quality improvement and public reporting. The National Quality Forum (NQF) already has endorsed more than a dozen quality measures specific to pediatric care, and another two dozen pediatric measures currently are under review. Together, these efforts reflect increased resolve to bring pediatric care into the fold of pay-for-performance and public reporting initiatives, and they offer much promise for driving rapid improvements in the quality of healthcare for children.","680":"Patient safety is a critical component of the U.S. healthcare system: thousands of people, including children, die or are injured yearly as a result of medical error. We designed and implemented a novel error-reporting tool for the pediatric intensive care unit. More errors were reported with the use of this paper-based tool than with the existing computerized error-reporting system. We also developed a scoring system to assess potential harm to the patient. The tool provided information about frequent and high-risk errors that guided successful improvements in patient care and safety and the achievement of measurable success.","681":"Working under a mandate for public reporting, children's hospitals in Texas joined in a partnership with the state with the intent of working toward providing meaningful assessment of the quality of pediatric inpatient care.

The Condition HELP call receives the same immediate attention as a life-threatening emergency, including deployment of a specialized rapid response team to the child's bedside. This article presents a 2-year analysis of pediatric patient safety outcomes following the implementation of the program.","684":"Discharge teaching in a pediatric hospital setting is difficult because the situation involves multiple learners, time constraints, and differing skill levels of nurse teachers. Shortened length of stay forces nurses to complete patient education efficiently. Unstructured education can lead to failed learning, as evidenced by readmissions and postdischarge feedback. A performance improvement project was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of standardized teaching plans for diabetes mellitus and infant cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Preliminary data indicated a passing score of at least 90% on posttests by all learners, suggesting that standardized teaching plans may help nurses complete prescribed discharge teaching.","685":"The medical home is a conceptual model of continuous and comprehensive care provision that is associated with improved outcomes for children with special healthcare needs. Most applications of the medical home have focused on improving primary care services. Despite concerted efforts to apply the medical home concept to the care of children with special healthcare needs, many barriers to its implementation still exist, in particular, for the subset of children with special healthcare needs who are medically complex.

This study was conducted to identify factors that hinder and facilitate EHR adoption in LTC facilities. Study participants were LTC nurses, administrators, and corporate executives. Primary barriers identified were costs, the need for training, and the culture change required to embrace technology. Primary facilitators were training programs, well-defined implementation plans, government assistance with implementation costs, evidence that EHRs will improve care outcomes, and support from state regulatory agencies. These results offer a framework of action for policy makers, LTC Leaders, and researchers.","690":"Medical science historically focuses on biomedical research about causes and treatment of disease.

Development of consistent processes for early risk stratification of patients with acute coronary syndrome and provision of evidence-based therapy will reduce variability. A reproducible system of care for patients with acute coronary syndrome was developed. Results show that the current mean time to electrocardiogram was 9 minutes. The percent of patients receiving aspirin within 24 hours of arrival was 96%. Average door-to-reperfusion time was less than 90 minutes in 55% of patients. Reperfusion was accomplished by percutaneous coronary intervention for 92% of patients. Mortality for patients experiencing an acute myocardial infarction decreased 30%, from 8.9% in fiscal year 2003 to 6.2% in fiscal year 2007.","692":"Short, unnecessary hospitalizations are the largest contributor to erroneous Medicare payment. A team of medical, nursing, case management, and coding and billing professionals used process improvement techniques to reduce inappropriate 1-day admissions among 20 hospitals with high 1-day-stay utilization. Interventions included performance feedback, root cause analyses, process redesign, monthly progress monitoring, and quarterly pattern analyses. Over a 6-month period, the unweighted average admission error rate was reduced from 39% to 21% (p &lt; .01). An estimated 1,396 1-day stays were prevented or denied payment, resulting in an annual savings of $6 million for Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.","693":"Since 2002, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have reported quality measures on the Nursing Home Compare Web site. It has been assumed that nursing homes are able to make improvements on these measures. In this study researchers examined nursing homes to see whether they have improved their quality scores, after accounting for regression to the mean. Researchers also examined whether gains varied according to market competition or market occupancy rates. They identified some regression to the mean for the quality measure scores over time; nevertheless, they also determined that some nursing homes had indeed made small improvements in their quality measure scores. As would be predicted based on the market-driven mechanism underlying quality improvements using report cards, the greatest improvements occurred in the most competitive markets and in those with the Lowest average occupancy rates. As policies to promote more competition in Long-term care proceed, further reducing occupancy rates, further, albeit small, quality gains will likely be made in the future.","694":"","695":"","696":"Interventions involving outreach to members via telephone are dependent on the success of reaching the member and engaging him or her in a discussion about treatment.

Organized under the umbrella of care management, 11 functional teams, ranging from process improvement and patient safety to clinical innovation and population health management, were created to achieve this goal. Initially focused on improvement with core measure metrics, these teams and their related work groups (focused on more task-specific work) initiated their plan in 20 facilities in seven states and supported local implementation of recommended changes that were grounded in evidence-based medicine. With 2 years of experience with this process, Banner Health began a 3-year journey from 2004 to 2006 to reach upper-quartile performance in select clinical quality metrics. A retrospective account of the experience follows.","700":"This study investigated two contributing factors in predicting adverse events in hospital settings. We approached this issue using the statistical procedure of hierarchical linear modeling to test for multilevel relationships. We found that the resource intensity of the presenting case was related to the severity level of negative incidents in hospital settings in a large metropolitan center. More important, we found that a more positive culture of patient safety within hospital units was related to lower incident severity. More than 8,000 admissions within 40 different units in three hospitals were included in the analyses.","701":"Streakiness in performance is a well-known phenomenon. The theoretical adverse effect of such runs of outcomes on standard statistical process control tools is widely known--resulting in an increased rate of \"false alarms.\" Should healthcare managers view this effect as an important practical concern for quality management? This article investigates cardiac surgery outcomes in Florida for more than 200 high-volume surgeons. The results confirm the presence of statistically persuasive streakiness in performance for an unexpectedly high number of surgeons. Also, cumulative sum charts may be more useful than the standard Shewhart process control charts to analyze this type of data.","702":"Open-access scheduling is a method of reducing both waits in access to care and the number of appointments missed by outpatients. The Department of Veterans Affairs has pioneered a system that includes a feature known as advanced clinic access as a quality improvement project to improve access to care. Patients are not scheduled for an appointment more than 30 days in advance but instead are reminded 30 days before anticipated appointments to call to be scheduled. Same-day appointments are also available. Although this system may pose theoretical disadvantages for the elderly, in Miami no significant reduction occurred in numbers of patients seen, and the number of missed appointments decreased significantly.","703":"This brief report describes the process of developing a valid and reliable questionnaire for quality measurement of pediatric day surgery care from the families' perspective. Questionnaire items were generated through a literature search and interviews with clinicians and parents. A computer-assisted telephone interview was used to administer the questionnaire to 448 parents within 72 hours of patient discharge. Tests of reliability and validity were administered, and questionnaire items were improved or omitted based on the results. The investigators plan to readminister the improved questionnaire to confirm its validity and reliability.","704":"","705":"Policy makers and providers have taken steps to address quality concerns in acute and Long-term care (LTC); however, serious quality problems remain. Efforts to measure quality have focused primarily on technical quality, assessing whether certain healthcare outcomes are achieved. Advocates for a patient-centered approach urge a shift to an assessment of functional quality that would include an overall evaluation of the service encounter that is heavily reliant on input from the service recipient. This article provides a discussion of why measuring quality in LTC is more challenging. Because a more comprehensive approach to quality is warranted in LTC, recommendations are made for using a 360-degree approach.","706":"Several sources of variation are associated with the number of survey deficiencies that can be received by nursing homes in the yearly survey and certification process. One source is variation across states. A second source of variation occurs within states. A third source of variation occurs for each facility across time. As measures of quality, large degrees of inconsistency are likely inappropriate and inefficient; thus, in this study survey deficiency variability was examined. The data used came from the 1991 through 2003 Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting system. We used two measures of deficiencies: (1) the number of quality-of-care deficiency citations (19 citations) and (2) all 185 deficiency citations. The results of the analyses suggest that recent changes by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in the survey and certification process have had little impact on the considerable variation in the use of deficiency citations. The high degree of variation limits the usefulness of deficiency citations not only for CMS but also for consumers and providers.","707":"Defining how preprinted physician orders are developed within a hospital has the potential to positively affect patients' care, services, safety, and outcomes. When they are well designed, preprinted physician orders improve interdisciplinary integration in care and promote accurate communication. Designing good preprinted orders is both an art and a science that can benefit all hospitalized patients and all disciplines within healthcare.","708":"","709":"","710":"Studies have shown that administering prophylactic antibiotics within 60 minutes of a surgical incision decreases the chance of postoperative infection. A large women's hospital that performs 8,000 surgical procedures per year committed to preventing infection by participating in a study. The study participants were patients who had undergone an abdominal hysterectomy. For testing and implementing improvements, the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle performance improvement method was used. In order to benchmark and to share best practices, the hospital joined the Surgical Infection Prevention Collaborative. The result of the study was antibiotic prophylactic delivery 60 minutes prior to incision in the abdominal hysterectomy population from a baseline of 10% to greater than 90% from 2003 to 2005. This result could not have been accomplished without the dedication and teamwork the hospital staff demonstrated.

Evidence about BSC usage in low-income countries (LICs) is deficient. This study assessed feasibility of BSC use in LICs. Systematic review of electronic databases shows that the BSC improved patient, staff, clinical, and financial outcomes in HICs. To translate the experience of BSC use in HICs to their use in LICs, the applicability parameters of the National Committee for Quality Assurance were applied. Despite contextual challenges, pilot testing of BSC use can be undertaken in selected LICs. Committed leadership, cultural readiness, quality information systems, viable strategic plans, and optimum resources are required.","714":"The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a follow-up system for positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) results in a single tertiary care hospital. The system consisted of a designated nurse who reviewed records of all positive FOBT cases for appropriate follow-up testing and notified clinic managers if no follow-up occurred. This system identified 63\/423 (15%) of positive FOBT cases with inadequate follow-up in a 10-month period, but it was unsuccessful in ensuring subsequent follow-up in 24% of these cases. Primary care providers often lacked knowledge regarding appropriate follow-up testing. More direct follow-up of positive FOBT results is recommended.","715":"Disparities in healthcare represent a failure in the equity domain of quality. Although disparities have been well documented, little has been written about how hospitals might use improved data collection and quality improvement techniques to eliminate disparities.

The authors also discuss the changes in policy and practice that may speed hospitals in placing disparities and equity on their quality agendas.","716":"Lessons may be learned from analyzing how a medical unit dramatically improved patient satisfaction scores, only to have the scores drop in future years. This article describes one hospital's experience in improving patient satisfaction by employing a parallel learning structure that promoted innovation and employee involvement. The reasons that gains in patient satisfaction and quality were not sustained are analyzed, and change management theory is used to explain what healthcare managers can do to prevent such capitulation in their own improvement efforts.","717":"","718":"The use of institutional measures of control such as seclusion and restraint within psychiatric hospitals is common and arguably countertherapeutic; however, little is known about how best to reduce the use of these measures. The development and implementation of new institutional strategies to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint are important. Although traditional performance improvement (PI) project methodology might seem well-suited to helping managers and administrators identify effective hospital-wide interventions to decrease seclusion and restraint rates, the Logic of the standard PI model precludes managers from making valid inferences about which interventions actually cause change. This article presents a model (derivative of the multiple baseline time-series design with randomization) for testing individual elements of a Large-scale PI project to reduce the use of seclusion and restraint in a behavioral healthcare organization. The proposed model is flexible, accommodates overlapping organizational initiatives, and simultaneously allows for meaningful inferences to be made about the active components of the interventions. The ability to make meaningful inferences is important because, if the initiatives to reduce seclusion and restraint rates work, other healthcare organizations would benefit from knowing Key Words which specific interventions actually Lead engagement model to change and which interventions have multiple baseline design Little impact on secLusion and restraint performance improvement rates. Early experiences with this model psychiatry from a hospital manager's perspective sanctuary trauma are discussed, along with the costs and benefits of using it.","719":"Hospitals and long-term care facilities have been addressing the issue of patient safety for some time. As a result of the increasing number of outpatient medication errors leading to adverse drug events (ADEs), interest in preventing outpatient medication errors has increased. Research indicates that the rate of outpatient ADEs may be about four times as high as that reported in hospital studies and that more than one third of these events are preventable (Gandhi et al., 2003). Harvard Pilgrim Health Care introduced its Medication Reconciliation Program in an effort to enhance patient safety by improving medication use and safety.","720":"","721":"","722":"Hand hygiene is undoubtedly the most important strategy in combating the increasing incidence and debilitating effects of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare.

The findings indicate that further research is needed to identify reliable and valid measures of hand hygiene.","723":"Ethical and regulatory guidelines recommend disclosure of medical errors to patients and families. Yet few studies examine how to effectively train healthcare professionals to deliver communications about adverse events to family members of affected pediatric patients. This pilot study uses a preintervention-postintervention study design to investigate the effects of medical error disclosure training in a simulated setting for pediatric oncology nurses (N=16). The results of a paired t test showed statistically significant increases in nurses' communication self-efficacy to carry out medical disclosure (t = 6.68, p &lt; .001). Ratings of setting \"realism\" and simulation effectiveness were high (21 out of 25 composite score). Findings provide preliminary support for further research on simulation-based disclosure training for healthcare professionals.","724":"Potential reasons for failure to report medical errors include concerns about adverse publicity, fear of litigation and professional sanctions, the burden of reporting, uncertainty about what information is required to be reported, and lack of feedback. The Patient Safety Quality and Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) was passed by the U.S. Congress as a response to these issues. Successful implementation of PSQIA requires changes such as moving toward an incentive-based system or providing continuing education programs for healthcare providers. In addition, the reform of residency programs will help in the implementation of PSQIA by future healthcare providers.","725":"","726":"","727":"","728":"Patients who were moved from a traditional medical ward to a new state-of-the-art medical ward were surveyed regarding their perceptions of quality during their hospitalization. Respondents rated the environment of the state-of-the-art facility, as well as the overall quality of their hospital stay, more positively. However, fewer differences in perceptions of the quality of the broader hospital environment and little difference in the perceived quality of staff-patient interactions were found. Findings indicated that enhancing the facilities of the patient care environment improved patients' overall perceptions of the quality of their hospital stay.","729":"Clinicians are confronted with various and often conflicting sets of practice guidelines that direct provision of preventive care. This conflict among guidelines is detrimental to the delivery of preventive care and creates a major barrier to improving these services. This study used a systematic approach to reach consensus among health plan medical directors on clinical preventive services (CPS) guidelines. A consistent set of 17 CPS guidelines was identified that all health plans could endorse as being a priority for implementation. This approach provides a template for competing health plans nationwide to reach consensus on guidelines that support clinicians in the delivery of CPS.","730":"This retrospective cohort study determined trends and patterns of mammography rates during 5 years (1997-2001) among female Medicare beneficiaries ages 50 years and older in Connecticut to better understand changes in rates over time and to plan future interventions. Time series analysis and hierarchical Longitudinal logistic regression were used to assess changes over time. Mammography rates increased significantly during the 5-year period (p &lt; .001). A cyclical pattern was observed for all age groups and counties, with dips and peaks in the spring and fall each year (average increase 8% per year), consistent with concentrated intervention activity at those times.","731":"Measurement is a cornerstone for improvement activities, and although the MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, OH, gathered a significant amount of improvement data, it did not have a consistent mechanism for sharing the data with the nursing unit and the frontline nursing staff. A process was implemented to improve data distribution, thus making the data more accessible. Following the implementation of this process, the frontline nurses were more engaged in improvement activities, and significant improvement was noted on several measures.

A causal-modeling design, using Donabedian's Quality Framework, tested hypothesized relationships among structure, process, and outcome variables to assess quality of care provided to this population. Structural assessment revealed that administrative and staff organization affected patients' trust in their provider and satisfaction with their care. Interpersonal process factors of racism, cultural mistrust, and trust in providers had a significant effect on satisfaction, and perceived racism had a negative effect on blood pressure (BP). Poorer quality in technical processes of care was associated with higher BP. Findings support the utility of Donabedian's framework for assessing quality of care in a disease-specific population.","734":"Is an activity quality improvement (QI), or is it research? And why does the distinction make a difference? While national leaders deliberate on how to answer these questions, healthcare organizations must act to ensure patient safety in both QI and research activities. The current system used by researchers for more than 30 years has not always protected human subjects. The result has been patient injuries and even death. Could QI activities result in patient injuries and death? This article offers healthcare quality professionals information that will better equip them to ensure safe practice and protect human subjects.","735":"In a study of 59 veterans and healthcare workers, the reliability of a self-monitoring method used to track the frequency of a spiritually oriented stress reduction technique was assessed. During a 5-week program of silently repeating a mantram (a spiritual word or phrase) to lower stress and anger and improve spiritual well-being, portable wrist-worn counters were used to track daily mantram practice sessions. All outcomes significantly improved in the hypothesized direction. Mantram practice tracked by the counters was highly correlated (r = .84) with retrospective self-reports, indicating that such counters may be a reliable self-monitoring tool and could be used to measure a variety of other behavioral health quality indicators.","736":"The definition of quality is complex, elusive, and ambiguous. Cross-disciplinary definitions, usually assumed to be identical, vary in significant and subtle ways. Clear definition of a problem is the first step in correcting or improving it. Therefore, identification and increased understanding of disciplinary definitions of quality healthcare are needed. Development of a universal definition would be the ideal solution and would support quality improvement and patient safety efforts and programs. This article compares and contrasts definitions of quality in four selected healthcare disciplines and offers recommendations for how healthcare quality professionals might address and mitigate the ambiguity.","737":"","738":"Healthcare managers are beginning to collect full population data, rather than sample data, on some patient and performance measures. For example, hospitals and healthcare systems already gather and store comprehensive data on admissions, ambulatory encounters, and other procedures. And as the electronic medical record is more widely used, complete population data will be collected on an even wider range of clinical measures, such as blood pressure and Laboratory values, in both inpatient and outpatient settings. To correctly monitor process quality when working with full population data, rather than sample data, healthcare managers will need appropriate statistical tools. Traditional control charts, which are used for tracking processes over time, are not suitable for such population data because they are based on the assumption that sample data are being collected. The author proposes a new type of control chart specifically for use with such population data: population control charts. These control charts can be used for monitoring processes that have output measures with continuous, binomial, or nonbinomial rate variables.","739":"This article assesses the extent to which a team using quality improvement methods could improve the timeliness of the flow of admitted patients through the emergency department in one hospital. Using a structured approach, a multidisciplinary team redesigned the processes for admitting patients from the emergency department to the inpatient unit. Indicators of capacity limitations in the inpatient environment were also identified as triggers for a tiered institutional response to capacity constraints. Three time intervals in the admission process were identified for measuring performance, with comparisons to the same months of the previous year to determine significance. Significant reductions in the median minutes for a majority of the time intervals studied were achieved during the 6-month study period. The data from the study suggest that improvements in patient progression through an emergency department can be achieved with quality improvement methods. Success factors for this and other improvement strategies are discussed.","740":"This article is the second of a 2-part series on a study of porter operations at Vancouver General Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

Participation in a knowledge-sharing network, a coordinated effort at reference-range establishment and validation, and development of quality and safety algorithms help them avoid many potentially costly problems. This article describes the experience of developing such a network over a 30-year period and illustrates the benefits of this practice.","745":"In spring 2005, Fairview Hospital, a small rural critical access facility, began an initiative to develop an integrated system for performance measurement and improvement. The system involved an organization-level change in the process of data collection, analysis, and dissemination, coupled with an organization-level change in structure that used the performance data to bring about continuous improvement. The system entailed no new investment in technology. Within the integrated system framework, Fairview used a patient-level composite score methodology to achieve dramatic improvement in core measure outcomes. This article describes key elements of Fairview's integrated system, as well as the specific initiatives that led to performance improvement on core measures, with the primary purpose of providing a framework for organization-level improvement.","746":"","747":"This article describes the emerging trend of using metrics in rural hospitals to achieve world-class performance. This trend is a response to the fact that rural hospitals have small patient volumes yet must maintain a profit margin in order to fulfill their mission to the community. The conceptual idea for this article is based largely on Robert Kaplan and David Norton's Balanced Scorecard articles in the Harvard Business Review. The ideas also come from the experiences of the 60-plus rural hospitals that are using the Balanced Scorecard and their implementation of metrics to influence performance and behavior. It is indeed possible for rural hospitals to meet and exceed the unique needs of patients and physicians (customers), to achieve healthy profit margins, and to be the rural hospital of choice that employees are proud to work for.","748":"Small and rural communities face unique challenges in improving healthcare quality. To address these challenges, MaineHealth, an integrated health system serving small and rural communities, leveraged knowledge, resources, and data through collaboration to help providers improve care and outcomes for asthma, heart failure, diabetes, and depression. The programs emphasized patient self-care, used uniform clinical standards, and supported population-based data collection. This collaborative approach provided an effective way to achieve improved outcomes across a geographically and structurally diverse system, and it can help influence improvement efforts in other small and medium-sized rural communities.","749":"The Pennsylvania Critical Access Hospital Consortium (PACAHC) has had success with an ambitious plan to bring together 12 small rural hospitals to support performance improvement initiatives. PACAHC differs from most other rural health networks or state Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Programs because of its multiyear process to implement Balanced Scorecards at every member hospital and its innovative coordination of data collection and reporting systems to enable performance comparison. PACAHC also convenes statewide performance improvement meetings that allow partner organizations, such as the state quality improvement organization, to contribute to improvement activities.","750":"","751":"","752":"","753":"Numerous studies demonstrate that patient satisfaction correlates with perceived timeliness of care. Turnaround time data identified Laceration patients as a subset of emergency department patients who were not receiving high-quality care. With the Define-Measure-Analyze- Devise-Verify methodology, root causes of delay in operations were sought, and remedies were devised. An education module and an improved patient-care process model were implemented. Through the use of continuous quality improvement, a wound-care process model improved turnaround times for laceration care by 30 minutes.","754":"In order to focus on and improve key aspects of patient satisfaction in its behavioral health programs, Catholic Health East (CHE) enhanced its measurement methodology. In an effort to be consistent with the federal government's movement from measuring patient advocacy programs to measuring patients' perceptions, CHE transitioned to behavior-based questions. These questions give clear targets for program goals and initiatives by objectively measuring whether certain events and desired staff behaviors occurred during treatment, rather than subjectively ranking attributes of institution-defined service. Through this change in approach, CHE may better align its care and services with patients' wants and needs, as illustrated by four case examples.","755":"Substance abuse among adolescents requires early intervention and proper treatment. Although substance use among this age group is considerable, the population of adolescents identified as having a substance use problem is significantly lower. Recent attention has focused on the use of adult substance abuse performance measures for quality improvement in this area. This article discusses the importance of performance measures for adolescent substance abuse treatment, the measurement tools now being developed, and implications for future treatment.","756":"This article examines variations in clinical practice for 30 clinical indicators. Patients' age, gender, and morbidity and certain characteristics of their physicians affected whether they received recommended care. Recommended care increased with patient age for 13 significant clinical indicators and decreased with age for 7 others. Males received recommended care more often for 12 of 13 clinical indicators. Recommended care varied by physician specialties for health screenings, disease management, and medication use. Patients seeing physicians who treated a high volume of patients generally received better care. The variations in recommended care suggest potential targets for healthcare quality improvements.","757":"Performance feedback is a common quality improvement (QI) intervention strategy in the outpatient setting. This article describes the use by one quality improvement organization (QIO) of performance feedback to primary-care physicians with claims-based measures relating to diabetes, adult vaccinations, and mammography screening. Feedback from the physicians identified themes relating to data accuracy, methodology of the feedback reports, reasons for low performance rates, and suggestions on how the QIO could improve its intervention strategy. The article highlights the value of collecting and analyzing formative data on the process and offers specific recommendations to other QI professionals contemplating the use of claims data for performance feedback.","758":"Medication errors are among the most common type of patient-safety error and therefore are a priority for organizational performance-improvement efforts. Medication reconciliation has been found to greatly reduce adverse drug and medication events. At one facility, a computer-generated Physician Discharge Medication Worksheet (PDMW) was developed to aid medication reconciliation. Use of this tool led to a reduction in discrepancies in drug frequency and dose, as well as therapeutic duplication, at the time of discharge. Through the use of the PDMW, medication reconciliation has been dramatically improved.","759":"The current relationship between payers and providers is often adversarial. The growth of managed care has fostered very little cooperation between the payer and provider, even though both are working toward improved patient outcomes. This article describes the process by which a payer and provider were able to transform a contentious relationship into a collaborative patient-centered program. The program demonstrates that through the sharing of retrospective utilization data, improved clinical and financial outcomes can be achieved.","760":"Healthcare organizations are under increasing pressure to evaluate and report the level of quality in their health services. The electronic medical record (EMR) has been used in acute care settings to provide clinical data for quality evaluations. The implementation of the EMR in primary care settings is a more recent development, and as a result, the EMR has not been widely used to evaluate quality in primary care. Little research exists that uses the primary care medical record as a source of data. What remains to be seen is the extent to which EMRs contain the variables needed to address quality of primary care. This article describes a study that investigated the viability of the EMR as a database for evaluating quality in a women's primary health clinic.","761":"Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota conducted a quality improvement project to quantify and improve the clinical and functional outcomes of low back pain and neck pain patients in a chiropractic network. Improved outcomes were encouraged through a financial incentive for implementation of standard clinical outcome measurement tools, quarterly feedback to individual practices, and a face-to-face meeting to share best practices. Although a large database on baseline neck pain and low back pain and functional disability was generated, and clinically and statistically significant improvements in outcomes were documented, progressive improvement in outcomes over the 4-year project period was not found.","762":"","763":"Patient safety indicators (PSIs) can be a valuable reporting tool to incorporate into patient safety plans to monitor performance and identify areas that warrant further investigation. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) developed PSIs as a low-cost tool to enable hospitals to monitor safety patterns within specific patient populations. Screening performance and evaluating it against empirical rates provided by AHRQ are the cornerstones of the PSI system.","764":"Lack of research expertise and participation in the nonacademic setting hinders evidence-based performance improvement in community hospitals. Research opportunities are limited in small hospitals, and staff nurses often are unfamiliar with research terminology and practice.

Two of the four measures of clinical quality showed statistically significant, moderately strong, positive correlations with a global measure of satisfaction and with, respectively, 5 and 7 subscales of the 10 subscales of satisfaction under examination (Pearson's r ranged between .40 and .67, 2-tailed; p &lt; .05). Findings demonstrate that quality need not be a zero-sum issue, with clinical quality and service quality competing for resources and attention.","769":"The 2003 National Healthcare Disparities Report underscored the need for performance measurement of evidence-based preventive services for at-risk populations. This study compares receipt of primary care prevention services among homeless and nonhomeless veteran patients who received Veterans Affairs (VA) medical care services. The study used chart review data on a national sample of 94,932 veterans with chronic medical conditions whose care was reviewed through the VA External Peer Review Program during 1998 and 1999. Receipt of eight preventive services was examined: two measures of immunization, four of cancer screening, and two of tobacco use and counseling. In risk-adjusted models, recently homeless veterans received 9% fewer prevention services for which they were eligible. Modest differences in receiving prevention services between domiciled and recently homeless veterans suggest that targeted efforts are needed to facilitate access to needed medical services in this population.","770":"","771":"Interview techniques have evolved to include objective testing and situational assessment methods, and an applicant for a quality leadership role in today's market may encounter these new techniques.

This article describes a 3-year longitudinal study of QI process innovations in two nursing homes and highlights details of a successful 6-month initiative. The initial QI initiatives were based on the principles of staff empowerment, enhanced ability through training, and financial incentives. After 18 months without measurable success, the QI process was modified to include real-time feedback. Two not-for-profit nursing homes participated in this study to explore the effect of organizational change in nursing homes on residents' quality of care and QoL and staff members' job satisfaction. At 6-month intervals, residents and staff participated in structured assessments of residents' QoL and quality of care and staff members' job satisfaction. When the QI process was modified to include real-time feedback, there was a significant reduction in the rate of new pressure ulcers, stage 2 or greater (p &lt; .05), in one of the facilities that had struggled with this problem for more than 18 months. By examining QI processes in nursing homes, the researchers were able to identify some of the obstacles to improving quality of care and QoL. Only when the element of real-time feedback was introduced, in combination with enhanced staff abilities and financial incentives, were substantial improvements seen in key clinical outcomes.","773":"","774":"","775":"","776":"Integrating behavioral healthcare into the primary care setting is associated with many benefits; however, plans to integrate care must address several challenges. This article identifies the challenges of integrating behavioral health specialists into primary care and describes strategies used to overcome these challenges.","777":"This article describes the development of a novel model for quality assurance of pediatric asthma using administrative data and clinical guidelines. Children for whom drugs for asthma were dispensed during 1998 were recruited from the drug-dispensing registry of the largest health maintenance organization in the southern region of Israel. The Israeli clinical guidelines were translated into a list of six markers for inadequate treatment. This list was used for a computerized search in the drug registry, and cases with markers were noted as cases in which inappropriate treatment was provided. The model was validated by proving that there was an association between inappropriate treatment (markers) and bad outcomes (emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and healthcare utilization). This model creates an interface between administrative and clinical information and provides an easy-to-use tool for quality assurance.","778":"The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires accredited organizations to assess individual competency of physicians granted membership on the medical staff. Verification of the competency of physicians caring for children in the acute-care setting presents a particular challenge for the clinical privileging of community physicians. At Cincinnati Children's Hospital, a knowledge-based reappointment method was developed and implemented. Using a case-based self-test, the initial phase measured physicians' knowledge of evidence-based guidelines for three common pediatric inpatient diagnoses. Future methods for tracking individual performance of community-based generalists at the time of reappointment were explored through a physician survey. Response was positive. This process may help keep community physicians engaged as vital members of the hospital staff.","779":"Staff members need appropriate training before the investigation and causal analysis of accidents in any complex system. Otherwise results will be incomplete and will be focused on the Least manageable contributors, such as the unsafe acts of frontline operators, regardless of the degree of organizational commitment. This is particularly true in healthcare, a field in which errors have traditionally been understood in terms of breaches of personal and professional accountability. This article outlines an incident investigation and root cause analysis workshop developed to address this training need for healthcare professionals representing the full spectrum of healthcare settings in Utah and Nevada and reviews feedback from participants.","780":"The new sciences of chaos and complexity are generating considerable interest within the social sciences, particularly with regard to organizational development, management, and Leadership.

PSAs, consisting of brief self-report questionnaires, were developed for asthma management and mammography screening and were mailed to participating physicians in a partially capitated Medicaid managed care insurance program. A random chart audit was conducted at each practice site, and results were compared to the PSA responses. An 85% concordance was found between the asthma PSA and chart data, and an 88% concordance was found between the mammography PSA and chart data. These findings suggest that the PSA, combined with random chart audits, can be a viable alternative to full chart reviews.","785":"This study assessed the extent of use of the subcutaneous insulin sliding scale (ISS) with hospitalized medical patients and examined the association between ISS use and glucose control. Despite some concerns about efficacy and suitability, the ISS is often used in the hospital studied. Researchers reviewed records of patients with a secondary diagnosis of diabetes who were admitted to the medical teaching unit of a tertiary care hospital. On day 1, 45.2% of patients were on an ISS alone. Patients on an ISS were more likely to experience hyperglycemia compared with patients on scheduled regimens, but they also had fewer hypoglycemic episodes.","786":"This article examines trends in avoidable hospitalizations to determine whether improved access following post-1997 Balanced Budget Act expansions in public health insurance programs resulted in a decreased rate among affected populations, particularly children of ages 0-19 years. Florida inpatient discharge data sets from 1992 to 2003 were compiled in order to analyze trends using descriptive and linear regression methods. The rate of avoidable hospitalizations for children was subsequently compared to that of adults (ages 20-64 years) to assess relative changes. The rate declined significantly for black and other nonwhite children. Based on age, the declines were concentrated in the subgroups for ages 0-1 year, 5-9 years, and 10-14 years. In contrast, the rate for adults, with the exception of nonwhite and black populations, increased. The decline in the overall rate of avoidable hospitalizations for children indicates that increased expenditures related to the expansions were at least partially offset. However, the trend could not be directly attributed to the Balanced Budget Act.","787":"The communication and documentation of radiology preliminary and final interpretations for the identification of discrepancies failed to evolve with radiology's transition away from film. Processes should facilitate documentation and distribution of preliminary findings to multiple practitioners in real time and should provide timely communication and documentation of additional findings. The evolution of the electronic medical record and digital radiology images provided an opportunity to establish effective, safe, and efficient methods of communication and documentation. Froedtert Hospital (Milwaukee, WI) used the Six Sigma process to improve communication and documentation of radiologic findings. Root causes of problems were determined, hypotheses were tested, and new processes were piloted and implemented. Froedtert Hospital improved its process for documenting and communicating preliminary and final interpretations and identifying discrepancies.","788":"This study examined the use of outcome reports sent to clinicians by a managed behavioral healthcare organization to monitor patient progress and its relation to treatment outcome. Results showed that clinicians who reported using outcome information had patients who also reported greater improvement at 6 months from baseline. Improvement per session was greatest among patients whose clinicians reported reading the outcome report and using outcome measures in their clinical practice. Using baseline and ongoing measures to assess patient improvement can provide clinicians with feedback during treatment, which may lead to better clinical outcomes and enable quality management systems in managed care to flag high-risk cases and identify failure of adequate improvement.","789":"","790":"The researchers developed a diabetes care quality summary score (DCQSS) that weights blood pressure, tobacco use, glucose information, and lipid information by cost-effectiveness for improving cardiovascular outcomes. They compared the DCQSS to selected Diabetes Quality Improvement Project (DQIP) measures of care in an urban Medicaid healthcare maintenance organization population using a retrospective chart review. The DCQSS assesses cardiovascular risk compared to individual risk-factor control with DQIP measures. The authors believe that the DCQSS provides an easier interpretation of diabetes quality than multiple DQIP measures.","791":"Most research shows a lower rate of avoidable hospitalizations associated with better access to outpatient care. Such findings have important implications for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), with its change from delivering mainly inpatient services to emphasizing quality ambulatory care. From 1999 to 2004 the number of avoidable hospitalizations at the VHA increased while the rate per 10,000 enrollees declined. The trend in the rate of avoidable hospitalizations and the rapid growth of the beneficiary population indicate that new enrollees had a higher health status and perhaps better access to outpatient care.","792":"Electronic patient records provide an opportunity for real-time access to patient information at the bedside, which has the potential to improve healthcare quality because it would increase efficiency and facilitate best practice. Patients in this study reported that portable computers used at the bedside did not affect the clinician-patient relationship. Many patients thought that the technology was a valuable tool and that it could foster an efficient hospital atmosphere and promote reliable and accurate medical documentation.","793":"","794":"Quality improvement is an essential feature of the ongoing development of palliative care programs. Little has been written, however, about using quality improvement as a strategy to introduce research concepts to staff and administrators for the purpose of enhancing research readiness in healthcare settings. This article describes such an endeavor. The authors discuss two quality improvement initiatives undertaken by a palliative care program in Canada. These two examples demonstrate how the quality improvement process acted as a catalyst to enhance research readiness.","795":"Hospitals continuously look for ways to improve patient care and retain high-quality physicians. Previous research indicates that physicians' satisfaction with where they practice is a crucial part of addressing these issues. A reliable and valid method to assess physician satisfaction is needed in order to identify potential areas of discontent. The purpose of the present study was to develop and validate a self-administered medical staff satisfaction survey. The survey contains 13 Likert-type items divided into three reliable subscales: Quality of Patient Care (alpha = .84), Ease of Practice (alpha = .76), and Relationship with Leadership (alpha = .92). Results from both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported the survey's structure and robustness across three independent samples.","796":"Statistical process control (SPC) charts have become widely implemented tools for quality monitoring and assurance in healthcare settings across the United States. SPC methods have been successfully used in industrial settings to track the quality of products manufactured by machines and to detect deviations from acceptable Levels of product quality. However, problems may arise when SPC methods are used to evaluate human behavior. Specifically, when human behavior is tracked over time, the data stream generated usually exhibits periodicity and gradualism with respect to behavioral changes over time. These tendencies can be quantified and are recognized in the statistical field as autocorrelation. When autocorrelation is present, conventional SPC methods too often identify events as \"unusuaL\" when they really should be understood as products of random fluctuation. This article discusses the concept of autocorrelation and demonstrates the negative impact of autocorrelation on traditional SPC methods, with a specific focus on the use of SPC charts to detect unusual events.","797":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has enforced federal requirements related to the use of methadone since 1972; regulations essentially have not changed for nearly 30 years. With Congress' recently released federal regulations for opioid treatment programs (OTPs), however, oversight of OTPs has shifted from the FDA to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Treatment developed guidelines for accreditation agencies such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and The Rehabilitation Accreditation Commission...CARF to develop standards for OTPs. Preliminary findings show that OTPs are indeed able to meet these accreditation standards. This article reviews the need for the changes, the history of methadone treatment oversight, the development of accreditation requirements, stakeholders' initial response to the proposed regulations, and performance domains of importance to OTPs.","798":"","799":"The focus of this article is secondary analysis of data to establish the psychometric properties of the TQManager Feedback Instrument. The TQManager Feedback Instrument was developed by Schmidt and Finnegan in 1993 to assess five key managerial competencies related to creating work environments where quality management can thrive. The overall instrument reliability measured by Cronbach's alpha was 0.97. Construct validity assessment using principal components analysis with varimax rotation did not empirically support the thesis that more than one dimension exists on the instrument. Further psychometric testing is needed. The preliminary results support the idea that the TQManager Feedback Instrument has potential for application in healthcare organizations trying to close the quality chasm.","800":"This article describes the structure, implementation, and early results of a performance-based hospital incentive program designed by a large nonprofit health plan. The Hospital Quality Service and Recognition program, developed by the Hawaii Medical Service Association, was launched in 2001 to reward high-quality medical care at the hospital level. This pay-for-performance program used administrative claims data, survey data, and hospital-reported information to assess hospital performance in risk-adjusted complications and risk-adjusted length of stay (LOS), patient satisfaction, and hospital processes of care measures. Financial incentives were provided to participating hospitals based on their performance on these measures. Preliminary outcomes of the program evaluated over a 4-year period after implementation revealed improvements in aggregated rates of risk-adjusted surgical complications and efficiency of care as evidenced by a substantial decrease in risk-adjusted average LOS for several surgical procedures. Quality improvement was demonstrated in several other program components including emergency department satisfaction. This quality incentive program offers an innovative approach for encouraging delivery of high-quality and service-oriented care in a statewide network of participating hospitals.","801":"","802":"To prevent adverse drug events for pediatric patients, increase care provider efficiency, and reduce stress for care providers, a technology tool was developed that calculates medication dosage requirements during emergency situations.

The 855 completed surveys (a 31% response rate) demonstrate that bereaved families are willing to give feedback on care received from nurses and physicians and attention paid to the personal needs of patients and families. The team used families' feedback to shape quality improvement initiatives and focused on questions with comparatively lower scores: physician communication, physician compassion, and family understanding of what to expect as their loved one approached the end of life.","804":"In the 21st-century healthcare environment, customer service remains critical to the fiscal viability of healthcare organizations. Continued competition for patients and diminishing reimbursements have necessitated the establishment of customer service programs to attract patients and retain outstanding employees. These programs should increase quality experiences for both internal customers (employees) and external customers (patients). This article describes a unique employee-driven customer service initiative titled Serving Together Achieving Results. Obstacles to implementing a customer service program in a multifaceted academic setting are highlighted, and the use of a novel tool, Q technique, to prioritize employee feedback is discussed.","805":"Healthcare, as with any other service operation, requires systematic innovation efforts to remain competitive, cost efficient, and up-to-date.

Controlling healthcare cost increases, improving quality, and providing better healthcare are some of the benefits of this approach.","806":"Focusing on the critical transitions of patients and their caregivers across healthcare settings and among providers is a promising approach to enhancing care coordination and improving quality. This article describes the research base for the transitional care of older adults and offers recommendations to advance the science, translate best practices into home healthcare settings, and improve the transitions of high-risk older adults to and from home healthcare. Home healthcare is a component of the healthcare industry uniquely positioned to improve transitional care and outcomes for the growing population of older adults with continuous complex needs.","807":"Persistent pain affects at least half of all older adults. The negative consequences of persistent pain are numerous and include depression, anxiety, and lower overall quality of life: However, pain is often underrecognized, underreported, underassessed, and undertreated, and multiple barriers to optimal pain practices exist. Although a solid evidence base exists for optimal pain practices, little progress has been made. This article reviews a study that developed and implemented a multifaceted intervention to improve pain practices in nursing homes and then examines the implications of those study findings for the home healthcare setting.","808":"Computerized drug utilization review (DUR) can potentially reduce adverse drug events. We examined automated DUR for home healthcare patients with diabetes or hypertension. Sixty-eight percent of diabetes patients and 50.7% of hypertension patients triggered severe, moderate, or duplicative alerts. Among diabetes patients, 74.3% of duplicative alerts were trivial or inappropriate, compared with 3.9% among hypertension patients. Experts judged that 40.5% of high-risk diabetes patients and 53.6% of hypertension patients had alerts requiring nurse follow-up. Adequate follow-up was significantly lower for the former. The relationship between inappropriate alerts and poorer follow-up reinforces the need for more specific alert systems to focus clinicians' attention on clinically important alerts.","809":"Since implementation of the Outcome and Assessment Information Set and publicly reported outcome indicators, a focus of home healthcare necessarily includes efforts to improve older patients' functional abilities. This article presents results from selected home-based research studies providing strategies for evidence-based practice to efficiently and effectively improve functional outcomes. Assessments and interventions are suggested, as well as administrative and clinical processes of care that have been found to successfully translate research into practice. Results suggest that if systems of care are redesigned, the payoff in patient and staff satisfaction and in improved functional and economic outcomes can be substantial.","810":"Implementation of research evidence into clinical practice is a complex and dynamic process that has become the subject of investigation in the field of \"translation science\" or \"knowledge utilization.\" Research shows how individuals, units, and organizations all influence the rate and extent of adoption of research evidence. Environmental factors also play an important role in this process. This article summarizes key lessons from translation science and examines the implications for the organization and delivery of home healthcare. The implementation of pain management guidelines is used as an example.","811":"Organizational climate generally refers to staff members' perceptions of organizational features like decision making, leadership, and norms. It is widely acknowledged that these perceptions influence patient, employee, and system outcomes. However, there has been little consensus on how best to measure these important relationships. This article examines how organizational climate has been defined and measured in health services research and identifies factors most important in home healthcare delivery. Standardization of climate measures will facilitate the ultimate goal of translating results into evidence-based management practices to improve the quality of care delivery.","812":"","813":"This article is designed to assist healthcare professionals in identifying begin and end ages for annual breast cancer mammography screening through the use of cost-effectiveness and computer modeling. With a limit of acceptability of $50,000 per life-year saved, the ages of screening were found to be 35 to 85. The present study identifies the end age for screening more clearly than currently available evidence while meeting the societal limits of $50,000 per life-year saved and equitable spending for the young and old alike.","814":"Palliative care is medical care that provides relief from suffering and support for the best possible quality of life for patients facing advanced chronic illness and for their families. Healthcare organizations use palliative care to improve quality of care, because it is an effective approach to relieving pain, discomfort, and stress; improving patient and family satisfaction; improving continuity and reducing fragmentation of care delivery; and contributing to efficient and effective use of healthcare resources. As a result of these outcomes, palliative care programs help hospitals meet pain management and other quality accreditation standards. This article summarizes the data, provides case examples of the effect of palliative care, and identifies resources for implementing programs.","815":"This article examines the degree to which healthcare information technology (HIT) supporting the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) six care aims is utilized in the hospital setting and explores organizational factors associated with HIT use. Guided by the IOM's Crossing the quality chasm report and associated literature, 27 applications and\/or capabilities are classified according to one or more of the six care aims. A structured survey of Florida hospitals identified the use of HIT. Results suggest that, on average, hospitals have not yet embraced HIT to support the IOM's care aims and that associated organizational factors vary according to care aim.","816":"In January 2002 Aurora Health Care Metro Region chartered an interdisciplinary team to develop a process and structure for patient-centered interdisciplinary care planning.

The purposes of this paper are to (a) describe a pilot application and adaptation of eight Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) measures to six NMCs, (b) report the findings from the quality assessments, and (c) compare findings to national HEDIS data. The eight quality assessment areas are asthma, cervical cancer screening, childhood immunizations, depression, diabetes, hypertension, mammography screening, and smoking cessation. The NMCs achieved or exceeded HEDIS 50th percentile levels in a number of important clinical areas, but did not attain the 50th percentile level in others. Thus, HEDIS measures are relevant for the assessment of care quality and provide useful data for quality improvement in NMCs.","818":"","819":"This brief report determines whether patients admitted to a large teaching hospital knew the name of their caretaker (physician or nurse) and whether emphasis on patients' awareness of this name improved their recall. A survey of 100 patients on the internal medicine and neurology services at a large teaching hospital in BrookLyn, NY, was conducted. A derivative survey was also conducted on 30 different patients to see whether caretaker name recall was enhanced after the patients were advised of the importance of remembering this name. Of patients initially tested, 14.7% correctly stated their physician's name, and 21.3% correctly stated their nurse's name (p &lt; 0.3). After being given the name of their physician in writing and being asked to remember it, 76.2% of a different group of patients correctly stated their physician's name. Less than a quarter of the patients initiaLLy surveyed were able to state either their physician's or nurse's name. However, after a specific effort to have a smaller group of patients remember their physician's name, more than 75% did so. Therefore, it was concluded that simple interventions such as providing the patients with their physician's name in writing and emphasizing the importance of knowing it result in a significantly greater percentage of physician-name recall.","820":"A p control chart is used to monitor a proportion from a binomial variable that reflects the output of a process. The p control chart is a graph that includes serial sample proportions (p) as the variables of interest, a centerline that represents the overall proportion of the samples (p), and upper control limits (UCLs) and Lower control Limits (LCLs) that represent three standard errors (SEp) above and below the centerline. We use a p control chart to estimate with 99.7% confidence that the population proportion of an output variable was within the interval defined by the UCLs and LCLs during a period of baseline monitoring. We further assume that if the process remains stable, the values of future population proportions will remain between the established control limits. An np control chart simply plots the numerators of the sample proportions as the variables of interest. A u control chart is used to monitor ratios. In u control charts, ratios are quantities in which the numerator can have one or more occurrences in reference to the denominator. A c control chart is analogous to an np control chart in that it graphs the numerators from the ratios.","821":"Statistical process control (SPC) can be thought of as the frequent monitoring of processes using inferential statistics. The feature that distinguishes SPC from the typical use of inferential statistics for analyzing populations is that in the former frequent samples are taken over time, whereas in inferential statistics a single sample is generaLLy taken before and after some intervention or treatment. An x-s control chart is used to monitor a continuous variable that reflects the output of a process. The x-s control chart is a graph that includes serial sample means (x) as the variables of interest, a centerline that represents the grand mean of the samples (x), and upper control limit (UCL) and lower control limit (LCL) that represent three standard errors (SEx) above and below the centerline. An x-s control chart is used to estimate with 99.7% confidence that the population mean of a continuous output variable was within the interval defined by the UCL and LCL during a period of baseline monitoring. It is further assumed that if the process remains stable, future population means wiLL remain between the control Limits for additional process outputs. Control charts allow the evaluation of both common- and special-cause variation. AnaLysis of the common-cause variation aLLows an assessment of the current process performance. Special-cause variation is identified when there is a sample mean that is beyond the UCL or LCL.","822":"Although acute chest pain accounts for five million emergency room visits annually, only 10% represent acute myocardial infarctions (AMI). Even patients with negative evaluations of chest symptoms experience subsequent cardiac events. Patients readmitted with AMI within 90 days after a cardiac evaluation were examined to identify potential errors in management that may have Led to readmission. Only six of 2,340 patients met criteria for AMI after a negative work-up. No medical errors were found to account for the subsequent AMI. No other previously published reports have investigated the quality of chest pain evaluations to find missed opportunities for cardiac event prevention.","823":"The intensive care unit (ICU) waiting room is a dynamic place that influences the satisfaction of families of critically ill patients. Waiting-room comfort and amenities are important, because families often spend a great deal of nonvisiting time there. A quality improvement evaluation of the ICU waiting room at Lehigh Valley Hospital, Allentown, PA, was conducted. Methods included distribution of an 18-item family survey, ethnographic observations, interviews, and assessment of the physical environment. Findings suggest that the role of the receptionist and access to food and other services were important to families and influenced their assessment of the quality of services provided by the ICU.","824":"This study tested whether an action research organizational intervention fostering participatory management practices would sustain a nursing best-care practice protocol in a nursing home. An experimental nursing home (EH) and a control nursing home (CH) with similar characteristics were studied over a 4-year period. A pretest\/posttest quasi-experimental design was used. Baseline data were co[lected on residents, families, and the staffs at the EH and the CH. Staff turnover rates, demographics of participant groups, and surveys concerning job stress, nursing care, family involvement, and satisfaction of residents and family members served as proximal outcomes to indicate whether organizational changes had occurred in the EH. Sustaining best practices in a nursing home requires not only significant organizational change but also changes in regulatory support for quality care, sufficient staff resources to implement and monitor the practices, and a change coordinator with sufficient formal or informal influence.","825":"","826":"","827":"As the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a major burden to the healthcare system and society at large. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment lead to an increased economic burden, with exacerbations being a key driver of costs. COPD symptoms compromise quality of life (QOL), which affects both patients and caregivers. Appropriate management decreases healthcare utiization and improves QOL. This article provides an overview of COPD and promotes understanding of opportunities to optimize patient health and outcomes for those with the disease. Specific interventions that have been demonstrated to improve clinical and economic outcomes for COPD include improved implementation of guidelines, optimized pharmacologic treatment, and risk-factor reduction.","828":"A distinguishing characteristic of high performance organizations is a strong internal control structure-controls that ensure patient care, compliance with regulations, internal efficiencies, and financial reporting. It is controls on financial reporting that are receiving a great deal of attention under a new law, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Public companies are now required by law to document controls over financial reporting, in order to fully address exposures and the effectiveness of current controls. Though many healthcare organizations are not directly affected by the law, regulatory agencies could follow suit and require similar compliance. In fact, several states have introduced bills that require nonprofit organizations to adhere to portions of the act. This article provides a guide for organizations desiring to stay ahead of the curve.","829":"","830":"","831":"Much literature exists detailing adverse outcomes associated with the use of seclusion and restraint (S&amp;R). Recognizing the negative effects of this intervention, one organization began a quality improvement project to reduce the use of this behavioral management strategy. A retrospective study using the medical record and the S&amp;R database was initiated to examine clinical symptoms at the point of admission of those individuals who later experienced an S&amp;R and to evaluate S&amp;R practices across treatment areas. This initial project identified the admission processes, early treatment initiatives, and individuals experiencing multiple episodes of S&amp;R as critical foci.","832":"Patients discharged from The Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX, are contacted post discharge and asked to assess the care provided; specific questions are focused on pain management. Responses to these questions were initially unfavorable: only approximately 72.4% of patients were completely satisfied. An interdisciplinary team was developed on an acute-care unit at the hospital to individualize pain management through daily rounds and improvements in nursing assessment. Kurt Lewin's change theory was utilized to improve patient outcomes and to bolster staff commitment to control pain more effectively--as evidenced by improved patient satisfaction scores to a high of 86% only 3 months following implementation of this new interdisciplinary program.","833":"This article describes a knowledge-transfer process developed by Catholic Health East (CHE), headquartered in Newtown Square, PA, and focuses on improving resident safety in the skilled nursing or long-term care setting. How the health system customized and implemented an electronic medical event database to identify opportunities for improvement to prevent future occurrences of adverse events is outlined. The database customization and subsequent discussion of results is conducted under the auspices of CHE's quality and patient safety department in collaboration with 18 of CHE's long-term care facilities.","834":"","835":"The healthcare industry has shown significant recent growth potential in Taiwan. Associated financial problems have grown considerably since 1995, when national health insurance was implemented. Taiwan's healthcare bureau began to change the primary quantity-based healthcare expense payment method to a case-based payment model. Hospitals are now challenged to minimize healthcare waste. This article examines the application of manufacturing-based Six Sigma methods to an X-ray radiography improvement project to reduce the defect ratio of films for a teaching hospital in Taiwan. It was determined that (1) analysis of customer satisfaction data helped the Six Sigma improvement team identify critical quality elements; (2) the Six Sigma Level in this healthcare project is Lower than that in the manufacturing industry; (3) the improvement opportunity and the time required for the project had a direct correlation to the importance ascribed to the project and the cooperation received; and (4) process change can be made more quickly in the healthcare industry than in the manufacturing industry.","836":"This article presents the case of the first ISO 9001:2000-certified small healthcare organization (the Center for Therapy and Rehabilitation) providing therapeutic and rehabilitation services for disabled children in Northern Poland.

This study compares the satisfaction rates of this unique population in different primary healthcare settings. Previously validated patient-satisfaction surveys were conducted 4 months apart in 10 large primary care clinics that treat home-front army career personneL. Satisfaction was highest in a civilian hospital-based primary care clinic. The specialized military career personnel clinics produced less satisfaction than the hospital setting, according to the survey; however, the differences were not statistically significant. Patient satisfaction was significantly lower in the classic military-based general practices. The hospital setting of civilian primary care created higher satisfaction in aspects of accessibility, availability, and interpersonal relationships. However, the patients' perception of quality of care was lower than in the other settings.","838":"","839":"Strategic planning for hospital inpatient capacity is important in providing quality healthcare service at a reasonable cost. This study estimates annual average hospital length of stay (LOS) as an aggregate quantity for all private and public hospitals in Singapore. Because LOS depends on a patient's medical history as well as on the severity and type of illness, it is a random variable that involves a wide spread. Hence, providing an accurate estimate for LOS poses a challenge but is very valuable. In this article, a multivariate fuzzy linear regression (FLR) model is developed for predicting aggregate annual LOS. The results show that FLR can provide accurate point and interval forecasts, although the amount of training data is small and the spread is wide.","840":"Wellspring is a group of cancer support centers in Ontario, Canada. The centers provide information, support, and coping-skills programs for people with cancer and their families. To ascertain that all centers provide the same high quality of programs, the board at Wellspring established a panel of external oncology experts and asked them to establish a process to review program quality in each center. This article outlines the process undertaken to provide quality improvement in a nonprofit charitable organization.","841":"Proxies, such as next of kin, often provide information to healthcare professionals about a cancer patient they know, particularly when this information is not available from the patient. Understanding the extent to which proxies offer reliable information about patients is important for improving the quality of patient care and also for assessing the quality of research, evaluation, and administrative data when proxy response is utilized. This study determined Levels of agreement between information reported by colorectal cancer patients and by their proxies about complementary and alternative medicine obtained by questionnaire response. Patient-proxy agreement was also compared for conventional therapies, patient demographics, lifestyle, and symptoms.","842":"Information technology (IT) that positively affects both quality of care and patient safety currently exists but is not used widely. This study identifies organizational and external factors associated with the adoption of patient safety-related IT (PSIT) in acute care hospitals in Florida. Factors found to be positively correlated with PSIT use included physicians' active involvement in clinical IT planning, the placement of strategic importance on IT by the organization, CIO involvement in patient safety planning, and the perception of an adequate selection of products from vendors. Other factors and implications are discussed as well.","843":"Healthcare professionals must make breast cancer screening decisions without the help of clear answers in current medical knowledge. This study used computer simulation to evaluate two screening protocols. The American Cancer Society (ACS) protocol comprising self-breast examination, professional breast examination and annual mammography was evaluated versus annual mammography alone. The effective frequency of mammography and the cost in the ACS protocol doubles the cost of mammography alone. Breast self-examination and clinical breast examination contributes to increased cost without any added health effects. These study results could be applied by healthcare professionals to assist their decision making for breast cancer screening.","844":"Several published articles have identified that providing automated, computer-generated clinical alerts about potentially critical clinical situations should result in better quality of care. In 1999, the pharmacy department at a community hospital network implemented and refined a commercially available, computerized clinical alert system.

In the Tech Care Coordination Program, older veterans with chronic diseases and high healthcare utilization were followed with an in-home technology device, the Health Buddy, and risk management software. Program staff could identify at-risk patients based on their responses to a series of questions about symptoms, behavior, and knowledge. Patients followed in the program for at least 6 months experienced a 45% decrease in hospital admissions, 67% decrease in nursing home admissions, 54% decrease in emergency room visits, and 38% decrease in pharmacy prescriptions. The patients also demonstrated improved compliance with treatment regimens and both patients and providers reported high levels of program satisfaction.","848":"Patient safety, in particular, medication safety, has become a major issue for healthcare providers, payers, and patients. Medication errors occur at an alarming rate, and the majority of non-intercepted medication errors originate at the point of care when a nurse mistakenly administers a medication. The 1999 Institute of Medicine report called for increasing the use of information technology to reduce medication errors. Realizing a 59% to 70% decrease in medication administration errors on individual nursing units, this hospital demonstrates how bar code point-of-care medication administration systems successfully track, reduce, and prevent bedside medicationerrors while having a positive effect on nursing satisfaction.","849":"","850":"","851":"Healthcare organizations can respond effectively and efficiently to the needs of consumers and the demands of customers, accreditation agencies, and regulators by implementing a comprehensive quality improvement (QI) program.

The Spanish translation of the survey demonstrated the same underlying factor structure of the English version of the survey, was reliable at both the subscale and overall level, and accounted for 81% of the variance in Spanish-language respondents' reported likelihood to recommend the hospital to others. Spanish-language respondents showed higher mean satisfaction levels with regard to most aspects of their care than English-language respondents, except when rating staff courtesy.","866":"From 1999 to 2003, the home health industry in the United States moved from an environment with extremely diverse data collection protocols and little or no dissemination of quality-related information, to an environment in which uniformly collected clinical data are transformed into information and then into publicly available reports using federally mandated quality indicators. This speed to action has raised many questions about the adequacy of home healthcare data and their use as quality-monitoring tools. This article summarizes current evidence about the scientific and clinical adequacy of data currently used to measure home healthcare quality and discusses roles of a variety of policy stakeholders in implementing and refining data, information, and quality indicators that are now the cornerstones of federal home healthcare quality policy. The scientific adequacy of Outcome and Assessment Information Set data is acceptable but bears routine monitoring and review; efforts should be made to develop home healthcare quality indicators sensitive to nursing interventions and published clinical practice guidelines for specific medical conditions; and policy stakeholders should collaborate to maximize the utility of home healthcare quality reports now disseminated to consumers, providers, and insurers.","867":"Examination of operational failures in home healthcare could yield important insights into improving patient safety. This article presents a case study of work system breakdowns observed in the home healthcare setting. The findings suggest that the biggest areas of opportunity are failures stemming from (a) insufficient support from home health agencies and (b) inadequate coordination with patients and their families. Factors that impede organizations from learning from employees' experiences with operational failures and steps that managers may take to overcome these hurdles are discussed.","868":"Penny Hollander Feldman, PhD, is Vice President for Research and Evaluation at the Visiting Nurse Service of New York (VNSNY) and Director of the Center for Home Care Policy and Research.

Although the components of an informatics infrastructure are available and applications that bring these components together to promote patient safety and enable EBP have demonstrated positive or promising results in the acute care setting, a number of challenges hinder implementation in home healthcare. Resolution of these challenges requires commitment and collaboration among key stakeholders.","870":"The 1990s brought shifts in the organization and financing of healthcare services and changes to the nursing workforce as well. These changes were pronounced in home healthcare, where growth in service use between 1988 and 1996 was followed by sharp contractions in home healthcare users and visits after changes in Medicare reimbursement policy in 1997. This article examines how the nursing workforce has responded to these changes, explores the challenges posed by the nursing shortage, highlights the gap in knowledge of the staffing-outcomes relationship and its implications for quality, and offers recommendations on ways to improve care.","871":"The home health industry has lagged in adopting evidence-based care but is now well positioned to adopt such practices. However, few clinical practice guidelines have been developed for the home healthcare setting. This paper reviews the existing evidence base for prevalent home healthcare diagnoses and conditions and the progress made in applying those practices in home healthcare. Existing guidelines for congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, falls, osteoarthritis, depression, and medication management could be modified for applicability to home healthcare.

A total of 41 acute care, 200-plus bed, not-for-profit hospitals in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania were included. Correlation and multiple-regression statistical methods were employed. The results revealed no relationship between these quality indicators on a summative level and no meaningful pattern categorical relationships. This finding suggests a disassociation between these two quality indicators, thus supporting the use of a balanced scorecard approach to hospital quality management. The study also revealed certain shortcomings in these two quality indicators, relating to insufficient score variability, which should be considered by those using such data to manage quality outcomes.","884":"Dystocia, or slow labor, is the leading cause of first-time cesarean sections. Current diagnostic guidelines for dystocia are vague, and there is no clear postoperative confirmatory evidence to assess the correctness of this diagnosis. For several decades, various professional organizations have indicated that cesarean rates could be lowered safely and have recommended levels that are far below national averages. The three major factors, of roughly equal importance, associated with cesarean for slow labor are the baby's weight, the mother's height, and the threshold at which the physician believes it is reasonable to intervene. The last is the only modifiable factor, and quality programs are a major part of changing medical behavior. By using two study designs, the effect of a mathematical method for evaluating labor progress on the rate of cesarean section was measured. In the prospective randomized clinical trial, the relative risk of cesarean in the experimental group was unchanged at 1.04. In the pretest-posttest analysis, the rates fell from 19.54% to 17.04% at 6 months and 16.62% at 12 months.","885":"Clinical decision units (CDUs) are a relatively new and growing area of medicine in which patients undergo rapid evaluation and treatment. Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is important for the establishment and functioning of CDUs.

By using a Plan-Do-Check-Act process improvement model, several interventions to decrease the infection rate were planned and implemented based on hypotheses generated from the characteristics of infected patients. These interventions included chlorhexidine preoperative shower, discontinuation of shaving, administration of antibiotics in the holding area, segregation of instruments, and implementation of an insulin protocol. Findings included a decrease in deep sternal and leg infections after implementation of these interventions. Deep sternal infection rates decreased from 2.1% to 1.5% and leg infection rates, from 1.93% to 0.47%. Results were not statistically significant but were clinically relevant. Furthermore, a total of $200,000 was achieved in cost savings in 1 year.","887":"A review of the literature (1995-2001) was conducted on the relationship-centered care model first proposed in Health professions education and relationship-centered care: A report of the Pew-Fetzer task force on advancing psychosocial education. The report describes a developmental process that occurs in four dimensions of relationship-centered care: patient-practitioner, practitioner-practitioner, practitioner-community, and self-awareness. Publications were read and sorted by professional affiliation of the first authors, dimension of relationship-centered care citations from the Pew-Fetzer Task Force report, and references to activities of regional relationship-centered care networks affiliated with the Fetzer Institute. The Pew-Fetzer relationship-centered care model, when included in healthcare professional education, will improve consumer and provider satisfaction.","888":"Nurse-managed anticoagulation is an emerging trend in primary care with the potential to improve the quality, efficiency, and responsiveness of outpatient anticoagulation services.

Using measurement selection criteria is the first step in developing a performance measurement system as a component of an overall quality management (QM) strategy. Opioid treatment programs can \"leapfrog\" the development of such systems by using lessons learned from the healthcare quality industry. This article reviews performance measurement definitions, proposes performance measurement selection criteria, and makes a business case for Internet automation and accessibility. Performance measurement sets that are appropriate for opioid treatment programs are proposed, followed by a discussion on how performance measurement can be used within a comprehensive QM program. It is hoped that through development, adoption, and implementation of such a performance measurement program, treatment for clients and their families will continuously improve.","893":"A rapid-response team process was used to achieve unique team synergy and project success.

A first step toward collaboration is an understanding of, and respect for, one another's roles. As part of a quality improvement project, we implemented a curriculum in which medical students \"shadowed\" nurses for 1 day and then measured the impact on their attitudes toward nurses' roles. Sixty-five students completed the program. Thirty students completed a validated survey instrument before and after the experience. Students demonstrated a trend toward improvement on the attitudes survey. Medical students highly valued the program and better appreciated nurses' roles.","896":"Quality improvement efforts in patient care are most successful when the entire healthcare team is involved in care planning.

One resource often overlooked as a strategic asset is the hospital board of directors. Too often hospital boards erroneously assume or are forced into the roles of either micro-management or crisis management. Board education, which focuses on pertinent healthcare market information and strategic decision making, can help board members' understanding of their roles. As part of its overall plan, hospital leadership should ensure that its board members understand the market environment and its effect upon the hospital's strategic directions, options, and priorities. This article focuses on the structure and type of information that board members need to know to better guide the hospital leadership through the decision-making process and to fulfill their obligations to the institution they serve.","901":"As PacifiCare Health Systems' senior vice president and chief medical officer, Dr. Sam Ho is responsible for developing and implementing strategies and programs to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of healthcare services throughout the company.

The authors sought to increase documentation of immunization status, and influenza immunization rates of these patients. A survey was distributed to dialysis facilities to determine immunization practices. Facilities were provided with an immunization toolbox and spreadsheets to document the immunization status of patients. A total of 102 facilities (53%) provided data for three collection periods (1999, 2000, and 2001). Immunization rates for each influenza season increased significantly from 62.1% and 61.4% in 1998-1999 to 80.3% and 80.0% in 2000-2001 (Pennsylvania and Delaware respectively).","903":"This article reviews how to create a quality improvement (QI) reporting system for a multiple subspecialty pediatric clinic that is part of an acute pediatric facility in a major metropolitan area.

We describe the structure of a comprehensive EBM program in a multihospital community teaching system. This EBM model is distinct and separate from the peer review process and has achieved substantial physician involvement. The program emanates from the Board of Directors Quality of Care Committee and has strong administrative support. The approach relies extensively on physician involvement and expert physician panels to enhance existing EBM practice guidelines, with an explicit strategy of performance reports and feedback.","912":"Healthcare quality improvement (QI) studies are systematic analyses of processes and outcomes. As such, they meet one of the federal regulatory criteria defining research. They also meet the second criterion in many instances, generalizability of findings, even if it was not the study's original intent. Therefore, to err on the side of patients' rights, any studies involving human subjects or human data must be approved by federally mandated institutional review boards (IRBs) or their designees. This article explores federal regulations to protect research subjects, levels of IRB review, and strategies to simplify the IRB approval process and discusses implications for QI studies.","913":"","914":"As currently practiced, the standard of care strictly limiting the number of medical conditions that warrant withholding vaccination may be incompatible with the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) recommendation for patient-centered care. Furthermore, the \"parsimonious\" approach to accepting contraindications to vaccination is inconsistent with the IOM's recommendation to consider alternative vaccination schedules and policies aimed at redistributing the benefits and burdens of immunization. This critical perspective is examined within the framework of five rules proposed by the IOM. There is an opportunity to improve the quality of childhood immunization by adopting a patient-centered approach, identifying individuals at risk for acute and\/or delayed adverse vaccine effects, and developing alternative immunization schedules for these high-risk children.","915":"This article describes efforts to design and automate a balanced performance indicator report to meet the needs of hospital and physician leaders. Indicator measurement reports provide clinical information but often do not provide other administrative data. An automation team developed business rules, standardized definitions, and developed a Web-based electronic application to report quarterly indicators. The efficiency and effectiveness of the automation project were measured and included report production time, data sources, indicators included, and statistical significance of indicator rates. Significant improvement in efficiency of report preparation and a decrease in resources used were demonstrated through this automation project, although variation existed among clinical services. Generic performance measures reports encompassing clinical and administrative data can improve the consistency and quality of reporting to the medical staff. The process provided insight for expanding the prototype.","916":"Behavioral health as a discipline has grappled with regulatory compliance issues on its own, tending to be isolated from other specialties and to benefit little from the mistakes and solutions of the rest of medicine. The most common problems with behavioral health regulatory compliance have to do with documentation, billing and coding, treatment plans, and medical necessity. Regulatory compliance is inextricably linked to quality of care. Providers can assess their compliance efforts by asking themselves a series of questions and, most important, by assessing the quality of the care they provide. Sound research and outcomes-based practice are the best ways to improve outcomes in behavioral health treatment and will be the most effective methods for aligning practice with regulations.","917":"Allergy immunotherapy commonly is administered in primary care practices by nurses and medical assistants, who often have little education or experience in this procedure. An assessment of an organization's 18 primary care offices revealed a number of deficiencies in clinical practices and documentation. The goals of an improvement initiative were to ensure that allergy immunotherapy practices complied with published guidelines and to improve staff's patient assessments, dosage calculations, and documentation skills. A policy was developed to guide practice, practice standards were implemented, staff education was provided, documentation methods and standards were established, and ongoing monitoring was set in place. After 2 years, allergy immunotherapy practices are standardized throughout the organization and improvements have been noted.","918":"This article describes BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee's (BCBST) success in blending evidence with experience. This process has provided a winning solution for members, providers, and the health plan. Provider input has proved to be an invaluable tool in assessing both new and established technologies. BCBST uses a variety of methods, from formal panels to a modified Delphi approach, to obtain provider input into the creation of clinical decision tools. Provider experience fills the gap in the assessment of technologies that are widely used but do not have sufficient evidence to support them. This approach has significant implications for health plan delivery. It also meets the Institute of Medicine's concern that every healthcare organization, purchaser, regulator and educational institution encourage the delivery of services based upon the best available scientific knowledge.","919":"","920":"Creating this type of a program is a challenge and takes the time and commitment of key players. Most healthcare facilities have had systems and processes in place for years to \"ensure quality.\" Inherent in those systems has been some ability to detect errors and to identify opportunities for improving quality of care. The next evolution of ensuring quality requires healthcare organizations to become far more proactive with error detection and correction systems. How? Becoming more openly and honestly communicative internally is an important first step. That means creating a nonpunitive environment that encourages staff members to report known or suspected problems. To do this most successfully requires not only involving members of the hospital staff who become aware of concerns, but also engaging patients and families as partners in the process. Healthcare organizations can learn much from patients and families about things that actually or almost go wrong. In turn, healthcare organizations owe patients and their families honesty when they know something has gone wrong that could or should have been prevented. Many healthcare organizations throughout the country are struggling with these new expectations from accreditors and consumers about disclosing medical errors to patients (and\/or their families). Some may still even be questioning the need and\/or the value of doing so. The Lexington VA Medical Center has been disclosing errors for approximately 10 years. The center has also been piloting proactive approaches to identifying and eliminating threats to patient safety (i.e., error-prone systems and processes). VAMC's experiences have demonstrated that both are clearly worth the effort.","921":"The Kaiser Permanente North East Bay service area redesigned its quality program beginning in 1995, to better mirror how care was provided across the continuum. The old model had evolved over time, was based on departmental structure, and did not focus on all patient populations.

A 25-question survey developed for this study using Likert scale responses was completed by 181 (of 404 eligible addressees, a 45% response rate) members of the Cleveland Clinic staff in the divisions of medicine, surgery, and pediatrics. Ratings of the overall value of inpatient consultation reflected moderate satisfaction (mean 6.9 of possible 10). Types of consults that were most valued were those requesting a procedure and those seeking assistance in establishing a diagnosis and in interpreting data. Features deemed most important in making a consult excellent were legibility of the consultant's note, timeliness of the response (i.e., within 24 hours), and direct communication of the consult question. The data showed a trend indicating that physicians regarded the value of direct physician-to-physician communication more highly than they personally practiced such direct communication when requesting a consult. Study findings indicate the opportunity to improve the process of inpatient consultation by implementing measures that enhance direct physician-to-physician communication about the consult, ensure timeliness, facilitate identification of the appropriate consultants, and allow easier auditing. We propose a novel process for requesting inpatient consultations that extends currently available hospital information systems but offers a process improvement that warrants development.","923":"Thomas A.

This pilot study was conducted to assess the visibility of pain management through documentation; the effect of implementing new tools (forms) was measured to determine whether they improve documentation of pain management assessment and intensity. A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine presence of this documentation. This study found that it is possible to improve the quality of information related to pain assessment through the development of explicit documentation tools.","925":"Integrating patients' spiritual values into healthcare is important to quality of care according to patients and to accrediting agencies. Little is known, however, about how or whether physical therapists, as members of the healthcare team, are knowledgeable about these values or incorporate them into practice. Therefore, we explored the perspectives of 34 physical therapy (PT) students via an online discussion. Most suggested that spiritual and religious considerations should be part of PT practice, noting their potential effect upon motivation, functional status, and outcomes. Further dialog about and assessment of PT education and practice related to spiritual issues seem warranted.","926":"This study was part of a large departmental performance improvement initiative to implement and evaluate developmental and family-centered care as \"best practice\" in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The goal was to evaluate the safety, effect on infant clinical and developmental outcomes, and maternal satisfaction of co-bedding of multiple-gestation infants compared to traditionally bedded infants\/mothers. A secondary purpose was to evaluate co-bedding and American Academy of Pediatrics-recommended \"back to sleep\" behaviors in the same infants\/mothers after discharge. A retrospective, comparative, descriptive design was used. Chart reviews and mailed written surveys were used to collect study data. Findings showed no significant differences in demographic variables or clinical and developmental outcomes between the total traditionally bedded and co-bedded groups. All mothers reported positive experiences with the NICU. Co-bedding may promote maternal bonding and has no negative clinical or developmental outcomes. Once policies and education are in place, parents should be offered the option to co-bed multiple-gestation infants in the NICU. There is a performance improvement opportunity regarding the education provided to parents of multiple-gestation infants before discharge on the \"back to sleep\" recommendations.","927":"","928":"This article provides healthcare administrators and managers with a framework and model for developing a balanced scorecard and demonstrates the remarkable success of this process, which brings focus to leadership decisions about the allocation of resources. This scorecard was developed as a top management tool designed to structure multiple priorities of a large, complex, integrated healthcare system and to establish benchmarks to measure success in achieving targets for performance in identified areas. Significant benefits and positive results were derived from the implementation of the balanced scorecard, based upon benchmarks considered to be critical success factors. The network's chief executive officer and top leadership team set and articulated the network's primary operating principles: quality and efficiency in the provision of comprehensive healthcare and support services. Under the weighted benchmarks of the balanced scorecard, the facilities in the network were mandated to adhere to one non-negotiable tenet: providing care that is second to none. The balanced scorecard approach to leadership continuously ensures that this is the primary goal and focal point for all activity within the network. To that end, systems are always in place to ensure that the network is fully successful on all performance measures relating to quality.","929":"The purpose of this study was to develop and test two interventions designed to improve provider compliance with diabetes management guidelines: the use of a diabetes management flowsheet inserted into patient charts and the use of a diabetes management flowsheet plus quarterly provider feedback about compliance levels. Diabetic patient charts from six family practice clinics were randomly selected and audited at baseline and at 12 months. The analysis indicated that the use of the flowsheet was associated with improved provider compliance in the completion of foot examinations only. Providers involved in the study believed that the process of the flowsheet plus feedback contributed to their greater awareness of diabetes management guidelines.","930":"Sr. Mary Jean Ryan, Franciscan Sister of Mary, is president\/chief executive officer of SSM Health Care (SSMHC), one of the largest Catholic healthcare systems in the United States, with 23,000 employees and 5,000 affiliated physicians serving in 21 hospitals and 3 nursing homes.

This study looked at 336 THA patients' satisfaction with 16 specific services before and during hospitalization. Provider characteristics considered reflected attributes of reliability, responsiveness, communication, and interpersonal care. Among patient characteristics considered, the most marked finding was that older individuals and those who did not live alone tended to be more satisfied. This study demonstrated that THA, in addition to being an effective treatment for hip arthritis, also is a desirable option from the perspective of patient satisfaction with the process of care.","942":"One indicator of quality home healthcare is the prevention of rehospitalization. This study explored factors that place patients at risk for repeat hospitalizations after home healthcare admission. One year of outcomes assessment information data from a large home health agency was used to identify 7,393 patients who had at least one episode of rehospitalization. Results revealed that after the data had been adjusted for age and gender, a number of demographic, clinical, and functional factors predicted repeat hospitalizations. Home health agencies that focus on these risk factors may improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their efforts to prevent rehospitalization.","943":"","944":"","945":"","946":"As Winston Churchill once said, \"Personally, I am always ready to learn, although I don't always like being taught.\" In behavioral health, consumers can make important contributions to the design and evaluation of programs and services. As demonstrated by this case study, progress can be made in incremental steps, over several years. Another reason for BABH's success was progression from very concrete projects to an ongoing organizational structure that consumers could identify as providing a role in policy and procedure development, program evaluation, strategic planning, and programmatic changes. Performance improvement professionals, through their contributions to the organizational design of committees and communication structures, are in ideal positions to promote the full participation of consumers across all healthcare settings. Just imagine what could be achieved in understanding how to design systems if current issues and recent research results were routinely explored--such as those by Harrington et al. regarding Medicare beneficiary complaints (2001) and Gines et al. (2001) on chronic care and satisfaction with managed care--with a consistent group of consumers. Consider adding consumer participation as a new exciting goal in the next edition of your performance improvement and strategic plans!","947":"This study was conducted to determine whether enrollment in a Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA) Access Point (AP) community-based clinic would reduce hospital admissions and unplanned urgent care visits while maintaining patient satisfaction with medical care. Through use of a survey and a review of medical records, data were gathered on the following three patient groups: veterans receiving care at a VHA hospital-based clinic, veterans receiving care at an AP, and veterans receiving care from non-VHA sources. Results showed that the number of unplanned hospital admissions and urgent care visits decreased in the two groups receiving care at VHA facilities.","948":"Identification of alternatives to manual chart review might improve efficiency in quality improvement work. This study at a large community teaching hospital in central New Jersey considered whether selected charges from a patient-level costs database could identify compliance with Sixth Scope of Work indicators in congestive heart failure (CHF). Charges resulting from specific tests, from test outcomes, and from prescribed treatments were identified from among 75 randomly chosen patients with CHF. In the sample 65% (as determined by database analysis) and 69% (as determined by chart review) complied with the principal peer review organization criterion. This difference was less than that found between review and re-review of study charts.","949":"When patients are evaluated for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the possibility of HIV type 2 (HIV-2) infection should be considered in individuals who may have acquired infection in West Africa or from an individual from that area. A 45.6% error rate in HIV-2 test ordering was observed among patients at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, this was attributed in large part to the order entry screen, which may have confused ward clerks who were entering HIV testing ordered by clinicians. Modification of the order entry screen and consultation with clinical laboratory personnel for diagnostic HIV-2 testing were effective in reducing the rate of errors tenfold, to 4.3%.","950":"","951":"This article reviews a disease management program that was developed to improve the treatment of depression in members of a managed care organization (MCO). The program's focus is on medication monitoring to improve members' compliance with their antidepressant medication regimen. Within the first year of the program's implementation, medication compliance rates improved by more than 10%. This was accomplished through a collaborative team effort among the MCO, the MCO's behavioral health vendor, the MCO's pharmacy benefit management provider, and a physician advisory committee. The program's positive outcomes demonstrate that patient monitoring works when there is collaboration among healthcare providers and physician support is achieved.","952":"This article reports on the use of a multidisciplinary action plan (MAP) in a tertiary care craniofacial center to evaluate one set of outcomes after primary cleft palate repair (PCPR). Two series of patients undergoing PCPR were studied. The first series of 30 patients was managed by using a set of preprinted order sets developed by plastic surgeons and clinical nurse specialists. The patients were evaluated 90 days after surgery to determine whether they had received the planned postoperative care. Most patients received care from plastic surgeons, and fewer obtained care from otolaryngologists. The second group of patients was managed by using a revised set of preprinted order sets and an MAP developed by both surgical specialty groups. In the second group, the proper postoperative follow-up care was provided by both surgical subspecialists with the revised interdisciplinary order sets and new MAP-directed care.","953":"","954":"","955":"The Institute of Medicine reported unacceptably high rates of medical error but did not identify whether this is a growing or a stabilized problem.

Although there have been many studies on patient satisfaction in Turkey and other countries, few studies have been done in military hospitals. A patient satisfaction questionnaire using a 4-point Likert scale was mailed to 500 patients after discharge, and 316 questionnaires were returned. The findings indicated that satisfaction with physician, nursing, physical plant, and food services were the main determinants of overall satisfaction with the hospital. The type of clinic in which the patients stayed also was an important determinant. The effect of patients' demographic characteristics on overall satisfaction with the hospital was also examined, and only lower education level was a statistically significant determinant.","970":"Optimizing nutritional delivery in the intensive care unit (ICU) continues to be a challenge. Nutritional guidelines were developed at a metropolitan Level I trauma center as an institutional response to ensure the timeliness of patient evaluation, initiation of therapy, and attainment of goal therapy.

We hypothesized that a unit-focused effort to remind cardiologists to order platelet counts after percutaneous coronary interventions GP IIb\/IIIa would improve compliance. Findings indicated that a greater number of patients had platelet counts drawn after a reminder effort had been implemented. For both the first and second draws, the CCU had a higher pre-reminder rate than the CRU. Post-reminder, the CCU had no significant changes, whereas the CRU showed significant increases in both the first and second draws. For post GP IIb\/IIIa platelet measurement, aggregate analysis (CRU and CCU) showed that, of those patients who had platelet counts drawn pre-reminder, only 18.2% met the first guideline and only 17.1% met the second. Post-reminder results showed no significant changes for the first or second draws. We concluded that the practical application of a standard operating procedure can have a secondary beneficial effect despite not meeting the stringent parameters set in prescribing guidelines.","975":"The adoption of new care processes can take years despite high-quality research findings that support the change in clinical practice.

To evaluate the use and effect of respiratory care protocols in community hospitals in the Cleveland Clinic Health System (CCHS) in Cleveland, OH, an observational study was conducted based on a survey of respiratory therapists from 9 of the 10 CCHS hospitals. Study results showed that respiratory care protocols had been implemented in most of the CCHS hospitals in a variety of formats and that use of a full respiratory therapy consult service was common. Over-ordering of respiratory care services was reported far more frequently than was under-ordering and was often the impetus to adopt respiratory care protocols. Larger hospitals were more likely to implement protocols, but protocol use was not associated with having a residency training program. Furthermore, in the three hospitals in which the issue was examined, use of respiratory care protocols did not appear to discourage pulmonary consultation. As was the case in academic medical centers, which have generated most studies to date, the use of respiratory care protocols was reported to be beneficial in community-based hospitals.","990":"The objective of this study was to compare the level of satisfaction among members with and without chronic health conditions (asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and elevated plasma lipoprotein) in a large California managed care organization.

Logistic regression models were used to analyze the complaints in terms of sociodemographic factors, enabling factors (income and health maintenance organization [HMO] membership), diagnoses, and primary service providers. The complaint rate was found to be very low, and only 13% of complaints were confirmed by the PRO. HMO members and members receiving physician care and outpatient\/emergency room care were more likely to complain about denials of or delays in services or the failure to be referred to specialists than were members in fee-for-service plans and those receiving other types of provider care. Complaints about poor nursing care were associated with receiving skilled nursing\/rehabilitation care. Complaints about care that resulted in injury were associated with the denial of care, failure to be referred to a specialist, poor medical care, and poor communications. Complaints about care that led to disability were associated with medical errors, whereas those that led to death were associated with misdiagnosis and premature hospital discharge. It would be valuable for PROs to focus their complaint review efforts on common types of complaints in different settings. A review of PRO procedures should be undertaken to understand why so few complaints are submitted and confirmed.","1010":"Significant data exist to suggest that women with coronary artery disease (CAD) have worse outcomes than men. One explanation is that women present with more advanced disease because of a lack of screening and early detection. To examine this, we performed a claims-based analysis of exercise treadmill testing (ETT) within an urban managed care population. We analyzed all claims for 57,793 covered lives. Utilization rates for ETT were calculated for men and women by age group. ETT utilization between men and women demonstrated significant differences: 49.2 tests\/1,000 men versus 25.0 tests\/1,000 women (p &lt; 0.001). This 2:1 ratio was observed across multiple age strata. Significant differences in ETT utilization exist between men and women, even in older populations in which the incidence of CAD in women exceeds that in men. ETT often is the initial screening test for detecting CAD; these gender differences in ETT utilization may result in underdetection of CAD in women and treatment at later stages of disease when interventions are less effective.","1011":"The Drug and Alcohol Problem Assessment for Primary Care (DAPA-PC), developed under a contract from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, is a comprehensive screening system developed for quickly identifying and addressing substance abuse and related problems in a primary care setting.

This framework is designed for studying intervention programs that change during the evaluation. The development of family drug courts is provided as an example. CIE relies on outcome data collected over time and benchmarked across similar cases in comparison sites; thus, this study was designed to collect data on effectiveness of intervention programs at multiple sites and over time. A weight is calculated for similarity of any two cases based on features they share. In statistical process control charts, these weights are used to compare outcomes at the site against the average of similar cases in comparison groups. Once data are benchmarked, program staff meet to discuss process changes that have led to improvements in outcomes. To ensure that intervention programs have access to evaluation reports on demand, information technology is used to collect, clean, and pool data. Computers generate study reports, and evaluators review reports after release to clients. Statistical tools can be used to evaluate changing programs. Traditional evaluators may be concerned about some threats to validity associated with CIE. The article concludes with a discussion of typical threats to validity and how these threats are addressed in the CIE framework.","1013":"Since 1990, Margaret E.

An understanding of the differences between these design techniques can help healthcare quality professionals make the most efficient use of their time, energies, and resources. To evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these various study designs, it is necessary to assess factors that threaten the degree with which quality professionals may infer a cause-and-effect relationship from the data collected. Processes, the conduits of organizational function, often can be assessed by methods that do not take into account confounding and compromising circumstances that affect the outcomes of their analyses. An assumption that the implementation of process improvements may cause real change is incomplete without a consideration of other factors that might also have caused the same result. It is only through the identification, assessment, and exclusion of these alternative factors that administrators and healthcare quality professionals can assess the degree to which true process improvement or compliance has occurred. This article describes the advantages and disadvantages of common quantitative design techniques and reviews the corresponding threats to the interpretability of data obtained from their use.","1015":"This article describes a pediatric primary care network's initiative to implement an office-based quality improvement (QI) program. First, network physicians determined their priorities for quality improvement.

This model is helpful in the ongoing development and testing of new measurement systems.","1017":"The purpose of the study was to describe the effect of physician reminders on the measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and treatment to achieve an LDL-C goal of &lt; or = 100 mg\/dL in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. After reminders were initiated, the number of CHD patients without a documented LDL-C was reduced from 30% to 18%, between January 1997 and July 1998, and the percentage of CHD patients achieving the LDL-C goal improved from 10% to 27%. Thus, reminders can be an effective tool in improving cholesterol management of CHD patients. In contrast, a cholesterol-lowering clinic made available to some physicians, in addition to the reminders, was rarely used.","1018":"The Universal Billing Code of 1992 (UB-92) is a standard database used by hospitals to generate itemized charges for patient visits. This study examined the use of UB-92 information to monitor emergency department performance improvement projects. UB-92 data were used to determine whether urine tests had been ordered for emergency department patients. A population of patients at low risk for requiring a urine culture was defined as discharged female patients between 16 and 60 years of age undergoing a urinalysis as part of their emergency department treatment during a 10-month period. Based on UB-92 data, only a total of 2,138 patients were identified who met the study's low-risk criteria. Recommendations for the optimum use of these tests were presented to the emergency physicians as part of departmental performance improvement activities. Additional logistical problems associated with the procedure for ordering this test were identified and corrected as part of this project. After an additional 5-month period, a second analysis of the entire 15 months of UB-92 data was performed. Prior to physician notification, 41.6% of low-risk patients underwent both a urinalysis and a urine culture and sensitivity in the emergency department. In the 5-month follow-up period, the percentage of patients undergoing both tests decreased 18% to only 23%.","1019":"A self-administered satisfaction survey instrument for the assisted-living industry was developed and validated. The survey contains 45 Likert-type items that measure residents' and family members' satisfaction with the most central aspects of housing and care. The scale covers six key service dimensions: activities, personnel, dining, apartment, facility, and management. Internal consistency tests indicate high reliability. Multiple tests of validity confirm the scale's effectiveness in measuring residents' and family members' satisfaction with the six dimensions. Overall, residents are less satisfied with assisted-living programs than their family members are, but they may feel inhibited about expressing criticism in the presence of family. A priority index highlights service areas in which performance improvement efforts should be made to obtain the greatest increases in satisfaction while making the most efficient use of limited resources. Managerial implications of the tool are discussed.","1020":"Independent Health, a large health maintenance organization in western New York, is participating in a national initiative to redesign the way healthcare is delivered in the clinical office setting. The Idealized Design of Clinical Office Practices (IDCOP) project aims to initiate profound change in the ways physicians deliver care and treatment in the office; the focus is on demonstrating improvements in access to care, patient care, patient and staff satisfaction, and financial performance. Two clinical prototype test sites have successfully implemented an \"open access policy,\" which enables most patients to see their physician on the day an appointment is requested. The two test sites also found improved clinical indicators (for diabetes and coronary heart disease) that positively affected the health of patients; reduced waiting time, enriching the overall experience of the office visit; and improved patient and staff satisfaction with the operational and care delivery modifications. This article describes the findings of the IDCOP initiative at Independent Health.","1021":"Despite extensive research on defining and measuring quality of care, less attention has been given to consumers' views. The purpose of the study reported here was to identify indicators of quality of healthcare and nursing care important to clinic patients. The most important indicators of healthcare quality were getting better, getting care and services when needed, and having diagnoses and treatment options explained. The most important indicators of nursing care quality were communicating with the nurse, being treated with respect, being cared for by nurses who were up-to-date, teaching by the nurse, and not being rushed through the visit.","1022":"The tacit values of quality include tapping the creative potential of people, valuing their ideas equally, and viewing work as process--a series of steps that combine people, resources, and activities to produce a certain outcome. Mediation is a process that brings to the surface the creative thinking of people when differences, or conflict, exist among them. Mediation has the advantage--over arbitration, counseling, or negotiation--of seeking win-win outcomes that try to optimize the interests of all parties. This article seeks to provide healthcare leaders with a set of skills and concepts that will enable them to work through differences and achieve common ground. The mediation process, the characteristics of the ideal mediator, and the proper environment in which to conduct the dialogue are described. Lessons learned on how to creatively manage differing mindsets are enumerated.","1023":"The Hanford Nuclear Reservation is one of the U.S. Department of Energy's largest nuclear weapons sites. The enormous changes experienced by Hanford over the last several years, as its mission has shifted from weapons production to cleanup, has profoundly affected its occupational health and safety services. Innovative programs and new initiatives hold promise for a safer workplace for the thousands of workers at Hanford and other DOE sites. However, occupational health and safety professionals continue to face multiple organizational, economic, and cultural challenges. A major problem identified during this review was the lack of coordination of onsite services. Because each health and safety program operates independently (albeit with the guidance of the Richland field operations office), many services are duplicative and the health and safety system is fragmented. The fragmentation is compounded by the lack of centralized data repositories for demographic and exposure data. Innovative measures such as a questionnaire-driven Employee Job Task Analysis linked to medical examinations has allowed the site to move from the inefficient and potentially dangerous administrative medical monitoring assignment to defensible risk-based assignments and could serve as a framework for improving centralized data management and service delivery.","1024":"This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of needle-stick injuries among healthcare workers in hospitals in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia from 1995 to 1997, and to gather information about the measures these hospitals are taking to protect their employees against these injuries. Precautionary measures taken to protect healthcare workers from injury and the follow-up after injuries were surveyed. The total overall prevalence rate of needle-stick injuries was significantly lower among healthcare workers in governmental hospitals than among those in private hospitals. The extremely low prevalence rate of needle-stick injuries indicated that there were serious defects in the reporting systems of the hospitals studied. All hospitals should have a mandatory, clear, and unified policy to help reduce the number of needle-stick injuries. Hospitals must adopt a policy to ensure that precautions are taken to reduce healthcare workers' accidental exposures to potentially infected blood.","1025":"In the continuing redesign of healthcare, the Internet is one of the tools being used. It is used to provide education, conduct Internet support groups, collect research data, send e-mail, facilitate pharmaceutical sales and online medical visits, and develop integrated healthcare networks. This article examines each of the above-mentioned ways in which the Internet is being used to facilitate the provision of healthcare.","1026":"This study examines the correspondence between medical records and Medicaid claims to determine whether claims are a valid source of data for monitoring quality of asthma care. A total of 460 claims for care encounters were matched to medical records of the encounters. While most of the diagnoses and procedures recorded on the claims were documented in medical records, claims failed to identify 29% of encounters with asthma diagnoses and 45% of nebulization procedures administered during encounters. About 30% of documented asthma prescriptions were not associated with filed claims, and about 30% of filed claims for asthma medication were not documented in medical records.","1027":"Incident review (IR) is a process for achieving a better understanding of problems related to the health and safety of clients and the integrity of healthcare facilities. The IR process ensures that the quality and the performance of care in a facility continue to be maintained and improved over time. Because of the practical realities of administrative and clinical care issues, the process of implementing IR and related interventions is often challenging. This paper examines the IR process and the barriers that affect and impede it.","1028":"Consumers are becoming more knowledgeable about their medical ailments and conditions, and they want to make informed decisions about their healthcare. This development can be attributed to the increased use of the Internet. How can practitioners work with this newly found consumer empowerment and knowledge? By accepting that consumers are becoming more knowledgeable and that they want to be involved in the decision-making process. In addition, practitioners require an attitudinal shift. Whereas they previously were in total control of healthcare decisions, now they must share control and decision-making responsibility with consumers. If practitioners work together with consumers, this new relationship may become a win-win situation.","1029":"This article describes how a mission hospital in East Africa expanded its quality improvement (QI) process by promoting partnership with the community in order to better meet the community's needs. The partnership evolved from the hospital's existing COPE (client-oriented, provider-efficient) self-assessment approach. In addition to seeking the views of clients, the hospital embarked on a process to engage community members in a dialogue, implement improvements suggested by the community, and gradually ensure community representation on its QI committee. The importance of considering the cultural diversity of the community was reinforced by the outcome of the COPE initiative.","1030":"","1031":"Programs targeted toward chronic conditions provide a stimulus for development of program performance indicators. This paper illustrates how existing information can be organized at community and health plan levels to produce these indicators. Data compiled by claims and encounter systems are emphasized. Survey data can be incorporated in the indicator system on a targeted basis, particularly for information on community services and linkages to healthcare and also for caregiver perspectives.","1032":"Transformational change, or reengineering, is a tough assignment for any organization. The pay-off, however, can be huge: happier patients, reenergized staff, and increased productivity. This article describes the team-based Apollo 11 project at Southeast Health Center in Indianapolis. Although this redesign effort took 7 months of extraordinary team effort, it resulted in a 54% reduction in patient encounter time, a decrease of more than 40% in per-visit cost, and improved patient and staff satisfaction. This article summarizes the background and dynamics of Apollo 11, shares some initial project results, and summarizes the lessons learned, so that other healthcare organizations can successfully tackle the reengineering challenge.","1033":"","1034":"Kenneth W.

A CQI program was implemented based on voluntary, handwritten, anonymous reports of intraoperative and postanesthesia care unit events. This CQI program detected a high incidence of intraoperative hypertension, indicated major causal factors, suggested a set of corrective measures, and allowed for measurement of their efficacy.","1037":"Survival analysis is used in a wide variety of research settings to maximize the information extracted from a group of timed observations. Measures employed in continuous quality improvement (CQI) efforts often involve such observations. Yet to date, survival analysis has not been widely used to guide CQI efforts. This article presents the features of survival analysis that are most applicable to CQI efforts and illustrates the application of these techniques to a quality improvement project focused on diabetic kidney disease. Results are compared with those from a \"standard\" analysis. The interpretation of results is discussed in the context of constraints typical of CQI efforts. The article concludes with a recommendation for broader application of this valuable analytic methodology.","1038":null,"1039":"The managed care community and employers have expressed interest in substance abuse prevention, but there has been little consensus about which prevention and health promotion activities are most appropriately provided in the workplace.

It reviews the findings and recommendations in the Institute of Medicine report on medical errors, which issued a call to action. Moving beyond the call to action requires aligning incentives, in both public and private sectors, consistent with complexity theory and the tenets of a systems approach to the reliable delivery of service in dynamic environments in which failure produces severe consequences. Because safety is a fundamental value of healthcare and has money-saving potential, it can be a powerful pathway forcultural change. Thisarticle explains a simple framework that requires alignment among stakeholder groups and communities. It recommends a practical problem-solving approach and explores the roles and responsibilities of each segment within the framework. Finally, it describes a VHA Inc. leadership initiative, based on the framework, to promote change within healthcare systems.","1046":"Healthcare errors represent the seventh leading cause of death in this country and are largely the result of systems errors as opposed to individual incompetence. In order to correct systems errors, it is essential that known adverse events b e reported so that the underlying causes can be determined and corrective action taken. However, despite their importance, the majority of known errors are not reported. This article describes the barriers to reporting errors and offers several recommendations to increase reporting of adverse events and, thus, improve the quality of healthcare.","1047":"The Colorado Mental Health Institute at Pueblo (CMHIP) established a performance improvement initiative to reduce the frequency and length of episodes of seclusion, restraint, or both (S&amp;R). The initiative, the S&amp;R Challenge, is a systematic approach to identifying the root causes of the S&amp;R problem and developing solutions to identified causes.

Team members believed they knew the path--they knew their expected results, their goals, and their decision-making authority. Yet, the team was miserable in its work. In order to find out what was wrong, the team contacted the team expert in the organization whose job was to build teams. The team expert determined that the process components of personal interaction criteria were being overlooked and, instead, content work was being pursued. As a result of these findings, the team rebuilt itself by defining its purpose in terms of goals and objectives, determining a set of team values and behaviors, and setting ground rules for meeting management.","1054":"Variations in quality of healthcare have existed for many years, yet interest in measuring, understanding, and eliminating these variations has waxed and waned. The advent of managed care and its perceived focus on reducing costs has stimulated interest in variations in quality of care. In response to the need to better understand and measure quality, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) funded the development of a tool capable of categorizing clinical performance measures, a subset of quality measures, for comparing and evaluating them relative to a user's specific needs for measuring and improving quality. This research lead to the development of the COmputerized Needs-oriented QUality measurement Evaluation SysTem (CONQUEST)--a free software quality improvement tool that includes about 1,200 clinical performance measures. CONQUEST enables users to quickly identify measures of interest, compare them on the basis of factors of importance, and select measures that will help them measure and improve care.","1055":"Asthma is a common illness in children and adults that is often associated with suboptimal outcomes, despite the existence and distribution of carefully considered national and international guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The need to improve asthma care in North Texas motivated a coalition of health plans, employers, hospitals, academic medical centers, providers, and benefit consultants to collaborate in developing and implementing Minimum Standards of Care for Asthma. To gain consensus, the North Central Texas HEDIS Coalition used a panel of regional asthma experts and surveyed a large number of primary-care providers to construct a one-page document that was ultimately approved by regional stakeholders in healthcare participating in this coalition and also by specialty organizations in Texas. Adopting a minimum standard guideline, developed and supported by multiple stakeholders, may represent a more realistic intermediate goal when implementing \"best practice\" guidelines is limited by practical barriers.","1056":"","1057":"Shared Governance evolved as a way for hospital nurses to have a role in decision making that affected nursing practice.

This study was limited to patients who underwent a surgical procedure that did not involve the bowel. Patients who developed an ileus after the surgical procedure (study group) were compared with patients who did not develop an ileus after the same procedure (control group). Principal factors associated with a postoperative ileus included a low serum albumin level, excessive use of narcotics, and a history of a previous gastrointestinal condition. Practice changes were made as a result of these findings. A follow-up chart review revealed a decrease in the postoperative ileus rate.","1062":"","1063":"Systems and technology that support the collection and dissemination of healthcare information improve service levels, enhance quality, and improve continuity of care. The delivery of patient care is changing rapidly because sophisticated clinical information systems are providing fast, organized access to large amounts of patient information (Ornstein et al., 1997). The Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix developed and implemented a computerized process for interdisciplinary assessment and treatment of patients. This was accomplished within the framework of a recent reorganization into service lines and the initiation of a computerized medical record system. Traditional frameworks for change management often include a methodical picture of the required steps or phases of the change process. The rapid rate of change, both technologically and in the healthcare system, however, defies the application of some aspects of traditional change theory. A model for change that considers realistic change strategies, including good planning and identification of barriers, was used to facilitate the move to computerized interdisciplinary assessment (Daly, Button, Prophet, Clarke, &amp; Androwich, 1997).","1064":"The lack of compliance with universal precautions (UP) is well documented across a wide variety of healthcare professions and has been reported both before and after the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. Gershon, Karkashian, and Felknor (1994) found that several factors correlated significantly with healthcare workers' lack of compliance with UP, including a measure of organizational safety climate (e.g., the employees' perception of their organizational culture and practices regarding safety). We conducted a secondary analysis using data from a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 1,746 healthcare workers at risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens to assess the validity and reliability of Gershon's measure of safety climate. Findings revealed no relationship between safety climate and employees' gender, age, education, tenure in position, profession, hours worked per day, perceived risk, attitude toward risk, and training. An association was demonstrated between safety climate and (1) healthcare worker compliance with UP and (2) the availability of personal protective equipment, providing support for the construct validity of this measure of safety climate. These findings could be used by occupational health professionals to assess employees' perceptions of the safety culture and practices in the workplace and to guide the institution's risk management efforts in association with U.P.","1065":"Root cause analysis is a technique used in determining the real cause of an event. The Sentinel Event Policy of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires a root cause analysis of a sentinel event but not a \"near miss.\" However, root cause analysis is an important process for preventing another near miss from the same or similar cause. This article reviews the background of basic root cause analysis and provides an example of the process. Changes in policy and procedures for patient-controlled analgesia therapy, as a result of the root cause analysis, are described.","1066":"","1067":"","1068":"","1069":"Aurora Healthcare, an integrated healthcare delivery system, wanted to use interhospital collaboration to improve quality. An opportunity for improvement at five Aurora hospitals was identified: Only 71% of patients received timely preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis. A Users Group approach was proposed to foster collaboration among the hospitals in a quality improvement (QI) effort. Although these hospitals differed in size, volume of cases, medical staffs, and antibiotic-delivery processes, they had common objectives and, many times, common barriers to the timely delivery of antibiotics. A Users Group approach to this QI initiative resulted in an 18% improvement in the number of patients who received timely administration of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis (p &lt; 0.001). This article describes the Users Group approach to QI at Aurora Healthcare in southeastern Wisconsin.","1070":"The management of urinary tract infections at primary health clinics in Saudi Arabia varied widely and did not generally conform to modern recommendations. A clinical practice guideline was developed to standardize and modernize the approach in order to improve the quality of care and reduce costs. An algorithm was developed for the management of acute urinary tract infections in non-pregnant adult females. Guideline recommendations were generally well received, and acceptance was greater where users were involved in the initial stages of guideline development. The cost of managing urinary tract infections was reduced providing that reliance on dipstick analysis did not increase costs through increased misdiagnosis.","1071":"A Town Meeting about the Performance Measurement Coordinating Council (PMCC) was held at the NAHQ Annual Educational Conference in September in Atlanta.

As one effort to evaluate and improve asthma care in the Dallas\/Fort Worth area, the North Central Texas HEDIS Coalition surveyed 36 independent school districts (ISDs). Twenty-nine ISDs, representing 679,631 children, responded to questions on school health personnel, identification and monitoring of students with asthma, staff training in asthma care, policies for students carrying asthma medications, and campus smoking policies. Key findings were more positive than expected and included the following: (a) training in asthma management is fairly extensive, (b) students in 26 ISDs are allowed, upon physician request, to carry medihalers, and (c) smoking on school property is illegal in Texas. However, the absence of a fully developed strategy for implementing the survey findings may have hindered the continuous quality improvement efforts among schools, health plans, providers, and the community that could have evolved from this project.","1074":"","1075":"Rapidly rising healthcare costs, questions about effective medical intervention, and the need for efficient delivery of healthcare services have compelled organizations to focus on outcomes research, measurement, and management. Proponents of outcomes measurement predict that it will produce significant benefits, including improved physician and patient information, increased understanding of the effectiveness of different treatment interventions, and established guidelines for medical management. Multiple professional organizations, academic centers, and independent research laboratories, as well as government agencies, are now involved in the research and development of outcomes measurement tools. This article provides some insight into the outcomes phenomenon.","1076":"This study examined the relationships of patients' self-report of their physical and mental health to their satisfaction with care received during recent hospitalization. These associations were examined within and across 11 service groups in a mid-Atlantic academic medical center. The sample size of 944 patients was distributed among the service groups, with 68-105 patients in each service. The instruments were a portion of the institution's patient satisfaction survey and the SF-12 (a 12-item generic measure of health status), both administered through telephone interviews. Across all hospital services, the relationships between satisfaction and health were too weak to interpret, with only 0.36% and 0.81% of the variance explained between overall satisfaction with care delivery and physical and mental health, respectively. At the service level, however, a number of significant but weak associations were found between satisfaction and health status in the otolaryngology, orthopedic, cardiothoracic, and transplant populations. Mental health and patients' likelihood to return to the hospital were negatively correlated in the neurology\/neurosurgery populations, indicating that at higher levels of mental function, patients reported lower likelihood of their returning to the hospital.","1077":"BlueCross BlueShield on the Rochester Area (BCBSRA) initiated a clinical quality improvement project that increased its diabetic retinopathy screening rate from 42.8% in 1995 to 58.1% in 1997. A multidisciplinary team examined the processes and discovered both member (patient) and provider (physician) barriers to annual screening. Members did not understand the clinical importance and were uncertain as to how frequently diabetic eye examinations were covered by insurance. Providers identified a role for BCBSRA to reinforce patient education on eye examinations and to assist with tracking of services. Involvement of these key stakeholders was critical to understanding and overcoming barriers.","1078":"A healthcare organization in northeast Georgia developed a team approach to meet the challenge of unacceptable customer service scores, improve numerous system inefficiencies, promote staff accountability, and maintain an emphasis on cost-effective and efficient utilization of resources.

The answers to three defined questions, the Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle, and testing the improvements on a small scale under a variety of conditions are the basis of rapid cycle change. The initial results are encouraging. To obtain a deeper evaluation of the clients' experience, a modified qualitative research methodology was utilized to obtain and analyze information. Five themes emerged that support rapid cycle change as an elegantly simple and effective model.","1086":"","1087":"The prioritization of QI activities and clinical studies is necessary in identifying and developing programs that improve care and service. In practice, significant factors that contribute to higher matrix scores are as follows: The activity affects both high-volume and high-risk populations The activity uses secondary rather than primary data sources The activity incorporates outcome as well as process measures. Through the use of formal, systematic procedures and an objective tool such as the prioritization matrix, quality professionals can develop and successfully implement QI activities and clinical studies. The process described here is useful when resources are limited or fixed or when the activity supports integrated methods used by both MCO clients and other MBHOs, because it can reduce the overall costs of designing a study, implementation, analysis, reporting, and monitoring.","1088":"The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS)* is an evolving set of criteria for collecting data on health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Initially designed by a consortium of employers and health plan representatives, it is owned by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and becomes more complex each year. As of 1999, HEDIS results are being used in NCQA HMO accreditation scoring.

This study was conducted to examine patient perceptions and observations about the coordination of care in a hospital setting and to identify the effect of patients' perspectives on satisfaction. The results suggest that even as lay observers, patients are interactors during their hospital experiences and their perceptions about care coordination are affected by communication patterns among healthcare professionals.","1092":"","1093":"This article describes how Great Plains Regional Medical Center (GPRMC) in North Platte, NE, changed its quality improvement (QI) methodology and its mind-set toward team time management to accelerate its improvement efforts. The \"24-hour road map\" and the improved FOCUS-PDSA methodology, coupled with strong leadership, make up the team time management element that has been missing from healthcare quality improvement but is critically needed to accelerate the process. At GPRMC, a major criterion for success is now a 6-month-or-less improvement cycle for cross-functional teams to complete their QI efforts. The lessons learned at GPRMC can help others in healthcare improve quality, lower costs, and do both more quickly.","1094":"When our emergency department (ED) initiated a continuous quality improvement (CQI) program, we selected as a quality indicator the percentage of patients leaving without being seen (LWBS) by a physician. Because the primary reason for LWBS patients was determined to be dissatisfaction with waiting time, we devised four interventions in clinical operations to decrease delays in patient flow through the ED. Statistical process control (SPC) methodology was then used to assess the effect of these interventions. Because baseline data were available, we constructed control charts of the percentage of LWBS patients versus consecutive months beginning in January 1990 with the mean percentage of LWBS patients and upper and lower control limits. Postintervention data, plotted using control statistics from the baseline period, demonstrated sustained special-cause variation, indicating a fundamental change in the overall system. A new control chart was then constructed using postintervention data. A significantly lowered mean percentage LWBS and a narrowed control limit range were observed, leading to the conclusion that the interventions improved the quality of care as measured by a reduction in percentage LWBS.","1095":"Outpatient addiction therapy is the most prevalent form of treatment for people suffering with chemical dependence. Hospital-based outpatient programs need to provide excellence in care and service while maintaining cost efficiency. Unfortunately, addiction services have not kept pace with the rest of the healthcare industry in measuring productivity and formulating benchmarks. The nature of counseling makes it difficult to accurately define productivity and even more difficult to measure it. This article addresses productivity measurement in the outpatient addiction setting, describes common obstacles in measurement, and offers solutions to these obstacles.","1096":"A tertiary-level academic hospital in Kaunas, Lithuania, adopted a continuous quality improvement (CQI) management paradigm from June 1996 through July 1997 in response to new political, economic, and social environments. This article presents an overview of the hospital's strategy, initial steps, and main accomplishments, as well as mitigating factors that arose in its quest to manage its own resources. Because historical influences are key to understanding the Lithuanian healthcare system, this discussion includes pre- and post-independence dynamics that caused a multidisciplinary hospital management team to choose a CQI approach that targets organizational and professional structures for change. In addition, it identifies environmental factors, internal and external to the hospital organization, that influence the continued development and sustainability of these healthcare management reform efforts.","1097":"Barbara Dickey, PhD, is director of the mental health services research department at McLean Hospital in Belmont, MA, and associate professor of psychology in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

It offers practical guidance for choosing a measurement method for each guideline, introduces patient surveys to measure guidelines, and identifies proven strategies for overcoming barriers in each phase.","1100":"Clinical pathways are similar to the production algorithms developed by industry. They are being adapted for use in healthcare to reduce resource utilization, decrease variability, and control expenditures. At Boston Medical Center we identified four trauma diagnoses that we believed to be amenable to the design and implementation of clinical pathways: closed head injury, penetrating wound to the abdomen, penetrating wound to the chest, and penetrating wound to an extremity. Upon implementation of these pathways, appropriate nonoperative, single-system, short-stay trauma patients were enrolled in them. This article details the process by which the four diagnoses were identified and the pathways designed, implemented, and evaluated. Preliminary data demonstrate a significant decrease in resource utilization following implementation of the pathways, without an adverse impact on readmission rates, length of stay, or mortality.","1101":"Just as quality programs have evolved into organization-wide performance improvement efforts, the quality professional's role has expanded, bringing new challenges and expectations. The quality services umbrella, an operational framework for a total systems quality process, helps organization leaders and quality professionals identify organizational functions that contribute to overall performance. This article describes the benefits of utilizing the quality services umbrella framework through five examples. Each example highlights different benefits of the model, such as identifying a system's quality issues, enhancing performance improvement efforts, sustaining improvements, and effecting cost savings.","1102":"An employee's ability to fit into an organization's culture is a key factor in achieving excellence in the workplace. This article explores socialization, anthropological factors, and shared values and their relationship to culture and esprit de corps.

The studies described in this article suggest that scientific methodologies should be used.","1103":"As healthcare providers proceed with redesigning patient care, forming centers of excellence, developing clinical pathways, focusing on best practices, and restructuring care services in their efforts to improve the structures and the processes of healthcare, outcomes research can help to determine the most effective patient care regimens. In a similar manner, outcomes are also assuming a higher priority for administrators of long-term care facilities. This article defines outcomes, discusses how they are being used in long-term care settings, presents commonly used outcomes, and describes how these outcomes can be measured and graphically displayed.","1104":"","1105":"Congestive heart failure (CHF) is the most common cause for hospitalization in older patients, and the prevalence of this condition is expected to rise as the population ages. The high cost of care has resulted in an increased emphasis on cost-effective approaches in patient management. One way to achieve this is the use of clinical pathways. This article compares outcomes in a group of older hospitalized patients managed on a CHF pathway with those of a historical cohort managed in the traditional manner. The patients on the pathway had significant reductions in length of stay and cost of care as well as more effective delivery of processes of care. Mortality rates were unchanged, at 3.5%. However, readmission rates showed a significant increase, from 9.25% to 13.5%, for patients on the pathway.","1106":"Patient falls have been a concern in North American healthcare for many years. Studies have examined environmental, clinical, and patient variables for purposes of risk identification and fall reduction, primarily in the context of Western societies. An investigation at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, began in 1993 to determine whether commonly reported risk factors apply to the Saudi patient population and whether cultural values, beliefs, and practices such as the performance of ablution before prayer, fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, and the need for socialization influence the rate of patient falls. The study included all inpatients (N = 379) who fell during a 3-year period.","1107":"Several models for implementing quality improvement have been developed, but they have been applied primarily in the United States. One model developed by the U.S. Agency for International Development Quality Assurance Project has been applied in several other countries.

And like other members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Canada is under pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures. One strategy being explored by Canadian provincial governments is to regionalize or decentralize the delivery of healthcare services. To ensure achievement of its goals for each region, the Ministry of Health requires each regional health authority to submit a business plan and annual report, including performance information and underlying performance indicators. Performance indicators are used to measure process and outcome as well; they are useful for generating questions about the behavior or the performance of a provider or organization. A system for defining systemic performance measures for a publicly funded healthcare system does not exist. However, the performance indicators described in this article provide a sampling of provider-based healthcare performance.","1109":"This article presents the results of a patient satisfaction survey carried out in an acute care hospital complex in Doha, Qatar, in the Middle East. The objectives were to determine the level of patient satisfaction as follows: in general, in 18 different patient areas and services, for Qatar citizens and noncitizens, among patients with different sociodemographic characteristics, and in technical and interpersonal areas of care. The quantitative, descriptive survey design involved two 73-item questionnaires, one in English and one in Arabic. It was given to medical, surgical, and obstetric and gynecologic patients. Satisfaction was rated on a 5-point scale, and univariate statistics and chi-square analysis were used to determine frequencies and statistical differences. The response rate was 77%; 84% rated the overall quality of care excellent or very good. Respondents gave nursing services the highest ratings and slightly favored technical over interpersonal care. The results show that patients are willing to participate in the survey process and that the questionnaire is a valuable tool for measuring satisfaction and for obtaining feedback and continuous evaluation of services.","1110":"Faculty of Kuwait University have been active promotors of quality assurance in their host country, yet despite many attempts the concept has failed.

This article describes how Brighton Health Care NHS Trust in the south of England follows the CQI path and discusses some of its achievements and the problems encountered along the way.","1113":"HealthEast, an integrated care delivery system based in St. Paul, MN, established a care management program in 1993. At HealthEast, care management is defined as \"an interdisciplinary process of coordinating client-centered services across the continuum of care to achieve quality and cost-effective outcomes.\" The program included establishing a collaborative practice model that was used to drive the organization's improvement efforts. The use of this model has been instrumental in achieving significant improvements in financial and clinical performance. As a result, HealthEast received a leadership award for \"Improving Clinical Effectiveness within a Healthcare System\" from VHA, Inc., a nationwide membership alliance of approximately 1,700 community healthcare organizations.","1114":"Patient satisfaction survey data provide valuable information about how well healthcare organizations and their individual departments are meeting the needs and expectations of their patients. Lack of sufficient data can severely inhibit an organization's ability to understand its strengths and to target areas in which performance can be improved. This article describes a performance improvement project that a hospital used to increase response rates to its patient satisfaction surveys in its ambulatory care settings. The results were significant: five times more surveys were returned 6 months after implementation of the project than had been returned at baseline. Managers and staff now have the information they need to understand how well they are meeting their patients' needs and to make sound decisions related to performance improvement efforts.","1115":"Baystate Medical Center is a 750-bed tertiary-care referral center in western Massachusetts. In 1995 Baystate reorganized the structure of its quality assurance (QA) program from an individual departmentally based QA committee structure to a series of multidisciplinary service-line performance improvement teams. The new approach sought to implement total quality management techniques that had been proven effective in major industrial settings but were not widely applied in the healthcare sector. The oncology services performance improvement team is cochaired by an attending surgical oncologist and the nursing supervisor of a dedicated inpatient oncology unit. Its membership comprises a broad spectrum of oncology subspecialists and allied support staff. The team supports multiple performance improvement initiatives, including analyses of various cancer-related outcomes (e.g., patient satisfaction, morbidity and mortality data) and peer review analysis. Systems issues not falling under the aegis of the oncology services team are referred to other service-line teams. The performance improvement activities are carefully designed to meet the needs of the facility's patient population and the accreditation requirements of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer.","1116":"We conducted a study in the mental health and behavioral sciences program at Hines Veterans Administration Hospital to determine if a recent reorganization of the mental health services had resulted in the efficient use of treatment resources according to patients' needs. The Brief Symptom Inventory was used to assess symptomatology when patients were admitted to the inpatient psychiatry, dual diagnosis, or substance abuse lodger units. The results indicated that the groups differ significantly from one another on eight of nine symptom dimensions and on all three global indices of psychopathology. The results also reinforced the supposition that patients are receiving appropriate treatment and that resources are being used efficiently.","1117":"Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been used to reduce unnecessary and undesirable variations in clinical practice. Many facilities succeed in developing and using these tools, while others conclude that they are not worth the effort. This article describes the results of a systemwide analysis of the processes a healthcare system used to plan, develop, implement, and measure CPGs after several years of experience. Extensive interviews were conducted at facilities in which the CPG program was active to determine what factors had contributed to its success or failure. The result is a series of recommendations that will facilitate CPG implementation in virtually any clinical setting.","1118":"The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) is a tool to measure and report managed care performance. HEDIS has become the industry standard for assessing and comparing the quality of managed care organizations (MCOs), so it is imperative that MCOs collect and communicate HEDIS data correctly and efficiently. Several primary issues face MCOs in compiling HEDIS data. In particular, this article examines the HEDIS audit process and outlines the preparation required to undergo an audit, common errors uncovered in the audit process, and steps that can be taken to ensure compliance with HEDIS technical specifications.","1119":"To develop an effective, coordinated, and integrated process for patient education in primary care, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Western New York Healthcare System, launched a process action team. The interdisciplinary team utilized a variety of methods, including flowcharts, cause-and-effect diagrams, and variance matrices. The team developed, implemented, and analyzed a data collection plan involving chart reviews, staff interviews, and patient-staff surveys. An improvement plan was initiated in collaboration with staff. The results highlight the importance of using a data collection plan to understand the causes of problems as well as the need for staff involvement.","1120":"The performance improvement department at The Queen's Medical Center (QMC) in Honolulu, has been monitoring the outcomes of cardiovascular interventional procedures and cardiothoracic surgical procedures. By using an institution-wide database as well as participating in national cardiac databases, a set of clinical indicators is tracked, and quarterly reports are provided to the cardiovascular medicine (CV) and thoracic and cardiovascular surgery (TCV) services. After reviewing the data, a combined CV\/TCV\/anesthesia morbidity and mortality committee meets monthly to further evaluate the data, review cases, and formulate action plans based upon the findings. Using these tools and methods, we have seen a marked improvement in clinical outcomes among cardiac patients.","1121":"The strategic importance of performance improvement (PI) in healthcare is being recognized across the country. Organizations that recognize PI's importance and support PI will be better prepared for a healthcare future that mandates measurable value. Building the foundation for success is neither a simple task nor a cheap one. It requires a total systems perspective on improving processes and systems, a commitment to continual learning, and recognition of what other industries have already learned--to succeed, you must constantly innovate and improve. This article discusses one organization's approach to building the foundation for a performance-driven 21st-century healthcare system.","1122":"","1123":"Several long-term care facilities in the Rochester, NY, area developed a benchmark process that was customer driven, analytical in its approach to problem-solving, measurable, and flexible enough to be applicable to any area of care within the facilities. The facilities benefited by gaining a process that improves their operations and has a positive impact on residents' quality of life.","1124":"","1125":"Successful implementation of a clinical pathway program is a complex, multifaceted task. Medical and hospital staff education is often overlooked or minimized during the implementation process. Even with a clinically sound pathway and a state-of-the-art variance-tracking system, implementation can fail miserably if the medical and hospital staff do not completely understand and support the pathway initiative. A well-developed plan for education provides staff members with the foundation they need to be successful within the pathway program.","1126":"A large urban university medical center used a unique set of strategies in preparation for its triennial survey conducted by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. Although the medical center had experienced many Joint Commission surveys, this particular survey was the first to include associated physician offices in multiple diverse settings. To address these challenges, the hospital developed a structure and process that engaged all levels of staff and ensured a successful survey outcome.","1127":"Having accurate measures and high-quality health information is critically important for all providers today. Integrated delivery systems are faced with increasing demands for numerous redundant, sometimes conflicting, performance measurement and reporting data from managed care customers, regulators, and accreditors. When implemented independently within each organizational subunit, these measurement systems are costly and difficult to manage. Centralization of all measurement services can maximize the productivity of the costly resources required to deliver them and can achieve efficiencies, cost savings, and a better balance between internal and external resources while collecting information that is of a higher quality for managerial and clinical decision making.","1128":"Assisting organizations with performance improvement planning is among the most important, challenging, and potentially rewarding responsibilities of the quality management professional. NorthCrest Medical Center, a 100-bed not-for-profit community hospital, developed a long-term vision for quality which was then supported through a unique model of performance improvement based on important functions. The resulting key function framework has helped the organization prepare for two successful Joint Commission surveys, relocate to a new facility, and survive in today's rapidly changing environment.","1129":"Managed care organizations (MCOs) conduct provider facility site reviews to promote quality standards in office practice operations and to comply with such regulating agencies as the Joint Commission, various payers, and the Michigan Department of Community Health and statutes such as the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act. The results of the facility site reviews are incorporated into the credentialing and recredentialing decision processes for individual practitioners and provider organizations. This study sought to compare the facility site reviews conducted by nurse reviewers who were experienced in quality management of managed care with site reviews conducted by nonclinical staff. In 9 of the 22 sites, the nurse reviewers' scores more accurately represented the primary care physicians' compliance with existing standards and regulations than did those reported by the nonclinical reviewers. This study supports the recommendation that facility site reviews be conducted by nurses experienced in the quality management of managed care.","1130":"Managed care's initial continuous quality improvement impact may have been comparable to the sentinel, or Hawthorne, effect. Managed behavioral healthcare's CQI role can be compared with that of the clinical navigator. The clinical navigator attempts to develop a consensus with the patient on what is the clinical destination, and must choose a route to travel that is the best approach to reach the destination (i.e., a focused treatment plan). In addition, the clinical navigator tries to find the most efficient mode of travel--or, the least restrictive, least intrusive site of care from where the patient can receive treatment. Essential clinical tasks or expectations in the clinical assessment are also outlined, and the concept of knowledge coupling is introduced to accommodate the unique, individual issues of the patient. The emphasis of managed care today is shifting to further accentuate a CQI, outcomes-based approach.","1131":"In the rush to produce balanced scorecards and outcomes measures, managed care organizations must recognize the need to better assess the clinical competencies of their contracted skilled nursing facilities. Health plan quality management staffs, although composed of gifted professionals, generally do not have sufficient skilled nursing facility (SNF)-related experience or knowledge to support evaluation and qualification of these providers. The successfully implemented Altman-Conrad (A-C) SNF quality management process objectively measures and monitors managed care contracted services provided by SNFs. The A-C process requires a health plan's quality management\/utilization management staff to engage in a team-based educational endeavor. This effort is designed to generate measurable outcomes specific to the health plan's needs. The proven benefits of the process include improved member services, greater member satisfaction, more productive days for SNFs, more effective discharges, and the generation of a win-win relationship between the health plan and its contract providers.","1132":"","1133":"This article examines the role of a state Medicaid program in standardizing and implementing quality performance measures for providers. It describes the Asthma Education and Primary Care Clinician Linkages Quality Improvement Program (QIP), one aspect of the ongoing Hospital Quality Initiative in Massachusetts. In October 1996, the second year of the initiative, the Massachusetts Division of Medical Assistance requested that all contracting hospitals submit quality improvement process and outcome measures related to asthma care, including practice guidelines, patient education materials, and documentation mechanisms to facilitate patients' appropriate follow-up contact with primary care clinicians. A team of evaluators reviewed these materials to determine whether hospitals had baseline data in place for asthma QIP development. Information forums were held with three reviewers and the hospitals to discuss various programs and progress toward quality improvement in asthma care. Reviewers also worked to identify hospital programs that could be used as models and those that would benefit from assistance in meeting the state's program goals.","1134":"With the emergence of new, relatively low-cost code-based severity indexes, this question arises: Do complex descriptions of patient population in terms of severity yield a clearer picture of patients' opinions about hospital care and service? Consumers and third-party payers of healthcare are using patient satisfaction data with increasing frequency to evaluate the quality of care that hospitals provide. Insurers also use satisfaction data, when they are available, for contracting and ensuring provider accountability. The study described here examines whether the all patient refined-diagnosis related groups (APR-DRG) severity-of-illness rating system, in particular, can explain the variability in inpatient satisfaction ratings independently of patient demographics and clinical events. Multiple logistic regression was used on a data set of 3,720 patient records from one tertiary care facility, and model terms were fitted on the basis of reason for admission, year, gender, length of stay, age, and severity. The findings were that age and reason for admission were consistent predictors of high satisfaction on 14 survey items. APR-DRG severity was not a significant factor. Length of stay made a small but significant contribution on three items related to clinical quality.","1135":"Managers at Kino Community Hospital in Tucson, AZ, were growing concerned about patient violence and its effects. This worry resulted from an increasing number of injuries to staff caused by patients in addition to the escalating costs of workers' compensation claims. Managers theorized that staff injuries could be decreased by changing staffing patterns, practicing crisis intervention techniques more frequently, and establishing continuing education classes. The hospital therefore implemented a step-by-step violence prevention program for its inpatient psychiatric department, an action that led to markedly fewer staff injuries by the end of 1996. A detailed account of this program follows.","1136":"Hospital length of stay (LOS) has declined significantly at Mt. Sinai Hospital with the advent of diagnosis-related groups (DRGs). Patients with colorectal cancer who were operated on before and after the implementation of the DRG were compared to determine whether the shorter LOS reflected changes in the patient population or changes in the way patients were being treated. Both preoperative and postoperative LOS declined significantly for DRG patients. The decreased LOS for DRG patients could not be attributed to a decreased severity of disease because DRG patients presented with significantly more advanced tumors. The DRG patients had significantly less operative blood loss; shorter, less extensive procedures; fewer transfusion; shorter specimen lengths; shorter margins of resection; and fewer postoperative complications than the pre-DRG patients. Other measures of disease severity (i.e., admission hematocrit, tumor differentiation, and tumor size) and patient mix (i.e., age and sex) did not change. These results suggest that with the use of DRGs, surgeons may have modified certain aspects of treatment for colorectal cancer in an attempt to shorten LOS.","1137":"This article describes a process developed by Eastern Mercy Health System (EMHS), headquartered in Radnor, PA, to identify opportunities for quality improvement using defined outcome-based indicators in skilled nursing and long-term care (SN\/LTC). The model is built on collaboration among the system's freestanding and hospital-based facilities; it includes a cyclical approach to the exchange of information. The experiences of three of the system's members reflect how each has realized measurable benefits by applying to their unique settings the lessons learned through the collaborative process.","1138":"Regulation-based processes for evaluating the performance of mental health agencies are gradually changing to focus on measuring the effectiveness of mental health services in obtaining the best possible outcomes. The decreased availability of resources for serving people with mental health problems has led to an emphasis on effectiveness, which is often expressed in terms of accountability. Thus, a singular reliance on compliance with practice standards has shifted to the need to be able to demonstrate that funds appropriated for mental health services are being used in ways that result in valued outcomes. In Colorado, this shift has led to the development of performance indicators that provide information reflecting stakeholder values about the performance outcomes of the mental health system. This article describes these performance indicators and presents the data that led to a decision to award monetary incentives to two community agencies. Potential benefits and pitfalls of Colorado's performance indicator process are also discussed.","1139":"Continuous quality improvement (CQI) activities depend on valid and reliable instruments to generate data. An evaluation of internal and external customer satisfaction is one of the pillars of the CQI process. This article describes the development of a valid and reliable instrument for measuring physicians' satisfaction with the orthopedic nursing units at a major medical trauma center. The physician satisfaction survey instrument was found to be internally consistent (alpha = .95). Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that 68% of the variance in physician satisfaction scores (eigenvalue = 8.14) was explained by using a single-factor model.","1140":"The definition of scopes of practice for allied healthcare practitioners in outpatient settings is an emerging healthcare topic in this era when technologically advanced procedures are being done and diagnostics, therapies, and care are being given in outpatient settings. The standards of care and practice under which allied health professionals provide care must be defined within an organization in order to provide the high-quality integrated healthcare that is the benchmark of excellence. One way to increase leadership and staff awareness is to provide experts in each allied health discipline the opportunity to define their scopes of practice, as the Joint Commission suggests, based on the rules and regulations that govern those practices.","1141":"This article describes a continuous improvement team's activities to improve the process of obtaining and documenting informed consent and to decrease the incidence of communication errors during the surgical scheduling process.

The following article presents a case study of a successful quality improvement process mounted at Good Shepherd Home, a rehabilitation hospital in Allentown, PA. It discusses the key items of the systems approach and looks at how the items have been implemented and integrated and the future of the process.","1143":"This study validates the measurements of performance of preventive practices and identifies organizational and market factors that affect variations in the preventive care practices of health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess HMO performance, reflecting the rates of five preventive practice services. A structural equation model of the preventive practice performance of HMOs was evaluated. It was discovered that HMOs that employ more board-certified primary care practitioners have a higher rate of preventive care practices and that market competition and market forces do not influence the variation in HMO preventive care practices.","1144":"In today's managed care healthcare environment, there is a need for hospitals and physician groups alike to know the true quality and costs of healthcare services provided to patients. As the movement toward having providers accept risk via financial capitation escalates, quality improvement professionals involved in outcomes management are increasingly being asked to investigate information sources and systems that can prove helpful in managing effectively within these limitations. As a result, there is a high degree of interest in comparative performance outcomes measurement data based on risk-adjusted and severity-adjusted data. This article explains the key features of performance outcomes measurement systems and notes concerns that should be considered when evaluating these software systems for selection.","1145":"","1146":"To have a positive impact on the immunization rate of the 4,000 newborn infants it covers each year, Blue Care Network of Southeast Michigan (BCNSEM), a 240,000-member health maintenance organization that is based on an independent provider association model, convened a continuous quality improvement team. One of the results of this initiative was the development and implementation of an immunization registry, which is used as an internal tracking and reminder system for its members and providers. In recognition of its efforts, BCNSEM recently earned a Celebrating Innovation award from the American Association of Health Plans.","1147":"Healthcare literature suggests that most adverse drug events (ADEs) are the results of errors at the prescribing stage. These ADEs affect patients, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and hospital administrators. Improving systems and providing education, rather than tracking the performance of individual prescribers, seem to be more effective in preventing and reducing ADEs. Pharmacists' participation on patient medical rounds and their presence in a satellite pharmacy increased their accessibility and their ability to share pertinent clinical information and thereby improved the medication order process and, ultimately, patient care. The pharmacy and medicine departments at one hospital took a proactive multidisciplinary approach that resulted in streamlining the medication order process, decreasing delays in initiating drug therapy, preventing ADEs, enhancing the knowledge of healthcare professionals, meeting the needs and expectations of patients and providers, and employing cost-effective drug therapy.","1148":"Canadian federal and provincial governments face relentless fiscal and societal pressures to reduce healthcare expenditures. A chief cause of this mounting stress is Canadians wanting to know how and why their healthcare dollars are being spent, as well as what evidence supports the use of new technology and alternative ways of treating specific medical conditions. One of the tools attracting attention and allowing this type of analysis is the clinical practice guideline. Physicians, who have come under increased scrutiny as the key players in health services delivery, are often asked to lead the clinical practice guideline process as project leaders. This article addresses some of the common roadblocks encountered as clinical practice guidelines are initiated, developed, and implemented in healthcare organizations.","1149":"","1150":"Everyone has an opinion on healthcare delivery. When the subject is a national system for healthcare delivery, opinions can become very heated--for and against! This article outlines the British National Health Service (NHS). It discusses the history and background of the NHS and how those working within its system are endeavoring to follow the path of continuous quality improvement to enable it to meet the demands of the 21st century.","1151":"In today's managed healthcare era, cost-control measures that encourage underutilization of resources create fears that patients will receive less care than their conditions, injuries, or illnesses warrant. Patients need protection now that the rules have changed. Traditionally, patients have relied on direct caregivers to put their patients first. As individuals, caregivers want to be patient advocates; however, changes in the healthcare environment make it difficult for them to maintain their advocacy role. Clinical decision support criteria that are contained in a resource management program can help providers and payers maintain a balance between cost containment and healthcare quality.","1152":"The changing responsibilities of registered nurses are challenging even the most dedicated professionals. To survive within her newly-defined roles, one nurse used a total quality improvement model to understand, analyze, and improve a medical center's system for tracking inpatient injuries. This process led to the drafting of an original software design that implemented a nursing informatics tracking system. It has resulted in significant savings of time and money and has far surpassed the accuracy, efficiency, and scope of the previous method. This article presents an overview of the design process.","1153":"Internet Relay Chat (IRC) program is a medium that can provide low-cost interactive conferencing for healthcare organizations. This article analyzes IRC in the context of the many facets of the Internet, discusses some precautions regarding IRC use, and lists some sources of help for the user. IRC is an extremely powerful adjunct to other Internet programs.","1154":"Providers and payers will need to implement the Ambulatory Patient Groups (APG) system, a complex new payment mechanism for outpatient care. Because the APG system consolidates, packages, and discounts a facility's payment for outpatient services, providers might receive decreased reimbursement for services, as compared to the reimbursement received under their present outpatient payment arrangements. APGs, like DRGs, will force providers to examine their coding practices carefully to ensure that they will receive reimbursement adequate to cover their costs.","1155":"With the rise of managed care, purchasers and payers are increasingly demanding value in healthcare. Traditionally, patient satisfaction surveys and focus groups have been used to elicit information regarding customers' perspectives. This article explores the use of an inexpensive alternative methodology--that of monitoring quality-of-care concerns and complaints. A nomenclature and a process for tracking, trending, and reporting quality-of-care issues are detailed; they encompass both the patient's and the provider's perception of a specific care experience. This methodology promotes the use of quantifiable data to support strategic planning and compliance with National Committee for Quality Assurance accreditation standards.","1156":"Ventilator-related pneumonia is costly not only in terms of treatment, equipment, and length of stay but also in terms of patient morbidity and mortality. From October 1995 through March 1996 an increase in ventilator-related pneumonia cases, of which 83% were caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), was noted at a Veterans Affairs medical center. A multidisciplinary team based on the TQI model and using TQI tools, methodology, and principles of problem solving was subsequently formed to look into ventilator-related pneumonia. The team's data collection and analysis efforts identified numerous opportunities for improvement. The primary outcome has been a decrease in the incidence of ventilator-related pneumonia that has resulted in substantial cost savings.","1157":"To connect practices, outcomes, quality, value, and costs, healthcare organizations must start using a balanced scorecard. A balanced scorecard is a set of measures that reveals the interdependency of the organization, its employees, and its patients. It thus serves as a balanced perspective on the organization for senior management to use in designing, developing, deploying, and directing the strategic plan, consistent with total quality management principles.","1158":"Providers will continue to experience increasing pressure to demonstrate cost-effective, high-quality care. For relevant comparisons between providers, outcomes must be evaluated with respect to severity of illness and mortality risk. However, most hospitals use patient classification methods, such as Medicare and Health Care Financing Administration diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), which group together different levels of severity and mortality risk. The most common approach for developing severity-adjusted outcomes for groups of cases with dissimilar severity levels is to divide a statistic by a factor such as the Medicare case mix index, which was not designed or intended for that purpose. As an alternative, providers are increasingly using severity-based methods that classify patients as to severity levels within each diagnosis-related group. The key to severity-based profiling is the classification of cases to similar patient groups and comparison to selected benchmarks for variance analysis at each severity level. Effective provider profiling requires that hospital staff and physicians work together toward the common goal of accurate and complete documentation and coding of all medical conditions. Through use of more accurate severity-based profiling, providers are better able to identify opportunities to improve performance and demonstrate cost-effectiveness and quality to buyers, beneficiaries, and third-party reviewers.","1159":"The surgical service at the Philadelphia Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center has been making a continuous effort toward improving efficiency in the operating room. A multidisciplinary task force was created in May 1994 to look at delays in operating room start times for the first case of the day. This article identifies problems that contributed to the delays and the changes implemented, along with a statistical analysis of the data collected. The team discovered that delays were related to system problems in the perioperative process and were not caused by any specific problem. Many of these problems proved correctable, as the statistical analysis shows, and the result was significant improvement in operating room efficiency.","1160":"Hospital internal medicine and family practice care were redesigned in July 1995 at Kaiser Permanente of Colorado. The objectives were to provide for a full time dedicated inpatient team, improve continuity of care, and establish a two-tiered process of admission. Physicians were divided into four tracks that marked varying degrees of time in the hospital. A position of triage physician was created that screened all potential admissions to internal medicine. Hospital inpatient days per thousand members, unadjusted lengths of stay, patient readmission rates, and satisfaction questionnaires were obtained both before and after the change. The change achieved significant reductions in unadjusted average lengths of stay and days per thousand without diminishing quality of care, as reflected by hospital readmission rates and by patient satisfaction surveys.","1161":"","1162":"In May 1994, it was noted that lost work days due to employee injuries were out of control at MedCenter Hospital in Marion, OH. An employee injury team was commissioned by the continuous quality improvement steering committee to investigate and make recommendations to reduce lost workdays. An analysis of the situation required a data search that revealed several patterns and trends. This information was then examined and a decision was made to institute a \"Back Care: Train the Trainer\" program to reduce the major cause of employee injuries--back sprains and strains. The concept of teamwork is defined and the developmental process of a team is explored.","1163":"Assessing clinical performance is difficult. Members of the Nursing Service Clinical Practice Committee at the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix developed a comprehensive program of competency assessment based on performance measures.

The approach to competency assessment includes performance measures specific to patients' ages.","1164":"This article presents strategies for enhancing the emergency department care delivered to patients with chest pain and suspected acute myocardial infarction. It also describes the planning and implementation of an emergency department reengineering project at a university medical center. The establishment of chest pain evaluation centers within emergency departments has been associated with improved clinical outcomes and cost control. Creating such a center requires careful revamping of diagnostic and treatment algorithms, a process that must be based on information from all departments affected by the changes.","1165":"This article describes the process that a team of Department of Veterans Affairs social work service department heads went through as they developed national guidelines for social work case management. Many of the concepts and findings of this team apply to case managers in any profession.","1166":"Wayne Memorial Hospital uses focus groups to elicit feedback from clients. One group involved 11 women with breast cancer. Aspects of interest included screening and detection, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, life after cancer, and general perceptions of cancer care. The findings revealed that participants felt the community offered high-quality progressive cancer care. Opportunities for improvement along the continuum were identified, including a need for personalized breast self-exam education, consideration of bed placement in the room following breast surgery, and additional support for breast cancer victims and their husbands. A multidisciplinary plan was developed to address the identified issues.","1167":"Pneumonia is the third most frequent admission diagnosis at Macomb Hospital Center. The average length of stay for this diagnosis (DRGs 89 and 90) was 9.07 days. After the initiation of a critical pathway that begins in the emergency department, the average length of stay decreased to 7.11 days. Quality of care also improved in two areas: the time elapsed before delivery of antibiotics and availability of X-ray reports. This article reviews the implementation and results of the critical pathway for pneumonia.","1168":"Many hospitals and integrated health networks are turning to case management as a means to control costs by more effectively managing resource utilization. The problem arises when an organization does not define the scope of case management or does not identify criteria specific to the needs of the organization and the population it serves. Integrating case management into the existing organizational structure and systems is key to its success.","1169":"Healthcare organizations need critical performance measures if they are to lead, manage, and operate effectively. Traditional financial measures or report cards on patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes are insufficient, however. Value-based cost management directly links cost accounting, processes, clinical outcomes, and patient and employee satisfaction through organizational, work environment, and financial relations measures. These measures address three levels of performance: strategic, diagnostic, and operational. Their linkages identify value in three areas: business-related financial and operational measures; employee-related measures such as those related to satisfaction and well-being; and learning and patient-related measures linked to clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and population.","1170":"The newly independent nations of the former Soviet Union continue to restructure and refine their political and economic environments. Competition for scarce of dwindling economic resources within these nations and between the nations of an expanding global community necessitates that they adopt more efficient and effective management methods to provide essential public services. As a result, organizational management concepts developed and used in the West (i.e., in the United States and the countries of the European Union) are eagerly sought for incorporation into new administrative systems. This is an opportune time for healthcare service management educators to develop and present total quality management (TQM) programs, stressing continuous quality improvement (CQI) methods specifically targeted and adapted to the organizational needs of these countries, as they restructure their societies from centrally planned to market-driven economies. In general, educators in healthcare service management, acting as information consultants, can play a pivotal role in guiding strategies for healthcare organizational change and in helping to stabilize transitional organizational processes, by providing guidelines that can improve utilization of healthcare resources and monitoring of healthcare service outcomes. Most of the observations and recommendations presented in this article are derived from the author's experiences in conducting healthcare management improvement projects in Bulgaria in 1993 and in Lithuania since 1991.","1171":"Organizations are facing the economic challenges of managed care while employees are facing the domino effect. Both are having an arduous time with changes in healthcare delivery. Employees don't automatically fall into line with strategic plans for organizational change. They need current information and assistance into obtaining the necessary training related to their jobs. How does a medical center help employees to integrate the organization's mission, vision, and values into all work processes in ways that meet their needs? Adult learners need to know why they need to grasp the concept of managed care and how they can apply it on the job.","1172":"Undergoing a survey by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) is an arduous and grueling task. In many healthcare settings, there is more emphasis than ever before on achieving commendation status, which is the highest rating possible from JCAHO. This article chronicles one hospital's journey toward receiving accreditation with commendation and is applicable to any hospital preparing for its own survey.","1173":"Healthcare organizations are being challenged to find ways to leverage improvement efforts. Collaboration offers an avenue for working together toward a common goal. Healthcare leaders can initiate collaborative projects to analyze common clinical problems and to share best practices. This article describes how a Catholic healthcare system successfully initiated a systemwide collaborative clinical quality improvement project to deal with patient falls.","1174":"A multidisciplinary performance improvement team was chartered to examine the problem of repeated admissions to psychiatric hospitals. It was also asked to devise an intervention strategy to reduce the number of readmissions, including the number of patients with three or more admissions in a 12-month period and the number of days patients spend in hospital beds. Multivoting, benchmarking, and a review of medical records for 88 psychiatric patients who had been hospitalized three or more times in 1 year were the methods used to gather data on client characteristics. An analysis of the data suggested that these high-end users had similar patterns of service utilization prior to their hospitalizations. The team identified 11 of these patterns as triggers that appear to signal early stages of decompensation that can lead to hospitalization. The team implemented an early intervention and prevention system by using the triggers as criteria for initiating a change in treatment plans. A study of the effectiveness of the Triggers Intervention and Prevention System (TIPS) was undertaken over the next 2 years. An automated program for deriving the triggers from the emergency services database was developed. Initial results that TIPS is an effective means of reducing recidivism and that the triggers can identify high-end users. Some of the triggers were deemed to be more effective than others in the early identification of individuals who may need to be hospitalized. A comparison of hospitalization rates for the pre- and postimplementation periods of TIPS showed a significant reduction in the number of patients who had three or more hospitalizations, fewer total admissions, and a shorter average length of stay. During 1995, the triggers were successful in the early identification of all patients who had more than one admission. The teams used the Design, Measure, Assess, Improve method recommended by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations.","1175":"MedSpan, a managed care organization, believes it should provide physicians with maximum input regarding utilization management and practice guidelines. This has been accomplished through nine committees, all of which report to a Medical Management\/Quality Management Committee. This committee structure has allowed MedSpan to avoid the unilateral imposition of guidelines and has enhanced the quality of care and service while decreasing utilization and reducing costs. Examples of specific physician committee actions are included in this article.","1176":"The 1994 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) National Customer Feedback Survey of 43,594 recently discharged inpatients revealed that problems relating to emotional support were reported two to three more frequently by VHA patients than by patients in the private sector. The scores related to emotional support that were reported by 130 Oklahoma City Veterans Affairs Medical Center surgery respondents were the facility's least favorable scores in benchmark comparisons with all VHA surgery patients and with surgery patients at Picker Institute, a nonprofit, private sector research and education organization. These scores prompted the initiation of a successful program to loan radio and digital beepers to patients' family members.","1177":"This article examines the possibilities and limitations of using computerized insurance claims and outpatient medical records to evaluate a Medicaid managed care program. The quality of medical care delivered to enrollees 1 1\/2 years into the MassHealth managed care program's operation is discussed in the context of an evaluation that was conducted by the University of Massachusetts-Boston's McCormack Institute in 1993. Study results suggest that these two data sources offer adequate information to determine the quality level of primary and preventive services and lead to further suggestions for evaluating care.","1178":"Analysis of the quarterly quality improvement reports submitted by departments and teams at the University of New Mexico Hospital identified several common pitfalls: monitoring someone else's performance, choosing irrelevant or meaningless indicators, working with inadequate samples, changing measurement techniques or indicators too frequently, taking ineffective actions, and jumping to solutions. To overcome these pitfalls, managers and team leaders can use tools such as indicator worksheets, data collection plans, report forms, team-tracking mechanisms, and comprehensive guidelines as their guides through the quality improvement process.","1179":null,"1180":"Families of patients in critical care experience extreme anxiety and frustration while awaiting their loved ones' recovery or stabilization. To study the hypothesis that meeting families' informational needs can reduce their anxiety and help them cope with the initial crisis, a small task force at a Midwest acute care facility, using a CQI approach, studied possible solutions. Initial findings showed low satisfaction for families of critically ill patients with the present system of imparting information to them. After initiation of a storyboard to present information by the critical care team, families reported increased satisfaction and greater knowledge recall.","1181":"","1182":"The study described in this article examined disease chronicity and quality of care and their relationship to hospital readmissions during a 3-month period. Results showed that readmissions due to disease chronicity were significantly more prevalent than for other categories. Illnesses, including pulmonary disease, heart failure, and cancer, ranked as leading causes for readmission, whereas readmissions due to quality of care or complications most often resulted from a previous admission for surgery. This study's findings demonstrate that using readmission rates alone as indicators of poor care can be misleading.","1183":"The Clinical Indicator Workbook is a computerized tool that allows users to develop measures of healthcare quality. The electronic workbook, which includes selected clinical indicators to measure various aspects of patient care and teaching examples, was developed by using a major word processing package and uses a point-and-click feature. Its distribution and installation are managed by a program that enables users to select one of three options: (a) installation of the required files and indicator documents, (b) duplication of material on two diskettes for future distribution within the user's facility, and (c) on-line help. Once the workbook is installed, users are able to copy and customize the indicators for use with interdisciplinary teams in clinical settings. A survey of initial users, who are, for the most part, quality managers in the Veterans Affairs system, indicated that they are satisfied with this tool overall.","1184":"Healthcare organizations are faced with the responsibility of teaching their entire staff the founding principles, concepts, and practices of total quality management (TQM), to improve organizational effectiveness. Purchasing training products from outside consultants can be costly, but healthcare leaders can design and develop their own TQM training products, integrating each product with their organization's mission and values. This article describes how a Catholic healthcare system successfully developed and deployed a compendium of TQM educational products throughout the health-care system.","1185":"A byproduct of outcome measures is the provision of financial benefit to the healthcare providers while ensuring healthcare access and quality to the patient. Consequently, a framework for measuring outcomes must integrate the \"customer's perspective\" of perceiving value of the services provided, the \"provider's perspective\" of acting as the patient's fiduciary, and the \"business's perspective\" of achieving net income. Value-based cost management (VBCM) accomplishes this integration by linking several measures with three financial tools: activity-based costing, value-added analysis, and cost of quality. This article illustrates the use and benefit of VBCM to the laboratory as a partner in the delivery of healthcare services with an example of chest pain triage.","1186":"This article addresses, from both research and political perspectives, the issue of quantifying data on nonmedical psychiatric treatment activity in large residential treatment settings. It presents a method of collecting this type of data that includes the use of readily available statistical software. It describes the methodology in detail and examines the variables. The system has had an impact on treatment, administration, and personnel at the facility.","1187":"Healthcare delivery today emphasizes quality improvement in program management. The focus on consumer needs and satisfaction challenges us to develop effective tools to evaluate our services from the user's perspective. This article delineates the development, implementation, analysis, and outcomes of a program evaluation questionnaire that was designed to evaluate program staff and treatment services from the perspectives of both patients and families. The potential this type of consumer opinion gauge and tool has to shape healthcare delivery is outlined within the context of a rehabilitation program.","1188":"Reports to the author's hospital's board of directors on quality, risk management, infection control, and safety issues were complex and lengthy. Board members found the reports uninteresting and difficult to understand. To improve the reports, several ongoing measurements were identified from key areas, teams, and functions, and were reported graphically. These measurements now are reported on a quarterly basis; they include results from the current time period and the previous time period, as well as benchmarking goals. The revised presentation of material has been well received by the hospital's board, medical executive committee, and administrative staff.","1189":"A courier robot at Abington Memorial Hospital has allowed the hospital to maintain high standards of patient care in the face of budget constraints. The robot handles after-hours deliveries of meals and supplies efficiently and cost-effectively, thus freeing support staff to focus on other tasks.","1190":"In an era of increasing emphasis on cost-effectiveness and efficient utilization of resources, physicians and patients can expect to face changes in clinical practices. Smooth transition from inefficient and expensive practices of the past to more cost-effective, newer practices would require strategies to identify and address the concerns of both physicians and patients. The involvement of patients will be important to maintaining patient satisfaction and patient empowerment. This article describes an example of effective solicitation of cooperation from physicians and patients for cost containment and reduction of inappropriate use of electrocardiograms.","1191":"Emphasis on hospital mortality as a monitoring tool has raised concerns about the validity of mortality rates as a measure of quality of care. An indepth review of all mortalities at Beth Israel Medical Center was conducted from 1988 through 1993. Clinical issues identified from chart review were referred for departmental physician peer review, and quarterly reports of trends and issues were disseminated to all levels of the institution. Mortality rates declined 21% over the 6 years, from 3.3% to 2.6% of all discharges. Clinical quality issues were identified in less than 3% of all mortalities. The majority of problems were related to delays and appropriateness of treatment (57% of quality issues). The review program identified specific hospital processes for improvement, and, more importantly, created a \"watchful concern\" about quality-of-care issues throughout the hospital.","1192":"This article examines the applicability of a \"report card\" strategy as a means of differentiating among providers on the basis of performance. The specific focus is on the potential effect of differences in data collection processes on the meaningfulness of subsequent comparisons among similar types of providers. Variations in reported nosocomial infection rates are analyzed in light of differences in reported surveillance practices; data for similar nursing units are analyzed as well. Thirty-one rural, rural referral, and urban acute care hospitals in the midwest participated in the study. The reported nosocomial infection rates for different types of nursing units and different hospital groups varied substantially. Likewise, there were marked variations in the nosocomial infection surveillance practices at the hospitals, which were found to explain some of the variation in the reported nosocomial infection rates for specific types of nursing units and nosocomial infections. The study conclude that differences in data collection processes may result in incorrect conclusions about differences in the quality of care provided by various providers.","1193":"This article reviews the definitions and principles that should guide the use of control charts in healthcare quality. Several examples from the literature are used to illustrate significant problems and issues in control chart construction.","1194":"For the past 3 years, the nursing case management team at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY, has been involved in a project to implement more than 50 clinical pathways, which provide a written \"time line\" for clinical events that should occur during a patient's hospital stay. A major objective of this project was to evaluate the efficacy of these pathways with respect to a number of important outcomes, such as length of stay, hospital costs, quality of patient care, and nursing and patient satisfaction. This article discusses several statistics-related issues in the design and evaluation of such case management studies. In particular, the role of a research approach in implementing and evaluating hospital programs, the choice of a comparison (control) group, the exclusion of selected patients from analysis, and the problems of equating pathways with diagnosis-related groups are addressed.","1195":"","1196":"The healthcare industry is under mounting pressure to cut costs without reducing the quality and quantity of healthcare services.

It also addresses the fact that membership in a CHIN, if not controlled, greatly increases legal risks. Details on how many of these risks can be minimized or avoided are provided.","1197":"The quality of healthcare services is as much a matter of perception as of hard clinical data. Therefore, to improve quality, it is necessary to understand the way in which customers perceive, rank, and weigh the variety of elements that make up this elusive attribute. Otherwise, the management of quality becomes a hit-or-miss affair, with misses more likely than hits. Thus, a proper framework for quality management must include a profound understanding of the customer's \"dimensions of quality.\" This article offers an approach for developing such an understanding.","1198":"Reengineering provides the means to radically affect the way in which services are provided and results in significant change within an organization.

As organizations reengineer to reduce costs and change the way in which services are delivered, it is critical that decisions about reengineering be communicated throughout the entire service-delivery enterprise. There must be a framework to provide a common ground for change. The process approach to delivering service provides the greatest opportunity for organizations to achieve their goals to facilitate care, achieve the best patient outcomes, and deliver services on time and at the right price. Processes that are built around core competencies and that address customer needs are the most successful. Organizations that adopt a common framework built around the delivery of patient care and the patient care process can establish a common frame of reference for the entire organization and therefore can enhance the delivery of service for their patients and achieve organization-wide commitment to common goals.","1202":"Reengineering has become a fact of life for all professionals in the healthcare industry.

Using the CPI format, a team of healthcare professionals selected the management of the asthma patient as a project. The team's goals were to evaluate current practice patterns, review and recommend practice guidelines, recommend indicators to monitor patient outcomes and changes in practice patterns, and provide recommendations for implementing educational activities. A survey mailed to primary care physicians and selected specialists (allergists and pulmonologists) was used to determine present methods of managing asthma. A patient outcomes survey tool was piloted as part of the CPI process. The pilot indicated that this tool was appropriate for use in physician offices for both longitudinal and aggregate analysis of asthma patient outcomes. Patient and provider educational materials were developed and disseminated to providers.","1209":"It is recognized that in primary care, the staff is at the heart of the healing community. Primary care, which recognizes the wholeness of patients, cannot be successful unless the organizational culture also recognizes the wholeness of the staff.

Prior to 1994, Joint Commission standards required all healthcare disciplines to instruct their patients about issues relevant to their health. There was no requirement that the information that was given to patients by providers in various disciplines, units, or clinics be coordinated. Now that education is a functional chapter in the Joint Commission's Accreditation Manual for Hospitals, an integrated approach to providing such education is necessary. This article proposes a theoretical model intended to help medical centers meet the new standards, improve patient education, and improve communication among healthcare providers.","1220":"The education of patients and their families can support positive patient healthcare outcomes. Patient and family education is an essential component of the healthcare delivery process, but it often is fragmented, with individual disciplines providing information without coordination. At the Carl T. Hayden VA Medical Center in Phoenix, AZ, a team reviewed the facility's process for providing patient education. As a result of this review, interdisciplinary process and documentation forms that improved both the quality of education provided and the documentation of that education in the medical record were developed.","1221":"A California hospital developed a program to better serve and satisfy its customers. This article details the hospital's plan to implement the program with the collection and use of data to measure success, promote staff accountability, and, ultimately, demonstrate improved customer satisfaction as measured by fewer complaints. The various activities initiated to promote staff education and recognize employees also are briefly addressed.","1222":"The mental health profession is plagued by the perception that it is a vague, ambiguous, and sometimes ineffective field. A confluence of worldwide megatrends is affecting the mental health and substance abuse delivery system. Two different methods of providing psychiatric clinical care are addressed.","1223":"Case management as a concept of efficiency and effectiveness has demonstrated its applicability in acute care. This article addresses one model of case management that integrates the traditional structure of independently functioning, nonrevenue-producing activities of quality, risk, and utilization management under the comprehensive umbrella of quality resource management. The model transformed existing full-time equivalent services at an acute care hospital in Florida into value-added services on behalf of patients, physicians, the hospital, and payers and presented a practical approach to organizing a case management program. Issues in the transformation process also are addressed.","1224":"In summary, there are no quick or easy guidelines for maintaining and protecting confidentiality and avoiding discovery. It appears that managers who are responsible for information that is at risk will have to make an extra effort to learn not only their own state laws, but also the laws of any other states their facility or corporation might do business in. Close contact with the organization's attorney certainly enhances the ability to stay on top of the issues as healthcare delivery systems change.","1225":"Historically, employers have asked health plans to measure performance in terms of quality, utilization, satisfaction, and cost. As organizations collected these data, employers realized that rarely were all the data comparable. Several employers, such as Xerox Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Bull HN Information Systems, Inc., agreed to work together to create reporting criteria that would standardize measurement. This collaboration resulted in the Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) criteria. This article reviews some of the implementation issues and decisions that a plan must resolve to gather accurate HEDIS data.","1226":"The search for better ways to deliver healthcare services at lower cost led a group of hospitals in the Carolinas, 2 years ago, to pioneer a new concept, the collaborative group. A collaborative group typically is composed of five or six similar (but not competing) hospitals that work together closely to help each other make the changes necessary to survive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Hospital staff members at all levels are able to work together to discover improvement opportunities through benchmarking teams and networking efforts. This article describes their experiences, achievements, and lessons learned.","1227":"Total quality improvement (TQI) advocates that all staff members in an organization develop their own ideas on job improvement about their own specific jobs. This process helps to improve staff performance and to build continually on those improvements. This article will describe how the TQI process was used successfully by quality management staff members at a federal medical center to investigate a problem with linen.","1228":"The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has made major alterations in its standards and survey process under the Agenda for Change, by emphasizing cross-functional healthcare. The Joint Commission published the changes in its 1994 Accreditation Manual for Hospitals, under which criteria these hospitals were surveyed. Surveyors concentrated on evaluating the following major issues: care of patients, particularly restraint policies and procedures; uniform performance of processes, particularly as related to conscious sedation; staff competency; and process improvement. The authors detail why a thorough, detailed preparation for the document review session is essential for a successful survey.","1229":"A clinical pathway is a comprehensive method of planning, delivering, and monitoring patient care. As efforts continue to streamline the delivery of services at all levels of care and settings, it is essential that quality management and utilization management professionals respond in a proactive manner to facilitate quality outcomes while decreasing cost and increasing efficiency. The use of clinical pathways, as one part of a facility's or an organization's total quality management program, may be the answer to this challenge.","1230":"Clinical pathways are used for planning, coordinating and facilitating the continuum of patient care from before admission to after discharge. They rapidly are changing the provision of healthcare services through improved patient care and cost containment, but they also have raised questions about possible legal ramifications. If sound policies and procedures for clinical pathways are developed and consistently adhered to by healthcare facilities, the potential for liability may be minimized while patient care is improved. This article describes a multidisciplinary task force's work to develop such policies and procedures.","1231":"Bon Secours Hospital, a 304-bed community hospital in Grosse Pointe, MI, decided to target high-volume and high-cost DRGs for clinical process improvement. Working collaboratively with members of the medical staff, the cardiac team set out to improve outcomes by reducing the non-value-added costs and the variations in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). A comprehensive program of care for these patients, that included the full continuum of care, from prevention to maintenance, is being developed, using a clinical pathway to manage the acute phase of treatment.","1232":"Clinical paths can help caregivers \"do the right thing the first time\" for the individual patient. They also can help to continually improve the system of providing care for future patients. By comparing what should be happening (according to the clinical path) with what actually is happening, the healthcare team can design an effective plan for patient care. By gathering data about the patient care experience, the healthcare team can redesign care for future patients. This article describes important concurrent and retrospective activities of path-based patient care and the ways in which healthcare providers are using clinical paths to improve patient outcomes.","1233":"Clinical pathways have long been used as a mechanism for implementing a managed care delivery system. They have been effective in highlighting lengths of stay, outcome variances, and systems problems. Clinical pathways play an important part in enhancing quality improvement activities, especially in accordance with the standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. This article addresses benefits of clinical pathways in general, and benefits at the authors' facility in particular, specifically, a clinical pathway's effectiveness in influencing readmissions of patients with atrial fibrillation.","1234":"Efforts to implement case management and, subsequently, to develop critical paths at Birmingham Baptist Medical Center Montclair in Birmingham, AL, began in the late 1980s. Under the case management system, registered nurses using the CareMap system manage the care of 60-80% of the medical center's patients. Those patients whose care does not follow a map are managed by nurse case managers. The patients who do not meet the identified goals for care require a collaborative effort from all the healthcare professionals associated with their care. Since the inception of the case management program, Montclair has made significant strides in decreasing the cost per discharge, decreasing the variable cost per case, and, most importantly, improving quality outcomes for designated case types.","1235":"This article describes a utilization management advancement system at the authors' facility that recognizes the staff members' levels of utilization management expertise and links them with the annual performance appraisal. After 2 years of brainstorming, analysis, discussion, and research, the utilization management nurses were able to define their practice in terms of functional domains that reflect levels of experience and competencies. The process of developing these levels and the performance appraisal standards is addressed.","1236":"","1237":"","1238":"Like many other healthcare organizations today, the authors' facility, a 306-bed acute care community hospital in Michigan, strives to visualize and make a transition from traditional quality assurance to continuous quality improvement. The Juran Trilogy provided the insight that strategic planning, measurement, and continuous improvement must exist side by side. At the authors' facility, this realization resulted in the hospital quality plan, which treats each of these components as part of the foundation for quality. The authors explain this model and the reporting and communication mechanisms that support it.","1239":"This article details how a software program has helped a hospital collect more Medicare payments for which it was eligible than it previously had collected. The software simplifies the process of selecting complications by reminding the user when no complications have yet been entered, by determining whether each item entered qualifies as a complication, and by suggesting other possibilities. In many instances, these complications are possibilities that a person performing manual coding might not consider.","1240":"The successful implementation of quality improvement (QI) in an organization requires the organization's executives to visibly and consistently demonstrate an understanding of and commitment to QI principles. One means of developing this understanding is to give executives firsthand experience with QI tools and skills. This article details the lessons learned by personnel at a large medical center during the implementation of QI initiatives and highlights some aspects of the role hospital executives must play in achieving QI. Whatever approach an organization chooses for the implementation of QI, the exercise of discipline to do what is right inevitably will lead to the improvement of quality.","1241":"The philosophy of W.E. Deming suggests that continuous quality improvement efforts, when properly applied, ultimately will lead to financial dividends and will help ensure business longevity. Reducing hospital charges can be exciting for the participants and can provide an impetus for expanding quality improvement efforts. Americans, however, tend to demand almost instant gratification and have limited patience for longer-term results. This factor, coupled with minimal knowledge of actual operational costs and inaccurate charge accounting systems, may lead hospital managers to misinterpret the potential net long-term effects of their quality improvement efforts. In the approaching environment of capitated reimbursement, such mistakes may have serious consequences.","1242":"Although nurses constitute the largest single group of healthcare providers in the United States, confusion exists about what nurses actually do. This article provides an overview of the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC), which is the first comprehensive classification of nursing treatments. Quality management professionals will find the NIC useful in designing quality management programs, meeting Joint Commission standards, and planning redesign initiatives.","1243":"Utilization management and discharge planning are two essential functions for all healthcare facilities. In many hospitals, these two jobs are performed by personnel from two separate departments. This article describes the methodology and benefits of a project that combined the functions of utilization management and discharge planning.","1244":"Both state healthcare reform and the market are shrinking the healthcare infrastructure and changing the needs of the workforce. Managed care, in its various forms, generally uses fewer doctors and makes more efficient use of hospitals. This will have a profound effect on medical schools, existing specialties, and underutilized hospitals. After many false starts, Adam Smith's \"invisible hand\" is having its impact. This article explores some of the consequences.","1245":"","1246":"A facility's annual appraisal or report historically has evaluated the traditional quality assurance (QA) role of morbidity and mortality, infection control, tissue review, and medical record data. With the evolution of QA to performance improvement (PI), the traditional annual appraisal has had to expand to address multiple organizational programs, projects, and indicators, as well as the structure and outcome of teams. This article discusses a structure for evaluating various programs and reviewing how well the organization has met its goals.","1247":"Since the mid-1980s, quality management has infused the healthcare industry with a newborn commitment to improving the quality and efficiency of its service delivery processes. Increasing industry competition has served to sharpen the focus on quality. For health services companies such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts, a relative latecomer to the managed care marketplace, the challenges of getting quickly up to speed were significant. This article describes the simultaneous efforts of the company to develop a substantial new presence in the managed care marketplace, while also applying the basic principles of quality assurance and continuous quality improvement to its organizational transformation.","1248":"Healthcare organizations across the United States are embracing the tenets of continuous quality improvement. The challenge is to disseminate information about this quality activity throughout the organization. A monthly newsletter serves two vital purposes: to share the improvements and to generate more enthusiasm and participation by staff members. This article gives practical suggestions for promoting a monthly newsletter. Preparation of an informative newsletter requires a significant investment of time and effort. However, the positive results of providing facilitywide communications can make it worth the effort. The current availability of relatively inexpensive desktop publishing computer software programs has made the process much easier.","1249":"","1250":"Criteria-based project prioritization is key to the rational development of a clinical path program. Implementation education that emphasizes a philosophy of cost-quality balance fosters multidisciplinary participation and program \"rollout,\" or expansion. This article explains the selection of case types based on volume, cost, physician interest, resource use variability, market opportunity, and clinical homogeneity. Also described is how implementation is facilitated by educating physicians, nurses, and other clinicians about the relationship between clinical paths, collaboration, and quality improvement.","1251":"Part 1 of this two-part article addressed the approach and skills needed to gain a clearly defined and agreed-upon direction for the consulting mission. The importance of mental preparation and flexibility was emphasized and a number of ethical dilemmas were reviewed, including confidentiality issues. Part 2 addresses strategies for handling difficult psychological issues that often come up in the process of internal consulting. Transference, resistance, regressions, and counterproductive group dynamics are reviewed. These psychological issues may be the predominant source of stress in an internal consulting experience. Case examples are presented along with some empowering strategies. It is hoped that through this review, the quality professional will be better prepared to meet the exciting and rewarding challenges of internal consulting.","1252":"The rapid pace of change in healthcare has caused critical engineering systems in hospitals and other healthcare facilities systems to be altered and upgraded on a virtually continuous basis. Changes to these systems, which include heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC), medical gases, normal and emergency electrical systems, plumbing, and fire protection systems, often are not properly documented. As a result, healthcare facilities may, over time, be exposed to increased risk. Such a situation compromises an organization's high level of patient and staff safety; it also may cause problems during a Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations review of environment of care. This article outlines seven specific questions safety officers should review to determine if their facility needs a thorough systems assessment.","1253":"Hospitals today are challenged to provide high-quality, high-technology, cost-effective care while maintaining a humanistic approach toward patients and their families. Thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can present challenges to emergency department and critical care nursing staff members. The areas of concomitant medications, screening checklists, associated laboratory studies, and overall time to treatment presented opportunities for improvement at a Florida hospital. The clinical process and the existing quality improvement activities were reviewed by a multidisciplinary continuous quality improvement (CQI) team. The outcomes of the CQI process were extremely favorable; 100% compliance was achieved in all aspects of care for patients with AMI.","1254":"The physicians at Methodist Hospitals of Memphis have designed a program of resource management that has resulted in significant patient care cost savings while maintaining an excellent quality of care. The program combines methods of increasing physician awareness of cost issues, sharing physician utilization and quality data with them, and coordinating patient care through the use of multidisciplinary clinical pathways and case management. Our physicians, patients, nursing staff, and quality management personnel are enthusiastic about the program's positive effect on costs and improved quality patient care.","1255":"Peer review is an essential mechanism for evaluating the judgment and performance of clinical providers. Reasons for conducting physician peer review range from identified quality-of-care concerns to general education. There are a variety of challenges to conducting an effective peer review, including the personal concerns of the peers conducting the reviews. This article reviews the potential uses of physician peer review, its basic methodologies, and challenges to and suggestions for obtaining effective peer review.","1256":"Patient outcomes...indicators..measurement. What do these concepts mean to you? More importantly, what do they mean to our customers, the patients? The department of nursing at the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) embarked on a 6-month initiative to begin to identify the major outcome indicators of nursing practice. This article will discuss the outcome indicator project from its inception to the identification of the actual outcome indicators. The rationale for undertaking this project and the process of selecting the indicators also will be addressed.","1257":"","1258":"Expertise in quality and process improvement is becoming widely recognized as a valuable resource. The more objective viewpoint and experience of consulting firms or outside professionals in quality and change management often is critical to the success of organization-wide quality or change implementation. Outside consultants, however, are not inexpensive. It is predictable that there will be an increasing tendency for healthcare systems to look internally for organizational and quality expertise. Part one of this article discusses the approach and skills needed to gain a clearly defined and agreed-upon direction for the consulting mission. The importance of mental preparation and flexibility is discussed. Ethical dilemmas are a core challenge, and a number of real-life scenarios and associated strategies are presented.","1259":"A multidisciplinary continuous quality improvement (CQI) team at the authors' facility was commissioned and empowered to study and improve communication among the disciplines involved in discharge planning. CQI methods and tools were applied to analyze the process and determine the improvement. The authors of this article describe the use of a customized electronic medical record system to deliver accurate, rapid technology (DART) at their facility. DART was programmed to improve communication among the disciplines by assisting with the referral process. In addition, users are systematically prompted throughout the discharge process to ensure that all aspects are considered and documented.","1260":"IMPACT CARE is the Morton Plant Mease Health Care's internally developed quality measurement tool designed to implement an integrated quality assessment\/quality improvement system. IMPACT CARE enables work groups to measure all aspects of performance from a total quality management (TQM) perspective and at the same time meet Joint Commission requirements. The IMPACT CARE format works equally well for the medical staff and for clinical and nonclinical departments throughout the health system. This article relates process improvements that have been made at Morton Plant Mease Health Care since 1992 as a result of using IMPACT CARE.","1261":"Reports of abuse, both domestic and institutional, are increasingly common. A myriad of statutes and rules govern when and how incidents of abuse are reported. It is incumbent upon medical centers to establish policies that clearly outline the responsibility of all staff members to identify and report suspected abuse and neglect. This article presents a summary of a comprehensive hospital policy on identifying and responding to all types of suspected or witnessed abuse and neglect of patients. It also illustrates how multidisciplinary teams and flowcharts can be useful in developing and implementing policy in complicated areas that involve many players, rules, and regulations.","1262":"This second part of a two-part article follows Cape Canaveral Hospital's first continuous quality improvement team through the processes of goal setting, system analysis, data gathering, and problem resolution in the area of patients' assignment to observation status. The team's primary goal was data-driven improvement. As detailed here, the team's solution to improve the use of observation status is both time-efficient and offers opportunities for financial gain.","1263":"The Sisters of Charity Health Care Systems, Inc., (SCHCS) developed methods to collect more than 290 data elements from its 15 hospitals to measure community benefit, illness prevention, patient satisfaction, severity of illness, appropriateness, traditional quality measures, outcome measures, maternal\/child services, psychiatric services, efficiency, financial performance, and risk management. The data were compiled to produce a report card called the Hospital Quality Profile, which SCHCS hospitals now use for strategic quality planning, assessment, and monitoring. Collaboration between quality management, information systems, and financial department personnel is critical to the success of such a quality database.","1264":"This article reviews the structural changes of the Joint Commission's accreditation manual and relates how organizations can provide documentation that illustrates departmental, team, or hospital-wide efforts to improve quality. The tools reviewed in this article capture systematic performance improvement across functions and departments and include team activity. The tools also can be used as reporting documents to the governing body.","1265":"The reform movement in healthcare is occurring in response to financial pressures on American business. The trend toward managed care with competition-based discounting and capitation contracts is likely to continue even if Congress does not enact healthcare reform legislation. Efficient management of resources with acceptable outcomes and customer satisfaction is becoming increasingly crucial. As cost-shifting options are reduced, accurate knowledge and management of resource consumption costs become critical to enable hospitals to assume the financial risks associated with competing in any future capitation area. Hospitals must consider altering their approach to utilization management and business as usual to survive these changes.","1266":"In this second part of a two-part article, the author describes more of the common loss exposures seen in the obstetrical areas of healthcare organizations. Topics discussed include vaginal birth after cesarean section, birth plans, and nursery security. The author addresses each subject from the risk management perspective and suggests industry methods for mitigating or preventing losses in obstetrical care.","1267":"","1268":"This first part of a two-part article describes the process of making the theory of continuous quality improvement a reality. The successes, the failures, and the struggles of the first team effort are outlined. The evolution of the team approach is captured from the perspectives of the quality directors, the facilitator, and the team leader. The team project discussed in this article focused on inpatient admissions and the assignment of patients to observation status.","1269":"By using registered nurse quality service analysts (RN-QSAs), the United States Air Force Medical Center in Wiesbaden, Germany, which closed in 1993, reduced physician reviews of medical records in 1991-1992 to only the records that did not meet the preestablished screening criteria. The authors relate how the screening of records by RN-QSAs increased the number of records reviewed, reduced the number of people reviewing records, established the quality services department as a repository of patient care information, and markedly improved the quantity, quality, and reproducibility of patient care reviews.","1270":"The goal to decrease cost while improving efficiency and quality of service is a driving force in healthcare today. By redesigning and reassigning work, Poudre Valley Hospital was able to achieve this goal. This article describes the process of restructuring a central housekeeping department into patient care areas, the redistribution of work, and the outcomes that were achieved.","1271":"Quality monitoring in a small rural hospital is a challenge on many fronts. The case study presented here illustrates a quality monitoring failure and analyzes the contributing factors. Based on their experience, the authors suggest methods to improve small rural hospital quality monitoring.","1272":"Most medical facilities' leaders are concerned with satisfying the patients who use their healthcare organization. Whereas many facilities have identified specific individuals whose job it is to hear patient complaints, the authors promote the view that all staff members play important roles in patient advocacy. Management's role is to determine how to collect and analyze the complaints and suggestions voiced by patients throughout their healthcare experience. This article presents one method.","1273":"The National Naval Medical Center (NNMC) provides care and services to approximately 16,800 inpatients and 576,000 outpatients annually. In an era of healthcare reform, effective cost containment is crucial, and healthcare organizations can ill afford wasteful practices. To optimize its organizational effectiveness, NNMC adopted a philosophy of total quality management. This article chronicles the work of a team whose efforts resulted in improvements that resulted in a significant cost savings to the hospital that have been sustained over time.","1274":"","1275":"","1276":"The proportions of patients undergoing a given procedure or experiencing a specific health outcome often are important in studies of healthcare quality. Run charts are a nonstatistical method for evaluating changes in these proportions or rates over time. Simple epidemiological methods for comparing rates between two groups allow statistical comparison of rates between two time periods. The chi-square test measures the statistical significance of differences in rates between two groups. Practical aspects of the use of these statistics and interpretation of their results are discussed and illustrated in this article, with realistic examples originally prepared by the author for a drug usage evaluation study. Readers with appropriate software and hardware may request a simple spreadsheet from the author to calculate many of the analyses described in the article.","1277":"Dedicated quality professionals are tired of quick fixes, Band-Aids, and other first-aid strategies that offer only temporary relief of nagging problems rather than a long-term cure. Implementing strategies that can produce permanent solutions to crucial problems is a challenge confronted by organizations striving for continuous performance improvement. One vehicle, driven by data and customer requirements, that can help to solve problems and sustain success over time is the storyboard. This article illustrates the use of the storyboard as the framework for reducing length of stay--one of the most important problems facing healthcare organizations today.","1278":"Obtaining physician commitment to and continued involvement in quality assessment activities can be difficult. Some physicians view quality assessment as a bureaucratic morass that fails to improve patient care. However, by combining quality assessment and clinical research, insight into practice patterns can be obtained and physicians might be more likely to express interest in quality assessment issues. We reviewed medical records of patients at our hospital on peritoneal dialysis (PD) to determine the rate of free air found in normal PD patients. This was compared to PD patients with known gastrointestinal perforation; free intra-abdominal air has been described as a sign of gastrointestinal perforation. Documentation of free air and its significance in radiology reports were noted. Fifty-nine of 59 (100%) cases had available radiology reports. Documentation of free air was present in only 5 of 23 (22%) cases, and its significance was noted in the same 5 of 23 (22%). These results were communicated within the hospital, and a subsequent improvement in free-air detection, documentation, and reporting--both oral and written--was noted by the clinical service. The documentation of radiological findings is a frequently used monitor in radiology quality assessment. Our study identified a clinical and documentation problem, quantified the deficiency, and took steps toward improvement while simultaneously performing clinical research. We conclude that quality assessment and clinical research can coexist and serve to improve clinical practice while encouraging physician involvement in quality assessment programs.","1279":"Collaborative interdisciplinary patient care is enhanced as healthcare professionals in special care units work to implement Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' standards for improving organizational performance. This second part of a two-part article provides a practical approach to developing a process action team to review the care of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. As a follow-up to the development of one special care unit committee, this was an important step in the transition from multidisciplinary, discipline-specific care to interdisciplinary, collaborative care.","1280":"Sixteen hospitals from the Northeastern New York Hospital Council tested the theory that clinical pathways are an essential component of the integrated quality assessment process. Clinical pathways served as a transition to the holistic, process-oriented approach of quality improvement. The clinical pathways that they developed included preadmission, hospitalization, and postdischarge care needs. Respect and trust established among the hospitals in the consortium were evidenced by the cooperation and collaboration of the participating hospitals. This regional approach to care resulted in increased patient and staff satisfaction, positive patient outcomes, and a decrease in length of stay.","1281":"The need to meet customers' expectations is one of the driving forces in healthcare today. Organizations can achieve this goal most effectively by using rational and systematic problem-solving approaches. This article describes systems theory as a problem-solving method that analyzes and implements customer satisfaction data to produce the desired result of increased customer satisfaction levels and economic growth.","1282":"","1283":"For the task of monitoring a process, detecting change, and making correct attributions on a continuous basis, there is no better tool than the control chart, particularly where the data set is large and permits subgrouping. By using this technique, staff will get quicker answers or will have a smaller data requirement, and will arrive at more valid conclusions than with the two-sample method. (The two-sample approach is typically used when the data are not produced or collected in sequence is unknown. This, however, may reflect a weakness in the data collection process.) In addition, we believe that the control chart approach is as simple as the two-sample approach. Once the control limits and zones are established, the plot of points can be maintained by personnel who need to do no more than plot a rate on a weekly (or a daily) basis. The control chart rules properly focus laboratory and QA personnel on change. Control chart procedures are statistical tests of special cause and need no further significance tests. Those using control charts need to be aware of three important points: 1. Control limits are not standards or thresholds and cannot be derived from these concepts. Control limits are a statement about the current natural variation in the process. 2. The type of chart to be used should depend upon the type of data being evaluated. (Finison et al., 1993).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1284":"Quality improvement (QI) activities in special care units can serve as a model of interdisciplinary problem identification and resolution for organizations that are moving from service-specific QI activities to organizational-wide activities. The transition from distinct unit-based QI activities to an interdisciplinary collaborative model at the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Administration Medical Center began with recognition of problems that were identified during a Joint Commission survey of the special care units. Process improvements were made that resulted in improved interdisciplinary collaboration between the special care units, and a successful follow-up Joint Commission survey.","1285":"Continuous quality improvement (CQI) is vitally important to professionals in the field of healthcare quality. Many of us have met the challenge and have successfully introduced CQI principles to the employees in our hospitals. However, physicians, who play a key role in our hospitals, have not, for the most part, been directly involved in hospitals' organizational education efforts. This article focuses on involving physicians in the CQI process. It explains the approaches that were used to inform them about CQI principles, to encourage their feedback, and to elicit their participation in the hospitalwide quality improvement program.","1286":"This article discusses the implications of designing a comprehensive competency assessment program for healthcare providers. Increased liability for providers, institutions, and liability carriers is providing the impetus for change. Current methods to evaluate competency are limited; most methods include requirements that simply validate licensure and credentials. This article discusses the literature that supports methods for evaluating competency by assessing skills and proctoring. The author proposes a three-part model to ensure that competency assessment and performance improvement is the mainstay of an organization's quality management program. The model includes (a) a skills assessment inventory, (b) a standards review to promote compliance, and (c) a peer review program. Included are samples from two comprehensive skills inventories designed for orientations for physicians and nurses.","1287":"In 1990, The Memorial Hospital at Easton, Maryland, Inc., a not-for-profit 183-bed rural community hospital, recognized a need to explore alternative patient care methods or approaches to improve the continuity of care, focus on healthier patient outcomes, and contain costs. The concept of collaborative care became the focus for patient care delivery. Multidisciplinary teams were established to coordinate patient care activities for patient populations process. Plans of care, referred to as critical pathways, identify intermediate goals and interventions, providing guidance for the patient, family, and healthcare providers as they work to achieve quality outcomes. As the patient progresses along the critical pathway, variances from the established goals are monitored and become the focus of quality reviews.","1288":"","1289":"Quality improvement tools that integrate clinical and financial data provide a statistical basis for quality planning and cost containment. Clinical path development results in an operational guideline for optimizing quality and efficiency. Implementation provides the means for delivering value. This article describes a step-by-step process in which quality improvement tools were used to develop a pediatric femur fracture clinical path at the author's hospital.","1290":"","1291":"The quality movement in healthcare is here to stay. Total quality management (TQM) and continuous quality improvement (CQI) approaches are no longer considered fads or transitory trends; they are being woven into the very fabric of hospital operations. What has been unclear, however, is the extent to which the underlying TQM\/CQI philosophy, tools, and techniques are being implemented and whether hospitals are noticeably changing as a result of TQM\/CQI programs. The results of a study of 14 rehabilitation hospitals indicate that the rehabilitation setting is a natural one for TQM\/CQI but that these settings are just beginning to implement the needed structures and processes and to use the relevant tools and techniques.","1292":"Medical care systems must demonstrate that they provide cost-effective, quality care if they are to remain viable in the wake of healthcare reform. A basic premise of continuous quality improvement is that an organization can measure and improve the performance of key functions (a group of goal-directed processes). Accordingly, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has been restructuring its accreditation manual, moving from department-specific standards to functional standards. In early 1992, our hospital began reporting quality improvement data by key functions rather than by service. As a result of this change, departments communicated and worked together better and more interdisciplinary efforts occurred, resulting in some dramatic improvements in the quality of care.","1293":"The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires medical staff members to provide effective mechanisms to monitor and evaluate the quality of patient care and to improve organizational performance. Many healthcare facilities choose to meet this requirement through structured committees such as those on surgical case review, blood usage, medical record review, and pharmacy and therapeutics. This article describes a streamlined alternative to medical staff committees and explains how intensive and screening evaluations can be improved by using the most significant data.","1294":"The Joint Commission requirements have had a major impact on both the delivery and evaluation of nursing care in hospitals. This article discusses changes in the Joint Commission nursing care standards from 1953 through 1991 and the relationship between the Joint Commission and organized nursing.","1295":"Preparations for Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) surveys are rarely described in the literature. This article is intended to provide much-needed information on survey preparation processes, not only to Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, but also to all hospitals undergoing surveys of biopsychosocial delivery of care. Beginning in 1995, JCAHO will apply biopsychosocial reviews to all assessments of patients. Facilities whose preparations include those detailed in this article will be better prepared for such reviews.","1296":"Over the past decade, public and private healthcare organizations across the United States have been struggling to implement the principles of total quality management to improve service delivery and operating efficiency. Despite large investments in time and money, these organizations often are disappointed with the return on investment. This article argues that by failing to apply a systems perspective to organizational change efforts, well-intentioned executive staff members and training professionals unknowingly collaborate to ensure the failure of the quality initiative they hope will create a more effective and efficient organization.","1297":"","1298":"Medication administration and the prevention of medication errors have been identified by quality management professionals and consumers alike as an area of healthcare that needs quality improvement. A proactive multi-disciplinary approach taken by nursing and pharmacy at the author's acute care teaching hospital has resulted in a significant improvement in the medication administration process and in reduced medication errors. Improved quality data management resulted in more effective action planning. The reporting format of medication errors was changed based on trends, and severity evaluation was implemented. System problems were more easily identified due to increased information about the medication errors. As a result, staff education and training could be more specific, and thus, more meaningful. Additionally, jointly developed quality management studies provided the foundation for effective improvement strategies and efficient system changes.","1299":"As the trend toward ambulatory care increases, the infection control practitioner's (ICP) role and responsibilities in this setting are continually expanding. Implementation of mandated governmental regulations, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Bloodborne Pathogen Standard, has markedly increased the ICP's workload. Analysis reveals that much of the ICP's time is being spent on clerical tasks that encompass a variety of nonclinical functions. Clerical support would allow the ICP to use his or her time to implement essential components of an infection control program in the most cost-effective manner.","1300":"The center of attention in recent nursing literature has been on the evolution of outcome-based care. This concept has emerged as an array of models that includes patient-focused care, case management, and managed care. All these approaches to redesigning patient care have a basic goal: to deliver quality care in a timely manner by using appropriate resources. The program at St. Margaret Mercy Healthcare Centers focused on the staff nurse as the multidisciplinary team member who would be responsible for coordinating patient care. This type of model, in which the pathway is initiated at the staff level, is called managed care. Managed care, as defined by Zander, is unit-based care that is organized to achieve specific patient outcomes within fiscally responsible time frames or lengths of stay (LOS) while using resources that are appropriate in amount and sequence to the specific case type and to the individual patient (1988a).","1301":"In today's healthcare marketplace, leadership requires more than the delivery of technologically sophisticated patient care. Leadership can be accomplished only by an organization energized with a mission that focuses on providing high-quality, technologically sophisticated, and cost-effective primary healthcare. The paradigm shift to total quality management at the authors' not-for-profit community hospital involved not only the adoption of the philosophy, tools, and techniques espoused by quality experts, but also a restructuring of the organization from a hierarchical format to one focused on the patient.","1302":"Continuous quality improvement (CQI) methodology is predicated on data-based decision making, using both statistical and nonstatistical data tools. The current generation of commercially available quality management computer software does not integrate the basic CQI tools. A variety of off-the-shelf programs can be used to supplement the resource needs of CQI methodology.","1303":"Issues of quality pervade American society. Demands for accountability for the quality of and the resources utilized in delivering healthcare services are coming from consumer advocacy groups, regulatory agencies, third-party payers, and corporate purchasers of healthcare. To date, institutions of higher education do not consistently offer either adequate or coordinated programs to prepare healthcare professionals to assume the regulator role. Promoting quality is both a mandate and a legacy, and each professional will need to be involved to ensure continuing quality care for consumers. Active collaboration between academic, service, and professional organizations, as well as a strong commitment to the development and timely implementation of a suitable curriculum, are imperative.","1304":"","1305":"Six decades of studies on healthcare quality have persisted in rendering the subject difficult to understand or explain to health researchers and policymakers. This article advances three hypotheses about why quality in healthcare is such an enigma. The first concerns problems with the conceptualization of quality. Issues of uncertainty embedded in quality are discussed in the second hypothesis. Finally, difficulties in understanding quality are discussed within a model offered by the sociology of deviance. The article highlights the contribution of each hypothesis and integrates them into a plausible explanatory framework for quality's elusive comprehensibility.","1306":"Quality management (QM), utilization management, and risk management each evolved in response to different external demands. Practices that evolved in response to the real or perceived influences of accreditors, regulators, and payers may be easier to modify if we understand their origins and can identify why those practices are or are not warranted in today's environment. Also, if an individual works exclusively in one of the three traditional areas of quality (QM, utilization management, and risk management), history provides insight into the demands faced by individuals working in the other two areas. Finally, history should be of interest as we prepare for another wave of healthcare reform, which may result in additional changes in our QM organizational structures. This article traces the roots of quality management, utilization management, and risk management for their impact on the organizational structure of hospitals, and summarizes the most common current design variations employed for different situations.","1307":"The Harvard Community Health Plan commissioned a cross-functional project team to improve the accuracy of the members' data base because inaccurate patient phone numbers and addresses were a major obstacle for clinicians seeking to provide high-quality service to patients. Accurate demographic information is essential to enable clinicians to contact patients quickly regarding lab results or follow-up care. The team members applied a quality improvement problem-solving methodology that required them to focus on the few vital problems and to test problems using data analysis. As a result, the team saw firsthand that staff members were not to blame for the inaccurate demographic information; the problem was in the automated system that obtains, updates, and maintains the records.","1308":"A simple method to calculate statistically significant differences between proportions is presented to evaluate changes in quality assessment and utilization data. The authors believe that this calculation could be a valuable analytic method for evaluating changes in monitored criteria, particularly in the assessment of criteria measuring high-volume events.","1309":"As healthcare providers, nurses in an acute care setting have the opportunity to review and evaluate the impact of their care delivery. The orthopedic nursing staff at a not-for-profit tertiary care community hospital in Michigan decided to undertake this challenge when they began to pursue a quality management (QM) review of patients admitted to their unit. The QM study targeted the elective surgical candidate admitted for a lumbar decompression with spinal fusion. The quality care issue focused on the complication known as an abdominal ileus. Two basic questions helped the staff to establish the indicators within this project: (1) what common variables could be measured within the high-risk patient population, and (2) by assessing these variables within the plan of care, could a link or association be made to reduce the incidence of the ileus complication?","1310":"A total quality management (TQM) plan has been instituted by the United States Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base. To determine the feasibility of implementing the same basic TQM plan in a district hospital, a joint industry-government team was established. Five areas of concentration were selected for review: infrastructure, methodology, training, strategic plan, and a \"Quality Bill of Rights.\" The TQM \"infrastructure\" is intended to match and complement the existing organizational structure and chain of command, not to supplant it. As the overall plan seemed well-adapted for implementation in a hospital setting, a three-phase implementation approach was identified that included conceptual planning, initial training and goal setting, and full-scale implementation. Each phase is described in terms of objectives, staffing, and timing requirements.","1311":"","1312":"Quality improvement (QI) monitoring of universal precautions at the author's facility appeared to indicate that although personal protective equipment is always available and staff are increasingly aware of the need to protect themselves, compliance with medical center practices remained inconsistent. The use, throughout the QI program at the medical center, of appropriate indicators to monitor for sharps incidents and body fluid splashes continues to highlight the need for innovative activities to help staff achieve more optimal compliance with medical center policies. Causes for noncompliance are examined using a problem-solving approach accompanied by various continuous quality improvement (CQI) tools. Root causes are explored with the intention of providing support rather than blame for the findings. Outcomes of activities that were implemented to improve compliance with medical center policies and practices are highlighted.","1313":"Improvements in the healthcare delivery system cannot be sustained over time until quality improvement (QI) methods and techniques are widespread and completely understood. The professional disciplines of quality assurance and continuous quality improvement (CQI) can work synergistically to produce the desired outcomes needed in today's highly competitive healthcare industry.","1314":"Quality improvement (QI) is a practice now expected of the healthcare industry. The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations has incorporated continuous QI into its standards; furthermore, the implementation of QI is a major challenge facing healthcare institutions today. The authors describe the educational approach taken by one institution as it implemented the QI process in a facility that recently merged three acute care hospitals and explain the necessary commitment and structure for a successful QI program. The importance of the educational process cannot be overemphasized.","1315":"Total quality management (TQM) has the potential to help medical practices in the transition to a healthcare system that is more demanding in terms of both higher quality and lower cost. Incorporation of TQM principles, however, must be based on creating skills in the areas of teamwork, communication, and problem solving. The potential gain will be seen in improved patient satisfaction, increased revenue as a result of more accurate billing, clearer understanding of costs and outcomes, better clinical documentation, and enhanced staff productivity.","1316":"Health maintenance organizations (HMO)s are taking center stage in our nation's move toward healthcare reform. Issues such as quality, cost, and access to healthcare are critical to consumers; the managed care industry provides care at a significantly more affordable cost than does traditional fee-for-service medicine. Although national surveys show that HMO members are extremely satisfied with the level of service and care they receive, managed care organizations still strive to demonstrate their commitment to quality. As healthcare industry leaders and major customer groups attempt to establish measurable performance standards, the emergence of the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) has enhanced the ability of managed care organizations (MCOs) to demonstrate excellence by way of accreditation.","1317":"Care planning continues to be be an integral part of nursing, yet it is often criticized by professionals as time-consuming, repetitious, and inconsistent. This problematic situation prompted the development and implementation of an interdisciplinary automated care-planning system that interfaces with a preexisting data base. The advantages of the system include standardization of care, consolidated documentation, provision of patient education tools, shared responsibility during the patient's length of stay, and minimal cost. Evaluation of the system demonstrated quality improvement in the documentation of patient education and compliance in meeting JCAHO nursing process standards.","1318":"","1319":"Health policy is increasingly shaped by national, state, and local public advisory committees. Health professionals selected to serve on these committees must be prepared to deal not only with considerable amounts of data, but also with widely varying interpretations of those data. In addition, they must be prepared to deal with different political and personal perspectives, including those of nonhealth professionals. The successful management of that broad range of professional and cultural diversity affects the extent to which different perspectives are successfully integrated into final committee recommendations. This article offers suggestions to future advisory committee members on facilitating effective healthcare policy formulation.","1320":"A national survey of hospital patient representatives was conducted to identify and analyze basic demographic and occupational data for patient representatives. A total of 387 randomly selected U.S. hospitals were surveyed with a response rate of 66% (256 hospitals). Only 172 responses were completed appropriately. Of those who responded appropriately, we found the typical patient representative to be a female between 30 and 50 years old, with a bachelor's degree and about 6 years of experience as a patient representative. The majority of the respondents held a positive view of their role as the liaison between the patient and the administration as well as a facilitator for patients, families, staff, and administration problem solving. Several of the respondents stated that patient representatives strive to meet the needs and expectations of patients through their role as liaison with the administration. This role has a positive and crucial impact on improving the quality of care in healthcare organizations.","1321":"This is the second part of a 2-part article. In part I, the author provided an overview of HMO laws, including the application of statutes and regulations. In part II, the author focuses on liability theories against HMOs and defense theories in their favor. All of the \"traditional\" theories apply in addition to new ones, resulting in evolving laws that are challenging for the risk manager.","1322":"Quality assessment\/quality management and quality improvement are two highly visible areas that are helping to change the healthcare system in the 1990s. In this article, the authors describe how quality improvement can enhance the current quality assessment\/quality management program in a hospital.","1323":"As the cost of healthcare has increased and the treatment time for chronic mental health problems has shortened, a gap in service of continuing care programs was identified by staff at a Veterans Administration (VA) hospital in Texas. The continuing care programs were already established in a facility some distance away from the referring hospital. The program that was developed focused efforts toward establishment of an intrahospital and interfacility network to provide maximum rehabilitation for veterans at reduced cost.","1324":"","1325":"Collaborative care is a system of patient care delivery that focuses on the achievement of outcomes within effective and appropriate time frames and resources. It addresses the entire episode of illness, bridging all clinical settings in which the patient receives care. Through the collaborative efforts of multiple caregivers, a plan of medical care is mapped out that results in a clinical path. The clinical path can improve satisfaction levels for patients, nurses, rehabilitation staff, and physicians by establishing a method of reinforcement for everyone involved in efficient delivery of care.","1326":"In an HMO's defense against a medical malpractice lawsuit, a risk manager faces questions and issues which are different from those raised in the defense of a traditional healthcare provider. While many of the established issues apply, there are also new statutes, regulations, and case decisions that are unique to HMOs. The result is a new and rapidly changing field. This is the first of a 2-part article.","1327":"Physicians are becoming increasingly aware of how their practice patterns affect the financial viability of their practices and of the hospitals in which they work. Programs of diagnosis-related group (DRG) analysis may be used not only to educate physicians but to provide data for physician-directed efforts to reduce variations in practice patterns and deal with physicians whose practice habits may be counter to cost-effective, high-quality care. A combination of early, extensive physician involvement and subsequent multidisciplinary interaction will ensure the development of and adherence to cost-effective, high-quality patient care.","1328":"This article focuses on hip fractures and their treatment. The common problem of hip fractures is examined demographically and in terms of its impact on healthcare costs. The use of quality assessment and improvement techniques in SNF-based physical therapy clinics is proposed as a tool to improve treatment outcomes.","1329":"The following article describes a quality improvement survey that examined the role nurses, patients, and patients' families expect the hospital chaplain to play when they use the chaplain's services. The results of the questionnaire suggest that patients and nurses sometimes see the role of the chaplain differently. There are times when nurses readily call a chaplain to help with a problem on a unit. There are other times when nurses are reluctant to ask for the chaplain, but patients would be most appreciative of the chaplain's presence. This article explores these situations and gives suggestions for ways to use a chaplain's expertise more effectively.","1330":"Hospital governing boards should be regularly and adequately informed of the important aspects of care rendered in their institutions. Such information must be provided in a concise and logical format that is easily understood by lay trustees and useful to their efforts to provide the most efficient, safest, and highest-quality care possible. This article offers a proposal for presenting quality information to hospital boards.","1331":"Recognition of patients' rights is growing in the healthcare field in this country, as is recognition of the need for advance directives. Advance directives are documents that indicate treatment choices and preferences made by an individual while he or she is still competent. Through the use of continuous quality improvement (CQI) tools and the development of a CQI team, the author's facility was able to implement the important process of having patients complete advance directives.","1332":"Each year, hospitals are provided data on actual and predicted mortality rates for their Medicare patients. This article explains how the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) calculates the actual and predicted death rates, gives details on a method by which hospitals can determine if their actual death rates are significantly better or worse than HCFA's predicted death rates, and suggests a strategy for identifying opportunities for improvement when actual mortality rates are significantly different from predicted rates.","1333":"","1334":"Due to the potential for increased HIV and hepatitis B transmission to all healthcare workers, the regulations and guidelines set forth by federal, state, and local government agencies for the prevention of these diseases and the protection of those in the healthcare industry are constantly updated. Because of the magnitude of these demands, the role of the infection control nurse (ICN) has become vitally important. The proper utilization of valuable staff resources will be a positive force in promoting the necessary quality of care to employers, employees, and clients. With the dedication of personnel who assist in the essential infection control function, the ICN can maximize protection of the clients and the staff by reducing their exposure to HIV and hepatitis B.","1335":"Quality management professionals confront the challenge of motivating others to participate in the improvement of patient care. Producing this motivation frequently proves problematic. This article addresses the issue of motivation by presenting it as a process. Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs functions as the foundation of the process. A process model is used to demonstrate that satisfaction of the higher-level needs of esteem and self-actualization is required to produce true motivation. By understanding the process of motivation, we may become more effective in improving patient care.","1336":"Workers' compensation insurance carriers are becoming aware of the potentially high cost of physical therapy. Utilization management of outpatient physical therapy by means of a precertification process is a relatively new development in workers' compensation. Physical therapy treatment plans are reviewed by peers to ensure that proposed care is appropriate and cost-effective and that past care has resulted in measurable, objective, functional progress. Treatment plans are thus either certified or noncertified, or changes are negotiated. Ongoing care is monitored to facilitate the patient's progress through appropriate phases of physical therapy toward \"maximum medical improvement.\"","1337":"With the revision of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) nursing standards in 1991, a new emphasis has been placed on the nursing standards of patient care and the standards of nursing practice (Claflin, 1990). These standards provide the basis for nursing care and the foundation for nursing's contributions to an interdisciplinary quality improvement program. This article will describe how nursing standards of patient care and standards of nursing practice have been developed and integrated into a nursing department's documentation plan and quality improvement program.","1338":"This article was written specifically to encourage hospitals that are initiating total quality management to include physicians at the beginning stages of the process. Including physicians from the outset can benefit the entire organization. Physicians, by the nature of their profession, have an important role in the quality of the patient care process.","1339":"Without carefully designed communication protocols, hospitals can fail to meet the query and reporting requirements imposed by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the National Practitioner Data Bank, and state medical societies. This article tracks the history of the requirements, outlines current standards, and offers specific recommendations for operational procedures to avoid potential pitfalls.","1340":"Total quality management (TQM), with its long and proven record of success in manufacturing and other service industries, is relatively new to the healthcare field. But given the success of TQM in pioneering healthcare organizations, many more organizations will implement it in the coming years. TQM provides the most promising hope for improving the nation's healthcare quality while controlling costs. This change will have its advantages, but will not be without pitfalls and problems. That is why there are specific steps that must be taken to make TQM a success.","1341":"","1342":"Health Care Finance Administration mortality data, which are obviously useful information, deserve close scrutiny. Many factors attributable to patient outcome are not considered when analyzing these data (e.g., health prior to hospital admission). These data should not be used alone, but as a tool to guide quality improvement efforts.","1343":"While the three facilities that eventually became Centennial Medical Center in Nashville were in the process of merging, it became necessary to merge all of the nursing policies and procedures to establish one standard of practice. Many areas of nursing are not accountable to the vice president of nursing, yet she is responsible for nursing standards of care and practice. To bring it all together, the author formed a council of all the chairs of the manual revision process; this council condensed 35 manuals to 19 manuals, developed historical files on all active and inactive policies, developed a flow chart for new policy manual assignments, and developed one standard of practice for the medical center.","1344":"Unresolved conflicts between healthcare associates can lead to decreased teamwork and result in mistakes. Because the goal of healthcare organizations is to provide quality care, it is in the organization's best interest to avoid these damaging results. Healthcare managers have a responsibility to promote quality communication among healthcare workers. Formal negotiations, mediation, and assertiveness techniques all are very effective in resolving conflict.","1345":"This article describes response to a questionnaire requesting information from parents about their knowledge of hospital facilities\/procedures and their satisfaction with the routines associated with the admission of their children for 24-hour growth hormone monitoring. The adjustment of children to stressful medical procedures is more successful if parents can act as \"therapeutic allies\" to their children. Unless parents have a clear understanding of (and satisfaction with) the procedures their children must undergo, they cannot be expected to fulfill this role adequately. By isolating areas in which parental knowledge is lacking or inaccurate, as well as areas of dissatisfaction, the nursing staff is in a better position to improve patient adjustment to medical procedures and to plan ways of improving patient care. The results of this study indicate that more information about hospital facilities needs to be provided to parents of children who have not had previous hospital admissions. In general, however, most parents were satisfied with the explanation given for why their children had to have growth hormone monitoring and the routines associated with the procedure.","1346":"\"Doing things the same old way\" can lead to complacency and eventually to a breakdown in the healthcare system. Such is the case with the deadly disease tuberculosis (TB). While TB was thought to be a disease of the past, the United States is experiencing an alarming rise in the incidence of the disease, especially among those least likely to get help or to stick with a treatment program. This article explores a more creative approach for reaching out to treat homeless people who have TB.","1347":"The quality of patient care services provided by individuals not subject to the medical staff privilege delineation process must be evaluated. With the advent of total quality management, the food and nutrition services department at Walter Reuther Psychiatric Hospital in Westland, MI, has begun using a quality assessment system that simplifies and improves the objectivity of the performance appraisal process while providing valuable data for improving the quality of patient care.","1348":"The benefits of the risk management (RM) department of a healthcare organization often are intangible. Perhaps that is why it is difficult for the finance department to understand the need for RM. But while it is difficult for finance personnel to understand the advantages of RM, strong communication between the two departments can be beneficial to the entire organization. This communication can be strengthened in large part by educating each department on the language of the other. It also is necessary to review the effectiveness of RM constantly and to provide results in terms that both senior management and finance personnel can understand.","1349":"Control charts are a basic tool for understanding variation in all healthcare processes. Control chart limits are not standards; rather, they divided variation into special and common cause, each of which requires a different management response. Each type of data--variables, count defect, or defectives data--requires a different type of chart (e.g., X bar and R, X bar and S; C or U; P or NP). Individual observations where events are infrequent can be charted on an individual's chart with moving range limits or by several alternative methods discussed in this article.","1350":"Even the most well-intentioned healthcare managers will encounter roadblocks to successful implementation of continuous quality improvement as long as fear remains pervasive in the workplace. This article discusses the roots of fear, explains how fear impedes improvement efforts, and describes methods to identify and eradicate fear.","1351":"","1352":"With the dynamic movement toward healthcare reform, increased attention is being focused on the duties and legal liabilities of hospital governing board members. Given the dual duties of loyalty and care and the legal and regulatory pressures to contain costs and assure quality, the role of the governing board is increasing in complexity and importance.","1353":"The Safe Medical Devices Act (SMDA) of 1990 (Public Law 101-629) is a federal law that became effective November 28, 1991. The SMDA mandates all facilities that use medical devices (referred to as device user facilities) to report serious injuries, serious illnesses, and deaths to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the manufacturer. The purpose of the act is to protect the public by ensuring that medical devices are not unsafe for their intended use.","1354":"The efficiency of admitting services at York Central Hospital in Richmond Hill, ON, Canada, was studied in terms of the timing of admissions. Over a 10-month period, information was collected relating to 1,630 patients' admissions. This information resulted in recommendations allowing the standard of waiting time to be changed and the standard of an admission time to be set. The patient wait time now is to be no longer than 15 minutes with an acceptable level of 80%. The information gathered in a 6-month period during the original 10 months of study showed that the admission process takes no longer than 18 minutes with an acceptable level of 90%.","1355":"In a quality environment, improvement starts with a commitment from top management and flows down to all levels in the organization. One of the many ways in which an organization can demonstrate this commitment is by first listening to customers and then taking actions to improve services based on the identified needs of those the organization serves. This article describes a quality process in action and demonstrates how teamwork and commitment can produce the desired outcome: customer satisfaction.","1356":"The Carrier Foundation, a not-for-profit psychiatric facility in Belle Mead, NJ, has been working with managed care for the past 5 years. As managed care began to affect patients' access to care, the quality improvement department at The Carrier Foundation became involved in case management. Through case management, the quality improvement department began to provide guidance to private review organizations to preserve and protect patients' rights and to ensure accurate reporting of clinical data.","1357":"This article describes 4 years of TQM implementation at Bethesda, Inc., a private not-for-profit diversified healthcare organization. Bethesda has used a comprehensive implementation strategy involving the use of process improvement teams, hoshin planning, daily management of critical processes, and quality function deployment. The article includes four process improvement case studies demonstrating the use of the seven quality control tools and a nine-step process improvement model. Factors contributing to processes as well as obstacles are described.","1358":"Quality leadership is a precondition for implementing quality management. How organizational leaders structure and direct an organization as well as how they behave within an organization are critical elements to the success of an effective quality management process. This article addresses these leadership issues and presents a plan for quality management implementation. Several behavioral tools are described that address potential obstacles to the implementation process.","1359":"","1360":"Are customers becoming more demanding or is the state of excellence in service in the United States in decline? With the dawning of the Age of the Global Marketplace and its attendant competition, American consumers have come to expect a higher standard in products and services. They naturally choose to purchase products that have proved to be well made and reliable. In brief, they require satisfaction. Yet business and medical journals, newspapers, and books all have been eager to tell the story of the sad state of customer service. The \"demands of American consumers for high-quality service are higher than ever and businesses that ignore the new realities of customer satisfaction can jeopardize not only their future sales but also their very survival\" (Szabo, 1989, p. 16).","1361":"Quality Improvement in Ambulatory Care (QIAC), a national demonstration project undertaken in northern Minnesota, recently was honored by the American College of Physician Executives at its 1992 national meeting in San Francisco. The Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Award for Advances in Quality, an award recognizing significant advances in improving the quality of healthcare delivery, was awarded for the first time ever to the QIAC project. Impartial reviewers, using objective criteria, selected this project as this year's most significant advance in improving healthcare quality because of its magnitude and its innovation.","1362":"This article was prepared by the American Hospital Association (AHA) Division of Quality Resources for hospital CEOs, senior managers, medical staff leaders, and trustees specifically to help clarify the relationship of ongoing hospital quality management activities to new continuous quality improvement (CQI) or total quality management (TQM) efforts. The focus of CQI\/TQM as an overall management philosophy extends far beyond the scope of this article. However, due to the volume of member inquiries received by the AHA Division of Quality Resources, and in response to the division's charge, the AHA staff has identified the need to discuss the application of CQI concepts and methods to existing quality monitoring and evaluation activities.","1363":"The Healthcare Quality Educational Foundation (HQEF), in its quest to identify formal educational opportunities for healthcare quality leaders, determined that academia lacked a standardized curriculum for healthcare quality management. Because a majority of the members of the National Association for Healthcare Quality (NAHQ) expressed a need for master's degree programs, the foundation appointed a committee composed of academicians and quality management professionals to define a curriculum appropriate for a master's degree program with a concentration in healthcare quality management. This article identifies the HQEF's goals and outlines the activities undertaken by the committee to define guidelines for colleges and universities interested in developing master's degree programs.","1364":"","1365":"Parkview Episcopal Medical Center in Pueblo, CO, has been implementing a continuous quality improvement (CQI)-driven organization since April 1988. Under the leadership of Michael Pugh, the medical center's president and CEO, Parkview has made great progress in this effort. However, there is much more to be accomplished in the years to come.","1366":"Preventing falls among hospitalized patients continues to be a major concern of nurses, as evidenced by the volume of literature on this subject during the past 10 years. Yet, preventing falls, like preventing medication errors, has been a difficult and chronic issue for most nursing departments. Carolyn Corbett and Barbara Pennypacker describe how the nursing staff at Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, PA, finally has experienced success by applying the systematic methods and principles of continuous quality improvement and establishing a fall prevention process.","1367":"Total quality management (TQM) is a unifying business strategy for achieving and sustaining growth. TQM proceeds, step by step, project by project, to transform the organization into one smoothly working, quality-focused team. For successful implementation of TQM, the small projects are every bit as important as the large ones. The simple, accessible successes validate the skills that employees are acquiring and encourage them to try more complex, long-term endeavors. This article discusses several TQM projects conducted at Baptist Medical Center in Columbia, SC: streamlining medical records processing (a large project that freed up millions of dollars in cash flow); improving the reliability of all hospital equipment; and ongoing small successes in the recovery room. Although the dollar value of the projects varied considerably, all were critical to creating a culture of total quality management at Baptist Medical Center.","1368":"The FOCUS-PDCA framework for process improvement developed by the Hospital Corporation of America helps the healthcare team look at work as a series of processes that can be improved rather than focus on the people involved in the processes. It is data driven, and it encourages teamwork and shared ownership in the process improvement opportunity. This article describes how, by using FOCUS-PDCA, the length of stay (LOS) quality improvement (QI) team at Hubbard Regional Hospital in Webster, MA, has decreased dramatically the time patients spend awaiting nursing home placement.","1369":"Evaluating the quality of medical care is a documented activity extending as far back as 1910, when William Flexner, MD, examined the nation's medical schools. Standards promulgated by the federal government and by voluntary accreditation agencies have been primarily responsible for driving the development and widespread use of monitoring activities over the past 20 years. A new wind is blowing, however. Momentum is increasing to incorporate the principles of industrial quality improvement into the healthcare arena. In this study, Michelle Harvey poses the following questions: Have hospitals made the transition from traditional quality assurance to continuous quality improvement? Is an individual hospital's transition affected by such variables as bed size, region, profit or nonprofit status, and system affiliation? This analysis suggests that opportunities to facilitate transition to the new paradigm abound.","1370":"","1371":"Evolving from a traditional quality assurance to a continuous quality improvement mindset is both challenging and frustrating. How to phase out the old and embrace the new is not always clear. Approaching the shift as an evolutionary process by applying CQI techniques to issues identified through traditional QA methods can be effective. It helps to validate the significance of past efforts and provide tangible evidence of process improvement.","1372":"","1373":"The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations Standards address seven factors (patient dynamics, complexity of care, assignment complexity, technology, the patient care environment, supervision, and staff competence) to be considered when making nursing staff assignments. This article describes a form that is being used in the special care units of a medical center for this purpose.","1374":"This article describes a consumer satisfaction survey of work services in a community mental health center. The development of a satisfaction survey tool is discussed, the results from 41 respondents are given, and the implications of the survey's results are outlined.","1375":"One challenge for the QA professional in healthcare today is initiating, coordinating, and facilitating QA programs that cross traditional departmental and discipline barriers and bring together multidisciplinary teams. When looking at healthcare from a customer's perspective, the QA professional must not isolate what nursing does for the patient, what the medical staff does for the patient, what pharmacy does for the patient, and so on. The imperative, instead, is to evaluate the healthcare as it truly is perceived and delivered-as a team effort. This article presents one method that uses the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' 10-step model to create an effective multidisciplinary QA program.","1376":"Drug usage evaluation (DUE) has been computerized at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Coatesville, PA. This article describes the implementation of a simple, cost-effective process and provides examples of facility-wide and provider-specific reports that can be used at the time of reappointment for privileges. As a result of computerization and the involvement of all pharmacists, the number of drug reviews have increased dramatically, and there is more consistency in the reviews.","1377":"Bringing together healthcare professionals from several disciplines for a quality project can provide many benefits. This article describes the collaborative process between nursing and dental services at a Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center as they assessed and evaluated the practice of oral hygiene among 120 long-term care patients. Enhancement of interdisciplinary collaboration occurred through appropriate disciplinary representation and leadership, clarification of disciplinary vocabularies, firsthand empirical assessment, and timely feedback. With each discipline combining resources, fostering open communication, and evaluating the project, the collaborative process was optimized. Benefits of this interdisciplinary quality project included (a) more comprehensive and holistic evaluation of patients' oral hygiene practices, (b) quality assessment in a timely fashion, (c) establishment of rapport between individuals who otherwise might not have an opportunity to interact, (d) improved communication and understanding between disciplines, and (e) development of better patient care indicators.","1378":"An inappropriate patient transfer from the emergency room results in less-than-quality care, cost concerns, and patient and staff dissatisfaction. The emergency room physicians at a 162-bed community hospital reported that patients were being transferred needlessly from the emergency room to other acute care facilities. An investigation of the issue documented lost revenues and concerns about the quality of patient care. Based on the findings of the investigation, specific recommendations were proposed to monitor and evaluate the quality of patient care provided in the emergency room.","1379":"In 1991, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations governing board standards required that a process be designed to ensure that all individuals responsible for the assessment, treatment, or care of patients are competent in age-appropriate care. To meet this requirement, Humana Hospital-Overland Park in Overland Park, KS, developed a process to educate, evaluate, and report competence of staff to the governing board in an efficient and useful way. The focus of this article is to discuss how the process was developed and implemented successfully.","1380":"In this article, Donna Wagner discusses using quality indicators as a means of improving quality in home healthcare. Stressing the need for an organization to have a thorough foundation in total quality management as its working context, the article demonstrates how to use quality indicators as part of a quality improvement program. Monitoring quality indicators in a home health agency will provide specific information on aspects of care that the agency has identified as measures of quality. This cost-effective monitoring can be a means of incorporating QI activities into daily work patterns.","1381":"","1382":"Quality assurance and quality improvement are two highly visible indicators of the significant forces that are remolding the American healthcare delivery system. Edward K. Jeffer reviews the current status of these disciplines and makes projections on how they will affect the structure and practice of healthcare in the next century. Some speculations are presented as to why the future appears so bleak to so many healthcare providers. A more optimistic outlook is suggested, and the key role of quality assurance professionals is emphasized.","1383":"The Welsh Health Planning Forum has developed a \"Strategic Intent and Direction for the NHS in Wales.\" The aim is \"to take the people of Wales into the 21st Century with a level of health on course to compare with the best in Europe\" (Welsh Office NHS Directorate, The Welsh Health Planning Forum, 1989). Gwent Health, one of the nine health authorities in Wales, provides a comprehensive health service to its population of 445,000 and was chosen to develop a prototype for the provision of cancer services. Gwent residents were invited to seminars to express their opinions of the health service that was provided and describe the type of service they would like to have in the future. The response was encouraging enough to engender the planning of future seminars.","1384":"The United States is adopting a resident assessment instrument nationwide that holds great potential for the measurement and improvement of nursing home quality. The steps necessary to ultimately use the assessment instrument to evaluate institutional quality at the facility level are discussed. Drawing from experience with a standardized resident assessment system used in Virginia since 1983, Anne Glass describes how assessments were employed in an exploratory project to examine the relative performance of 135 facilities. A model of nursing home quality is included to explain how indicators drawn from assessments relate to quality. Advantages of using a resident-assessment-based system to evaluate institutional quality are outlined. When computerized, this wealth of data will help clarify facility norms and support continuous quality improvement.","1385":"Accurate and complete medical record documentation is essential in any healthcare setting. In addition to communicating vital patient care information, the medical record provides documentation of appropriate evaluation, treatment, and services. It also is used to evaluate practitioner performance, to monitor resource use, and to determine reimbursement. In this article, Carol Ann Martin describes the efforts of one hospital to revise and upgrade its medical record documentation by means of continuous quality improvement strategies.","1386":"There has been a rapid growth in and evolution of information management to assure appropriate and timely awarding of privileges for credentialed providers. Proprietary software might not meet the needs of a particular facility. In this article, Jackie Walker and William F. Perry describe how, using commercially available database management software, information management can be tailored to the needs of an individual institution and altered as necessary.","1387":"With the evolution of high-tech healthcare in the home setting, patients and families now need to learn the skills to perform the tasks that previously were done in hospital settings by health professionals. Numerous private and federally funded home health organizations are offering services to this patient population. The mission of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) is to improve the quality of care provided to the public (JCAHO, 1991b). In 1988, the commission implemented standards for the accreditation of home care and began to survey home care providers (JCAHO, 1988). Standards governing the provision of durable medical equipment are included in the JCAHO Accreditation Manual for Home Care (1991a). The article describes an effective collaborative approach used to develop a comprehensive durable medical equipment\/home oxygen (DME\/home O2) program at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (DVAMC), now called the Veterans Health Administration Medical Center, in East Orange, NJ. Project management principles were used by the quality management (QM) staff to develop and implement the DME\/home O2 program successfully.","1388":"","1389":"As healthcare quality assurance programs grow, so too does the need to gather and provide vast amounts of information. To meet this challenge, QA programs have turned to the use of computer systems. As this article makes clear, QA automation involves more than simply the purchase of computer hardware and software. Much time, planning, research, preparation, testing, and education are required to create an effectively automated QA program. The author provides a realistic review of the major stages and elements of the QA automation process, beginning with the search for appropriate software and concluding with the diversification possibilities of a fully integrated program.","1390":"The shortage of nurses has prompted departments across the nation to examine nursing practices in individual healthcare facilities and to initiate changes where relevant. Saint Thomas Hospital, a 571-bed tertiary-care facility, developed a number of strategies designed to allow nurses to focus on skills consistent with professional practice and to reassign technical and clerical duties to other members of the healthcare team. One of the changes implemented was the clinical outcome assessment documentation (COAD) system, which communicates the plan of care without the use of a separate form, expedites charting times, and eliminates duplication. This system also facilitates the documentation of the patient's progress toward outcome-oriented goals. Evaluation of the COAD system after implementation showed improvement in documentation of the nursing process, staff satisfaction with the system, and compliance with the Joint Commission's 1991 nursing standards.","1391":"The home healthcare staff nurse faces formidable challenges that can be met only by an extraordinary commitment to quality care. Functioning autonomously much of the time, the home healthcare nurse must act as the client's case manager. Coordination of multiple services and extensive client education are vital to positive outcomes, and intervention decisions must be based on a holistic view of the client's needs and environment. Reimbursement issues under Medicare often conflict with the delivery of high-quality care. To achieve the goals of the home healthcare agency and perform optimally, the home healthcare nurse needs a supportive QA program and frequent peer review procedures.","1392":"A six-step plan based on using statistics was designed to improve quality in the central processing and distribution department of a 223-bed hospital in Oakland, CA. This article describes how the plan was implemented sequentially, starting with the crucial first step of obtaining administrative support. The QI project succeeded in overcoming beginners' fear of statistics and in training both managers and staff to use inspection checklists, Pareto charts, cause-and-effect diagrams, and control charts. The best outcome of the program was the increased commitment to quality improvement by the members of the department.","1393":"In 1991, the Joint Commission's nursing services standards scoring guidelines went into effect. Nancy Claflin discusses the changes in the nursing process needed to meet these revised standards under the rubrics of assessment, planning, intervention, and evaluation. She then presents an extensive implementation plan for integrating this revised nursing process into a nursing QI program. The focus of this article is both on the principles of quality improvement and the exigencies of aspects of care, standards of nursing practice, and indicators.","1394":"The final article in the \"Benchmark Matrix and Guide\" series developed by Headquarters Air Force Logistics Command completes the discussion of the last three categories that are essential ingredients of a successful total quality management (TQM) program. Detailed behavioral objectives are listed in the areas of recognition, process improvement, and customer focus. These vertical categories are meant to be applied to the levels of the matrix that define the progressive stages of the TQM: business as usual, initiation, implementation, expansion, and integration. By charting the horizontal progress level and the vertical TQM category, the quality management professional can evaluate the current state of TQM in any given organization. As each category is completed, new goals can be defined in order to advance to a higher level. The benchmarking process is integral to quality improvement efforts because it focuses on the highest possible standards to evaluate quality programs.","1395":"The purpose of this article is to introduce nurses to W. Edwards Deming and the 14 points of his management philosophy, the basis of total quality management (TQM) (Deming, 1986). Each of Deming's points has been subject to in-depth analysis from business executives for the past 40 years. Quality improvement is at the very center of TQM. To adopt TQM will require a major thought transformation for many nursing leaders, but the benefits that nurses and the profession as a whole can reap from this revolutionary style of management make the effort to change worthwhile. If you are not satisfied with the status quo and are looking for a better way to conduct business, the information in this article will begin to define quality improvement and will help you strive for the highest possible level of service to your ultimate customer--the patient.","1396":"The AIDS epidemic has created difficult ethical and legal problems. A particularly acute conflict for the healthcare professional occurs when the obligation to maintain HIV-patient confidentiality is at odds with the need to protect the ignorant sexual partner from infection. In spite of counseling, the AIDS patient may continue to engage in unsafe sexual practices with partners who are unaware of the individual's HIV status. The Centers for Disease Control and medical organizations such as the American Medical Association are in general agreement that the sexual partner of an HIV-positive patient must be notified. The legal strictures regarding confidentiality, however, vary from state to state.","1397":"Marketing the results of continuous quality improvement in hospitals builds a growing bank of loyal customers in an increasingly competitive and quality-oriented environment: If healthcare institutions want to survive and flourish, they must develop a lasting relationship with their customers. The long-term goal of CQI is to provide quality products and services. If marketing managers can sell these improved services, hospitals will build a solid client foundation.","1398":"The need for accurate and complete documentation of nursing care has grown as hospitals seek to comply with the new requirements of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. As of January 1991, the Joint Commission implemented standards for nursing services that include documentation of the planning and delivery of nursing care. While the new JCAHO standards do not call for a separate nursing care plan, they nevertheless involve enough changes to require modification of most currently used documentation forms. This article describes the methods used to design new forms at the Carl T. Hayden Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix, AZ. The newly developed forms are reviewed and compared with the Joint Commission's new standards and scoring guidelines.","1399":"Nosocomial pneumonia is a serious and potentially fatal occurrence in the hospital today. Medical and nursing management influence the susceptibility of an individual as well the outcome of the episode. Due to the importance of the actions of the nurse and of the physician, monitoring the risk factors of the patient, the events preceding the episode and the pneumonia management may provide an opportunity to improve patient care. A study was conducted on patients with nosocomial pneumonia that identified areas of deficits and focused educational efforts.","1400":"In part II of this series, Janet Scheuerman of Herman Smith Associates and Vaughan A. Smith, president of the American Association of Healthcare Consultants, continue their detailed analysis of how to select a healthcare consultant. Focusing on the request for proposal (RFP), the authors cover such practical considerations as how many copies of the RFP will be required and what contacts should be listed. A comprehensive outline of how to write a statement of purpose and describe the project and scope of work is presented. The article concludes with suggestions for interviewing candidates and checking references."},"articletitle":{"0":"30-Day Readmission Reduction in a Skilled Facility Population Through
