Infection should be ruled out in all cases prior to operation. Revision TKA requires intensive planning with regard to the needed augmentation possibilities and the stems to be used. The sole biological reconstruction of major defects (AORI II and III) shows high failure rates. Large defects must be augmented by metal (wedges\/sleeves\/cones). The concept of zonal anchorage (3-zone model) with a stable anchorage in 2 out of 3 zones as close to the joint as possible is currently the standard. According to the model, metaphysis (zone 2) is an increasingly important factor for long-term stable anchoring. The use of cones or sleeves seems to significantly improve the results of revision TKA. The anchorage in zone 3 via stems is still mandatory. Cemented metaphysary anchoring and cement-free diaphysary anchoring stems are available, whereby no clear recommendation for a principle can be given.","157":null,"158":"","159":null,"160":null,"161":null,"162":null,"163":null,"164":null,"165":null,"166":null,"167":"Spondylodiscitis is an infection of the spine that first affects the vertebral endplates (\"spondylitis\") and then spreads to the adjacent intervertebral disc (\"spondylodiscitis\").

Due to the multimorbidity of the patients and the complexity of the therapy, a multidisciplinary approach is essential. The vast majority of the cases heals under conservative therapy. An absolute indication for surgical therapy is given for acute septic courses or if there are new relevant neurological deficits. In addition, urgent surgical treatment is required for epidural abscesses that can be diagnosed by means of magnetic resonance imaging.

Methods Initially the connection of the cyst to the joint in the area of the posterior rim of the glenoid is identified arthroscopically. Following the decompression of the cyst the labrum tear is repaired to avoid recurrence. The goal is the complete decompression of the ganglion cyst carefully protecting the infraspinatus branch. Concomitant intraarticular pathologies are also addressed. Conclusions In the literature arthroscopic treatment is superior to open surgical treatments.

Due to their low incidence and the sparse literature, it is unclear what is the optimal treatment and how complications can be minimised. Material and Methods A literature research was carried out using the online medical database \"PubMed\". The findings of the literature were then applied to a clinical case of type IV talar dislocation fracture (Marti and Weber). Results Modern osteosynthesis with generous and multiple access paths is to be preferred to the previously prioritised methods of talectomy and arthrodesis. Priority is put on the fastest possible reposition of the fracture, while sparing the soft tissue and the conditions of vascularisation. It can be assumed that with increasing degree of dislocation the risk of necrosis of the talus rises too, but this does not necessarily correlate with the clinical outcome. Conclusions In totally dislocated fractures of the talus, the focus is on prompt reposition and sufficient osteosynthetic supply. Nevertheless, frequent complications have to be expected. Medial explantation, which is described in the clinical example and lateral re-implantation of the talar body have never been described before in the literature and were an encouraging development.","668":null,"669":null,"670":"This is the case of an 84-year-old patient 18 years after total knee replacement.

Examination showed a large ganglion with pressure on the peroneal nerve, and a loose knee replacement with severe inlay wear and extensive osteolysis around the tibial and femoral implants. This rare case demonstrates the importance of regular clinical and radiological follow-up examinations after total joint replacements, particularly in the long term.","671":"Periprosthetic femoral fractures can be categorized into proximal fractures around a hip stem or distally around a knee arthroplasty. This paper focuses on the proximal periprosthetic fractures. It is important to classify the fracture at diagnosis and to perform accurate planning of the surgery. Basically it is necessary to decide if the implant is fixed or loose, in the latter case a revision surgery including the change of the endoprosthesis is neccessary. If the implant is fixed an open reduction and internal fixation can be done. All implants have to be available on site because in the course of the intervention the plan could change. Due to rising numbers of primary arthroplasties and more elderly patients an increase of periprosthetic fractures can be expected. The treatment of periprosthetic fractures is an economic and surgical challenge. It is important to provide competence for these cases concerning both operative techniques and interdisciplinary treatment.","672":null,"673":null,"674":"","675":"","676":"","677":"","678":"","679":"The etiology remains unclear. Mechanical factors seem to play an important role. Most histologies report clefts between the cartilage and bone and necrotic areas. Several classifications have been published based on observations from imaging techniques or on intraoperative findings. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Imaging techniques are of great importance: X-rays of the ankle joint enable a quick diagnostic overview. MRT is the imaging-technique of choice for diagnosing OCDT-lesions. Regarding treatment, a tremendous number of retrospective publications exist. Only a few are classified as level I or II papers. Patients with open physes and low-grade lesions have good results with conservative therapy. Adults do not profit from a longer conservative procedure. Where surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the stage of the lesion and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures or transchondral drilling are to be favoured. Where the cartilage is damaged, several techniques can be used: while techniques such as drilling and microfracturing, or matrix-associated microfracturing produces repair cartilage, other techniques reconstruct the defect with osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte transplantation. Regarding the outcome, it is difficult to make a precise, scientifically-based recommendation which has been confirmed by more than one prospective study. Only limited recommendations are possible: In juveniles with intact cartilage, initially conservative treatment is indicated. If there is no improvement, conservative invasive techniques such as drilling may help. In adults conservative therapy should be limited to a few weeks. Regarding the surgical treatment options, there is a tendency towards better results with procedures which reconstruct the bone and the cartilage and there is also a trend towards better long-term results when co-morbidities are treated.

This topic is largely under-reported in the literature; there are a few case reports and no long term results. Due to an increase in life expectancy, the level of patients' activity and the number of primary joint replacements, one has to expect a rise in periprosthetic complications in general and periprosthetic acetabular fractures in particular. This kind of fracture can be intra-, peri- or postoperative. Intraoperative fractures are especially associated with insertion of cementless press-fit acetabular components or revision surgery. Postoperative periprosthetic fractures of the acetabulum are usually related to osteolysis, for example, due to polyethylene wear. There are also traumatic fractures and fractures missed intraoperatively that lead to some kind of insufficiency fracture. Periprosthetic fractures of the acetabulum are treated conservatively if the implant is stable and the fracture is not dislocated. If surgery is needed, there are many possible different surgical techniques and challenging approaches. That is why periprosthetic fractures of the acetabulum should be treated by experts in pelvic surgery as well as revision arthroplasty and the features specific to the patient, fracture and prosthetic must always be considered.","692":null,"693":"Treating vertebral body fractures is challenging when there is relevant pre-existing spinal degeneration.

The main diagnostic and therapeutic challenge is to identify the sources of pain and to start appropriate therapy. A structured and advanced algorithm is then essential. Unstable fractures must always be stabilised. However, surgical strategy may be greatly influenced if there are also degenerative diseases, such as segmental decompression, multisegmental instrumentation or fusion, or complex reconstructive spondylodesis, including osteotomies.

Hibernomas are typically located on the thigh, neck, axilla or in the peri- und interscapular region. Diagnostic work-up in symptomatic hibernomas usually includes conventional X-ray and magnetic resonance tomography (MRI) with contrast medium. Asymptomatic hibernomas are often found accidentally in the diagnostic work-up of other diseases.

The reasons are complex. Studies have shown that the interest in starting a career in surgery significantly decreases during medical school. To counteract the lack of young talent in the clinic, interest in the subject should be aroused in medical school. The aim of the present study was to evaluate current teaching at our university, where trauma surgery is a curricular subject with mandatory attendance for all medical students. Material and Methods: The current curriculum is intended for medicine students in their fifth year. The curriculum comprises lectures, practical courses and observation modules held in small groups. Students are provided with an experienced surgeon as teacher and mentor for the whole week. A teaching and training centre is available for the practical courses. In an anonymised questionnaire, students were asked about their overall assessment and the training success of practical and theory-oriented modules, as well as their specific interest in traumatology. Results: The evaluated curriculum gave very good results, with an overall rating of 1.53 (average) on a 6-point Likert scale in the overall assessment. It could be shown that students previously not interested in starting a career in trauma surgery showed significantly more interest in the subject after the curriculum.

The claimant suffered from a stroke, which had occurred several years before. Her aids were an ankle-foot-orthosis for foot lift and a wheeled walker. The current treatment was to be augmented by the disputed device. The statutory health insurance declined to meet the costs. They failed to find relevant benefits after analysis of video tapes of the patient's gait while using an electrical stimulation orthosis. The social court requested an expert opinion to answer the question as to whether or not there was a relevant functional benefit to using functional electrical stimulation over the existing orthosis or to an alternative treatment. Video documentation was desired by the court. We used the clinic's gait analysis laboratory, which is equipped with a gait course and the claimed video documentation. Standardised video documentation offers substantial advantages for answering forensic questions such as these.

The use of new nerve surgical concepts improved the control strategies tremendously, especially for high-level amputees. Technological innovation in the field of pattern recognition enables the control of multifunctional myoelectric hand prostheses in a natural and intuitive manner. However, the different levels of amputation pose different challenges for the therapeutic team which concern not only the prosthetic attachment; also the expected functional outcome of prosthetic limb replacement differs greatly between the individual levels of amputation. Therefore, especially in partial hand amputations the indication for prosthetic fitting has to be evaluated critically, as these patients may benefit more from biologic reconstructive concepts. The value of the upper extremity, in particular of the hand, is undisputable and, as such represents the driving force for the technological and surgical developments within the exoprosthetic replacement.

We have developed the \"acetabulum wing plate\", which is designed to facilitate repositioning, with its anatomically precontoured structure, and which offers full support of the quadrilateral surface, thus counteracting the force of the femoral head pushing inwards. Conventional plate osteosynthesis only provides insufficient support to the medial surface. After a successful series of biomechanical tests, we now report a clinical case series. Material and Methods: Between April 2012 and August 2013, a total of twelve patients underwent plate osteosynthesis using the precontoured plate described above. The patients (ten male, two female) were aged between 45 and 87 years, the average age being 62.5 years. We were able to perform all osteosynthesis with the modified Stoppa approach, in combination with the first window of the ilioinguinal approach (according to Letournel). In most patients, the plate was applied without complications, In some patients, it even supported repositioning. In six patients, the fractures were of the anterior collum and six fractures were fractures of both colla. The mean time span of follow-up was 13.1 months, the minimum being 4.5 and the maximum 23 months. Results: In most patients, the intra- and postoperative computed tomographic scans showed anatomically correct placement of the plate, thus confirming the correct repositioning of the bone. Routine follow-ups are part of the hospital's postsurgical care system for acetabular fractures; these revealed no secondary dislocation or loosening of the plate. The radiological examination showed consolidation of the fractures after a mean period of twelve weeks. A full year after the initial procedure, no implant-specific complications were observed. Revision surgery was necessary in one patient due to bleeding five days after surgery. In another patient, necrosis of the femoral head necessitated total hip replacement ten weeks after the first surgical intervention. In summary, the concept of the plate proved to be successful in its first case series. Summary: In spite of increasing surgical expertise and the refinements of standard approaches, there is a recognisable shift in acetabular fractures from mainly posterior fracture patterns to fractures of the anterior column. The new acetabulum wing plate takes these factors into account and is an implant designed to address the anterior aspects of the acetabulum. The outcome of the first application is promising and the acetabulum wing plate produces satisfactory results in our patients.","725":null,"726":null,"727":"Pills in sharp packaging that are accidentally swallowed (blisters) can cause perforations in the gastrointestinal tract, which are only clinically apparent after the emergence of mediastinitis or peritonitis.

Despite surgery, the patient with oesophageal perforation died 3 weeks later of multi-organ failure. The patient with ileal perforation survived sepsis after multiple procedures.

The aim of transpedicular screw fixation is to achieve maximal stability. Screw malposition should be obviated to avoid neurological complications. There are published methods of applying evoked EMG to control screw position in relation to neural structures. These studies demonstrated that an intact bony pedicle wall acts as an electrical isolator between the screw and spinal nerve root. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of intraoperative pedicle screw monitoring on screw positioning. We enrolled 22 patients in this prospective randomised study, who underwent spinal instrumentation after being split into two equal groups. In the first group, dorsal instrumentation was supplemented with intraoperative nerve root monitoring using the INS-1-System (NuVasive, San Diego USA). In the second group, screws were inserted without additional pedicle monitoring. All patients underwent monosegmental instrumentation with \"free hand implanted\" pedicle screws. 44 screws were inserted in each group. The screw position was evaluated postoperatively using CT scans. The position of the screws in relation to the pedicle was measured in three different planes: sagittal, axial and coronal. The accuracy of the screw position was described using the Berlemann classification system. Screw position is classified in three groups: type 1 correct screw position, type 2 encroachment on the inner cortical wall, type 3 pedicle cortical perforation. Screw angulation and secondary operative criteria were also evaluated. The use of neuromonitoring did not influence the distance between the centre of the screws and the pedicle wall. Distances only depended on the implantation side (right and left) and the height of implantation (caudal or cranial screw). Because of the low number of cases, no conclusion could be reached about the influence of root monitoring on the correct positioning of the screws. There was at least a non-significant trend towards more frequent perforation of the pedicle in the monitor group. In the present study, we showed that root monitoring had a significant effect on the scattering of transversal angles. These were increased compared to the control group. Otherwise, the implantation angle was not shown to depend on the use of neuromonitoring. Neuromonitoring did not influence blood loss or operative time. The data did not permit any conclusion as to whether this technique can minimise the frequency of pedicle screw malposition. The four coronal plane distances did not depend on the use of neuromonitoring. The inclination angle was also unaffected by neuromonitoring. The only parameter for which we found any effect was the transverse angle. The mean values were similar in both groups, but the variances were not equal. The effect of monitoring on the only parameter which could not be evaluated by fluoroscopy is thus rather unfavourable. ","732":"Muscle injuries frequently occur during sport and are one of the commonest injuries. The diagnosis and treatment of muscle injuries impose high demands on medical treatment, in order to ensure successful regeneration and a rapid return to sport. Most of the injuries can be treated conservatively, as skeletal muscles have a high endogenous capacity for repair and regeneration. Conservative treatment includes initial on-field therapy. This is known as the \"RICE\" principle and is common and recommended for initial treatment for most sports injuries. The primary therapy target is to reduce pain, swelling and bleeding and thus to limit the initial inflammatory process and prevent further damage. During the first days after injury, brief immobilization helps to reduce the re-injury rate and accelerates the formation of granulation tissue. There are many possible additional treatments, including intramuscular injections, manipulation of the sacroiliac joint or rehabilitation programs, including stretching and strengthening. If the acute treatment phase is complete after 3 to 5 days, more active treatment, including trunk stabilisation, stretching and strengthening, can be started gradually. Despite their high prevalence, there have only been a few studies on the treatment and management of these injuries.

Existing classification systems, such as the Magerl classification, are complex and do not include the neurological status, while the TLICS system has been accused of over-simplifying the influence of fracture morphology and instability. The AOSpine classification group has developed a new classification system, based mainly upon the Magerl and TLICS classifications, and with the aim of overcoming these drawbacks. This differentiates three main types of injury: Type A lesions are compression lesions to the anterior column; Type B lesions are distraction lesions of either the anterior or the posterior column; Type C lesions are translationally unstable lesions. Type A and B lesions are split into subgroups. The neurological damage is graded in 5 steps, ranging from a transient neurological deficit to complete spinal cord injury. Additional modifiers describe disorders which affect treatment strategy, such as osteoporosis or ankylosing diseases. Evaluations of intra- and inter-observer reliability have been very promising and encourage the introduction of this AOSpine classification of thoracolumbar injuries to the German speaking community.","742":"","743":"","744":"","745":"","746":"","747":"","748":"","749":"","750":"","751":"","752":null,"753":null,"754":null,"755":null,"756":"The aim of the present study is to describe the biomechanical properties of the fracture motion of a locked plate construct.

Fracture motion was described in terms of delta z (mean fracture motion in direction of force application) and the pitch angle (angle between the upper and lower cylinders of osteosynthesis). It could be shown that the fracture motion of a conventional locked plate construct is only possible through the bending of the plate. The ratio of pitch angle and mean fracture motion (delta z) is a measure of the necessary degrees of bending per millimeter fracture motion. At the same pitch angle, dynamic osteosynthesis gave greater fracture motion.

Unstable pelvic ring fractures can cause this bleeding and the so-called \"C problem\". This is usually due to haemorrhagic shock caused by the loss of large volumes of blood from the presacral venous plexus, iliac vessels and the fracture surfaces. Many clinical studies have shown that, in the preclinical setting, unstable pelvic ring injuries are often underestimated. The application of a non-invasive external pelvic ring stabilisation (pelvic binder) is therefore recommended if a pelvic fracture is possible. Several circumferential pelvic binders have been developed and their prehospital use is increasing. Clinical and biomechanical studies have demonstrated that there is a favourable haemodynamic effect in unstable fractures, due to rapid closure of the pelvic ring. It is unclear whether the pelvic binder can be safely removed in a presumably haemodynamically stable patient. A correctly placed pelvic binder leads to anatomical closure of the pelvic ring. Therefore unstable pelvic ring fractures may be clinically and radiologically overlooked. This is a particular problem in unconscious patients. Furthermore, the real severity of the injury may then be underestimated in the diagnostic evaluation. Unconsidered opening of the pelvic binder can thus provoke renewed deterioration of the circulatory situation, especially if the injury was adequately treated by the binder and the C problem was controlled. The aim of this article is to describe procedures for handling pelvic binders, particularly as to how to deal with an already applied pelvic binder and how to \"clear the pelvic region\" while reducing the risk of haemodynamic instability. A detailed analysis of the literature and a Delphi-like discussion among several experts were performed. The following points were raised: 1) Assessment of the clinical situation, including trauma kinematics. 2) Assessment of the haemodynamic status. 3) Check of the need to open the pelvic binder for diagnostic\/therapeutic measures before completing all diagnostic tests. 4) Assessment of the radiology diagnostic testing and release of the pelvic region. The result is a so-called \"clear the pelvis algorithm\" which describes a structured approach according to specific criteria and which specifies the circumstances under which the pelvic binder can be opened. Additional studies are necessary to analyse the applicability and safety of this algorithm in a clinical context. Our advice is not to \"clear\" the pelvis if no X-rays or CT scans of the pelvis have been carried out without (or with an opened) pelvic binder.","760":null,"761":null,"762":null,"763":null,"764":"","765":"Periacetabular osteolysis is a frequent long-term complication of cementless total hip arthroplasty. The decision whether to retain or to revise a cup in the presence of osteolysis remains a challenge. The options are regular clinical and radiological check-ups, isolated liner exchange with and without bone grafting, and complete cup revision. Thorough preoperative diagnostics, including a medical history, examination and imaging, are mandatory for correct decision making. In most patients, computed tomography is useful to assess periacetabular osteolysis. If the cup is well-fixed and positioned in an asymptomatic patient without progressive osteolysis and no implant defect or higher grade polyethylene wear and no signs of infection, continuous clinical and radiological monitoring is preferred. If imaging reveals cup loosening, malposition, osteolysis localised in a weight-bearing area, imminent or present periprosthetic fractures, rapid progressive osteolysis, implant defects or massive inlay wear, surgical treatment may be preferred. Cup revision is usually performed in such patients. If the cup is well-positioned and well-fixed in the X-ray, the procedure has to be discussed with the patient individually. Apart from patient-specific risk factors, the risk of further progression has to be assessed.

New concepts in pathobiomechanics and improved clinical understanding of chronic gluteal dysfunction have unmasked gluteus medius (GMed) tears as an underlying cause of enhanced trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). These tears are often missed or misdiagnosed as bursitis, but lead to prolonged chronic peritrochanteric pain. Clinic: The clinical signs are often dull pain on the lateral hip aspect, reduced hip abduction strength with positive Trendelenburg testing and a tendency for the leg to external rotation, as the internal rotation strength is reduced. Radiography and ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis, whereas MRI is the modality of choice for imaging. Compensatory hypertrophy of the tensor fascia latae muscle (TFL) and fatty involution (especially of the GMed) are also seen. Conservative treatment regimens for partial thickness tears involve hip joint centering and strengthening of abductor muscles, sparing TFL. Failed conservative treatment and full thickness tears are treated surgically. Partial tears can be addressed endoscopically with suture anchors for tendon footprint reconstruction. Larger tears involving the anterior and\/or lateral facets of the tendon or failed conservative treatment are repaired with minimally invasive open reduction techniques. Double row suture anchor techniques provide anatomical tendon footprint reconstruction. Postoperative rehabilitation is prolonged, due to high acting forces in the peritrochanteric region, and needs to be carried out under professional surveillance. Reconstruction of gluteal tendon tears is often the only solution in the treatment of chronic hip pain due to gluteal insufficiency. Available data suggest that reduction in pain and restoration of abduction power can be achieved in mid-term follow-up.

Experimental techniques with translational character are discussed in the context of the detection of early degenerative processes relevant to OA. Non-invasive imaging methods such as quantitative MRI, ultrasound, optical coherence tomography (OCT), scintigraphy and diffraction-enhanced synchrotron imaging (DEI), as well as biochemical methods and proteomics, are considered. Early detection of OA is reviewed with minimally invasive techniques, such as arthroscopy, as well as the combination of arthroscopic techniques with indentation, spectrometry, and multiphoton microscopy. In addition, a brief summary of macroscopic and histologic scores is presented. Finally, the spatial organisation of joint surface chondrocytes as an image-based biomarker is used to illustrate an early OA detection strategy that focusses on early changes in tissue architecture potentially prior to damage. In summary, multiple translational techniques are able to detect early OA processes but we do not know whether they truly represent the initial events. Moreover, at this point it is difficult to judge the future clinical relevance of these procedures and to compare their efficacy, as there have been comparative studies. However, the expected gain in knowledge will hopefully help us top attain a more comprehensive understanding of early OA and to develop novel methods for its early diagnosis, therapy, and prevention.

Patient 1 had a chronic wound at his stump after a lower leg amputation years ago. Due to weight loading and unloading of the lower leg prosthesis while walking, air was sucked in and triggered subcutaneous emphysema. Patient 2 had a persistent fistula at his lateral thigh due to a chronic osteomyelitis and Girdlestone hip. Caused by the up-and-down movements of the femur during walking air was entrapped and led to emphysema. Patient 3 had a drain in his knee for development of a chronic fistula because of a persistent infection of his knee prosthesis. In extension of the knee, the drain was clamped in and air was entrapped during knee flexion and then seeped into the surrounding subcutaneous tissue. No signs of infection in the blood samples were present in two of the patients. None of the patients had fever and no gas producing bacteria were identified in the microbiological cultures. Only multisensitive Staphylococcus aureus was present in the wounds of patients 1 and 2. Two patients were treated surgically. One patient was treated by fasciotomy plus debridement and irrigation of the wound. A second patient was treated by debridement of the Girdlestone hip, air evacuation and insertion of a drain.

Early recognition of the disease is above all important for its later outcome. Therapy takes place in not only orthopaedic\/trauma surgery clinics but also in neurosurgical clinics. We sent an online survey on this subject to orthopaedic clinics, trauma surgery and neurosurgery clinics in Germany. The aim was to ascertain current care strategies in Germany. A further objective was to elicit differences between the specialist fields. A total of 164 clinics responded to the survey. The response rate was 16% of the orthopaedic\/trauma surgery clinics and 32% of the neurosurgical clinics. Differences between the two specialist fields can be found particularly in the use of systemic and local antibiotics, in the choice of surgical access to the thoracic spine and the lumbar spine and in post-operative imaging. In both specialist fields, patients with neurological dysfunctions are treated primarily in clinics with high case numbers. In terms of surgery, 2\/3 of the responding clinics choose a one-stage operative treatment. Minimally invasive procedures and the use of cages are widespread. The participants estimate that, on the whole, a better outcome and higher patient satisfaction tend to exist after operative treatment. The lack of homogeneity regarding treatment strategies which is indicated here clearly shows the need for therapy guidelines as an aid to orientation.

The results are evaluated critically in comparison with those in the relevant literature. In ten cases a bone tumour and in two cases a chronic osteomyelitis have been treated. 11\/12 patients showed a complete osseous integration. In one case a rigid pseudarthrosis of the ankle joint was observed. Clinical results were evaluated by the MSTS score (results 83.3-100). The non-vascularised fibula transfer is a reliable method to span bony defects of up to 25 cm in length. Unlike the autologous spongiosa graft it ensures a mechanical support because of the high cortical proportion. A temporarily occurring absorption of the transplant can be solved by a vascularised transfer, also the indication can be extended for covering combined osseous-soft tissue-defects or for reconstruction of the growth plate through epiphyseal transplantation. Indeed a strikingly increased extraction morbidity by resection of the peroneal artery and an essential elevated surgical effort are associated with these procedures. In consideration of the excellent results, the indication limits of the non-vascularised fibula transfer need to be defined. It can be successfully applied, especially in infancy, under the following conditions: unstable osseous defects with vital soft tissues, appropriate shape of the fibula for reconstruction as well as appropriate osseous requirements for a stable incorporation or osteosynthesis.

By regarding older MRI scans, we could find out which finding was first to occur. Concerning the second question, we followed patients with spondylosis to see if they could progress to a disc prolapse. In 67% of our cases with disc prolapse and chondrosis, a chondrosis was seen before the disc prolapse. More than a half had had a spondylosis and a chondrosis in the same segment before the herniation. Only 33% of our cases showed a prolapse before chondrosis. Concerning patients with disc prolapse and chondrosis in the same segment, chondrosis was seen before the herniation in most cases. Also patients with spondylosis progress to a herniation.

The widespread notion that positioning screws must be removed by default after healing of the syndesmosis remains a topic of debate which lacks scientific support. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that syndesmotic positioning screws are safely retained per protocol in asymptomatic patients. A retrospective analysis of an institutional prospective database was performed during a 5-year time-window at an academic level 1 trauma centre in the United States. All ankle fractures requiring surgical fixation were included in the analysis. The primary outcome parameter consisted of the rate of elective hardware removal for syndesmotic positioning screws within 6 months after surgical fixation. A total of 496 consecutive patients with 496 isolated ankle fractures managed by surgical fixation were included in this study. Of these, 140 injuries were managed by placement of syndesmotic positioning screws. Within 6 months follow-up, 17.1% of all syndesmotic screws were found to be radiographically broken, and 13.6% of syndesmotic screws revealed radiographic signs of loosening. Only 2 patients (1.4%) required the elective removal of symptomatic positioning screws within 6 months of surgical fracture fixation. Despite the high rate of radiographic complications related to breaking or loosening of syndesmotic screws in almost one third of all cases, more than 98% of all patients remain asymptomatic and do not require a scheduled hardware removal. The routine removal of syndesmotic positioning screws does not appear to be justified from a patient safety perspective.

This article intends to raise the awareness for the diabetic foot and the neuropathic osteoarthropathy, and furthermore illustrate diagnostic steps and offer therapeutic options. After distinguishing the diabetic foot from the Charcot foot a selective therapy for each entity has to be initiated.

","945":"Total knee replacement in patients with post-traumatic arthritis is not fundamentally different from total knee replacement in patients with primary arthritis. Because of a 10-times higher infection rate, ordinary surgical planning should be implemented by the best possible exclusion of site infection based on actual information. Extra-articular deformities have to be preoperatively identified and individually treated with either an incomplete or a complete intra-articular correction or a single or double correction osteotomy. The commonly found combination of a contracted knee joint and an insufficient ligament balancing can mask instabilities of the knee joint. Consequently the definitive grade of a constrained knee prosthesis can only be determined intraoperatively. Existing osseous defects can be addressed with autologous bone grafts left from the total knee arthroplasty. Depending on the osseous defective site and the grade of constraints, prosthesis stems may be necessary but so far no clear recommendation can be given for either a cemented or a cementless fixation of the stem. The approach to the knee joint should be guided according to existing scars in order to prevent wound healing disorders. Even given optimal surgical planning and an optimum procedure of total knee arthroplasty postoperative results of post-traumatic arthritis are significantly inferior to results of primary arthritis. Therefore it is important to induce the commonly younger patients to form realistic expectations.

It is an alternative to the ilioinguinal approach. Goals are the gentle soft-tissue preparation, anatomic reduction and stable internal fixation. Here, the approach is described in detail together with possible expansion possibilities. The Stoppa approach in particular is used for the treatment of fractures of the anterior column with participation of the quadrilateral surface, transverse fractures, T-type fractures, but also 2-column fractures when the main pathology is located in anterior portions of the acetabulum. This intrapelvic approach allows a direct view of the quadrilateral surface and the direct reduction of these fragments. In contrast to the ilioinguinal access the Stoppa approach dispenses with the preparation of the 2nd window with exposure of the vessels. The preparation is carried out via a Pfannenstiel access following transection of the median line alba. The further dissection is performed along the anterior pubic ramus, on the pelvic rim, towards the ipsilateral sacroiliac joint. The modified Stoppa approach is a soft-tissue-friendly approach for the treatment of acetabular fractures.

Besides general and perioperative complications long-term consequences, especially post-traumatic arthrosis, are relevant problems when it comes to treating fractures of the acetabulum. The primary reconstruction of the acetabulum, as well as a possibly necessary prosthetic replacement of the hip joint, makes high demands on the diagnostic and operative capabilities of the attending physician. Exact knowledge of the specific risks and pitfalls for each type of fracture and for the specific surgical techniques is crucial for a successful treatment. Due to the much worse long-term outcome when compared to primary total hip replacement in patients with osteoarthritis, acetabular fractures should, regardless of the patient's age, whenever possible be treated by operative reconstruction.

How should such combinations of injuries be treated? Based on 11 patients from the years 2005 to 2013 with different combinations of sternal and spinal injuries, we distinguish the therapeutic approach of ventral, dorsal or combined stabilisation, with the help of a four-column classification of these injuries. We classify sternovertebral injury into 4 types. First the descendant type with an injury from C I to C VII and sternum, second the horizontal type (T I to T XII and sternum), third the ascendant type (L I to L V and sternum) and fourth a dissociative type. The recommended therapy of the descendant type is dorsoventral stabilisation of the spinal column plus stabilisation of the sternum. The horizontal type should be treated with dorsal stabilisation of the spine and stabilisation of the sternum. The ascendant type should be supplied with dorsoventral stabilisation of the spinal column and conservative therapy of the sternum. In case of the dissociative type one should supply each injury independently. The literature on sternal injuries and their treatment is low. Combinations of sternum and spine injuries have not yet been processed systematically in literature. Thus, there is no concerted standard of therapeutic options. The very rare occurrence of this injury combination often leads to this injury type being forgotten in the primary evaluation of casualties.

In the long version of the classification, which was designed for scientific studies, the parameters are named by capital letters and specified by Arabic numbers, e.g., an acute, haematogenous osteomyelitis of a femur in an adolescent with diabetes mellitus, caused by Staphylococcus aureus, multi-sensible is coded as: OM2 Lo33 S1a M1 In1d Aa1 Ba2a K2a.

As an alternative, different kinds of bone substitutes have been used more often during the past years. These bone substitutes include synthetic materials, just as well as processed materials from human donors (allogen) or animals (xenogen). The relatively low hurdles in the approval process, compared to pharmaceutical drugs, have led to an almost unmanageable amount of different kinds of bone substitutes. Due to sparse clinical studies, evidence-based decisions for a specific product or a specific indication are hardly possible. Therefore, a deeper knowledge about basic properties of different bone substitutes is needed for a rational clinical decision. The present review aims to clarify the sometimes confusing nomenclature of bone substitutes and discuss their different biological properties. Generally, bone substitutes can be discriminated in osteogenic, osteoinductive and osteoconductive materials. The great majority of bone substitutes and especially synthetic materials serve as a matrix for bone growth and therefore possess mainly osteoconductive properties. The combination of these osteoconductive materials with osteogenic cells or osteoinductive growth factors, leads to composite materials with higher bone forming potential. Clinically, the quality and vitality of the recipient bone defect is of great importance. As a prerequisite for successful transplantation of bone substitutes or autologous bone, the recipient bone defect should be mechanically stable, free of infection with vital bone ends and intact soft tissue coverage. Bone defects in the spine, methaphyseal defects after trauma\/tumour and diaphyseal segmental defects are typical indications for the application of bone substitutes. Unfortunately, the current literature does not allow concrete recommendations for specific bone substitutes or specific clinical indications.

The logbook covers 15 skill domains from different specific components of orthopaedic surgery and traumatology. Where these skills overlap with those also required in compulsory modules (e.g., surgery), the required level of complexity may be lower for students in the elective module. The text is supplemented by figures with synopses of the major issues and summaries for easy reference. With the recent changes in German licensing regulations for physicians, it has become necessary to set up a logbook of uniform learning outcomes to assist medical students and their teachers alike. The authors have developed such a logbook of elective training modules in orthopaedic surgery and traumatology to be taught during the one-year undergraduate internship of German medical students. ","1039":"Patients with chronic widespread pain often present with musculo-skeletal pain and therefore often initially contact an orthopaedist. For these patients fibromyalgia syndrome is an important differential diagnosis. Recommendations for the diagnosis of and therapy for fibromyalgia syndrome based on the recent German S3 guidelines for fibromyalgia syndrome (AWMF registration number 041\/004) are outlined in this paper. These guidelines were developed under the coordination of the German interdisciplinary association for pain management DIVS and two patient support groups. The history of a typical symptom complex and the exclusion of relevant somatic causes for the pain are epecially relevant for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome. Besides the exclusion of relevant orthopaedic causes for the pain, psycho-social aspects should always be evaluated. According to the modified ACR criteria 2010, chronic widespread pain and accompanying sleep disturbances and a physical as well as mental state of exhaustion lead to the diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome. It is not mandatory to check tender points (ACR 1990 criteria). A graduated treatment approach depending on the severity level of the fibromyalgia syndrome in the individual patient is recommended. Active treatment options (aerobic training, meditative movement therapies, strength training) should be preferred to any drug therapy in the long-term treatment of fibromyalgia. If indicated, amitryptiline or duloxetine may be used to treat accompanying depressive or generalised anxiety disorder. Muscle relaxant medication, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and strong opioids should be avoided. The multimodal pain therapy considering all psycho-social aspects is a promising treatment option for fibromyalgia syndrome of moderate to high severity.

Observing international medical journals (over the recent years), one finds very few case histories. What is more, these case histories vary significantly with regards to their approaches to the problem at hand. This survey lists essential publications and case histories in question and - following their analysis and in light of the fairly low number of respective cases - attempts to create a 'treatment algorithm'. Approaches to treatment vary considerably throughout the medical literature. Reasons are the localisation of the actual damage, pertaining to the medial collateral ligament as well as surgeons' aptitudes and preferences with regards to hinged or constraint implants. Eventually, there are five different treatment options: (i) solely conservative treatment by means of an orthesis; (ii) primary reconstruction of the medial collateral ligament; (iii) medial collateral ligament augmentation; (iv) inlay elevation and lateral release procedure; and (v) a higher degree of coupling regarding the TKA. It is strongly advised to refrain from conducting a release at the femoral origin of the medial collateral ligament. In stages, a tibial release should be carried out strictly subperiostally. A high expenditure of energy during tension examination needs to be utterly avoided. Reconstruction of the femoral origin\/insertion can be carried out rather safely, while reconstruction of the tibial origin\/insertion is more complicated due to the more complex anatomic line-up\/constellation. Likewise, the reconstruction of the median ligament portion is considerably more difficult; in this case, the application of a primary suture or augmentation by use of the semitendinosus or quadriceps tendon are recommended. In addition, the temporary application of an orthesis is recommended regardless. In any case, a higher degree of coupling should be considered as a fallback. Introduced is an algorithm which differentiates the ligament damage location.

Besides osteosynthesis, which in most cases of femoral neck, pertrochanteric and femoral head fracture is the method of choice, arthroplasty of the hip is likewise an established therapy. Indications are dislocated femoral neck fractures of the elderly. But there are good results for arthroplasty after proximal femoral fractures in younger active patients as well, when the fracture was not recognized or treated immediately. The outcome of hip arthroplasty after fracture is influenced by the elderly and unhealthy patient himself and the difficult planning and operation conditions due to fracture and its morphology. Most important for the best result are an interdisciplinary preparation of the patient and a well-planned surgery. In these cases common complications like thromboembolism, massive intraoperative blood loss and general infections like urinary tract infection can be reduced. For hip arthroplasty after fracture total hip replacement as well as hemiarthroplasty with bipolar prosthesis should be considered. The implant chosen and the implantation technique with or without bone cement has to be determined.

Specific patient-related, intra- and postoperative risk factors have been identified and need to be considered during the course of treatment. Often a profound management of underlying infection must accompany the staged defect treatment which could require a prosthesis explantation with secondary revision in the case of a deep infection and involvement of the prosthesis. Four stages of soft tissue defects have been introduced (types A-D) and criteria for differentiation are the overall soft tissue coverage, the exposure, respectively, necrosis of the extensor mechanism, preservation or involvement of the joint capsule and\/or an accompanying septic loosening of the prosthesis. The concept of plastic coverage follows a stage-adapted algorithm and includes secondary wound healing and mesh coverage for superficial defects, fasciocutaneous flaps for moderate defects and pedicled or free muscle flaps for deep defect situations with extension into the joint capsule. Crucial factors for a successful therapy include the early identification and precise analysis of defect characteristics, the careful preparation of the wound bed with serial debridements and the diligent flap coverage with early consultation of plastic-surgical expertise.

The patient-relevant clinical question can be formulated as: Is the rehabilitation of osteoarthritis patients with minimally invasive implantation of total knee arthroplasty faster compared to those with the conventional approach. The available literature is sorted and critically appraised with regard to methodological quality and risk of bias. Following the results of the meta-analyses the clinical question can be positively answered. Following the aspect of a structured evolution for surgical techniques, the meaning of a minimally invasive technique for total knee arthroplasty cannot be answered finally. Under the impression of more frequent surgical complications, the rating of the procedure is conservative. A general advantage is not apparent. Further studies investigating surgical learning curves, proper patient selection and the selection of the patient for such techniques are required, before the final judgement on the use of this technique can be formed.

Two independent researchers evaluated the quality of original investigations by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Systematic reviews were checked by the CBO\/Dutch Cochrane Centre Guideline. A total of 1541 studies was initially retrieved from the databases. After screening for inclusion criteria, one review and ten original papers could be included for further evaluation. Studies showed methodological weaknesses. Heterogeneity of outcome measures and the fact that 6 of 9 studies with an one-group pre-post design measured the combined effect of surgical treatment and CPM prevented a meta-analysis. Three studies described significant improvements with regard to subjective outcome such as pain, swelling, Quality Life Survey, Knee Society score, WOMAC score or rating Cincinnati due to the surgical treatment and the CPM intervention of cartilage defects in the knee.

","1074":"For vertebral body fractures combined with strong back pain, the kyphoplasty is an established method for pain reduction. A balloon effects an excavation in the vertebral body, which will be filled up with cement. We distinguish between cements of polymethyl metacrylate (PMMA) and calcium phosphate. Their diverse chemical qualities enable different indications. A 72-year-old male patient with refractory back pain after a lumbar vertebral body fracture was treated with a kyphoplasty operation. After four days the patient went home with clearly less pain. After two months the patient had a bagatelle trauma at home, which caused an exacerbation of the back pain. In computered tomography we saw a disruption of the PMMA cement plombage forwards and also a kyphosis of the lumbar vertebrae. Therefore we had to operate on the patient two more times. The first time we stabilised the spine from dorsal via an internal fixator. The additive ventral fixation was at that time declined by the patient. Because of the persistency of the back pain after operation combined with a sense of instability, we were ten days after the first revision allowed to stabilise the patient from ventrally with a Harms cage. At the first-year follow-up the patient was still free of pain. Injuries of the vertebral body frame cannot be operated exclusively with kyphoplasty. The reason for this is the instability of the vertebral body despite the injection of the PMMA cement. We advise to stabilise the spine in such cases with a dorsal internal fixator additively.

Intramedullary fixation with Prevot nails was initially reported in the late 1990s. This procedure offers minimally invasive stabilization of the fracture, thus enabling immediate mobilization and rapid loading capacity. Using a case study, the positioning and procedure are demonstrated on video. The intramedullary implant accommodates the varying tension loading of the clavicle. This treatment is ideal for clavicular fractures with 2-3 fragments. Compared to patients treated conservatively, operated patients achieve more rapid and improved mobility.

In case of mono- or polyarticular joint swelling, stiffness or inflammatory arthralgia, rheumatoid arthritis has to be deliberated particularly in differential diagnostic considerations. When diagnosed early, a joint treatment by an internal specialist as well as the initiation of a basic medicamentous therapy are highly recommended. Therefore, corticosteroids and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate can be used, in case of failure a treatment with biologicals should follow. The operative therapy depends on the stadium of joint destruction. In early stadiums (LDE 0-3) and in case of therapy resistant inflammation a synovectomy should be performed as a preventive intervention. Given an already advanced destruction, alloarthroplasty or arthrodesis are indicated as reconstructive procedures.

A total of 119 students participated in 9 courses and performed a detailed evaluation. The main motivation to participate was (i) to acquire practical skills (93 %), (ii) to learn about orthopaedic and trauma surgery (66 %) and (iii) to facilitate decision-making for the occupational choice (21 %). 94 % judged the quality of the course as \"excellent\", and all 119 participants indicated that they would recommend the course to other students. 43 of 45 students, who had not yet decided on their occupational choice, indicated that the course stimulated them for a career in orthopaedic and trauma surgery.

During patella dislocations injuries of soft-tissue structures can occur that can destabilise the patella and lead to recurrent dislocations. There are also congenital pathologies that predispose to patella dislocations. In the current literature, diagnostics and treatment of patellar dislocations are frequently discussed. Therefore the aim of our survey was to analyse and summarise actual diagnostic and therapeutic strategies regarding primary and recurrent patella dislocations. An online questionnaire form was sent to 735 orthopaedic and\/or trauma departments in Germany. The departments were invited to participate in an anonymous survey concerning diagnostics and treatment of primary and recurrent patellar dislocations. The questionnaire consisted of multiple choice questions and was divided into three sections. The first section included questions concerning the department structure. The second part contained questions regarding diagnostics and treatment of primary patella dislocations. The third part involved diagnostic and treatment strategies for recurrent patella dislocations. A systematic review of outcome after treatment of patellar dislocation was performed and discussed with the results of the survey. 245 hospitals (33.3 %) returned the questionnaire. Among the participants were 23 % orthopaedic surgery departments, 32 % trauma surgery departments and 45 % combined departments. 12 % were university hospitals and 53 % academic teaching hospitals. Clinical examination was performed by nearly all participants after primary and recurrent patella dislocations. MRI was used as diagnostic tool in 81 % after primary patella dislocation and in 85 % after recurrent patella dislocation. Conventional X-rays were performed in 58 % (primary) and 51 % (recurrent patella dislocations). Computed tomography scans for measurement of the tuberositas tibiae-trochlea groove distance were used in 35 % after recurrent dislocations and in 20 % after primary patella dislocations. 69 % of the participating departments performed non-operative therapies after primary patella dislocations, especially when no associated injuries and no congenital pathologies were observed. Reconstruction of the medial retinaculum was the most frequent surgical therapy (52 %) followed by the reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (36 %) after primary patella dislocation. Following recurrent patella dislocations reconstruction of the medial patellofemoral ligament (58.5 %) was the most performed surgery and a tuberositas transfer was done in 58 % of participating departments after recurrent patella dislocation. The results of our survey showed diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in the participating departments which are in accordance with recommendations in recent publications. The clinical importance of the MPFL reconstruction was observed for primary and recurrent patella dislocation. In addition, conservative treatment is still the most common treatment after primary dislocation of the patella.

Four patients had not been treated before, 25 had suffered recurrences after 1-10 previous procedures, and 9 patients had not improved after conservative therapy. 34 patients presented with traumatic rupture or fistula of their bursae. In all cases we performed a radical bursectomy and vacuum-assisted therapy for 4 to 5 days. In addition, patients received systemic antibiotics. We phoned all patients and were successful in 57 cases (72 %). We questioned these patients for range of movement, limitations at work, pain, sensibility disorder, satisfaction with the result and further surgical procedures. In all cases we took tissue specimens for cultures, in 48 preparations histological examination was performed. Microbiological and histological results are discussed in detail. 40 patients were free of complaints, 15 complained of mild pain, 54 of 57 had unlimited range of motion. Minor discomforts at desk work were reported by 5 of 43 patients, 12 out of 36 patient reported discomfort when performing on their knees. There was no recurrence in the period of investigation. We recommend our treatment concept for septic olecranon and patellar bursitis because patient satisfaction is high and recurrences are reliably avoided.

Important clinical characteristics are marked postural distortions such as camptocormia (bent spine) or laterocollis. In cases of these adult scolioses, surgical spine treatment puts high demands on the surgeon. Surgery in Parkinson's disease, for example, is associated with serious surgery-specific as well as general complications. The more rarely occurring Pisa syndrome is an entity primarily requiring medical therapy. A series of ten case reports of patients with Morbus Parkinson and Pisa syndrome who underwent spinal surgery is presented and discussed. From these reports, treatment recommendations have been derived and complemented by references from the literature. An extensive MEDLINE search was performed for this purpose. In patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, even minor surgical interventions can lead to instability of whole spine segments or even the entire spine. Implant loosening, adjacent segment instability, general perioperative complications, and progressive malposture due to disease progress can bring forth disastrous treatment courses. Spinal fixation should be performed long-segmented in combination with ventral stabilisation. Due to osteoporosis, pedicle screw cement augmentation is recommended in this collective. If the diagnosis of Pisa syndrome is established, an optimised preoperative preparation should be initiated in close cooperation with neurologists. In many cases medical therapy is sufficient and surgical interventions can be avoided. ","1094":"Due to the changing attitude of treating paediatric forearm fractures increasingly towards the surgical stabilisation rather than conservatively by the method of elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN), we are confronted with complications which have not been described in childhood previously. Pseudarthrosis following surgically treated forearm fractures in children is only found in single reports with none in the German-speaking area. The goal of this study is to define predisposing factors which may lead to pseudarthrosis after surgery for forearm fractures. From 1990 to 2011 all children having sustained a pseudarthrosis following forearm fractures treated in our institution were included. All children who did not demonstrate a complete consolidation of the forearm fractures after 6 months from injury were considered for the study. Those pseudarthroses which were caused through systemic diseases were excluded. During the time period of 21 years, fourteen children were treated who fulfilled the criteria of having a pseudarthrosis. Nine of the fourteen children had primarily been treated in an outside hospital, five in our institution. The average age was 10.8 years (7-15 years). There were thirteen ulnar shaft and one radius shaft pseudarthroses. In 11 children the pseudarthrosis was located in the middle third and there was one child each with a pseudarthrosis in the proximal and distal third of the ulna. There were 13 ulnar shaft fractures and one monteggia lesion. Twelve of the fractures were primarily closed and there were two open cases. In nine cases an open reduction of the ulna was necessary, the radius was openly reduced in four patients. In five children technical mistakes of the osteosynthesis were identified to contribute to the formation of the pseudarthrosis. Five of the 14 children had experienced a re-fracture. Nine children had revision surgery. These children were treated by plate osteosynthesis or ESIN. In five patients the pseudarthrosis healed spontaneously without interference. There were 13 hypertrophic and one hypotrophic pseudarthroses. Pseudarthrosis of the forearm following surgical treatment of forearm fractures in children and adolescents mainly occurred in the middle third of the ulna. In primarily open fractures or in cases which needed to be openly reduced the risk of pseudarthrosis formation was higher. Inadequate osteosynthetic stabilisation is another factor to contribute to difficulties in fracture healing. Despite of the possibility of pseudarthrosis, the indication to ESIN treatment in paediatric forearm fractures is not doubted. It is important to keep the surgical trauma as small as possible if open reduction is required in order to not disturb the perfusion of the bone.

In order to reveal the influence of considerable comorbidities and the time of surgery in the treatment of geriatric hip fractures we analysed patients treated between 1993 and 2008 at a level I trauma centre. 654 patients with isolated hip fractures were included. Surgical treatment was performed with osteosynthetic stabilisation in 55.5 % (n = 363) and with endoprosthetic implants in 44.5 % (n = 291). The presence of pulmonary, psychiatric and metabolic\/endocrinological comorbidities resulted in delayed treatment. If an early surgical treatment was performed within the first 12 hours after hospital admission, long-term survival was significantly improved (p = 0.02). A regression analysis revealed a statistical trend towards an increased mortality of 0.2 % per hour delay after hospital admission. The presence of considerable comorbidities and surgical treatment with endoprosthetic implants (odds ratio 1.611) were proven as independent mortality factors. The present study supports the guideline of early surgical treatment of geriatric hip fractures. Emphasising the incidence of in-hospital complications and the mortality after endoprosthetic treatment, osteosynthetic fracture stabilisation should be considered in the presence of considerable morbidity and pre-surgical immobilisation.

The main aims of surgical treatment is to reduce pain and preserve or restore function and mobility. After the contribution on spinal metastases in the last volume, this article focusses on metastases of the extremities and the pelvis. Pathologic fractures with an unclear oncological situation should be examined thoroughly before any surgical treatment is performed. In case of doubt, a biopsy should be performed. Depending on the individual prognosis, possible options for extremity surgery are (compound) osteosynthesis and implantation of a tumor endoprosthesis.

The dynamic locking screw - DLS - allows for a decrease of the rigidity of a plate osteosynthesis. The fracture motion is positively affected. The advantages of the angular stability are not affected. In the Trauma Centre Tuebingen 35 patients were treated with the DLS5.0 in the time between November 2011 and October 2012. These first clinical cases with the use of the large fragment DLS showed good results. Handling the DLS5.0 is comparable to the conventional locking screw - LS5.0.

There is still no proof for the superiority of any strategy concerning clinical or radiological outcomes. The aim of this study was the evaluation of residual complaints and correlation with radiological findings. 87 patients, who underwent different types of surgery for vertebral fractures of the thoracolumbar region were included. Patients were treated by posterior stabilisation with internal fixation alone, by a combined approach using posterior internal fixation and anterior fusion by bone graft from the iliac crest with or without additional anterior plating or with a combined approach using posterior stabilisation and anterior implantation of an expandable titanium cage. Data were collected using results of physical examination, standardised testing of several established quality of life scores (SF-36, VAS, LBOS and Oswestry score) as well as radiological findings (post-traumatic kyphosis, loss of correction). There was no difference in the overall results of quality of life in the different subgroups. Analysis of the subgroups revealed differences in the complaints according to the surgical strategy used (a high rate of non-fusion where bone grafts, especially without additional anterior plating were used, combined with a high rate of bone graft morbidity, intercostal neuralgia in cage implantation). Loss of correction as documented in the radiological course showed a maximum in patients who underwent posterior stabilisation without an additional anterior approach. There was no correlation of loss of correction and quality of life. Overall outcomes of the four surgical strategies were comparable in our study concerning loss of correction and quality of life, respectively. The use of bone grafts, however, results in a high rate of non-fusion with a remarkable number of patients complaining about bone graft morbidity. Therefore we prefer the use of expandable titanium cages for anterior stabilisation if additional anterior stabilisation is necessary due to type of fracture or damage of adjacent discs. In any other cases, a limited approach by posterior instrumentation alone should be considered.

In one group, a rapid rise in heart rate even at lower walking speed was observed. In a second group of persons with poor motor coordination, the maximum walking speed was limited. Single subjects were not limited neither in their physical performance nor in their condition.

The goal of these approaches is a good visualisation with minimal trauma of the bone and its vascularisation as well as of the muscles. Of the extended approaches we prefer the transfemoral approach in a modified technique. This approach is indicated when the stem of the endoprosthesis is broken, when the femoral axis has shifted because of stem loosening, or when the bone has become noticeably thin, which by itself or in combination would greatly increase the risk of an intraoperative fracture or perforation. Similarly, it is indicated in cases in which the cement mantle was stable, when a periprosthetic fracture of Vancouver B2 or B3 type is present or when a loose cementless stem with a coarsely porous surface cannot be removed in an endofemoral manner. In a published study of 68 patients with hip revisions using this modified transfemoral approach, we could see a continuous increase of the Harris hip score from 41.4 points preoperatively to 85.9 points 24 months postoperatively. Healing of the bony flap was seen in 98.5 % of the cases. Two postoperative non-dislocated trochanter fractures could be treated conservatively.

Repair of the muscle is reasonable for coverage of the plate and to maintain normal pronation of the forearm. However, repair of the muscle is not always satisfactory. In this study, the topographic relationship of both the PQ and the brachioradialis muscle (BR) insertions are investigated with regard to optimising the repair of the PQ in open reduction and volar plate fixation of distal radius fractures. Twelve forearm pairs fixed in formalin were examined. The muscular boundaries of the PQ and the insertion of the BR were dissected, photographs were taken and measured digitally. The average distance of the PQ insertion was 4.75 cm. Distally, a close topographic relationship exists between the insertions of both the PQ and BR. A fascial connection of both muscles was detected in all specimens. The average distance of the common insertion was 1.75 cm. After removal of the PQ fascia, 0.85 cm of common insertion remained. In 25 % a muscular connection between both the PQ and BR was detected after removal of the PQ fascia. Both the PQ and BR have a common connective tissue and partially a common muscular insertion. Detaching the PQ insertion with a part of the BR insertion in open reduction and volar plate fixation of distal radius fractures can presumably lead to a more stable repair of the PQ in contrast to a repair within the muscle.

After evaluation of intra-articular pathology by prior diagnostic arthroscopy, we aimed to build patient groups regarding the stability of the elbow joint. In patients with a stable elbow joint, open surgery with a debridement to the origin of the common extensor tendon and transosseous refixation was performed. Patients with relevant posterolateral rotatory instability, however, underwent an additional LUCL complex stabilisation using triceps tendon graft besides debridement as mentioned above. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical functional outcome between these groups. 101 patients were included in our study. Arthroscopies were first performed on all patients to identify intra-articular pathological changes. In 26 patients with stable elbows, open surgery with debridement to the origin of the common extensor tendon and transosseous refixation was performed. For the other 75 patients who were found presenting a relevant posterolateral rotatory instability, a stabilisation of the LUCL in addition to the open procedure mentioned above was performed. Examinations and questionnaires were used for retrospective evaluation at follow-up. Both groups of patients revealed significant improvement in pain relief and elbow function. We observed no significant difference between the two methods concerning clinical and functional outcome. We recommend diagnostic arthroscopy with assessment of stability prior to the open performance to offer a more reliable evidence for surgical technique selection and therefore to achieve a better clinical outcome. ","1117":"The outcome of orthopaedic surgery such as total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) is commonly given by the change in mean scores on patient-reported outcome measures (Prom's). This may give the impression that all enrolled patients have experienced an improvement. But the Swedish hip registry and other studies report a reduction of complaints in 80-85 % of patients (\"responders\"), with the remainder (approximately one in six) remaining unchanged or reporting worse complaints (\"non-responders\"). According to Cohen, the degree of success in the \"responders\" group can be subdivided into excellent, good and moderate. For a given treatment, a total of 5 different outcome groups can therefore be defined: excellent, good, moderate, unchanged and worse. Allocation to the groups is based on the \"relative effect per patient\" (REPP). The REPP is calculated as the base-line score minus the post-treatment score divided by the baseline score. The maximum possible REPP is 1; a REPP of 0 means no effect and a negative REPP means deterioration. Allocation to the outcome groups is as follows: excellent 0.95 to 1 REPP, good 0.5 to 0.95 REPP, moderate over 0.2 to 0.5 REPP, unchanged -0.2 to 0.2 REPP and worse below -0.2 REPP. Our local arthroplasty register was used to evaluate the 1-year outcomes of THR and TKR patients operated between March 2003 and November 2008, using WOMAC scores and EuroQoL scores. Only patients with complete data sets and unilateral THR\/TKR were included. The success rate given by the REPP method was compared with that of the \"responder rate\" method defined by the OMERACT-OARSI criteria. With the WOMAC questionnaire, outcomes were as follows (THR\/TKR): excellent 29\/14 %, good 51\/54 %, moderate 11\/13 %, unchanged at 5\/12 %, worse 4\/7 %. The corresponding values for the EuroQoL were (THR\/TKR): excellent 16\/6 %, good 41\/42 %, moderate 25\/28 %, unchanged 12\/16 %, worse 6\/8 %. For THR, success rates were 92 % using the \"responder rate\" method (OMERACT-OARSI criteria) and 91 % using the REPP method with the WOMAC. Calculation of the REPP and the subsequent allocation to outcome groups is simple. The distribution of outcomes depends on the intervention (THR results better than TKR) and the patient questionnaire used (better results with a condition-specific than a generic questionnaire). The proportion of \"unchanged\" and \"moderate\" outcomes was greater with the generic questionnaire than with the condition-specific questionnaire, while the proportion of \"worse\" outcomes was similar for the two instruments. Partitioning of the degree of success into sub-groups, based on the REPP, provides more information for both the patient and the orthopaedic surgeon. ","1118":"The residency program for a specialist in orthopedics and trauma surgery is facing fundamental changes based on an initiative originating from the working group \"medical training\" of the German Medical Association (GMA). A survey indicated that 50 % of all trainees are dissatisfied with their current situation. It appears important to integrate the ideas and wishes of current orthopedic residents in a novel training concept. To assess this a survey was performed by the Young Forum of the German Society for Orthopedics und Trauma Surgery. The internet-based short survey was conducted in January 2013 among members of the professional societies (DGU, DGOU and DGOOC). 408 physicians participated. The majority of the participating physicians is interested in a career in orthopedics and trauma surgery with primarily operative contents. Accordingly the majority (62 %, n = 253) voted against a reduction of numbers of surgical interventions with 86 % (n = 351) confirming the necessity that these operations must be carried out by the trainee himself. The upcoming changes in residency program for orthopedics and trauma surgery offer the opportunity for a well structured and practical oriented residency program. It could be a further step in increasing satisfaction in this profession. ","1119":"Spinal metastases occur in 10 % of all carcinoma patients in the course of their oncologic disease. Spinal metastasis is a manifestation of a systemic oncologic disease. The treatment of the metastasis does not influence the overall oncological outcome. Treatment decision is depending from the primary tumor, presence of neurological symptoms, stability of the spine, extent of visceral and osseous dissemination, general state of the patient and his life expectancy. Therapy should focus on the patient's needs and be correlated with the expectations and prognosis of the patient. There exist a number of valid prognostic scores to support and objectify the decision. There has been a change of paradigmata with regard to surgical treatment, supported by an improvement in oncosurgical and anesthesiological fields. Surgery is indicated in case of instability or neurological compromise, in respect of the general state and life expectancy and can be performed from a ventral, dorsal or combined approach. Alternative or complimentary treatment methods are radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery and additive therapies like sequential embolization, antiresorptive medication or corticoid therapy. Therapy should be established by a multidisciplinary tumor board. Main issue for treatment decisions is palliation and optimizing the patient's quality of life.","1120":"Revision total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most demanding as well as increasing orthopaedic operations. The influence of a higher body weight or body mass index (BMI) on the results of revision TKA is not evident so far. We therefore hypothesised that obesity as well as a high body weight could influence the results of revision TKA. 75 consecutive revision TKA in 75 patients were included and stratified according to a BMI greater or smaller than 30 kg\/m2 and a body weight greater or smaller than 90 kg. The Knee Society score (KSS), the function and the knee subscales were analysed pre- and postoperatively as well as the pre- to postoperative improvement. The duration of the procedure, the occurrence of complications, the blood loss and the length of hospital stay were collected. All patients showed a significant improvement of the KSS and function score (p &lt; 0.05). There was a tendency to superior results in patients with a smaller BMI and a lower body weight. This tendency was most pronounced in the function subscale which depicted significant differences in favour of a BMI smaller 30 kg\/m2. No significant differences were observed in the other analysed factors. BMI greater than 30 kg\/m2 as well as a higher body weight seem to negatively influence the function of revision TKA. However, all patients significantly improved after revision TKA and no differences were found according to the occurrence of complications. Therefore, revision TKA should not be refused to obese or heavy patients. ","1121":"Blood transfusions are daily practice in orthopaedic surgery and traumatology. Due to new surgical techniques and a better understanding of anaemia-associated pathophysiology, the indications for transfusion are becoming more and more strict.

This article is intended to provide an overview of the literature in recent years dealing with this problem.","1122":null,"1123":"Proximal femoral fractures are common in the elderly. Surgical and postoperative complications are of major importance in this population. Numerous factors affecting the treatment results could be identified so far. The effect of surgeons' experience in terms of educational status is not entirely clarified yet. The aim of the present study was to analyse the effect of surgeons' educational status on the outcome in proximal femoral fractures. Therefore treatment results were compared in terms of individual surgeons' experience. Furthermore, the surgical education concept of our department was evaluated. At a national trauma centre, patients of at least 60 years of age with proximal femoral fractures were prospectively screened. Patient-specific parameters like Barthel index, ASA score, Charlson score, patients' age and type of fracture were collected at the time of hospital admission. During the in-hospital stay type of fracture treatment, surgery time, number of blood transfusions, perioperative complications, duration of in-hospital stay as well as in-hospital mortality were recorded. Results were analysed for osteosynthesis and prosthesis depending on the surgeons' educational status. Four different groups of surgeons were distinguished (inexperienced senior house officer; experienced senior house officer; specialist in orthopaedics and accident surgery; specialist in orthopaedics and accident surgery with an additional qualification for special accident surgery). 402 patients with coxal femoral fractures could be included into the study. 160 patients (40 %) sustained complications of different severity. In-hospital mortality was shown to be 6.2 %. Separate consideration of osteosynthesis and prosthesis revealed no difference between the four groups of surgeons regarding mortality rate, number of blood transfusions and in-hospital stay. In terms of cutting\/suture time consultants with a further specialisation in trauma surgery were significantly faster. Apart from cutting\/suture time, surgeons' educational status had no statistically significant impact on the rate of complications, rate of blood transfusions, hospital mortality and in-hospital stay. It can be presumed that surgical education according to our educational concept has no negative effects on treatment quality of patients with proximal femoral fractures. Differences in cutting\/suture time give a hint for the additional expense that is connected with surgical education. ","1124":"Modular distal femur replacements originally were developed for reconstructing a full weight-bearing and functional extremity after resection of primary bone tumours with large bony defects located in proximity to joints. The aim of this study was to examine the use of the modular distal femur replacements for complex fractures and severe post-traumatic sequelae of the distal femur in context to comparable studies. Fourteen patients with complex fractures or post-traumatic sequelae and extensive bone defects requiring distal femur replacement were analysed retrospectively. Median age of the patients at the time of distal femoral replacement was 77 years and median follow-up interval was 27 months. Median follow-up was 27.0 (IQB 13.5-37.5) months (range 10-49 months). The indication for distal femur replacement was a periprosthetic fracture in three cases. Three further periprosthetic fractures were treated with a megaendoprosthesis after failure of osteosynthesis. In eight patients a megaendoprosthesis was implanted due to complications following ostheosynthesis for distal femoral fractures. Distal femoral arthroplasty was performed as a two-stage procedure in five patients with implant-associated infections. A lateral approach was used in six patients and a medial arthrotomy was conducted in eight patients. The median Knee Society score (KSS) improved significantly from 20.0 (IQB 7.5-30.0) points preoperatively to 80.0 (IQB 62.3-89.0) points at follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). Complications requiring surgical intervention were documented in seven of 14 patients (50 %). In two patients wound-healing disorders and superficial infections necessitated surgery. In one patient a rupture of the patellar tendon was diagnosed. This patient subsequently also sustained a periprosthetic fracture. Another patient developed early aseptic loosening of the femoral component. The most common complication was a periprosthetic fracture in four patients. Three patients died for reasons not related to distal femoral replacement. Distal femoral replacement is an important option in reconstituting a full weight-bearing and functional lower extremity after complex fractures and post-traumatic sequelae with massive bone destruction. Particularly elderly patients regain ambulatory ability in the vast majority of cases. The relatively high complication rate demands very thorough preoperative planning as well as prompt allocation of extensive surgical procedures in the case of an adverse event.

There is, however, a lack of mandatory standard values for competitive athletes and normal individuals. In addition, research findings concerning the clinical relevance of qualitative changes such as hypoechogenic regions are still inconclusive. 202 national squad athletes from the German track and field federation and 199 age-matched normal individuals were examined sonographically. 404 patellar tendons of athletes were compared as to tendon diameter at the (i) proximal insertion, (ii) waist, and (iii) distal insertion with 398 patellar tendons of normal individuals using the portable ultrasound scanner \"Just Vision\". Furthermore, qualitative pathologies and clinical symptoms were assessed. Athletes reported more clinical symptoms and their tendons were thicker than normal tendons at all three positions (all p's &lt; 0.01). In athletes, proximal diameters above 6.0 mm were very likely to go along with clinical symptoms. There was an association between tendon diameter and symptoms at all three positions among the athletes, whereas in controls, this was only true for the proximal insertion. Only few consistent qualitative differences were found between athletes and normal individuals. The pattern of results confirms the clinical relevance of the proximal tendon diameter for patellar tendinopathy and provides standard values which should be evaluated in future research with regard to their prognostic utility in competitive sports. The importance of qualitative pathologies such as hypoechogenic regions could not be firmly asserted.

One year prior to admission, a planned joint replacement was not performed due to an existing ulcus cruris. After healing of the ulcus cruris, the patient presented with progressive pain and instability of the left knee without any trauma. The clinical examination showed a multidirectional instability of the left knee with a restricted range of motion (ROM) with 0-0-40 degrees for extension and flexion. The performed radiological examination revealed an anterior knee dislocation of the left knee. Intraoperative findings suggest a non-traumatic aetiology.

In a preliminary study we were able to show that fitted compression gloves had a positive effect. In a prospective randomised study the effect of compression treatment on the rehabilitation period was examined. In this study including 57 patients it was shown that due to a quicker reduction of swelling, measured via the circumference and volume of the forearm the range of motion increased faster than in the control group without compression treatment. Volume differed by 16 % between the injured and healthy arm in the compression group, yet by 25 % in the control group, representing a significant difference.

A statistically significant relation in the treatment statistics between the quality of the stump and the socket type can be shown. A mesh graft to cover the stump, extreme volume fluctuation, low activity class and co-morbidities are the main reasons for the use of a liner system. Main reasons for a change to a liner system were the preservation of individual independence, better adhesion and skin problems.

Osteoporosis affects women more frequently than men; every second woman older than 50 years suffers from an osteoporotic fracture, frequently a vertebral fracture. The aim of this study was to induce osteoporosis in rats to establish an osteoporotic small-animal model that simulates the human pathology particularly in the spine. Therefore, bone density parameters, which are routinely determined in the spine of osteoporotic patients, were investigated by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA). Fourteen-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 50) were either sham-operated (control group: sham) or ovariectomised (experimental group). Ovariectomised rats were further divided into two groups; one received calcium\/vitamin D2\/D3 deficient diet (OVX + diet), and the other received subcutaneous steroid injections (dexamethasone 0.3 mg\/kg body weight) twice a month (OVX + steroid). Rats were scanned by DEXA at three time points (Month = M, 0 M, 1 M and 3 M). DEXA measurement of the spine delivered T-value, Z-value, bone mineral content (BMC), and the scanned area. Fifteen female patients at an age of 57-72 years were scanned in 8-10 regions of the spine (150 measurements). T-values and Z-values were pre-calculated based on patient databases. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction, with significance considered at p &lt; 0.05. T-value and Z-value of both rat groups were compared with the patient data as well as with each others. Both treated rat groups revealed significantly lower T- and Z-values than controls. Despite the significant difference, the reference line (-2.5 for T-value and -1.5 for Z-value) was only reached by the OVX + diet group. On the other hand, the sham group showed an increase in BMC over time, while no change was seen in OVX + diet or OVX + steroid. Bone area demonstrated a significant increase up to M3. However, the increase in bone area within the OVX + diet group was notably higher than in both sham and OVX + steroid groups. Patients showed significantly lower T- and Z-values than sham and OVX + steroid but insignificant ones when compared with OVX + diet. A reproducible vertebral osteoporosis can be generated in a rat model by combination of ovariectomy with administration of a calcium\/vitamin D3 deficient diet. T- and Z-values of this experimental group mimicked values obtained from osteoporotic patients, reflecting a simulation of their pathology. Interestingly, the increase in bone area over time with the steady BMC results in lower mineral density (BMD) of the OVX + diet group.

However, several authors recommend analysing the spinopelvic relation in addition to the SVA. While compensatory mechanisms may neutralise a positive SVA, these mechanisms are energy consuming and may lead to unphysiological biomechanics, which can negatively influence the quality of life. The purpose of this radiographic analysis was to analyse global sagittal balance and to identify potential compensatory mechanisms after segmental instrumentation for AIS. From a prospectively collected multicentre database, patients with segmental instrumentation for AIS and a minimum follow-up of 2 years were identified. An additional inclusion criterion was the ability to measure lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence (PI), and SVA on each X-ray (preoperative, 1st erect, and the 2-year follow-up visits). LL was analysed in relation to PI in order to identify iatrogenic changes. Changes in LL were correlated to changes in PT and SVA. 91 patients were included. On the 1st erect X-ray, LL significantly decreased from pre-op but the SVA remained stable due to a significant increase of PT. At two years follow-up, PT recurred to preoperative values, accompanied by a significant increase of SVA despite a compensatory hyperlordosis below the instrumentation. The temporary increase of PT on the 1st erect was significantly correlated to an iatrogenic decrease of LL. An iatrogenic decrease of LL was significantly correlated to an increase of SVA on the 1st erect and at 2 years follow-up.

However, the patients' desire to resume driving at an early stage after hip arthroplasty is often faced by the uncertainty about their driving ability. Only little evidence is available to support the clinical decision-making with regard to driving competence after conventional total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, there is no proof that the results observed after THA can be transferred to hip resurfacing arthroplasty (HRA) patients. Due to physiological advantages, i.e., patient age and activity, as well as the special biomechanical implant characteristics, HRA patients could be expected to achieve normal braking capacity at an earlier stage in the rehabilitation process than THA patients. This could be achieved by an accelerated postoperative recovery or could depend on the preoperative vantage point concerning the patients' braking capacity. To verify this hypothesis HRA and THA patients were compared to healthy subjects concerning their ability to perform an emergency braking manoeuvre in a car simulator before surgery, and at 6 weeks and 3 months after operation. Furthermore, postoperative recovery rates were compared between the two groups of patients. In addition, correlations between pre- and postoperative braking capacity were tested. Reaction time, movement time and force-time integral on the brake pedal were analysed. Except for a deficient preoperative force-time integral, no significant differences were detected in HRA patients compared to healthy controls. In contrast THA patients required, pre- as well as postoperatively, a longer movement time and exhibited a smaller force-time integral. The two patient groups did not show any significant difference in recovery rates of movement time and force-time integral. However, considering the two patient groups as a whole, a significant correlation was detected between existing pre- and postoperative deficits. In conclusion, it can be confirmed that HRA patients resume normal braking capacity at an earlier stage in their rehabilitation process than THA patients. Patients recommended for HRA recover braking capacity at the latest six weeks after surgery. This capacity clearly depends on the better preoperative status of the HRA patients and is not determined by a faster recovery rate. General patient-related advantages as well as biomechanical aspects of HRA have thus no influence on the recovery rates of braking capacity during the first three months after surgery. Due to the increasing outpatient rehabilitation regime after HRA, further studies are necessary to detect the turning point after surgical impairment within the first six weeks after surgery. Concerning the THA patients we recommend a longer safety distance when driving a car for up to three months after the operation. However, patients, especially those assigned to THA, should be made aware of their most likely already existing preoperative deficit. For clinical practice a rough estimation of postoperative braking capacity seems to be possible based on group assignment (HRA\/THA). Nevertheless, deviators cannot be detected by this group classification.

Hard cutting technique and knowledge or the histomorphometry are indispensable prerequisites.","1190":"Cemented augmentation of osteosynthesis for the treatment of peritrochanteric fractures in elderly patients has been under discussion for years. We propose this option as a salvage procedure in cases of instability after standard osteosynthesis. After reduction and optional re-osteosynthesis a Jamshidi needle is placed transcutanously or through the open wound cranio-lateral of the tip of the hip screw. Cement augmentation can be performed under fluoroscopic control. The patients were monitored for at least 7 months postoperatively to rule out a redislocation. From 1\/2009 to 1\/2011 we treated 6 patients (5 female, 1 male, age 83.8 [79-94] years). We performed 4 augmentations and 2 augmentations with additional re-osteosynthesis. OP time was 26.8 (13-45) minutes. The revision was performed 9.7 (4-14) days after the osteosynthesis. Within 14.7 (7-28) months no redislocation and no surgical complication occurred. Even with a small patient number the good results show the potential of this minimally invasive technique. In our opinion this option allows a fast and technically easy salvage procedure without blocking of further treatment options like a prosthesis.

The morphology of the lesions is very variable and represents a spectrum of instability. Conventional classification is not applicable for all fracture types. Therapy includes a wide range between conservative and operative concepts. The choice of treatment is determined by the degree and the localization of the instability.

A promising technique are cement augumented pedicle screws. The goal of this study was to gain more information regarding application of pedicle screw augmentation in Germany. Participants of the National German Spine Congress 2009 were invited to participate in an internet-based anonymous survey regarding application of pedicle screw augmentation. The questionnaire was related to different aspects of materials and procedures for pedicle screw augmentation. The frequency of answers was divided according to the specialty state of the surgeons: orthopaedic and trauma surgeons vs. neurosurgeons. The Mantel-Haenszel test was applied to evaluate the differences between the groups. 69 (64 %) orthopaedic and trauma surgeons and 39 (36 %) neurosurgeons participated (n = 108). Nearly 80 % of the participants use cement-augmented pedicle screws in their daily practice. Almost 2\/3 of the specialists apply cannulated screws or other special screws. The Expedium (Company) screws are particularly preferred. The insertion of screws is combined with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in 20 % of the cases. The balloon kyphoplasty was applied most commonly. There was no statistical difference between the surgeon groups regarding the different techniques. The main indications for pedicle screw augmentation were osteoporosis, intraoperative findings as well as loosening of screws, and revision. The most frequently observed complication is cement extravasation into the spinal canal (28 %). The cost issue is considered as being important but unknown to most of the participants. It can be assumed that the use of pedicle screws in Germany is well established in spine surgery, without as yet a standard technique being established. ","1214":"In this paper we present our first experience in the application of a new, fixed-angle plate fixation: the locking attachment plate (LAP, Synthes, Oberdorf, Switzerland). We examined whether the LAP is a useful addition to the existing technical palette for periprosthetic fractures. The LAP is used for periprosthetic fractures with stable prostheses or intramedullary implants. The plate can be installed, e.g., on a 4.5 mm locking compression plate (LCP). Locking screws or cortical screws can be placed through its 4 diagonal fixed-angle arms, bicortical around the prosthesis stem into the bone. The LAP is designed to prevent lateral screw pull-out, to stabilise the prosthesis stem and thus to allow early postoperative mobilisation of patients. We implanted the LAP by operative fracture-treatment in the ORIF technique in 17 patients with periprosthetic fractures of the femur, tibia and humerus. The follow-up was at least 13 months. There were two losses to follow-up: the patients died a few weeks postoperatively. There was a total of two of 17 cases with infection events (11.8 %). We could examine 15 patients for follow-up. Eleven of these 15 patients regained their original range of motion (ROM) and nine of 15 patients their pretraumatic mobility. In all cases with periprosthetic humeral fractures we detected muscular deficits. In five out of 15 cases (33.3 %) no radiological fracture healing could be observed. Nevertheless in 14 of 15 cases the implant was stable without signs of implant or prosthetic loosening. There was no case of material failure. Periprosthetic fractures are an increasingly common complication in old, often multi-morbid patients. A contemporary therapeutic intervention and early postoperative mobilisation contribute substantially to the success of treatment. The first results in the use of the LAP as a new implant option for periprosthetic fractures of the femur, tibia and humerus are promising. Further studies are necessary to show whether our overall good results are reproducible in larger groups of patients and whether the LAP can be given a firm position in the technical repertoire for treatment of periprosthetic fractures. ","1215":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) revisions are increasing due to the rising numbers of primary cases, younger patients and an aging population. The technical demand of these procedures is incomparable higher than in primary cases. Also the expectable clinical results are inferior. Measures to improve the clinical results are desireable. PATIENTS\/MATERIAL: 203 unconstrained knee arthroplasties were explanted in 2009 in a single centre. In 150 cases those were TKAs. Fractures were excluded. These cases were analysed with special attention to the reason for the failure. Clinical and radiological data were included. Survival of revised implants was in the mean 55 months (range: 0,5-125 months). In 46 cases components showed an aseptic loosening (30.7 %), 37 TKAs were unstable (24.7 %), in 26 cases stiffness was detected (17.3 %), and nine misplaced TKA components (five femoral, two tibial, two combined; total 6 %) as well as three broken inlays (2 %) were encountered. In 25 cases deep infection was observed (16.7 %) and four patients complained of an unspecific anterior knee pain (2.6 %). Three TKAs were removed for a two-staged procedure. In five cases an inlay exchange was performed and in another five cases a conversion from cruciate retaining to posterior stabilised state was performed. In 60 cases a rotating hinged TKA was implanted (40 %) and in 42 a pure hinge (28 %). In 45 cases a condylar constrained TKA system (CCK, 30 %) was used. Range of movement increased with the procedure. Plain radiographs were inferior in detecting all loosening in advance. This study demonstrated that in more than one third of the cases the revision could have been avoided and was due to technical errors during the primary procedure. Infection and arthrofibrosis were besides unspecific complaints less often observed than is described in the literature. This study supports the high demand on the technical issues during the primary procedure which should be conducted by experienced surgeons. Registry data from Germany should allow the provision of more specific information in the future. ","1216":"The treatment of cartilage defects has seen a shift from replacement to regeneration in the last few years. The rationale behind this development is the improvement in the quality-of-care for the growing segment of young patients who are prone to arthroplasty complications because of their specific characteristics - young age, high level of activity, high demand for functionality. These days, two of the most popular regenerative treatments are microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). Although these new options show promising results, no final algorithm for the treatment of cartilage lesions has been established as yet. The objective of this review is to describe and compare these two treatment options and to present an evidence-based treatment algorithm for focal cartilage defects. Microfracture is a cost-effective, arthroscopic one-stage procedure, in which by drilling of the subchondral plate, mesenchymal stem cells from the bone marrow migrate into the defect and rebuild the cartilage. ACI is a two-stage procedure in which first chondrocytes are harvested, expanded in cell culture and in a second open procedure reimplanted into the cartilage defect. Microfracture is usually used for focal cartilage defects &lt; 4 cm2, the treated defect size of the ACI seems to have a wider range. The effectiveness of these two treatments has been shown in long-term longitudinal studies, where microfracture showed improvement in up to 95 % of patients, whereas 92 % of the patients in a 2-9 year period of follow-up after ACI showed improvements, respectively. The successful outcome of the treatment depends on multiple factors such as the location of the defect, cell differentiation and proliferation, concomitant problems, and the age of the patient. Associated complications and disadvantages of the two different applications are, for the microfracture patient, a poor tissue differentation or a formation of an intra-lesional osteophyte, and for the ACI patient, periosteal hypertrophy and the need for two procedures in ACI. Only a few studies provide detailed and evidence-based information on a comparative assessment. These studies, however, are showing widely similar clinical outcomes but better histological results for ACI, which are likely to translate into better long-term outcomes. Although evidence-based studies comparing microfracture and ACI have not found significant differences in the clinical outcome, the literature does show that choosing the treatment based on the size and characteristics of the osteochondral lesion might be beneficial. The American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons suggest that contained lesions &lt; 4 cm2 should be treated by microfracture, lesions bigger than that by ACI.

In conclusion, splenic injury is a rare but potentially lethal complication in the operative treatment of thoracolumbar fractures. Therefore postoperative abdominal sonography should routinely be done and in case of haemodynamic instability the possibility of splenic injury must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis.","1224":null,"1225":"Dislocations after total hip arthroplasties are one of the most common complications of the procedure. According to registers, recurrent hip dislocations account for up to 30 % of the indications for a revision operation. The incidence of a dislocation is influenced by indication-associated, patient-dependent and operation-specific risk factors. 50 % of the dislocations occur within the first 3 months which confirms the high relevance of operation-specific influencing factors. The diagnosis is almost always made with the help of computed tomography, as this is the only method to determine the three-dimensional relationship of the components. A dynamic fluoroscopic examination can verify an increased translation (reduced soft-tissue tension) and thus enables a functional examination to determine the mechanism of the dislocation. By means of a classification of dislocations into five types under consideration of the implant position, the sufficiency of the pelvitrochantar musculature, the presence of an impingement, the congruence of head and acetabular liner as well as combinations of these factors it is possible to plan an adequate therapy. From the therapeutic point of view the correct positioning of the stem and head is of decisive importance. In addition therapeutic success can be realized by using larger head diameters through to tripolar sockets, reconstruction of soft tissues and, last but not least, an adequate postoperative immobilization. Even so, this treatment is associated with a high rate of complications and in the literature failure rates of up to one third, i.e., the reoccurrence of a dislocation, are reported.","1226":"For the clinical planning of mass events the emergency departments are of critical importance, but there are still no data available for the workload in these cases. As this is essential for an effective medical preparation, we calculated the workload based on the ICD codes of the vicitims at the Loveparade 2010 in Duisburg. Based on the patient data of the Loveparade 2010 we used a filter diagnosis to estimate the number of shock room patients, regular admittances, surgical wound treatments, applications of casts or splints, and diagnosis of drug abuse. In addition every patient was classified to a Manchester Triage System category. This resulted in a chronological and quantitative work-load profile of the emergency department, which was evaluated by the clinical experiences of the departmental medical staff. The workload profile as a whole displayed a realistic image of the real true situation on July 24, 2010. While only the number, diagnosis and chronology of medical surgical patients was realistic, the MTS classification was not. The emergency department had a maximum of 6 emergency room admittances, 6 regular admittances, 4-5 surgical wound treatments, 3 casts and 2 drug abuse patients per hour. The calculation of workload from the ICD data is a reasonable tool for retrospective estimation of the workload of an emergency department, the data can be used for future planning. The retrospective MTS grouping is at present not suitable for a realistic calculation. Retrospective measures in the MTS groups are at present not sufficiently suitable for valid data publication.

Patient satisfaction, the simple shoulder test (SST), the American shoulder elbow score (ASES) as well as the Constant score (CS) were assessed, and radiological parameters as well as complications analysed. 85 % of patients in group 1 and 73 % in group 2 were satisfied with the results. The SST did not show a significant difference between both groups. The adjusted ASES did not differ significantly with 70 (27-95)% in group 1 and 73 (28-100)% in group 2, as well as the adjusted CS with a mean of 53 (27-83)% in group 1 and of 49 (27-87)% in group 2.

","1240":"Today there are different subcutaneous and three oral applicable medications for prevention of venous thromboembolism after knee and hip replacement. It is a general opinion that patients will prefer oral administration. However, until today there has been no study that analysed patient preferences and motives for deciding on the kind of administration. These data would be of interest since the consideration of patient preferences could improve adherence. The present study analysed patient preferences regarding oral or subcutaneous administration of medication after elective hip or knee replacement surgery. The results will have implications for clinical practice and for decision-making concerning the kind of administration. This prospective, multi-centric, observational study was conducted in six emergency hospitals and six rehabilitation hospitals. 178 current hip and knee replacement patients undergoing thromboprophylaxis and at least one further oral medication were interviewed. Subjective assessment data of patients were collected on study-specific questionnaires (epidemiological data, amount and background of general oral medication, details on subcutaneous thromboprophylaxis, preference of administration, causes for preference). 71.91 % of the interviewed patients preferred the daily intake of a tablet, whereas only 14.61 % favoured the daily subcutaneous injection. Main causes for the preference of oral administration were easier (86.6 % of nominations) and less complex (73.1 % of nominations) handling. 70.9 % reported that one more oral application would be unproblematic. Painlessness of oral administration was relevant for 65.7 %. Causes for preferring subcutaneous administration were \"safety\" (55.3 % of nominations) and an assumption of a generally better effectivity of subcutaneous (47.4 % of nominations) administration. Subjective discomfort induced by subcutaneus administration increased with the time interval since surgery. Less than 5 % of patients prefer subcutaneous administration due to the high volume of their existing oral medication. Patient approval of oral administration is governed by practical and comfort issues. In general, patients on existing oral medications are uncritical concerning a temporary additional oral medication. The clear discomfort measured in association with subcutaneous administration supports the idea that the oral route will have advantages for patient adherence. In particular this is of relevance with increasing time interval since surgery. Patients who have a very high volume of oral medications will probably profit from subcutaneous administration. The main reasons that patients gave for the preference of subcutaneous administration are based on incorrect knowledge. Therefore it is necessary to improve patient education concerning the existing alternatives for thromboprophylaxis.

The previously used term tendinitis is only rarely used for the chronic form since signs of inflammation such as redness and hyperthermia or elevated levels of inflammatory parameters on laboratory testing are generally absent. Duplex sonography with visualization of the neovascularization has become a valuable supplement not only for diagnostics but also for therapy planning. The classic, conservative therapy for painful tendinosis consists of oral anti-inflammatory drugs, pain-adapted load reduction, raising the heel, stretching the calf musculature, and various physiotherapeutic interventions. When conservative treatment over a period of 4 - 6 months fails to produce any or non-adequate pain relief, an indication for surgical treatment should be considered. In the therapy for fresh ruptures of the Achilles tendon further developments in minimally invasive techniques have led to a worldwide paradigm change over the past 10 years. The decisive advantage of minimally invasive surgical techniques is the lower risk of wound infection as compared to the sutures of the open technique. When compared with conservative functional therapy the minimally invasive repair has the advantage of being less dependent on the compliance of the patient since, in the early phase of tendon healing the suture prevents a separation of the tendon ends upon controlled movements. However, not every patient with a ruptured Achilles tendon should be treated with a minimally invasive repair. Open tendon reconstruction and functional conservative therapy are still justified when the correct indication is given.","1245":null,"1246":"","1247":null,"1248":null,"1249":"Lawn mower injuries in children usually involve the lower extremities and can lead to serious amputation injuries.

After failure of the conservative treatment, surgical bursectomy and resection of the calcaneal exostosis are indicated by many authors. But clinical studies also show a high rate of unsatisfactory results with a relative high incidence of complications. The minimally invasive surgical technique by an endoscopic calcaneoplasty (ECP) could be an option to overcome some of these problems. Between 1999 und 2010 we operated 164 patients with an age range between 16 and 67 years, 81 males and 83 females. The radiological examination prior to surgery documented in all cases a posterior superior calcaneal exostosis that showed friction to the Achilles tendon. All patients included in the study had no clinical varus of the hind foot, nor cavus deformities. All patients had undergone a trial of conservative treatment for at least 6 months and did not show a positive response. The average follow-up was 46.3 (range: 8-120) months. According to the Ogilvie-Harris score 71 patients presented good and 84 patients excellent results, while 5 patients showed fair results, and 4 patients only poor results. All the post-operative radiographs showed sufficient resection of the calcaneal spur. In 61 patients the preoperative MRI showed a partial rupture of the Achilles tendon close to the insertion side. In no case could we observe a complete tear at the time of follow-up. Only minor postoperative complications were observed. In many patients we could observe a chondral layer at the posterior aspect of the calcaneus. Close to the intersion the Achilles tendon showed also in many patients a chondroide metaplasia. ECP is an effective and minimally invasive procedure for the treatment of patients with calcaneal exostosis.

An orientation on these revenues alone, however, does not provide the basis for an economically sound decision-making process. The aim of this study is to present a comparison of the variable costs of the two procedures. The mean cost and performance data of 28 Endo-Model UKA implantations and of 85 NexGen CR TKA replacements were compared with each other in 2007. From the perspective of the hospital, when the correct medical indication is present, UKA treatment is of greater economic advantage. In this way the total unit contribution margin can be improved, and although the relative weighting is comparatively low, the costs are significantly lower than in a comparative analysis of the TKA. For the desired maximisation of the unit contribution margin, assuming that it is the proper medical indication, the recommendation for the hospital would be implantation of the UKA.

Little is known about the adequate treatment and results in patients with infection of proximal femur fractures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the different treatment options for eradication of infection as well as to analyse the clinical outcome and quality of life. 40 patients treated for infected proximal femur fractures between 2001 and 2010 were retrospectively analysed. Quality of life was assessed in 21 patients after an average of 40 months using the WOMAC and the SF-12 score. Surgical treatment included complete removal of infected implants and radical debridement. In 20 patients resection arthroplasty had to be performed. Ten patients were treated with a modular prosthesis, 4 patients were treated with a proximal femur replacement. Due to severe infection and risk-increasing comorbidities, resection arthroplasty had to be performed in the remaining 12 patients. Re-osteosynthesis could be performed in 13 patients. Average time of treatment was 67 days. At the time of follow-up the rate of mortality proved to be 15%. The rate of reinfection was 14.6%. At the time of follow-up infection was still prevalent in 2 patients. Dislocation after the hip prosthesis occurred in 3 of 14 patients. Of the 13 patients who received re-osteosynthesis one patient suffered a reinfection. Delayed fracture healing was treated with spongiosa grafts in 2 cases. 33% of the patients with resection arthroplasty died during follow-up. Statistical analysis showed better results in WOMAC and SF-12 scores in patients with hip prosthesis. Patients with re-osteosynthesis showed a larger variation in results.

The porous coated AMC-ceramic cups were taken out after a healing period of 8 and 52 weeks after unilateral implantation in 5 and 6 sheep, respectively. The osseointegration was analysed histomorphologically and histomorphometrically by representative serial sections after dying according to Masson-Goldner. The examination was stratified according the pole and the rim areas as a press-fit cup with an extended rim was used. Two animals had a hip dislocation after 8 weeks and these animals were excluded from the study and replaced. The cups were appraised as stable in the bony bed. Histologically, the rim area of the acetabular cup showed a higher osseointegration rate than the pole area. The rate of osseointegration in total was 3% after 8 weeks and 7% after 52 weeks. The rim area furnished 5.1% after 8 and 8.6% after 52 weeks. At the pole the osseointegration was 1,2% after 8 and 5.5% after 52 weeks. No significant differences were seen between both assessed time periods regarding the osseointegration rates. The bone showed an interlocking aspect with the pores of the coating as bony tissue was determined in the pores. The presented pilot study revealed a stable osseointegration of porous-coated AMC-ceramic monoblock cups one year after surgery in a weight-bearing animal model.

Studies on patients after surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) rarely have follow-up rates that reach 80% after 5 years or 70% after 10 years. While there is general consensus that a high patient drop-out rate will decrease the accuracy of a study, little is known about the characteristics of those patients who have dropped out. The purpose of the present study was to identify patients who were lost to follow-up after surgical correction of AIS and to compare their clinical characteristics to those of patients who were available for follow-up. All members of a popular scoliosis-specific online community were asked to submit information about demographic, surgical, and clinical characteristics. Patients who had surgical treatment for AIS and a minimum of 12 months since surgery were grouped into \"lost to follow-up - LTF\" and \"follow-up - FU\" based on whether they had changed their orthopedist or not after surgery. Demographic, surgical, and clinical characteristics with the use of the SRS-22 instrument were then compared. 271 patients submitted information of whom 81 patients (39 FU, 42 LTF) fulfilled all inclusion criteria. No difference was found in terms of age at surgery, surgical approach, number of fused levels, or revision rate whereas major curve correction and time since surgery showed significant differences. A subanalysis that was done after matching patients for time since surgery revealed significant differences for the SRS-22 domains function, pain, mental health, and total score in favour of the FU group. We found significant clinical differences for patients who are lost to follow-up when compared to patients who are available for follow-up. While we are aware of the difficulties in obtaining high follow-up rates for a clinical study, care should be taken in analysing studies with low follow-up rates because results may be skewed.

Besides choosing an optimal treatment strategy, in particular the time of absence from sports is of major relevance, not least because especially an \"early return to play\" may often qualify or disqualify a sports physician in the perception of the involved persons. Time pressure of a club and an athlete as well as an increasing number of matches per season may often result in inadequate rehabilitation periods or doubtful medical decisions and thus an increasing risk of reinjuries. On the other hand, professional sports may often reveal decisive circumstances, e.g., playing a final or special sportive pretensions of an athlete or a club, when - from a medical point of view - the classical \"can or cannot play\"-decision seams inappropriate. This article describes the borderline dilemma between responsible medical acting, irrespective of any sportive pressure of an athlete or the club and the need to concurrently take account of special circumstances in professional soccer sports. Furthermore, regarding the actual literature, a new decision model is presented which facilitates a responsible and well-balanced return to play decision respecting all the above named aspects.","1275":null,"1276":"Practical training on clinical cases and work with patients is one of the most important steps within the educational programme of undergraduates.

The development of coxarthrosis from a cam impingement, i.e., the loss of offset of the neck of the femur and degenerative damage to the acetabular lip as its early form, is seen again in the clinical picture of slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Depending on the degree of slippage, we see a varying severity of the loss of offset and thus also different extents of the potential damage to the hip joint. This knowledge is by no means new. The questions of reorientation of the epiphysis of the humeral head and thus restoration of the anatomy of the coxal end of the femur have been addressed by renowned surgeons and answered with the development of widely varying procedures for surgical correction.

A 66-year-old female patient was admitted to the emergency room after a car accident. Initial treatment was performed in a regional hospital. Initial clinical and radiological examinations were without any pathologies and the patient was discharged home after ambulatory treatment. Six days later, the patient was referred to our hospital because of increasing headache. A computed tomography of the head showed a subdural haematoma. A follow-up CT scan after three days showed no further progression of the haematoma. During the hospital stay, the patient developed abdominal pain, nausea and cardiovascular decompensation. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed free fluids, while a performed CT scan of the abdomen confirmed an arterial bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm of the left ovarian artery. An emergency operation was performed. Postoperative management included ICU monitoring, diuresis control and blood transfusion. The patient was discharged home after 19 days in a good condition.

However, there is still a dramatic shortage in younger generation physicians, especially within the surgical fields. The goal of this cross-sectional study was the gender-specific assessment of the ideal career wishes of students during medical school, with a focus being placed in orthopaedic trauma surgery. During the winter semester of 2010\/2011 an online questionnaire (www.surveymonkey.com) was created for students enrolled in their 3rd to 12th semester (n=887). The questionnaire consisted of 50 questions [Likert scale (LS); 5 = agree, 1 = disagree] along with 10 free response questions. The scope of these questions ranged from personal career goals, within the context of their learning environment, to general life goals and planning. With regard to career choice, a differentiation was made between students' ideal career choices\/subjects (IS), which were based solely on personal affinity, and so-called reality-based subjects (RS), which students considered more practical and to which they were more likely to apply in the future. The response rate was 36,4% (n=323, 23,4 years, 6.3 semesters, 226 [70.0%] female [f] and 97 [30.0%] male [m]). A total of 206 students (63.8%; m=55.7% vs. f=66.7%; p=0.047) were able to pinpoint an IS, this percentage increased with increasing semester number (p=0.048). Overall, 29.1% of students indicated that their IS lay in the field of orthopaedic trauma, while 20.0% of men and 19.1% of women saw it as a realistic career path (RS). Throughout the course of their studies, from the 3rd semester to their practical year, a declining tendency was observed regarding the agreement between ideal and realistic career paths. Particularly evident was a decreasing interest in the field of orthopaedic trauma, beginning around the 9th semester and during the practical year, especially among the female student population. The reason for this shift seems multifactorial, ranging from concerns about family planning as well as the work load in a male-dominated field. By the time students enter their practical year, 13.5% of women and 15.4% of men were still certain in their choice to pursue a career in orthopaedic trauma (RS). It seems that there is great interest in the fields of orthopaedic trauma among both female and male students in the middle portion of their studies. Women, especially, tend to prefer a specialisation in this operative field early in the course of their studies. However, this pool of potential successors decreases dramatically with time, due to personal experiences garnered on the wards, expectations regarding career paths (male-dominated, long hours) as well as concerns about family planning. The most dramatic shift seems to occur during the practical year. ","1295":"Proximal ulna fractures are common injuries in the upper extremity.

The EbM commentary was developed within the Swiss Orthopaedic Society and is a vital part of the Annual Meetings. The EbM commentary is a carefully prepared critical appraisal of an orally presented study by a specially trained colleague. The commentary consists of three components and begins with a systematic analysis following the SPION principle. What kind of study was carried out? Which patients were enrolled in the investigation? What kind of interventions were compared? How was the outcome measured? What is the benefit of the study for my own practice and what is the benefit for the patient? The reporting and the evaluation of the patient benefit is of great interest. In the second step the strengths and weaknesses of the study were discussed and the study will be rated for their evidence. For the best case the presented study implies direct changes in the usual treatment of patients. In the worst case no changes are necessary and the study is rated \"so what\" because of methodological weaknesses making the drawn conclusions invalid. For the audience the EbM commentary may support their rating of the quality of the presented study. The congress team selects interesting presentations for the EbM commentary. The EbM commentators receive the oral presentation and in most cases additional information from the selected studies four weeks in advance of the meeting. The EbM commentary is focused on a precise analysis of the presented data in an open and pleasant discussion. The aim of the EbM commentary is to clearly point out the patient benefit and to disclose the biases and weaknesses.

The different methods of osteosynthesis are difficult to compare. Studies differ in many aspects such as favourable outcome, timing of surgery, clinical features, severity and stage of the disease. Therefore uniformity and comparability of the studies is not given. An evidence-based therapy algorithm for the surgical reconstruction of Charcot feet does not exist. A retrospective study of twelve patients with 13 affected feet who had undergone arthrodesis of the foot to treat Charcot deformity was performed. All surgical procedures were performed at Eichenholtz stage 3. Six patients showed an ulcer of the foot at the time of surgery, six patients were without pedal ulceration. Screw fixation was used for reconstruction and bone grafting was performed in all patients. Radiographic measurements were recorded preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, 3 months postoperatively and at the time of the last follow-up. Patients were evaluated clinically and radiographically at an average of 2.4 years. Complete osseous union was achieved in ten patients at an average of 4.3 months. There was one patient with a postoperative infection and an internal amputation, one patient with an unstable non-union, with recurrence of deformity. All pedal ulcers healed during the period of the osseous consolidation. All patients returned to an ambulatory status within 7 months. Open reduction and arthrodesis with the use of screw fixation alone for the surgical correction of Charcot arthropathy provide a good result compared to other fixation methods. ","1318":"The diagnosis and treatment of patellar dislocation is very complex. The aim of this study is to give an overview of the biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint and to point out the latest developments in diagnosis and treatment of patellar dislocation. The authors electronically searched Medline, Cochrane and Embase for studies on the biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint and for conservative and surgical treatments after patellar dislocation. We extracted baseline demographics, biomechanical, conservation and surgical details. Understanding the biomechanics of the patellofemoral joint is necessary to understand the pathology of patellar dislocation. The patellofemoral joint consists of a complex system of static, active and passive stabilising factors. Patellar instability can result from osseous and soft-tissue abnormalities, such as trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, a high tibial tuberosity trochlear groove (TTTG) distance, weaknesses of the vastus medialis obliquus or a lesion of the medial retinaculum. Recent studies have focused on the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) and have shown that the MPFL is the most significant passive stabiliser of the patella. Following patellar dislocation, an MRI should be standard practice to detect an MPFL rupture, osteochondral lesions or other risk factors for redislocation. An acute first-time patellar dislocation without osteochondral lesions and without severe risk factors for a redislocation should follow a conservative treatment plan. If surgical treatment is required, the best postoperative results occur when the MPFL is reconstructed, leading to a redislocation rate of 5%, this includes cases that have a dysplastic trochlea. Duplication of the medial retinaculum show very inconsistent results in the literature, possibly due to the fact that the essential pathomorphology of patellar dislocation is not addressed. Addressing the exact location of the rupture of the MPFL with a suture is possibly more convenient, especially after first-time dislocation with associated risk factors for a redislocation. Recent literature does not encourage the use of lateral release, since this can increase patellar instability. Indications for lateral release include persistent patellar instability or pain reduction in an older arthritic subject. For correcting a patellofemoral malalignment, the TTTG distance should be measured and a medial transposition of the anterior tibial tubercle hinged on a distal periosteal attachment should be considered. Cartilage lesions on the medial facet of the patella are a contra-indication for medial tubercle transposition. For cartilage lesions of the lateral facet, antero-medialization of the tibial tubercle can be successful. A tubercle osteotomy can be efficiently combined with MPFL reconstruction. We believe that patients with open epiphyseal plates should be treated with duplication of the medial retinaculum. In the presence of patellar maltracking, an additional subperiostal soft tissue release with medialisation of the distal part of the patellar tendon can be performed. It seems that the predominating factors for patellar dislocation are heterogenic morphology in combination with individual predisposition. Non-surgical treatment is typically recommended for primary patellar dislocation without any osteochondral lesions and in the absence of significant risk factors for redislocation. If surgical treatment is deemed necessary, addressing the essential pathomorphology has become the primary focus. ","1319":"The disease \"osteomyelitis\" is characterised by different symptoms and parameters. Decisive roles in the development of the disease are played by the causative bacteria, the route of infection and the individual defense mechanisms of the host. The diagnosis is based on different symptoms and findings from the clinical history, clinical symptoms, laboratory results, diagnostic imaging, microbiological and histopathological analyses. While different osteomyelitis classifications have been published, there is to the best of our knowledge no score that gives information how sure the diagnosis \"osteomyelitis\" is in general. For any scientific study of a disease a valid definition is essential. We have developed a special osteomyelitis diagnosis score for the reliable classification of clinical, laboratory and technical findings. The score is based on five diagnostic procedures: 1) clinical history and risk factors, 2) clinical examination and laboratory results, 3) diagnostic imaging (ultrasound, radiology, CT, MRI, nuclear medicine and hybrid methods), 4) microbiology, and 5) histopathology. Each diagnostic procedure is related to many individual findings, which are weighted by a score system, in order to achieve a relevant value for each assessment. If the sum of the five diagnostic criteria is 18 or more points, the diagnosis of osteomyelitis can be viewed as \"safe\" (diagnosis class A). Between 8-17 points the diagnosis is \"probable\" (diagnosis class B). Less than 8 points means that the diagnosis is \"possible, but unlikely\" (class C diagnosis). Since each parameter can score six points at a maximum, a reliable diagnosis can only be achieved if at least 3 parameters are scored with 6 points. The osteomyelitis diagnosis score should help to avoid the false description of a clinical presentation as \"osteomyelitis\". A safe diagnosis is essential for the aetiology, treatment and outcome studies of osteomyelitis. ","1320":null,"1321":"Distal radial fracture is the most common bony injury in man. Still there are unsatisfying treatment results, such as limited joint movement, muscle atrophy and pain, resulting from immobilisation while the fracture is healing. During this period, also joint movement seems to be \"forgotten\". This study experimentally examined if the method of mental practice, meaning the systematic repetition of a consciously imagined movement or action without simultaneous practical execution, can positively influence these findings. 21 right-handed males had application of a circular forearm plaster for immobilisation of their left radiocarpal joint, simulating a distal radial fracture for three weeks. Following randomisation, half of the study participants learned mental practice for \"virtual movement\" of their radiocarpal joint and had to perform it, the others were not treated at all. At beginning and end of the experiment, joint movement was measured, and an MRI examination of the forearm muscles was performed. The brain (cortex) areas, responsible for radiocarpal joint movement, were examined concerning their activity with functional MRI at the beginning and also at the end of the three weeks. The experiment was also performed on three \"real\" patients suffering from a distal radial fracture demanding plaster immobilisation, all of them were mentally treated. Mental practice significantly ameliorated dorsal extension and ulnar abduction after plaster removal in comparison to those not having been mentally trained. Muscle atrophy of forearm muscles, measured via MRI, was significantly less in those having mental training. The cortex areas responsible for radiocarpal joint movements (supplementary motor area, precentral gyrus, putamen, nucleus caudatus, prefrontal cortex, thalamus and cerebellum) showed significant signal changes at the end of the three weeks in those having been mentally trained. There were significant correlations between MRI and functional MRI findings. The findings in the three \"real\" patients were similiar. The results of this experimental study show that mental practice can have a positive influence on the outcome of distal radial fractures demanding immobilisation. A study with a larger number of \"real patients\" should follow. ","1322":null,"1323":"The indication of implant removal of intramedullary nails is a subject of much discussion.

With the modified technique the proximal end of the nail is preparated by a guidewire and the standard reamer used for implantation. This allows a soft-tissue protection with reduced morbidity, especially in patients with ossification. The outcome was assessed 4-20 weeks postoperatively and the operation times compared with those of 10 patients operated with the conventional technique.

Success rates vary between 80 and 95% and the clinical outcome seems to depend on various individual factors. The aim of the present review article is to summarise factors that affect clinical outcome following ACI for treatment of symptomatic cartilage defects of the knee based upon the scientific literature available on this topic. The present publication represents a non-systematic review including publications which were considered relevant describing factors that influence clinical outcome following ACI for treatment of symptomatic full thickness cartilage defects of the knee. In order to identify relevant literature concerning complications following cartilage repair, medical databases including \"medline\", \"ovid\" and \"web of science\" were searched for the terms \"autologous chondrocyte implantation\", \"autologous chondrocyte transplantation\", \"prognostic factor\", \"clinical outcome\", \"cartilage repair\", \"cartilage defect\" and \"cartilage regeneration\". The literature search was performed in April 2010. Factors that influence clinical outcome following ACI for treatment of cartilage defects of the knee include patient-specific parameters on the one hand, such as body mass index, nicotine abusus, patients age, prior surgical treatment, duration of symptoms and more, and defect characteristics such as containment, defect location, defect size, number of defects treated, on the other hand. Furthermore, surgical technique, cell quality and rehabilitation seem to significantly influence the clinical outcome following autologous chondrocyte implantation. Among all factors identified as relevant for clinical outcome, some of these parameters are fixed and cannot be changed by either the surgeon nor the patient, while others can be influenced and even changed during the treatment and rehabilitation of a patient who underwent ACI. Knowledge of all relevant parameters that influence clinical outcome following ACI is essential in order to achieve an optimal clinical outcome in patients with cartilage defects of the knee. This paper presents a review of the scientific literature available which focuses on the questions as to what parameters influence the outcome of a patient following ACI for treatment of cartilage defects of the knee. No isolated factors could be identified that influence the outcome following ACI alone, but it seems that clinical outcome is influenced by many different parameters. These parameters should be considered carefully, at the time of decision about what kind of treatment is applied. Furthermore, the patient should be informed especially about those parameters which can be influenced by him-\/herself in order to create good prerequisites for the surgical treatment. ","1327":"Modern locking plates are widely used for the treatment of adult orthopaedic and trauma patients. Sporadic descriptions of their advantages now exist for paediatric trauma patients. Publications concerning their implantation in paediatric orthopaedic and neuroorthopaedic patients are still scarce even though it is well known that the compliance of children and adolescents is limited and that rapid mobilisation is essential for patients with disorders of neurological origin or bone metabolism to avoid developmental setbacks and perioperative fractures. The principle of the locking plate system also described as internal fixateur is based on the thread bolting of the screwheads within the plate. This results in high initial stability and thus high initial loading capacity. Furthermore, it is possible to preserve soft tissue and periosteum which leads to less impaired biological bone healing. Between February 2008 and March 2010 locking plates were used for osteosynthesis in our department in 16 paediatric patients with 20 corrective osteotomies. All patients suffered from either neurological disorders or diseases with alteration of the bone metabolism. The outcome was analysed concerning safety, complications, practicability, mobilisation, consolidation of the osteotomy, loss of correction, as well as complications with the removal of the implants. Seven of the treated patients suffered from neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy or spina bifida, 9 patients had diseases with local or systemic alteration of their bone metabolism such as vitamin D deficiency and phosphate diabetes. The average age of the patients at the time of surgery was 11.18 (5-18) years. Implant-associated complications were not seen in this patient group, especially no implant failures. Mobilisation was achieved without cast treatment with at least partial weight-bearing within the first postoperative week in most cases. Loss of correction or problems with implant removal did not occur. 18 of the 20 osteotomy sites were completely healed at the 12 week follow-up. Locking plates are a safe and effective treatment device not only for adult trauma patients but also for the treatment of children and adolescents. When stabilisation of corrective osteotomies is performed with locking plates especially young patients benefit from this technique since mobilisation can be started earlier as compared to the use of non-angle stable plates or wires and cast immobilisation becomes unneccessary. The surgeon needs to know the range of products to pick the best implant regarding the growing skeleton's special anatomy. When choosing implants for patients with reduced bone density or impaired motor abilities as in cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and other systemic disorders, locking plates have to be taken into account to facilitate mobilisation and to avoid setbacks in motor development as well as pressure ulcers from casts. Clinical studies have to evaluate if early mobilisation combined with shorter inpatient treatment and less time and cost consuming postoperative physiotherapy or rehabilitation justify the use of the more expensive locking plates for the treatment of otherwise healthy patients.

In this study the clinical outcome of 67 patients who underwent ACDF due to cervical disc herniation are presented. Based on the results of this study and those of other working groups the pros and cons of ACDF were analysed and discussed. 67 patients with cervical disc herniation underwent ACDF of a single level. Clinical and\/or radiological examination was performed immediately preoperatively, one day after surgery and 7 months postoperatively to assess the course of the examined parameters. The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range: 19-81). Seven months after surgery we observed pain reduction in 91% of the cases, range of motion in the neck improvement in 79%, motor function improvement in 78% and a function improvement in sensitivity in 78% of the cases. Analysis of the CT scans 7 months after surgery showed a fusion rate of 85% on the cervical spine segment that was treated. The results of this study demonstrate that ACDF is an effective surgical treatment for patients suffering from disc degeneration at the cervical spine. Over 80% of the patients showed an improved neurological status and had less pain than prior to surgery.

It is today the indication for 10 % of all the total hip joint replacements. Known aetiologies of nontraumatic femoral head necrosis are alcoholism, steroids, sickle cell anaemia, caisson, and Gaucher's disease. Further risk factors are chemotherapy, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis, in which also steroids are involved. Gravidity is another risk factor, but still idiopathic pathogenesis is found. In diagnosis, the ARCO-classification of the Association for the Research of Osseous Circulation is essential. While stage 0 can only be found histologically, the reversible early stage 1 shows MR signal changes. In the irreversible early stage 2, first native x-ray changes are seen as lower radiolucency reflects new bone apposition on dead trabeculae. In stage 3, subchondral fracture follows, and in stage 4 secondary arthritis of the hip. Established therapy in stage 1 is core decompression, physiotherapy, and more and more also bisphosphonates. Sufficient data to support extracorporeal shock wave therapy are still lacking. Stem cell therapy seems to be a promising new therapy method in stage 2. In stage 2 and 3 mainly proximal femoral osteotomies and (non)vascularised bone transplantation are performed. In stage 4, depending on size and location of the necrotic zone and pathology of the adjacent bone, resurfacing or short stem hip arthroplasty can be performed. However, conventional THA is still golden standard. The problem and challenge, however, is the often young patient age in femoral head necrosis. Especially chemotherapy-associated osteonecrosis in leukaemia is found in patients in their second decade of life. Therefore, the hip should be preserved as long as possible.","1333":"The widely accepted treatment of vertical talus after casting is correction by extensive surgery.

The initiation of treatment, number of casts, surgery, as well as clinical and radiological results were documented. To evaluate the radiological result we used the Hamanishi score. From the beginning all feet could be treated successfully with the Dobbs method. According to the Hamanishi classification we have four excellent and five good results. Two feet had a relapse with subluxation or dislocation of the talonavicular joint. Treatment of vertical talus with the Dobbs method is successful. Extensive surgery could be reduced.

The aim of this review is to discuss the influence of smoking on low back pain (LBP) and the outcome of spinal surgery. LBP is a highly prevalent disease and plays an important economic role, as it is associated with high direct and indirect health-care costs. In order to be successful in prevention, risk factors for LBP must be identified. A review of the literature (using PubMed with the search terms: smoking, low back pain and pathophysiology) was performed. Of the search results, 196 publications from peer-reviewed journals were analysed (including three randomised clinical trials, 134 clinical, 28 experimental articles and 31 reviews [including one Cochrane Database review and five systematic reviews]). Additionally, 11 official publications of the US Department of Health and Human Services, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (France) and the \"Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum\" were used. While the evidence level for severe adverse effects of smoking on osteoporosis is good, many studies performed on LBP describe a statistical association, but are not useful to detect a causal link between smoking and lumbar disease. However, with plausible pathophysiological mechanisms and an overwhelming number of studies identifying a correlation it is suggested that smoking is likely to contribute to LBP and affects spinal surgery adversely. As for all diseases with multifactorial (including psychosocial) aetiology, it proves difficult to distract the confounding factors for analysis. A high number of studies performed to identify an association between smoking and LBP have not led to a final conclusion. But still, on the basis of the current knowledge, a negative contribution of smoking on LBP and spinal surgery seems probable.

The emigration of young German physicians, the occupational image of the Physician Assistant and the quality of the German residency programs in Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery we discussed as main topics. The main reason for young German physicians to go abroad is, besides better work conditions and less bureaucracy, the better structured education during residency. Therefore the \"Youth Forum\" generally supports the concept of the \"physician assistant\" as \"a relief from non-physician duties rather than discussing the delegation of true physician duties\". The \"Youth Forum\" is looking forward to collaborating on the improvement of the ongoing education of residents. In this regard, Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery needs to become more attractive for young academics. We also support a uniform and nationwide curriculum, which guarantees a structured education to improve the theoretic, practical and academic skills of the future specialist in orthopaedic and trauma surgery. Additional surveys and interviews among the current generation of residents are needed to further specify the potential goals of such a curriculum. We would like to discuss the future of our speciality with our colleagues. Therefore different communication platforms including our website http:\/\/www.jf-dgou.de have been created.","1340":"","1341":"","1342":"","1343":"","1344":"Fractures of the distal humerus are rare and count only for a small number of all fractures in mature patients. Due to demographic changes surgeons will be faced with an increasing number of complex multifragmentary fractures with diminished bone quality. As conservative treatment frequently leads to limited and painful elbow function, open reduction and stable internal fixation with early range of motion exercises are considered the gold standard. Detailed knowledge of the complex articular anatomy, the biomechanics, operative approaches and available implants is needed for the proper management of these complex fractures.","1345":"Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a common and serious complication after spinal cord injury, with an incidence of 5-50 %. Single-dose radiation therapy with 7 Gy is an established procedure for HO prophylaxis after total hip replacement. The aim of our study was to determine the clinical outcome after single-dose radiation therapy in the prophylaxis of HO in paraplegic patients. Between January 2006 and July 2009, 75 paraplegic patients with heterotopic ossification were treated in our hospital. On the basis of the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 62 patients were included in our study, whereas 55 patients participated in our follow-up examination. All patients received a bi-weekly ultrasound of the hip for an attempt at early diagnosis of the condition. In case of an ultrasound suspicion of HO, a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hip was performed. After confirmation of HO, a single-dose radiation therapy with 7 Gy was performed. In group A, the patients were irradiated with an electrode voltage of 15 MeV (36 patients) and in group B with 6 MeV (26 patients). All patients were assessed with a standardised questionnaire with a mean follow-up of 30.6 months (range 6-78 months). The mean interval time between the initial spinal injury and HO development was 58,2 days (range 14-125). 69,4 % of all patients revealed a Brooker grade I, 27.4 % grade II and 3.2 % a grade III. No cases of Brooker grade IV (ankylosis) occurred. No patient showed side-effects after radiation therapy. However, in group A one patient (3,2 %) and in group B three patients (12.5 %) developed HO relapse. Those patients were treated again with a single-dose radiation therapy with 7 Gy and 15 MeV and, afterwards, they were free of complaints. Deep vein thrombosis was confirmed in 11 patients (32.3 %) in group A and in 8 patients (33.3 %) in group B. Single-dose radiation therapy with 7 Gy in the treatment of heterotopic ossification is an effective option. A higher electrode voltage improves the effectiveness of the irradiation and the clinical outcome. Essential for the outcome is the early detection and treatment of HO with single-dose radiation therapy. Randomised, prospective studies should be undertaken in order to confirm these findings. ","1346":"The evaluation of paediatric thoracic or lumbar compression fractures can be challenging. The anatomy of the growing spine often makes a correct diagnosis by plain radiography difficult. The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic reliability of X-Ray and that of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of acute compression fractures of the paediatric spine. From January to December 2008 20 patients (12 boys, 8 girls) who were treated because of clinically suspected compression fractures of the vertebra were included in our study. The average age was 8.3 years. In all cases a radiograph in two planes and an MRI of the lumbar and thoracic spine were obtained. Two orthopaedic surgeons and one radiologist retrospectively assessed the radiographs. The results were compared with the MRI findings. In six cases the MRI was normal, in one case there was only a bone bruise without compression of the vertebra. 13 children had two or more than two minor compression fractures (29 fractures altogether). The 5th and 6th thoracic vertebra predominated. In only two cases there was a corresponding result of all three physicians and the MRI. In 4 cases the observers agreed on the localisation of the fracture. There was no agreement about the number of fractured vertebrae. An exact evaluation of minor compression fractures of the pediatric spine with plain X-ray was not satisfactory. ","1347":"Musculoskeletal conditions consume enormous resources and costs, and their incidence is increasing worldwide. Therefore, an appropriate education of medical students about these conditions is required. This study examines the extent of medical education in orthopaedic and trauma surgery in Germany. A questionnaire comprising 7 topics (curriculum design, lecture, practical training, e-learning, examination, evaluation, resources) with a total of 44 items was sent to all assistant lecturers in orthopaedic and trauma surgery at the 37 medical schools in Germany. The survey attained a return rate of 76 % for orthopaedic surgery and 81 % for trauma surgery, respectively. Medical training in musculoskeletal conditions represents with an average of 38.4 hours of lectures and further 55.9 hours of practical training less than 6 % of the entire undergraduate medical education. This study demonstrates a high inhomogeneity regarding the curriculum design when comparing the different German medical schools not only in total training time but also regarding its contents. E-learning as additional teaching method is only offered in 39 % of orthopaedic training and in 47 % of the trauma surgery training. Practical examinations like the OSCE are offered at 8 medical schools for orthopaedic training and 15 schools for trauma surgical training, respectively. Medical training in musculoskeletal conditions is very inhomogeneous and requires further improvement and standardisation regarding quantity and implementation. ","1348":"","1349":"Vacuum-assisted closure is used frequently for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) of the extremities. After debridement and repeated VAC dressing changes, the wounds are closed by secondary suture, split-thickness skin grafts or local flaps. However, no objective parameters describe the time point for secondary wound closure. Our thesis was that negative microbiological results from wound specimens can indicate the time for secondary wound closure. 24 patients with SSTI of the extremities were treated by serial debridements and VAC therapy and analysed prospectively. Debridements were repeated until the wounds were macroscopically free from signs of infection (good granulation\/no necrosis). During each revision specimens were taken for microbiological analysis. Moreover, number of revisions, bacterial cultures, type of wound closure and wound status after 3 years and 5 months on average after the last surgery were analysed. 6.3 revisions on average were performed until secondary wound closure was possible. In spite of the absence of macroscopic infection, bacteria were still found in tissue samples from 14 of 24 wounds. 6 wounds were free of bacteria for the first time right before wound closure, 3 wounds had become negative during the treatment. After 3.4 years on average, the wounds of all 18 patients available for examination had healed well and were free from signs of infection. Vacuum-assisted closure resulted in clean, good granulating wounds without necrosis. However, in more than half of the wounds bacteria persisted. This bacterial load had no correlation to wound healing and outcome after over 3 years. In conclusion, microbiological tissue samples are not suitable as indicator for the time point of secondary wound closure in SSTI. ","1350":"Anterior screw fixation is a standard treatment procedure in the case of an uncomplicated Anderson-D'Alonzo type II odontoid fracture in younger patients. Insufficient bony screw hold can cause severe procedure-related complications and result in screw breakouts with secondary fracture dislocation. Hence, the procedure is limited to patients with an adequate bone mineral density. This case report summarises a technical modification of anterior screw fixation in elderly patients suffering from severe osteoporosis to avoid a posterior spondylodesis of C1\/2. Two patients with odontoid fractures of Anderson-D'Alonzo type II were operated using anterior screw fixation and additional vertebroplasty of C2 to increase the screw hold. During follow-up a regular bony healing without screw complication was observed. In conclusion, cement-augmented anterior screw fixation of odontoid fractures type II according to Anderson-D'Alonzo and persistent severe osteoporosis can be an alternative to posterior C1\/2 spondylodesis in individual cases.","1351":null,"1352":null,"1353":null,"1354":null,"1355":"Femoroacetabular impingement has been shown to be an important cause for the development of osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Radial MRI of the hip has proven to be the diagnostic procedure of choice to differentiate which patient to operate. While examinations after instillation of contrast agents have been described, new papers have shown high accuracy without contrast medium. Since instillation of contrast medium is considered painful and poses the risk of infection, it is not performed for MRI evaluation of the hip at our institution. However, the question as to which sequence to use has not been settled yet. Therefore, four frequently used sequences using the same resolution were compared. A retrospective analysis of T (1)-weighted (T (1)), T (2)-weighted (T (2)) and proton density sequences (the latter with and without fat saturation [PDfs and PD]) of 50 hips in 48 patients with femoro-acetabular impingement and developmental dysplasia of the hip was performed by two raters blinded to the clinical information. The different sequences were rated separately. Evaluated criteria were subjective imaging quality, power to differentiate acetabular from femoral cartilage as well as the labrum from the joint capsule, and localisation and characterisation of pathological changes in joint cartilage, the labrum and at the femoral head-neck junction. Subjective imaging quality was assessed to be similar for T (1), PDfs and PD, whereas it was significantly worse for T (2). In discriminating specific intraarticular structures, however, only PDfs and PD were superior. The differentiation of acetabular from femoral cartilage was possible in only 44% and 40% of T (1) and T (2) images, but in 79% and 76% of PDfs and PD images. Similar results were found for the differentiation of the acetabular labrum from its vicinity, especially the joint capsule (36%, 35%, 77% and 74%, respectively). Intralabral pathology was seen in a comparable extent in all sequences. An intramedullary oedema at the head-neck junction, however, was significantly more frequent in PDfs only (67% vs. 0%, 17% and 10% for PDfs vs. T (1), T (2) and PD). Despite their good subjective quality, T (1)- and T (2-)weighted sequences could not depict the acetabular labrum as efficiently as PD-weighted sequences. Concluding from our data, a PDfs sequence (possibly combined with a conventional PD sequence) is advantageous over T (1) and T (2) sequences. Intraarticular administration of contrast medium seems to be superfluous. ","1356":"Total knee arthroplasty is one of the standard procedures in severe osteoarthritis of the knee. Computer-assisted navigation systems became more popular in the last decade. Navigation systems improve the component positioning and the alignment in total knee arthroplasties. The aim of this survey was to capture the actual trend in computer-assisted total knee arthroplasties in Germany and to discuss the results in comparison to the current literature. A questionnaire form was sent to 506 orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in Germany. The first part of the survey included general questions about the department and total knee arthroplasties. The surgeons were asked about their application behaviour and their rating of computer-assisted navigation in total knee arthroplasty in the second part. Questions concerning total knee arthroplasties, unicondylar knee arthroplasties and revision total knee arthroplasties were included in the form. 194 of the departments returned the questionnaire. A total of 39 941 knee arthroplasty surgeries were performed in these departments. 35 624 of these surgeries were primary knee arthroplasties including 32 789 total knee arthroplasties and 2835 unicondylar knee arthroplasties. In addition, 4317 revision total knee arthroplasties were performed by the respondents. 60 % of the departments used a computer-assisted navigation system. In synopsis 29 % of the primary total knee arthroplasties, 4 % of the unicondylar knee arthroplasties and 7 % of the revision knee arthroplasties were performed with a computer-assisted navigation system. Minimal invasive surgery was performed in 31 % of the departments and 36 % of these surgeries were done with navigation-assistance. The \"ligament-balanced\" procedure was the most common used technique to determine the femur rotation in navigated total knee arthroplasties. In 75 % of navigated total knee arthroplasties cemented components were implanted. Overall 65 % of respondents approved of navigation-assisted surgeries and 77 % saw an improved precision by this technique. The number of computer-assisted navigation uses in surgeries is increasing in 34 % of the departments and decreasing in 13 %. The computer-assisted navigation in total knee arthroplasties is a frequently used technique. The most respondents support the application of navigation-assisted knee arthroplasties and indicate an improved outcome measured by the postoperative alignment. Nevertheless, long-term results are needed for a final evaluation of navigation-assisted surgery. ","1357":null,"1358":"This metaanalysis was performed to evaluate the prevalence of the radiological assessed knee osteoarthritis in the whole community. Medical databases (Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane) were searched for the strategy: [\"Osteoarthritis\" and \"Knee\" and \"Prevalence\"]. The deadline for the search was 31.12.2009. Two investigators (first and senior author) independently made the selection from 17 studies (from a total of 1428) according to the inclusion criteria: a cross-sectional study of the whole community, radiological investigation and definition of knee ROA by an established radiological score. Only studies in English or German language were evaluated. Effect sizes (event rate, odds ratio [OR] and confidence interval [CI]) were calculated by the software \"Comprehensive Metaanalysis V2\". Study heterogeneity (I2) was determined accordingly to Higgins. The kappa index for interobserver validity was k = 0.948. All studies judged the grade of osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) score. For calculation of knee ROA KL grades 2+ were estimated only. The total prevalence of knee ROA was 24.3 % (CI 23.4-25.2 %). The whole prevalence in male patients was 24.3 % (CI 23.4-25.2 %); I2 = 59.4 (p = 0.002) and in female patients 32.6 % (CI 31.8-33.4 %); I2 = 49,1 (p &lt; 0.001). Younger male patients (age 50-) had a prevalence of 5.6 (CI 4.5-6.8). In older patients (80+) the male prevalence was 44.5 % (CI 39.6-49.5 %). In this age group female patients had a prevalence of 71.6 % (CI 67.6-75.3 %). The higher prevalence of knee ROA in female patients was significant (OR = 1.8 [1.7-1.9]; I2 = 46.0 [p &lt; 0.001]). The prevalence of knee ROA was higher in male Asians compared with male Caucasians (OR = 1.1, CI 0.9-1.2; p = 0.080) in tendency. This difference was significant in female patients (OR = 2.2; CI 2.0-2.4; p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore another trend was evaluated. Female patients (70-79 years) from the birth-year cohort 1920- had a prevalence of 37.8 % (CI 35.9-39.7)%. In contrast female patients from the birth-year cohort 1920 had a prevalence of 62.8 % (CI 60.8-64.8 %) at 70-79 years. This difference was significant (OR = 2.8; CI 2.5-3.1; p &lt; 0.001). This investigation confirms the high prevalence of knee ROA. The evaluated data may serve as a reference for medical or scientific investigations in the future. ","1359":"The Internet provides additional and nearly endless health-related information material for the patient. On the other hand, previous studies reported on the lack of quality for health-related websites, especially for message boards. A direct analysis of treatment recommendations from message board members and spine experts has not yet been published in the medical literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the quality of information regarding treatment of scoliosis one can receive from message board members compared to experts in this field. All members of one of Germany's biggest scoliosis-related message boards were invited to fill out an online questionnaire. This questionnaire included questions regarding demographic data, questions commenting on the influence of the Internet regarding their own decision finding, and six imaginary cases with four answer options each. The attendees were asked to provide the best treatment option. The answers of experts in the treatment of spinal disorders who commented on the same cases were used as control. 31 complete questionnaires from Internet patients were included in the analysis and compared to 36 answers from spine experts. In four of six cases an excellent agreement could be found. There was a good agreement in one case and a poor agreement in another. The disagreement would unlikely have led to harm for the patient. One third of the patients claimed that information received from the Internet has had a major impact on their own decision finding. The data show that treatment recommendations from members of a scoliosis-related message board have good to excellent agreement with treatment recommendations from experts in the majority of cases. The use of a message board can potentially be helpful in the care of scoliosis patients. Additional studies will evaluate whether or not the results of our study are representative for other message boards as well. ","1360":"","1361":"Successful treatment of elbow instability is aided by fundamental biomechanical understanding. This allows for clinical instability to be traced back to structural injuries, which can be addressed with targeted therapy. Acute instability of the elbow joint after frequent posterolateral dislocations tends to affect the radial ligamentous complex. In addition to simple ligamentous injuries, fractures can also contribute to elbow instability; comminuted fractures of the radial head often correlate with a rupture of the ulnar collateral ligament. Improperly healed acute injuries can result in chronic instability. However, recurrent microtrauma such as that seen in throwing athletes can also lead to changes in joint laxity. Conservative therapy of simple elbow dislocation usually leads to satisfactory results. In isolated cases, chronic lateral instability may result that requires operative stabilization. Recently, chronic posterolateral instability has been seen as the primary underlying pathology in unstable elbows. Chronic medial instability is also a problem for active athletes and may even lead to inability to participate in athletics. Conservative therapy should be the primary course of treatment. Surgical treatment may be indicated if conservative measures fail, if an athlete desires additional treatment, or in cases of high-grade medial instability. In this case, a rehabilitation period of up to one year should be expected.","1362":"Arbitration offices (\"Schlichtungsstellen\") in Germany are expert panels for the extrajudicial resolution of malpractice claims. The performance of arbitration panel proceedings (\"Schlichtungsverfahren\") is based on the German medical and insurance jurisdiction. In Germany, and in the United States likewise, malpractice claims involving children concern in most cases fracture treatment followed by appendicitis. Out of 242 panel proceedings with the background of fracture treatment in children malpractice was confirmed in 144 cases (60%). The overall ratio: number of confirmed malpractices to number of all proceedings is 30%. There are remarkable differences between the natural occurrence of the different fracture localisations and the fracture localisation related claims. This ratio amounts for example: clavicula 7 : 1, forearm 2 : 1, femur 1 : 5, elbow region (articular) 1 : 5, humerus supracondylar 1 : 3. 32 arbitration panel proceedings concerning alleged malpractice in the treatment of supracondylar humeral fractures in children were evaluated in regards to diagnosis of fracture type and degree of dislocation, conservative and operative fracture treatment, complications, and malpractice related permanent disabilities. In 20 cases (63%) malpractice was confirmed. The different failures could be classified in: 1) Incorrect interpretation of the X-ray findings, classified as fractures without or with minimal displacement, no reduction, healing with intolerable dislocation; n = 3. 2) Insufficient closed or open fracture reduction, stabilisation and healing with intolerable dislocation; n = 10. 3) Correct primary closed or open reduction, unstable osteosynthesis (loss of pin fixation of the ulnar epicondylus), secondary postoperative rotatory dislocation, cubitus varus; n = 3. 4) Delayed detection of a compartment syndrome of the forearm, no or delayed fasciotomy; n = 3, in two cases resulting in severe Volkmann's contracture. 5) Extensive skin necrosis caused by uncontrolled tourniquet under operation. All malunited fractures, except one, led to cubitus varus, often combined with a restriction (extension\/flexion) of the mobility of the elbow joint. No cubitus valgus was found in our series. In eight cases a cubitus varus was treated by valgus osteotomy later on. In other cases this procedure was planned. Adverse events which could not be proven as caused by malpractice, included fracture consolidation in minimal tolerable displacement, n = 3; delayed recurrence of the normal mobility of the elbow joint, n = 2; traumatic cubitus varus caused by primary damage of the humero-ulnar epiphysis, n = 3; pin track infection, n = 1; nerve injuries, n = 10. The concomitant nerve injuries concerned: n. medianus 3, n. ulnaris 2, n. radialis 1, nn. radialis and ulnaris 3, nn. medianus and ulnaris 1. In all these cases the claim was based only or together with other reproaches on the nerve injury, but in no case could a malpractice be confirmed. However it should be mentioned that in some cases a iatrogenic nerve injury could not be excluded definitively. Therefore we always recommend the exploration and documentation of the function of the arm nerves at admittance and immediately after treatment. The applied methods of osteosynthesis were pin fixation, crossed or unilateral radial, n = 30; radial screw, n = 1; elastic stable intramedullary nailing fixation (ESIN), n = 1; fixateur externe (reoperation), n = 1. In no case the method of osteosynthesis was proven as inapplicable or as the cause for the adverse event. Permanent disabilities were considered to be slight in 12 cases (deficient mobility of the elbow joint) and severe in two cases (Volkmann's contracture). Physiotherapy was not found to be beneficial for the restitution of normal mobility of the elbow joint after supracondylar fracture. In at least 7 cases painful physiotherapy was applied, although the X-ray films clearly demonstrated the displaced fracture as the cause of the restricted mobility. In 5 casuistic representations of adverse events after treatment of a supracondylar humeral fracture, the final decision of the arbitration board on the basis of expert reports is illustrated. The results are discussed in order to avoid mistakes in the treatment of supracondylar humeral fracture in children. The appropriate treatment requires exact assessment of the degree and direction of the fracture dislocation, clear definition of the cases in which active treatment, i.e. closed or open reduction and stabilisation, is obligatory, and experience in the operative treatment. A beginning compartment syndrome of the forearm should be detected early by the initial symptoms and immediately treated by fasciotomy.

Classifications are based on the major forces leading to fracture. Data from injury mechanisms as well as clinical and radiological criteria are used to determine the degree of instability. The major aim of all kinds of stabilisation is the anatomic reconstruction of the bony pelvic ring. The injured ligamentous apparatus is still ignored. Some clinical trials assume that soft-tissue injuries may be the reason for the poor patient outcome in \"open book\" pelvic ring fractures. The aim of the study was to develop a realistic finite element (FE) computer model to simulate \"open book\" fractures and predict injury-associated instabilities for osteosynthesis planning. PATIENTS\/MATERIAL: We developed a realistic FE computer model of the pelvic ring based on CT data. With anatomic studies a computer model of the ligamentous apparatus was created and inserted into the pelvic ring to complete the bone-ligament complex. Numerical simulations were performed to identify the influence of single pelvic ligaments on the shifting at the intact anterior and posterior pelvic ring. Additionally, a biomechanical validated virtual crack simulation with anterior-posterior compression forces was undertaken to predict complex instabilities in \"open book\" pelvic ring fractures. The pelvic ligaments have local and general stabilising functions. The sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments are providing the vertical load transfer, whereas the ligaments of the iliosacral joint and the iliolumbal ligament are necessary for the horizontal load transfer. In \"open book\" fractures ligaments are ruptured stepwise from anterior to posterior. If the intraosseous and posterior ligaments of the iliosacral joint are intact, only single rotational instability along the ipsilateral iliosacral joint occurs. If the ligaments at the posterior pelvic ring are ruptured too, a second axis across both iliosacral joints was measured. In this particular case additional stabilisation of the posterior pelvic ring should be performed. With numerical simulations, prediction of injury-associated instabilities is possible. Because of incomplete radiological data the implementation of patient-specific FE pelvic computer models into the clinical routine is still not realistic. ","1373":"Considering the demographic changes in the populations of Germany and Europe as a whole, the field of geriatric traumatology is gaining more and more importance within the specialty of orthopedic and trauma surgery. The high prevalence of osteoporosis in this specific group of patients poses a special challenge, with vertebral compression fractures being the by far most common osteoporosis-related fractures. These fractures present with acute as well as chronic back pain leading to severe consequences for the affected patients. Mobility and quality of life are often heavily impaired. Furthermore, higher morbidity and mortality as well as higher risk for further fractures have been proven in these patients. Balloon kyphoplasty has become a more frequently used therapy and is now offered broadly. This treatment addresses stable fractures not involving the posterior margin of the vertebrae. With increasing application of this surgical procedure the number of complication reports is also rising. The following article gives an overview of the technique, indications and the possible complications by giving several examples from the daily practice and reviewing the relevant literature. Cement leakage of the treated vertebrae is the most common complication associated with balloon kyphoplasty. In almost all cases this occurs due to too early application of the cement, not having reached its optimum in viscosity. Literature research shows a percentage rate of about 9% for cement leakage. Thus, balloon kyphoplasty provides more safety for the patient than vertebroplasty, for which cement leakage rates of up to 41% are reported. Other studies report cement leakage ratios of 4-10% for kyphoplasty versus 20-70% for vertebroplasty. Overall the percentage of cement leakage is clearly increased in osteoporotic fractures compared to non-osteoporotic fractures, with the cement leaking mainly into the spinal disc space. So far, valid data in order to further explore the consequences of intradiscal cements are lacking. Most relevant for everyday practice are cement leakages that have become symptomatic. Depending on the localisation they present with dysaesthesia culminating in radicular pain or even paraplegia. Cement leakage into vessels can, depending on the amount of cement, lead to embolism of pulmonary arteries. Complications due to the surgical technique, postoperative infections, bleeding or cardiovascular complications are rare with less than 1%. The probability for symptomatic cement leakage averages about 1.3% for balloon kyphoplasty. Another discussion, for which at present there is no evidence-based verification, is concerned with the higher risk for adjacent vertebral fractures after cement augmentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. At present the degree of osteoporosis and more important the number of osteoporosis-related fractures must be the relevant predictor for adjacent fractures of neighbouring vertebrae. Balloon kyphoplasty is a highly standardised and widely used minimally invasive procedure for stabilising and augmenting painful osteoporotic fractures of the vertebral body. When surgery is indicated carefully and is carried out subtly, the risk of complications is reasonable and the outcome is promising. Viscosity of the used cement has to be adequate and it must not be inserted with too high a pressure. A causal connection between cement viscosity and risk of cement leakage has been proven in experimental studies. During application of PMMA cement a thorough fluoroscopic monitoring must take place in order to detect cement leakage at an early stage and if necessary stop application. These procedures should be reserved for clinical centres and surgeons who are able to surgically handle possible complications such as compression of the spinal cord. On the basis of our own experience we also recommend treatment in a hospital with an integrated osteoporosis centre and consecutive treatment in specialised outpatient care. Standards in primary care as well as after treatment can be introduced thereby. Also communication with practitioner concerned with outpatient care is simplified, which leads to enduring therapeutic outcome. ","1374":"Injuries of the sternoclavicular joint are rare. Probably these injuries are frequently missed. Distorsion type lesions mostly heal uneventfully. Their diagnosis and treatment may be demanding. Untreated, a dislocation of the sternoclavicular joint and dislocation fractures may lead to considerable discomfort or even a risk for neurovascular damage. This work focuses on the anatomy and lesions of the sternoclavicular joint, the pathomechanism of the injury and the treatment options according to our acute trauma-patient collective. Five patients with sternoclavicular impairment have been assessed. Radiological evaluation consisted in standard chest X-rays. In the situation of a fracture and\/or complete luxation, CT scans of the sternoclavicular joints were additionally performed. Two of our patients underwent surgery (one osteosynthesis with a plate and one reduction and ligament reconstruction were performed), in one case dislocation was reduced in a closed way in a short-lasting general anaesthesia and in two cases conservative treatment was performed. In all cases the chosen treatment protocol led to symmetrical arm function and all patients were pain-free 2 to 6 months after the injury. In one patient the plate was removed 4 months after osteosynthesis. Distorsions of the sternoclavicular joints are probably underdiagnosed and often mildly symptomatic. Conservative treatment usually leads to satisfying functional results with significant pain reduction. Non-reducible dislocations and dislocation fractures have to be treated operatively. Many different open procedures have been described, such as ligament reconstructions and osteosynthesis. The postoperative results are generally good, but operative treatment may be difficult and at risk for complications. Indications for operative treatment of joint subluxation should be strictly limited because of the high risk of accompanying neurovascular impairment during manipulation and fixation. ","1375":null,"1376":"Mid-shaft clavicular fractures are mainly treated conservatively with an average incidence of non-union in 4.5 %. Gender, age, grade of fragment dislocation and comminution are risk factors to develop a pseudarthrosis. In contrast to patients who where operated on, conservative treatment was also associated with a higher complication rate and pain level as well as a poor shoulder function and cosmetic result. Therefore more patients are treated operatively, especially modern minimally invasive techniques have been developed and remain as equals to the standard plate fixation. PATIENTS\/MATERIAL: Within a period of 24 months patients with a mid-shaft clavicular fracture were included into a prospective, non-randomised multicentre study. A modified AO classification was used. Patients were treated either conservatively, by plating or intramedullary nailing. Pain level, cosmetic result, shoulder function and complication rate were documented as well as the influence of the profession on the therapeutic strategy and duration of unfitness for work. 120 patients (95 male, 25 female) were included in the study. Fractures were caused in 35 (29 %) by a direct, in 85 (71 %) by an indirect trauma mechanism. Because of their lower grade fractures with overlapping fragments 47 (39 %) patients were treated conservatively with a figure-of-eight-bandage. Patients with higher graded fractures and fragment displacement were stabilised either by intramedullary nailing (n = 20, 27 %) or plate fixation (n = 53, 73 %). 96 (80 %) patients were examined at a follow-up of eight weeks and eight months after injury. Early freedom from pain (p = 0.014), a better cosmetic result (p = 0.1) and an improved subjective (p = 0.004) and objective (p = 0.01) shoulder function were statistically significant in operated patients. Clavicle shortening was often found to be significant in conservatively treated patients (p = 0.006). Duration of unfitness for work depended on the physical activity in the job. The complication rate was 15 % for each therapy, non-union was detected in one (0.8 %) patient. Mid-shaft clavicular fractures have to be classified by the criteria contact and number of fragments. Advantages of operative procedures are early freedom from pain and shoulder function recovery. Non-displaced low grade shaft fractures without shortening should be treated conservatively, whereas displaced low-grade shaft fractures have a better result after intramedullary nailing. Plate fixation should be predominantly used in dislocated and comminuted fractures as well as in patients with a high level of physical activity in their jobs. ","1377":"Complex vertebral fractures can lead to injury of the spinal cord with resulting paraplegia. High-speed accidents are common causes, especially in younger patients. Malignant or inflammatory processes play an important role in the elderly. Less common reasons for a spinal cord injury are congenital malformations. We here report about a 17-year-old patient who suffered from paraplegia after an isolated rupture of the spinal cord without an injury of the vertebral bodies, intervertebral disc or ligamentous structures. This type of injury has not been reported in the literature before. We report about a 17-year-old patient, referred to our hospital, presenting with lumbal paraplegia after a high-speed accident 8 days prior to admission. After initial stabilisation of the polytraumatised patient, he was referred to our hospital for further treatment. The radiological examination showed a bilateral acetabular fracture, a right anterior pelvic ring fracture and shaft fractures of the left humerus and right femur. Furthermore, the spinal cord at thoracic level 10\/11 was ruptured. Interestingly, there was no injury of the vertebral bodies, intervertebral disc or ligamentous structures. A tethered cord as a possible anatomic variation could be excluded in this case by MRI. However, anatomic variations could be the reason for this injury and should be kept in mind. ","1378":null,"1379":"This prospective study analyses the quality and number of physiotherapy reports, cooperation between physiotherapist and orthopaedic surgeons as well as correctness of the physiotherapy in relation to the prescription within the German medical health system. We pose the question to whether or not the reported information is sufficient to evaluate outpatient physiotherapy. In 264 physiotherapeutic prescriptions, given to the patients for conservative treatment or during postoperative rehabilitation by an orthopaedic outpatient clinic, we prospectively evaluated the report quality. The types of prescription and performed physiotherapy were compared. The ability of the patient to demonstrate or to verbalise exercises, as has to be learned during therapy, was analysed and the number of questioned follow-up forms documented. We also tried to evaluate the efficiency of different types of physiotherapy. We received 33 reports in 264 prescriptions, i.e., the obligation to report was only followed in 12.5 % of the cases. Depending on the type of physiotherapy, there was a range between 0 % in electric field treatment, 0 % in active muscle training with weights and resistant exercises as well as in thermo- and swimming therapy, 10.8 % in passive mobilisation, 16.8 % in regular physical therapy and 33 % in classic massage treatment. In 261 cases, i.e., in 98.8 % of the prescriptions, the physiotherapist was asked via the patient for another prescription. Only in one patient did the physiotherapist call the doctor personally to ask for a variation of the treatment during the prescribed series. In 193 prescriptions the patients should have learned to do the exercises by themselves as a home therapy programme. Only 5 patients were able to demonstrate this at the reassessment appointment. The allover complication rate was 2.3 % including nausea, vertigo or increasing pain. In all these cases the type of prescription was not followed. In the outpatient treatment of orthopaedic or trauma patients there is not sufficient cooperation between physiotherapists and surgeons. This may lead to prolonged postoperative rehabilitation time or may question the success of conservative treatment completely. The efficiency of physiotherapy could not be evaluated due to lack of prescription reports. Therefore, a new control mechanism to support the patient and the responsible outpatient surgeons should be introduced. ","1380":null,"1381":"In analogy to the thesis of \"pain-proneness\", conceptualised by G. Engel more than 50 years ago, the idea of a unique structure in personality emerged, which was given a causal meaning in the development of Sudeck's Disease (now known as complex regional pain syndrome - CRPS), of which the pathogenesis is particularly unknown until today. It was supposed that certain psychological traits predispose one to develop CRPS. Predisposition in this context was apprehended as a personal susceptibility to produce and maintain an excessive reaction to nociceptive stimulations. This model has been maintained for a long time and was the subject of scientific examination just in the last two decades. Some publications reporting sporadic correlations between CRPS and certain personality traits, for example anxiety, neuroticism and depressive mood, are presented as are also 15 current empirical studies and five reviews, which deal in a more differentiated manner with the formulated question and lead to sobering results. The relevant state of research as well as the fundamental and methodical difficulties in regard to verifying a CRPS personality or pain-prone personality are discussed critically. In general, there is a lack of high-quality relevant studies. Some retrospective\/cross-sectional studies yield contradictory results regarding psychological problems in patients with CRPS but the majority shows no association, and studies with higher methodological quality tend to the conclusion of no relationship between psychological factors like depression, anxiety, neuroticism, or anger and CRPS. Especially, the few prospective studies do not report such a relationship, psychological factors are not associated with CRPS onset. Compared to other patients with chronic pain there is no unique disturbed psychological profile and no higher degree of psychosocial disturbance in CRPS patients. In all, the results of research cannot confirm the hypothesis of correlations between psychological and psychosocial factors and the pathogenesis of CRPS. Furthermore, there is no evidence for the existence of a unique CRPS personality or psychosocial pattern. The findings are in conformity with the outcome of research referring to the general pain-prone personality, which was abandoned due to the lack of success. It has been shown that there is a non-specific and non-linear relationship between personality and pain, there is no aetiological link. The observed modifications in behaviour and personality of CRPS patients, in particular depression and anxiety, are a consequence of the persisting pain disease and its considerable resistance towards treatment and not the cause. Although many patients with CRPS have been stigmatised as being psychologically different, a relationship between this disease and several psychological factors cannot be derived. The idea of an existing \"Sudeck personality\" as well as the search for such a predisposing personality structure are obsolete and useless. Management of pain and pain-related impairments, however, are based on the personality of the affected persons. ","1382":"The treatment of cartilage defects remains a major problem in orthopaedics. With regard to cartilage tissue engineering, the reimplantation of pre-cultivated chondrocytes in the form of a chondrocyte graft is a promising alternative to conventional methods. Clinical practice requires this MACT procedure (matrix-associated autologous chondrocyte transplantation) to produce a biocompatible replacement tissue with adequate mechanical properties. Mechanical stimulation has the capacity to improve the quality of these cell-seeded biomaterials. By altering chondrocytes' cellular activities, the biological and biomechanical properties of cartilage replacement tissue can be modulated. Different systems are used for this purpose, e.g. shear, perfusion, hydrostatic pressure or compression. The mechanisms, biological effects, chances and problems of the techniques are presented and assessed. Among the stimulating techniques considered are systems that apply indirect and direct shear forces such as spinner flasks, rotating-wall bioreactors, direct tissue shear and perfusion culture systems. The application of hydrostatic pressure or compression may be brought about by either static or dynamic loading systems. Compressive loading is considered in the light of both its short- and long-term effects; additionally two exemplified systems are discussed in detail. However, despite promising approaches and seemingly favourable tissue characteristics, the in vitro culturing of functional cartilage replacement tissue with cartilage-like mechanical and biological characteristics still remains elusive. Furthermore, controlling, monitoring and regulating culturing conditions are general biotechnological requirements of a standardised in vitro cultivation. Among these, different aspects such as aseptic operation, media supplementation, nutrient and gas exchange, temperature and humidity control are considered.","1383":"In cases of unexpected and implant-related mechanical failures, optimal surgical treatment and provident information for the patients are mandatory. We describe the surgical method to revise the hip stem after fracture of the modular cone adapter of a short-stem hip prosthesis and the management of and information for all patients who have received a fracture-prone implant. We present two out of four cases in a series of fractures of the femoral neck cone adapter of a modular short-stem hip prosthesis. The patients in our hospital were male, aged 69 and 52 years with a body weight of 73 and 88 kg. Implant failures occurred 18 and 20 months after the index THA. Using special instruments available at short notice, the revision operation can be carried out with a primary implant (case 2) with reasonable technical expenditure, unless pathological-anatomic reasons do not allow it (case 1 with varus-flexion deformity and a rotational deviation that required a revision long-stem with combined correction osteotomy). Once the implants were fully integrated and tightly secured to the bone, they were loosened with flexible thin chisels. Drilling a hole and a thread into the fractured cone adapter allows the connection of a removal instrument for implant extraction. The clinical and radiological examination showed good results with an HSS of 100 points at 24 months follow-up. Our institution decided to inform all 54 patients who had received the failure-prone implant device. The provision of advice to the patients at risk proved to be effective. When using new implants and procedures, the surgeons must inform the patients of hitherto unknown risks. The recipients of a failure-prone implant must be provided with comprehensive information. It is advisable for both the clinic and the manufacturer to contact the patients and advise them on how to cope with the situation. In most cases, the revision operation of the stem component can be performed with a primary implant without significant additional bone loss. ","1384":"The nerve compression syndromes of the upper extremity, the common carpal and cubital tunnel syndromes are described, but also the less common entrapments such as thoracic outlet syndrome,suprascapular-, interosseus-posterior- and anterior entrapments and the Loge-de-Guyon and Wartenberg syndromes are mentioned. Besides history, symptoms and physical examination electrodiagnostic and imaging are necessary for establishing the correct diagnosis. The conservative treatment is less successful than the operative therapy. Surgical procedures and techniques are discussed as well as complications. The prognosis is in most cases good--provided that indication and technique were correct.","1385":"Despite good long-term results of primary total knee arthroplasty, it is a commonly accepted aim to stave off joint replacement as long as possible, particularly in younger patients. In this situation the surgeon has to make a careful decision whether an arthroscopic procedure will be promising, a corrective osteotomy may be sensible or a joint replacement due to the patient's age is acceptable. High tibial osteotomy had become increasingly popular by use of the opened wedge technique combined with locking compression plates fixation in the past decades while it has been replaced step by step by total knee arthroplasty. In spite of this fact the German national agency of quality management (BQS) showed that the number of total knee replacements in Germany increased from 90 000 in 2003 to 146 000 in 2008. The share of unicompartmental knee replacements in this period doubled from 5.3 % to almost 10 %. The aim of the present study was to inquire current data regarding particular surgical treatment concepts of unicompartmental knee arthritis in Germany. In a nationwide anonymous survey in May 2009 220 departments of orthopaedics and 230 departments of trauma surgery were asked about their treatment strategies in unicompartmental knee arthritis in middle-aged patients (30 to 60 years) with unilateral Outerbridge grade III-IV lesions. Overall 46 questions in 6 subject areas (structure of the department, number of treated patients, surgical methods, anaesthesiological procedures, perioperative management, postoperative treatment) were posed. With regard to the item \"operative treatment\" we asked for the importance of arthroscopic procedures, corrective osteotomies and different procedures of joint replacement. The interpretation was done with invariant data analysis by indication of numerical frequency and percentage distribution of selected options. Questionnaires were returned by 51.1 % of the surveyed departments. This represents a total number of 76,028 procedures in unicompartmental knee arthritis in middle-aged patients. First of all, arthroscopic procedures were applied (50.4 %), followed by knee replacements (43.4 %, of which 87.3 % were total knee replacements, 12.3 % unicompartmental knee replacements and 0.4 % tibial hemiarthroplasties) and corrective osteotomies (6.1 %). In 59.8 % of the 38,376 arthroscopic procedures a microfracturing and in 28.2 % an abrasion arthroplasty was done. Most of the corrective osteotomies were performed at the proximal tibia (90.9 %) using an open wedge technique (73 %) and internal fixation with locking compression plates (72 %). 75.2 % of the responders performed cemented unicompartmental arthroplasties (97.8 %) with an average number of 23.2 per year. 43.4 % believe that bicompartmental arthroplasty in case of additional affection of the femoropatellar joint is an option and 22.6 % believe in the expected advantages of patient-specific unicompartmental implants. Total knee arthroplasties are performed with an average of 197.4 per year, most frequently using the free-hand technique (85.5 %) and medial-parapatellar approach (82 %). Interpositional knee devices were only used in 9.1 % of responding departments with an average number of 6.6 per year. Only procedures with low difficulty level such as arthroscopies were done by residents in a higher number (16.9 %). Procedures with higher difficulty level were mainly done by consultants, senior or chief surgeons. In total, arthroscopic procedures still play an essential role in the treatment of unicompartmental knee arthritis prior to joint replacement. Total knee arthroplasty was preferred even though the number of unicompartmental knee replacements was only slightly increasing. Periarticular corrective osteotomies have gained in importance since the introduction of locking compression plates. Interpositional knee devices play a minor role in the treatment of unilateral knee arthritis in Germany.

But its implementation is often difficult. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the demands of the new specialist qualification on the part of the trainers in Germany. An e-mail questionnaire was distributed via the offices of DGU (German Society of Traumatology) and DGOOC (German Society of Orthopaedics and Orthopaedic Surgery) to 954 head physicians. Questions referred to abilities that are subject to concrete specialty training. Questions 1-3 referred to basic knowledge of the trained specialty. Questions 4 and 5 focused on self-reliant work, questions 6 and 7 touched aspects of conservative orthopaedics and multiple trauma management whereas questions 8-10 referred to the achieved surgical skills. 220 questionnaires were evaluated overall in a period of 6 weeks. 132 questionnaires were returned by the DGOOC and 88 by the DGU. Questions 1-3: basic knowledge regarding diagnostics and treatment of diseases and injuries of the musculoskeletal system as well as communication in adequate medical terminology were presumed by 97% and 85% respectively. 72% of the questioned trainers expected a brand new specialist to give a detailed and qualified description of an X-ray. Questions 4 and 5: 67% postulated that a brand new specialist should be capable of indicating a routine surgical intervention correctly. But only 30% expected a specialist to manage a consultation. Questions 6 and 7: the self-reliant conservative treatment of back pain patients was assumed by 60%, whereas the organisation of the medical care of multiple trauma patients is requested by 40%. Questions 8-10: referring to the surgical skills, 52% expected that one should handle the standard surgical approaches to the large extremity joints. Only 24% expected that after completing his training, a specialist can perform standard surgical procedures, which are required in the specialty training reglementation, without supervision. On the other hand they were expected to assist. Expectations of the head physicians concerning the skills of a new specialist did not match the expected skills defined in the specialty training reglementation regarding basic knowledge, self-reliant work, surgical skills as well as conservative orthopaedics and multiple trauma management. A reasonable structuring is necessary in order to implement the requested contents of the specialty training reglementation. This can only be achieved if demands on aims are compliant. ","1403":"For several years now interbody fusion has been the gold standard procedure for treating degenerative disc disease. The problem of adjacent disc degeneration after interbody arthrodesis led to the development of non-fusion techniques. The device which best represents the philosophy of spine arthroplasty is the total lumbar disc replacement (TDR). An analysis of the perioperative morbidity of lumbar disc replacement was carried out in the current study. 66 patients underwent lumbar disc replacement between 2001 and 2007. 78 protheses were implanted. Retrospectively patient-related variables (comorbidity, prior surgeries), perioperative blood loss, number and levels operated on, operation duration and technical and general complications were analysed. 54 patients had mono- and 12 patients bisegmental TDR. The mean operation time was 112 minutes with an average blood loss of 560 mL. Neither the type of comorbidity, prior surgery, operation duration, nor level operated on had an influence on the occurrence of perioperative morbidity. A significant influence could be shown for the number of levels operated on and the intraoperative blood loss. General complications were seen in 6 persons (9%) with urinary tract infection, technical complications occurred in 4 persons (6%) with severe blood loss (&gt; 1500 mL) and erythrocyte\/plasma substitution, 1 person (1.5%) with an injury of the iliac vein, 1 person (1.5%) with retrograde ejaculation and 1 person (1.5%) with dural tear and consecutive epidural infection. In our study the perioperative morbidity of lumbar disc replacement was similar to the data published so far and seems to be comparable with the perioperative morbidity of lumbar interbody fusion. ","1404":"Despite controversial discussions, hip resurfacing at the moment seems to be the most bone-sparing surgical procedure of the femoral bone when implanting hip endoprostheses. Main risks are septic and aseptic loosening and necroses of the coxal end of the femoral bone mainly influenced by the periprosthetic allocation of bone cement. Because of a lack of radiation transparency of the hip resurfacing implant, this cement allocation cannot be sufficiently evaluated by common radiological procedures. A pilot study was conducted to describe and validate the macromechanical interdigitation of bone cement with spongy bone of anatomic specimens compared to artificial bone models and to evaluate whether artificial bones may be used for further interdigitation studies of different implantation techniques. Plastic models of polyoxymethylene (POM) according to the inside geometry of the Metasul Durom hip prosthesis were implanted on ex vivo femora (n = 14) versus artificial bone models (n = 24) (Sawbones) of three different spongy densities (0.16; 0.20; 0.32 g\/cm(3)) (each n = 8) in a clinically standardised surgical procedure and reproduced by highly resolving computed tomography. Afterwards a computer-based analysis of the cement allocation was accomplished. It could be shown that the Sawbones of the lower spongy densities (0.16 and 0.20 g\/cm(3)) were similar to the ex vivo femora regarding the bone penetration of cement. No significant differences could be shown regarding interdigitation. According to our data, both groups of Sawbones may be used for further studies. ","1405":null,"1406":"It has been suggested that the use of a short-stem prosthesis could conserve proximal bone by proximal load transfer. Proximal stress shielding should be reduced, a phenomenon that has been associated with bone resorption around traditional stems. Bone remodelling of a metaphyseal fixed stem (Nanos, Smith &amp; Nephew Int.) was analysed by the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. This study included 36 patients undergoing the total hip replacement using the Nanos short stem in comparison to 36 patients operated by a traditional long-stemmed femoral stem (Alloclassic). In all cases a threaded cup was inserted. Both groups were not different in regard to the BMI or in regard to the quality of bone (BMI). The average age of the group of patients with the short-stem prosthesis was slightly younger (average 54.2 years [range: 29 to 75]) than the patient group with the long-stem prosthesis (average 61.1 years [range: 39 to 71]). A prospective clinical analysis was done by the Harris hip score (HHS) and the Sutherland score to evaluate the social quality of life. With a minimum follow-up of 12 months in all cases, radiological changes in regard to stem subsidence, periprosthetic osteolysis or linear radiolucencies were analysed. The changes of periprosthetic bone density were examined with DEXA in all patients 3 and 12 months postoperatively. No patients required reoperation because of loosening or subsidence of the short-stem prosthesis. The HHS improved from a mean of 43.1 (range: 9 to 51) to 96.5 points (range: 79 to 100) in the short-stem group and to 91.3 points (range: 61 to 100) in the group of patients with long-stemmed femoral component. Radiographic follow-up revealed no evidence of component loosening or migration of the short-stem. Along the greater trochanter an osteolysis of the bone structure was found in two cases. A decrease of the proximal periprosthetic bone density (Gruen zone I, -6.4%) and in zone VII (-7.2%) were measured. An increase of the BMD in the lateral inferior region (Gruen zone II, +9.7%) superior to the polished tip of the short stem was observed over a period of one year after implantation. At the polished tip of the prosthesis a significant change of bone density in zone III (+1.03%) and in zone V (+0.7%) could not be observed. The desired proximal load transfer of a short-stemmed implant in the metaphyseal region of the proximal femur could not be reached with this device. On the basis of the excellent clinical results of the patients operated with the Nanos short-stem prosthesis we conclude that the component induces bone ingrowth in the lateral\/distal region of the proximal femur. ","1407":"The aims of this review were to discuss the different mechanisms of biocorrosion of orthopaedic metal implants in the human body, as well as the effects of the released metal ions on bone metabolism and the immune system in regard to their involvement in the pathophysiological mechanisms of aseptic loosening and metal hypersensitivity. Implant failure due to aseptic loosening is thought to occur in about 10-15% of cases. A review of the literature (using PubMed with the search terms: biocorrosion, metal ions and bone metabolism) was performed. Additionally, we discuss our research results in the field of aseptic loosening. Despite a great effort in developing new implants, metal devices used in orthopaedic and trauma surgery remain prone to biocorrosion by several mechanisms including the direct corrosion by osteoclasts, leading to the production of significant amounts of wear particles and metal ions. In addition to the well documented increased osteolytic activity caused by large (in the nanometer range) wear particles, increasing evidence strongly suggests that the released metal ions contribute to the pathophysiological mechanism of aseptic loosening. Metal ions stimulate both the immune system and bone metabolism through a series of direct and indirect pathways leading to an increased osteolytic activity at the bone-implant interface. To date, revision surgery remains the only option for the treatment of a failed orthopaedic implant caused by aseptic loosening. A better understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms (including the effects caused by the released metal ions) of aseptic loosening may have a significant potential in developing novel implants and therapies in order to reduce the incidence of this complication. ","1408":"In spite of the cumulating evidence for the prognostic relevance of illness perceptions regarding the course of disease and recovery of hip and knee joint patients, there are still no studies that examine the effects of these perceptions on postoperative functioning as assessed by clinical ratings. The aim of this inception cohort study was to describe the course of functioning following a hip or knee joint replacement over a period of one year and to analyse moderator-type effects of illness perceptions in order to develop strategies for preoperative counselling and postoperative rehabilitation. The course of functioning following a hip joint replacement was assessed by the Harris hip score (HHS), the course of functioning following a knee joint replacement by the American Knee Society score (AKSS). Illness perceptions were assessed by the brief illness perception questionnaire. Due to the non-linear relationship of time and functional outcome, time was transformed using a log transformation. Moderator-type effects were analysed by interaction terms of log time and illness perceptions. For 135 patients the course of the HHS was analysed, for 127 patients the course of the AKSS. Results after one year confirmed a successful treatment for 82.3 % of the hip patients and 70.6 % of the knee patients. Hip patients expecting an enduring illness had lower scores on the HHS after one year (p = 0.026). The expectation that the treatment will be helpful was associated with a better outcome (p = 0.002). The outcome of knee patients was moderated by the degree how concerned they were about their illness (p = 0.016). The results confirmed the prognostic relevance of illness perceptions for the functional outcome and indicate the importance of preoperative counselling and the potential benefit of patient-oriented education that is aimed at modifying illness perceptions.

The lateral rim of both tendons was fixed with Mason-Allen sutures. Final adaption of the distal tendon stump above the reinserted tendon (doubling). Postoperative immobilisation for 3 weeks in Gilchrists sling was followed by active-assistive step-by-step mobilisation. A speedy rehabilitation was planned after 6 weeks, but at this time the patient was doing strength training, swimming, pull-ups and press-ups at his own responsibility. Normal mobility and previous sports activity were achieved in spite of the early and extremely high stress. We assume that the very strong and secure reinsertion technique with 4 mattress sutures, Mason-Allen sutures and doubling of the tendon close to the foot print region may be the reason for the good result in spite of the massive and early loading.","1411":"There has been great progress concerning the surgical treatment of full-thickness cartilage defects within recent years. Surgical techniques such as arthroscopic microfracturing (MF), autologous osteochondral transplantation (OCT) and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) have been introduced and, by using these techniques, reliable and satisfying clinical results can be achieved. Nevertheless, there are also technique-related problems and characteristic complications of all surgical techniques in the field of cartilage repair. Knowledge of these complications is essential for every surgeon using these techniques. The aim of the present article is to give an overview concerning technique-associated and characteristic complications of the most common cartilage repair techniques including arthroscopic microfracturing, autologous osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). In order to identify relevant literature concerning complications following cartilage repair, medical databases including \"medline\", \"ovid\" and \"web of science\" were searched for the terms \"autologous chondrocyte implantation\", \"autologous chondrocyte transplantation\", \"microfracture\", \"osteochondral transplantation\", \"cartilage repair\", \"cartilage defect\" and \"complications\" in October 2009. The present publication represents a non-systematic review including publications which were considered relevant for describing charateristic complications and adverse events in surgical techniques used for cartilage repair. Although the number of studies describing complications and adverse events following surgical cartilage repair studies is limited, for all techniques included in the present review (arthroscopic microfracturing, autologous osteochondral transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation) technique-associated and characteristic complications could be identified. While regenerative tissue following microfracturing seems to be limited in terms of durability, intralesional bone formation and elevation of the subchondral bone plate seem to be characteristic problems of this technique. Harvest morbidity, degeneration of the surrounding cartilage, necrosis of the transplanted cylinders and a lack of integration of the cartilage into the surrounding cartilage seem to be related to the transplantation of osteochondral cylinders (OATS\/OCT), while hypertrophic regenerative cartilage, disturbed fusion into the adjacent cartilage, delamination and insufficient cartilage regeneration are associated with the autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The present paper identifies technique-associated complications for the most common surgical techniques used for cartilage repair. Even if the clinical relevance of the complications described in the current article has not been investigated to its fullest extent, the awareness of these characteristic complications is essential in order to avoid them whenever possible or to develop standardised treatment regimes for these problems. This needs to be addressed in further investigations.

Two groups of eight female adult sheep (median age 3 years, range 2.4-3.8 years) received surgical treatment in the form of anterior monosegmental spondylodesis. The spondylodesis was performed in all animals in the motion segment L3\/4 through a lateral approach with the animals lying on their right sides. To produce serial sections, the explanted vertebral segments were implanted in methyl methacrylate. On one side the histological preparation was examined qualitatively and in addition we analysed the quantity of the bone structure with special software. The bone structure in both groups did not differ significantly and demonstrated integration of the grafts in the adjacent vertebral bodies. Fractures and lysis occurred in the region of the intervertebral disc and were more frequent in the group with the bovine graft. The bony integration of the grafts of both groups was not significantly different and showed good results. Almost all of the bovine grafts fractured or presented regions of lysis. In our opinion bovine cancellous bone graft is not a good alternative to autologous iliac crest.

Whether the radial nerve should be surgically explored in association with a palsy in humeral shaft fractures in order to exclude an interposition or discontinuity is being discussed controversially. The aim of this study was to assess the strategies for primary care of radial nerve palsies associated with humeral shaft fractures in Germany. In a standardised survey 495 traumatological and 134 neurosurgical clinics were interviewed regarding the treatment of primary radial nerve palsies after humeral shaft fractures. The distribution of the survey included all level-one trauma centres. Statistics were based on the supply strategies, the number of observed contusions, discontinuities and inter-position of the N. radialis in the fracture gap. Moreover, the results were recorded after primary neurorrhaphy. The evaluable response rate to the questionnaire was 56% (university hospitals 77%, level-one trauma centres 63%, level-two trauma centres 70%, level-three trauma centres 44%). 6097 humeral shaft fractures have been treated per year, the incidence of primary radial nerve palsy was 8.6%. Regarding the management strategies, 59% of the hospitals advocated exploration of the nerve, while 25% reported that the decision depends on the individual case. 16% reject the exploration in case of a primary nerve palsy. In the case of an exploration, contusions (74%) of the nerve were largely seen, followed by nerve interpositions in the fracture gap (19%) and discontinuity (7%). In the case of neurorrhaphy, a partial or complete remission was found in 87% of cases. Although a primary expectant procedure is recommended in the literature due to the high spontaneous remission rate of 90%, an early exploration of the nerve is often preferred in clinical practice. In these cases, the use of an interlocking intramedullary nail as a minimally invasive treatment option does not appear useful due to the direct exposure of the fracture zone and the radial nerve. Interestingly, the feared discontinuity occurs rarely. The impact of nerve interposition in the fracture gap without surgical exploration remains unclear due to the lack of visibility. There is no consensus concerning the treatment of radial nerve palsies after humeral shaft fractures in Germany. Discontinuities are rare, the rate of spontaneous recoveries is high. Whether and when an exploration of the radial nerve is obligatory in primary radial palsy remains unclear and should be clarified by prospective randomised trials.

To prevent these effects some authors recommend 3D-cultures and culture medium supplementation of defined growth factors and cytokines. Another aim is the reduction of donor site morbidity. Therefore, different progenitor cell types were tested towards their potential for osteochondral regeneration. In particular, MSC derived from bone marrow include several advantages for the treatment of osteochondral defects such as unproblematic sampling, cultivation techniques, and a relatively high degree of biological safety.

In a retrospective study, we report the functional outcome of five consecutive operatively treated patients suffering from a tear close to the insertion site of the anterior tibial tendon. All patients were assessed postoperatively, the AOFAS and Richter scores were obtained and the range of motion in the ankle joint was evaluated. Preoperatively all patients presented with a significant walking impairment due to a reduced active dorsiflexion, so the decision for surgical refixation was made. In all cases an MRI scan was performed preoperatively. Postoperative immobilisation without weight-bearing was done for six weeks. All patients returned to their former activity level, were satisfied with the postoperative result and had a normal gait in the follow-up examination. The range of motion was equal on both sides, the median AOFAS score was 86 and the median Richter score was 90 out of 100. There were no postoperative complications. Untreated tears of the anterior tibial tendon lead to significant impairment of the ankle joint and deformities of the foot. There is no consensus about the treatment with recommendations for operative and non-operative treatment. Various surgical procedures have been described. The surgical reconstruction of the tendon leads to a restored function of the ankle joint and allows a normal gait and is therefore desirable. Due to the loss of function and the good results after surgical treatment in our study, the non-operative treatment is not advisable. Surgical repair of degenerative tears of the anterior tibial tendon leads to very good functional results and high patient satisfaction.

The ICOAP measures pain with 12 items divided in the two subscales \"pain which comes and goes\" and \"permanent pain\". The reliability, the validity, the sensitivity to change, the practicability and the acceptance of this questionnaire were investigated in 120 patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis necessitating a total knee replacement. Retest reliability was determined in a subsample of 29 patients prior to hospital admission. Convergent construct validity was assessed by comparing the results of the ICOAP subscales and the overall score to the pain scales of the Western Ontario and McMasters University osteoarthrosis score (WOMAC) and the knee-injury and osteoarthrosis outcome score (KOOS). Sensitivity to change was determined by comparing the results of the ICOAP prior to admission with those assessed at discharge from hospital as well as 3 months after knee replacement surgery. To quantify the strength of associations between the ICOAP scales and the measures of validity as well as to test its reliability the Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated with an absolute value of \"r\" indicating the strength of a relationship. Sensitivity to change was assessed with an analysis of variance of the score results at the three different times of assessment. A p value of &lt; 0.5 was regarded to be significant. The reliability of this questionnaire was high, retest reliability ranged between r = 0.57-0.67, for the overall score as well as for the subscales. As a further criterion of reliability the internal consistency of the questionnaire was high as well, with r = 0.81-0.9. In comparison to the WOMAC pain scale, there was a concordance with r = 0.67 (overall score) and r = 0.68 (subscales). The pain scale of the KOOS correlated highly to the ICOAP scales. It ranged between r = 0.64 and r = 0.91. The review of sensitivity to change of this questionnaire showed a significant (p &lt; 0.5) decrease of pain within three months after implantation of a total knee arthroplasty for the overall score as well as for both subscales. The median significantly decreased from 30.37 to 12.93 % for the overall score and from 16.77 to 7.07 or, respectively, 13.59 to 5.86 for the subscales. Practicability is given and the acceptancy in patients was high, with no drop-outs during this study. With the validated German version of the ICOAP a questionnaire is available now which accurately measures pain in patients with advanced knee osteoarthritis. ","1428":"The IMAGE prosthesis was developed with the objective of proximal load induction to avoid stress shielding and proximal bone resorption. In this study patients were followed clinically and radiologically with a special emphasis on osteointegration of the shaft in the proximal and distal regions. In addition, the reconstruction of the bony geometry of the proximal humerus was investigated. 95 consecutive patients (mean age: 61.1 years) with an IMAGE shaft were followed up prospectively over five years after primary hip arthroplasty. Radiologically, the osteointegration was appraised on the basis of the parameters cortical bone hypertrophy, radiolucent lines, shaft sintering and the position of the rotational centre. The clinical parameters assessed were the Harris hip score (HSS) and the WOMAC score. In Dorr C configuration no distal cortical bone hypertrophy was visible, in contrast to 19% in types A and B. By means of this criterion in 81% of the cases, a metaphyseal anchoring can be assumed. In 20% of the cases proximal and in 11.1% distal radiolucent lines were found. In only 3.3 % of the patients were the radiolucent lines due to unwanted distal osteointegration. In most cases the reasons were PE wear and metallosis. In 18.8% a distal anchoring was visible. Sintering (in total 18 prostheses) was greatest in Dorr C configuration and high-grade osteoporosis. The difference in offset reconstruction was 4.23 mm on average. In reconstruction of the rotational centre the variability was between 2.0 and 6.9 mm. 94.13 points were attained in the HHS and 10.13 points in the WOMAC score. Specific complications related to the implantation were not observed. Proximal stress transmission can be supported and the danger of stress shielding can be reduced by means of an appropriate design of a prosthetic stem. Distal corticoid hypertrophy was found in only 19% of the patients with the prosthesis model investigated as compared to 60% having prostheses with distal femoral anchoring. The medium-term clinical results are excellent, so that the shaft appears suitable for primary as well as secondary osteoarthritis of the hip joint. ","1429":null,"1430":"Volar locked plate fixation of distal radius fractures has become an established procedure in the past decade, although reports of flexor tendon injuries due to volar plating have been increasing. The aim of the present study is to identify the risk factors which produce irritations of flexor tendons using the locking palmar 3.5 mm T-plate, with special emphasis placed on the watershed line and the pronator quadratus muscle. In this retrospective study, all patients with distal radius fractures who had been treated with a locking volar 3.5 mm T-plate between 2001 and 2005 were evaluated. The X-ray controls were analysed with regard to secondary losses of reduction, bony healing disturbances and the topographic relation to the watershed line. Follow-up included a clinical and subjective assessment using the DASH score. All patients underwent sonography to identify irritations of the tendons under functional conditions (neural and dorsal wrist flexion). A total of 151 patients were treated with the locked volar 3.5 mm T-plate. Of these, 68 patients could be included for follow-up. The mean age was 47.8 years with a mean follow-up period of 3.5 years. Fracture classification according to the AO indicated 13 A, 14 B and 41 C fractures with 37 Colles and 31 Smith fractures. Fracture union was achieved in all patients. A mean palmar tilt of 2.8 degrees (range: 1 to 9 degrees) was observed, with a loss of reduction in three cases of about 5 degrees. There were no implant failures. The mean DASH score was 12. The watershed line was reached by the distal edge of the plate in 48 patients and was exceeded in 20 cases. In 30 patients the pronator quadratus muscle could not be identified. In the remaining 38 cases the mean diameter was reduced to 1.4 mm, while the unaffected contralateral muscle had a mean diameter of 3.8 mm (range: 2.8 to 7 mm). Irritations of flexor tendons occurred only in 4 cases, in those patients where the pronator quadratus muscle could not be identified (2 tendon erosions and 2 tenosynovitises; 5.9%). Relevant functional distal plate prominence was detected in dorsal flexion (power grip) in 3 cases (4.4%), producing tendon deflection. The topographic relation of the plate to the watershed line played a minor role in causing tendon irritations, in contrast to the muscular coverage of the distal plate. Plate coverage by a vital reconstructed pronator quadratus muscle produces a greater distance of the tendon compartment to the plate, whereas a complete muscular coverage of the distal plate edge is difficult to realise, although it is not necessary regarding functional conditions. Stabilisation of distal radius fractures with dorsal and volar displacement by the locked palmar 3.5 mm T-plate produces positive results. A careful reconstruction of the pronator quadratus is more important than respecting the watershed line in that it achieves muscular coverage, and thus provides a greater distance of the plate to the tendon compartment. We recommend sonography after bony healing to identify functional plate prominence or tendon irritations under functional conditions (dorsal wrist flexion) and, if necessary, plate removal. Further systematic sonographic examinations should be undertaken including other locked plate systems.

There is no detailed curriculum describing which operations a resident has to learn at which stage of his training as in Switzerland or Denmark. We aimed to find out how many typical operations are performed by trainees\/residents in orthopaedic surgery. We performed a survey at Orthopeadic and Trauma Departments in Germany to measure the percentage of operations (knee arthroscopies, shoulder arthroscopies and knee arthroplasties) which are performed by trainees and residents. Retrospective data were evaluated. Out of 35 654 knee arthroscopies, 49.4% were performed by the head of department or senior consultants, 27.6% by junior consultants and 26.9% by trainees. A total of 30,642 shoulder arthroscopies was analysed. 78.4% were operated on by the head of department or senior consultants, 18.3% by junior consultants and 6.9% by trainees. We evaluated 31,138 knee arthroplasties, 80% were operated by the the head of department or senior consultants, 14% by junior consultants and 7% by trainees. Surgical training is still not at its best for trainees. Further improvement is necessary to create a transparent training environment for younger surgeons. ","1433":"Brucella spp. are a main contributor to morbidity in endemic countries, especially in the Near and Middle East and the Mediterranean. However, in most western industrialised countries, cases are rare. Here, we report the case of a previously unrecognised chronic brucellosis with subsequent laboratory-acquired infection. A 64-year-old female presented to the orthopaedic department with loosening of her knee prosthesis after total knee arthroplasty five years earlier. Bacterial cultures were obtained in a preoperative puncture of the affected joint. About two weeks after replacement of the prosthesis bacterial growth was detected by chance in the preoperative culture and Brucella melitensis was diagnosed, whereas the intraoperative swab was negative. Serology revealed a chronic brucellosis while blood cultures were negative. Antibiotic treatment with rifampin and doxycycline was initiated. Two months later, a 32-year-old male physician who was involved in identifying the bacterial pathogen began to suffer from night sweats, weight loss and elevated temperatures. Another 4 weeks later, he developed hip pain and synovialitis. At that time, blood cultures and urine specimens were positive for Brucella melitensis. The serological results were consistent with acute brucellosis. In many European and North American countries, especially Germany, Brucella spp. are rarely isolated from clinical microbiological specimens and present a considerable risk for laboratory-acquired infections.","1434":"Precise placement of the sustentaculum tali screw is essential for fixation of calcaneus fractures to achieve the best fixation strength. In the clinical practice, this procedure is demanding due to the complex anatomic configuration of the calcaneus and the limited visualisation in the intraoperative fluoroscopic images. The aim of this study was an evaluation of the accuracy for the sustentaculum tali screw placement by using different navigation procedures compared to the standard procedure. The different navigation specific workflows were evaluated and the feasibility of each procedure proven in clinical applications. Eight sustentaculum screws per group were placed in an artifical Synbone model. Different navigation procedures were evaluated: 2D-fluoroscopy (group I), 3D-fluoroscopy (group II), fluoro-free (group III) and compared to the conventional screw placement without navigation (group IV). For each screw the time of fluoroscopy and the duration of the procedure were measured. The accuracy was evaluated postoperatively by computed tomography using axial slices and coronary as well as sagittal reformations. Furthermore, the workflow of each navigation procedure was analysed and proven in clinical applications. In the experimental setup, no radiation exposure was mandatory for the conventional and fluoro-free procedures, whereas mean fluoroscopy times of 17 +\/- 1.03 und 66.8 +\/- 0.9 were measured for 2D- and 3D-navigation procedures. In line with this, the overall mean procedure times for the screw placement were 1.26 +\/- 0.05 (group IV), 3.49 +\/- 0.26 (group III), 13.32 +\/- 0.49 (group I) und 19.04 +\/- 1.41 minutes (group II). No significant differences were observed for the accuracy of screw placement. In the clinical practice a better orientation was achieved by use of a navigation system. The fluoro-free procedure can be easily integrated into the common operation workflow, whereas the workflow of both image-based navigation procedures is technically demanding. Navigation procedures seem to be helpful for the precise placement of sustentaculum tali screws in cases of operative calcaneus fracture fixation. The kind of application to be used depends on the infrastructure of the department and the navigation-experience of the operating room team. Whereas the fluoro-free procedure is intuitive in use, the 2D-navigation does not justify the extra efforts. The 3D-procedure is the recommended application for surgeons familiar with navigation, providing the best orientation due to the slice image visualisation in all three dimensions. ","1435":"Numerous epidemiological studies have suggested a relationship between knee osteoarthritis and occupational load or, respectively, a kneeling or squatting position at work. Cartilage breakdown was clearly identified as the main mechanism of the osteoarthritic process. This arthroscopic study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between frequency and grade of knee cartilage damage compared with occupational load. It was hypothesised that heavy work conditions cause higher cartilage degeneration in diverse age groups. Furthermore, it was suggested that kneeling or squatting work positions (analogous to the BK 2112) produce more severe cartilage damage or other distributions thereof compared with patients in low knee-loading professions. A total of 1199 patients with knee pain (history of 3 months or more) underwent arthroscopic operations. Cartilage lesions were classified according to the ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) protocol. The grading of joint degeneration was quantified by using the WOAKS (whole organ arthroscopic knee score). Patients were divided into 5 age groups (24-39-51-64-75 years) by analysis of cluster centres. In 80.6% (n = 1086) the preoperative radiography suggested signs of a knee osteoarthritis. There was a range from grade I to grade III osteoarthritis according to the Kellgren-Lawrence score. Older female patients had knee osteoarthritis significantly (p = 0.027) more frequently. The grade of osteoarthritis correlated significantly with the patients' age (p &gt; 0.001). The mean WOAKS was 16.6 +\/- 13.7 points. There was a continuous increase of WOAKS from 8.2 +\/- 5.1 in 24-year-old patients to 24.2 +\/- 16.3 points in 75-year-old patients (p &lt; 0.001). In about half of the cases cartilage lesions within the patella and trochlea were evaluated. Most frequently we recorded cartilage lesions within the mean bearing zone of the medial femoral condyle (96.2%) and the medial tibia (57.7)%. Only about a third of our patients suffered from cartilage lesions within the mean bearing zone of the lateral condyle and tibia. The frequency of cartilage lesions and the severity of the lesions grade was significantly less within the non-loaded margin of the surfaces. In 45 knees (3.8%) we found intraarticular osteophytes located: medial (n = 9) and lateral (n = 3) patella margin, intracondylar notch (n = 12), medial tibia (n = 9) and lateral margin of the lateral tibia (n = 4), lateral femoral condyle at the intersection to the lateral trochlea margin (n = 3). The occurrence of osteophytes correlated with the patients' age and the radiological grade of the osteoarthritis. There were no differences with respect to the profession within the age groups. In the non-adjusted WOAKS, patients with hard knee-loading work had a WOAKS of 16.8 +\/- 13.9 points and patients with soft work a score of 17.2 +\/- 14.3 points (p = 0.583). Differences in the frequency of cartilage distributions within the judged regions of the knee with respect to professional burden were also not evaluated. The same held for the frequency of intraarticular osteophytes. Despite there is a known relation between occupational load and knee osteoarthritis no relation to cartilage degeneration was found in our arthroscopic investigation. For better understanding of work-related knee osteoarthritis prospective studies are needed urgently. ","1436":"This is a report of a 70-year-old patient with spontaneous pain of the dorsum area of the left foot. A few days later there was a sudden onset of foot drop. First, an idiopathic peroneal palsy was assessed but an MRI showed a cystic tumour near the fibular head. These findings resulted in the patient attending our clinic for surgical treatment. During the operation we found an intraneural ganglion of the deep peroneal nerve and the common peroneal nerve. There was no connection with the superior tibiofibular joint. The ganglion was therefore removed. Two months after the operation the patient reported an improvement of the pain but no improvement of movement of the foot. An intraneural ganglion of the peroneal nerve derives from the superior tibiofibular joint. Given access to the articular branch, the cyst typically spreads out proximally from the deep peroneal nerve to the common peroneal nerve and to the point of the sciatic nerve. The clinical symptoms are correlated with the extent of cyst propagation. Recommended therapy would include the ligation of the aricular branch, or synovectomy, or resection of the superior tibiofibular joint and decompression of the cyst.","1437":"For the operative adjustment of a leg length shortening and for correcting an angular deformity, an external fixator is the most frequently used technique today. This method may, however, be complicated by painful soft tissue and muscle fixations, pin infections and psychic strain as well as by long treatment duration with the external fixator. The intramedullary skeletal kinetic distractor (ISKD) is an internal lengthening nail, which promises a postoperative course without further complications. We used the ISKD nail in a 28-year-old traumatised motorcyclist, in whom, after removal of a comminuted femur bone fragment, a leg length shortening of 8 cm resulted. After uneventful healing of all fractures and having performed implant removal, we implanted an ISKD nail for femoral lengthening. The following distraction resulted, without considerable complications, in a complete compensation of the leg difference. The ISKD nail is a suitable procedure to compensate for post-traumatic leg length differences, which exhibits, in contrast to the frequently used external fixator, a largely uncomplicated course. It cannot be used to correct a gross transverse or rotational deformity. ","1438":null,"1439":"Reinforcement cages are widely used for the treatment of large acetabular bone defects.

Due to the severe destruction of the acetabular bone stock and an infection of the total hip prosthesis as confirmed by fresh frozen section, the hip prosthesis was explanted. At the last follow-up the patient was free of infect-related symptoms and was able to walk with one crutch.","1440":"Due to the increasing prevalence of elderly people in Germany, the number of geriatric fractures will continue to increase. Typical geriatric skeletal and physical changes are osteoporosis, arthrosis, and reduced ability of coordination. Altogether, these factors may lead to a failure of a performed osteosynthesis, or may make the classical fracture treatment of reduction and internal fixation appear to be impossible. The aim of this study was to examine the results of peri-knee fractures treated directly or within 3 months by implantation of a knee prosthesis. 15 geriatric patients could be identified who were treated in the described way in the last 4 years. The follow-up time was 39 months. The knee injury occurred in all cases after a banal trauma. 14 patients could be examined by applying the HSS scoring system. We furthermore checked the operative management and postoperative course. The patients reached a good score level and showed few complications. For elderly patients, the primary knee arthroplasty after periarticular fractures of the knee is a valid treatment option. Nevertheless, the surgeon has to identify those fractures which are impossible to treat by a classical osteosynthesis. Furthermore, the application of the appropriate knee prosthesis, regarding the degree of hinge constrainment or augmentation of the tibial or femoral bone stock, is important. ","1441":"The efficiency and success of computer-assisted fluoroscopic navigation systems mainly depend on the quality of the process of image acquisition: obtaining the correct view of anatomic structures, relative orientation of multiplanar X-ray images and the necessary amount of radiation dose. These systems may be optimised by using a system called zero-dose c-arm navigation (ZDCAN). We investigate whether the available computer-assisted systems may be used to navigate the c-arm before image acquisition to obtain X-ray images with maximised accuracy and minimal radiation exposure. Based on position data of an optical tracking system combined with statistical deformable bone models, ZDCAN is able to generate a real-time preview of expected X-ray images of the lower extremities without using radiation. We performed a cadaver study on six full-body specimens comparing the zero-dose approach to conventional positioning of the c-arm in order to evaluate efficiency and accuracy. Eight users acquired two perpendicular X-ray images of the hip, the knee and the femoral diaphysis. The number of X-ray images required to get a satisfying picture could be reduced to seven using the zero-dose approach; the conventional approach needed 11 images. The mean time did not differ significantly. Regarding the image quality, using ZDCAN quasi-orthogonality could be reached while the conventional approach showed a large variation of the relative orientation. Using ZDCAN, the amount of radiation can be reduced by requiring less X-ray images as well as reaching better accuracy. ","1442":"","1443":"The concept of combined anteversion for total hip arthroplasty (THA) proposes a relationship between the cup and stem components that theoretically maximises the postoperative range of motion and minimises the risk for impingement of the joint. Using computer-assisted navigation tools, an anteversion angle of the cup component can be made to be dependent on the antetorsion angle of the stem component (or vice versa). We studied how this functional concept would be different from the traditional cup placement according to the Lewinnek safe zone. We prospectively reviewed 42 patients (42 hips) who underwent imageless, computer-assisted THA with cementless implants due to osteoarthritis between May and October 2008. Using computer navigation, we determined the cup anteversion with optimised containment and measured femoral stem antetorsion. Our goal was to implant the original implants with a combined anteversion of 37 degrees. Mean cup anteversion was 22.5 degrees, mean combined anteversion was 35.2 degrees. Femoral antetorsion ranged from -13 to 38 degrees (mean: 18 degrees). Mean anteversion of the trial cup with optimised containment was 15.9 degrees and therefore close to the recommendation according to the Lewinnek safe zone. The total postoperative range of motion (flexion, extension, abduction, internal\/external rotation) as measured with the navigation system intraoperatively was 209 degrees compared to 94 degrees measured clinically preoperatively. No THA dislocation occurred during the test. The combined anteversion concept results in a cup position with more anteversion when compared to the traditional cup placement according to the Lewinnek safe zone. In this context, modern navigation techniques open a new frontier for an optimised component position. Placing the cup and stem in relation to the anteversion for both components allows consideration of the patient-specific biomechanics. ","1444":"For decades the cemented anchorage of hip prostheses, especially for elderly patients, is the standard procedure. The cementing technique has turned out to be the determining factor for the survival of the implant. In the last few years developments in this field have been able to further improve the long-term survival. Established components of the modern cementing technique are vacuum-mixed cements, medullary canal plugs, centralising elements und the use of jet-lavages. The design of the cemented shaft depends on the more important surface finish. In the most clinical studies, polished shafts turned out to be slightly superior as compared to shafts with rough surfaces.","1445":"Repeated luxations, periprosthetic fractures, infections, and nerve palsies are the most frequent complications of hip alloarthroplasty. Paresis acquired during elective implantation entails considerable restrictions in the quality of life. The risk of sustaining a nerve injury depends upon the initial clinical situation, cases of planned leg lengthening in patients with hip dysplasia and high luxations being particularly at risk. A Medline search was conducted using the query \"nerve palsies during hip prosthesis implantation\", yielding 126 publications, of which 18 were used to predict the risk of nerve palsies in cases with simultaneous leg lengthening during total hip arthroplasties according to different preconditions. The risk for an acquired nerve lesion during hip alloarthroplasty in arthritis was 0.5 %. In cases of hip dysplasia (with no or moderate leg lengthening during the procedure), the risk was increased to 2.3 %. An even higher risk of 3.5 % was found in cases of revision surgery. According to the literature, the risk of nerve palsies in cases of continuous leg lengthening before THA is raised to 5.9 % with a linear correlation between the amount of leg lengthening and rate of nerve palsies. Neural lesions during single-stage leg lengthening of less than 3 cm in hip alloarthroplasty are uncommon. More extensive lengthening can be achieved with continuous procedures, which should be conducted under clinical monitoring of the peripheral nerves to avert possible nerve injury.

We describe the case of a patient who suffered from a Mycobacterium bovis infection of the left knee that led to spontaneous ankylosis in her childhood. At the age of 87 years an acute exacerbation of the tuberculous osteoarthritis occurred due to a drop attack with a fracture in the region of the previous knee ankylosis. Considering the patient's age and general poor condition, it was our paramount goal to preserve her walking ability and to avoid that she becomes bedridden. After radical surgical debridement and resection of the ankylosis, we achieved macroscopically clean bone and soft tissue conditions. We performed palliative arthrodesis with a long intramedullary nail and a cement spacer. Additionally, the patient underwent a tuberculostatic therapy for 8 months. The acute inflammatory process could be stopped and the ability of the patient to walk could be preserved.

In a first cohort of 25 patients with 33 affected hips ultrasound and radiography were compared. In a second cohort of 8 patients with 11 affected hips ultrasound and arthrography were compared. 32 radiographs proved to be not useful for the precise determination of the femoral head position. In all ultrasound images the criteria described by van Douveren et al. could be identified. All ultrasound images in the study were useful and gave reliable information with regard to the femoral head position. Consequently, standard radiographic documentation is no longer used as a standard in our clinic. MRI and CT are reserved for special cases. We recommend transinguinal ultrasound as a standard diagnostic method for determination of the femoral head position in hip spica casts.

In particular parents, whose children are affected by systemic diseases, orthopaedic defective positions, anomalies or deformities, use the internet to increase their knowledge. Concerning this situation there is a lack of studies in the current literature. We investigated parental preparation to the outpatient paediatric orthopaedic consultation at our University Hospital with respect to internet enquiries or further sources of information using a standardised questionnaire. We assessed age and educational background of the parents, local hardware equipment and general habits of internet use. In particular, we retrieved parental use of search machines (e.g., Google.de, Yahoo.de), general medical websites (e.g., netdoktor.de) and websites from self-help groups (e.g., klumpfusskinder.de). In total, 288 out of 300 questionnaires (96%) were evaluated. More than half of the parents (57%) were over 35 years of age and 78% were women. 82% of the study population had access to the internet at home and 70% used the internet regularly. More than 80% obtained information about the orthopaedic diseases of their child beforehand. Age and educational background of the parents were not significantly correlated with the extent of enquiries (p &gt; 0.05). 90% of the parents, using the internet as source of information, frequented internet search machines; approximately one third used general medical websites. In particular in clubfeet we observed a highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) tendency of parents to frequent websites from self-help groups. 60% of the study population assessed the internet information as useful; 92% will frequent the internet as source of information again. One third of the respondents is going to discuss the obtained internet information with the physician.

One patient did not consent to a follow-up investigation, 1 early revision was necessary 4 weeks post-op after a fall precipitating a periprosthetic fracture. The average age at the time of THA was 54 years and the Harris hip score reached 95 points at the time of follow-up. One implant had aseptic loosening and 1 implant was revised due to a failure of the modular titanium neck adapter. An equal number of patients received modular neck adapters with neutral or 7.5 degrees retroversion. No 140 degrees neck and no anteverted neck adapters were used. Radiological results of the 2\/3 porous coated hip stem showed a metaphyseal bone remodelling with hypertrophies in coated Gruen zones 3 (17%) and 6 (46%) and marked spot welds and increased bone density (86%) in the distal area of the coating. Primary implant migration between 2 and 10 mm was present in 7 cases due to a low osteotomy and implant position combined with an implant undersizing and lack of proximal-lateral support. At the time of the last follow-up these cases had no clinical symptoms with an average HHS of 96 points and with full bony integration. Our results support the use of the investigated short hip stem for THA when the femoral bone quality and morphology support the metaphyseal anchoring concept. The surgical technique must avoid a stem position without proximal-lateral cortical contact to the femoral osteotomy, as this reduces primary implant stability. Further follow-up is necessary to validate the long-term success of this procedure. ","1475":"Today, megaendoprostheses--which were originally designed for osseous defect reconstructions in tumour surgery--are being more frequently used for extensive bone defects in revision arthroplasty. The purpose of this study was to assess the complication rate and the functional results associated with megaendoprosthesis reconstruction of the proximal femur in a non-oncological patient group. 28 patients (average age 72; SD 10 years) with a proximal femur replacement were retrospectively (mean follow-up 43 months) evaluated regarding the complication rate. The Harris hip score was used to assess the outcome. The revision surgery was indicated because of large bone defects caused by implant-associated infection (n = 16), periprosthetic fracture (n = 8) or aseptic loosening (n = 4). Overall 8 patients (28.6 %) had to undergo 1 (n = 5) or more (2 n = 2, 4 n = 1) revision surgeries because of dislocation (n = 4), aseptic loosening of the stem (n = 2) and periprosthetic infection (n = 2). A significant pain relief could be achieved from on average 9.0 to 38.7 (according to the Harris hip score). All patients could be mobilised postoperatively, but walking aids were necessary for the majority of patients. A proximal femur replacement in revision arthroplasty should be regarded as a salvage procedure for restoration of extremity function. With this procedure it is possible to achieve a--limited--walking ability for patients who were immobilised preoperatively in most cases. Furthermore, pain relief can be achieved. However, the--mostly multimorbid--patients must be informed preoperatively about restrictions in daily life in order to avoid exorbitant expectations. ","1476":"By a retrospective assessment of the Boneloc incident, a bone cement which had an inferior outcome in terms of survival rate, the value of published datasets for the detection of inferior outcomes was evaluated. A structured literature review of English and German peer reviewed journals was conducted. The articles were assessed with respect to revision rate and statements about the product. In a standardised methodology, adjusted for number of cases and follow-up period, the revision rate was calculated. Main goal was to assess the agreement of published information from different datasets. In the first 4 years after Boneloc had been brought on the market exclusively experimental studies were published, most of which were in favour of the product. In 1995, clinical studies, migration analyses and register-based articles were published. Most of them reported about inferior results, in the same year Boneloc was taken from the market worldwide. Sample-based clinical follow-up studies were not able to contribute to the decision-making process, they were published with a delay of several years and were underpowered from a statistical point of view. All of them published critical statements--after the product had no longer been available on the market for many years. The average revision rate in sample-based studies exceeded the reference value in the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register 7.35-fold. When the inferior results with Boneloc were published, the product had already disappeared from the national markets in Scandinavian countries' operating registers. The central position of orthopaedic scientific societies in the entire outcome monitoring system in these countries seems to be a key factor for success and rapid reaction to identified problems. Arthroplasty registers and migration analyses have the highest value for the rapid and reliable detection of inferior outcomes in comparative analyses of published articles. Experimental studies did not agree with the performance of the product in a retrospective view, the data cannot be transferred from the estimation of future clinical outcome like survival rates. The involvement of scientific societies in the assessment and dissemination of the results is a key factor to realise potential benefit by an advanced quality monitoring project like arthroplasty registers.

So far there is no study comparing the improvement of radiological implant position and the extra costs for the CAS. We therefore analysed 200 (100 navigated procedures versus 100 conventional operations) total knee replacements and 60 (30 navigated procedures versus 30 conventional operations) hip resurfacing procedures. Evaluation criteria were radiological alignment and costs produced by using computer-assisted navigation tools. In our series of total knee and hip resurfacing arthroplasties the number of outliers could be significantly reduced by using CAS. Patients receiving a navigated total knee replacement had a significantly lower blood loss and need for blood transfusion. The financial calculation for CAS for our specialised orthopaedic hospital showed that every CAS operation produced 442 euro extra costs per operation. So far these extra costs are not reimbursed. By using CAS the implant positioning is significantly improved. Total knee replacements have a lower blood loss. Due to the prolonged operation time, the leasing costs and the single use navigation tools of every navigated operation produced costs for our hospital of 442 euro. As there is so far no reimbursement of these costs, long-term survival studies are needed to reveal the superiority of the navigation method and to show an impact on the medical budget. ","1479":"This retrospective study investigates the incidence of anterior intertrochanteric ossifications (AIO), especially in comparison with heterotopic ossifications classified according to Brooker. A classification system of AIO regarding short-term results (&lt; 1 year after surgery) was introduced in 2003: AIO occurred solely in 13 % of all cases (ossifications according to Brooker grade 0) and would have been \"overlooked\" without a lateral X-ray. The incidence of AIO combined with ossifications according to Brooker &gt; 0 was 48.8 % of all cases. Our study reports long-term results, furthermore correlations between ossifications and clinical outcome, rated by the Harris hip score (HHS) and range of motion (ROM), are evaluated. 149 cementless total hip arthroplasties (Hofer-Imhof threaded cup, straight stem), implanted into 140 patients from November 1991 to December 1994 underwent complete clinical and radiological follow-up from December 2005 to October 2006. The average age of the 81 female and 59 male patients at the time of implantation was 64 years. Without exception, a conventional, transgluteal approach (Bauer) was performed. All patients received indomethacin prophylaxis for 8 consecutive days after surgery. Current X-rays (a.-p. and lateral view) were evaluated in comparison with the former X-rays. AIO were found in 77 cases (51.7 %), heterotopic ossifications corresponding to Brooker in 93 cases (62.4 %), a combination of AIO and Brooker in 58 cases (38.9 %) and solitary AIO in 19 cases (12.8 %). HHS and ROM were not significantly altered by ossifications. Our long-term findings compare with the short-term results (indicating lack of new bone formation [heterotopic ossification] after more than one year after surgery, as previously described in the literature concerning ossifications according to Brooker) and verify the incidence rate of solitary AIO. Despite a minor correlation with clinical outcome, AIO could be considered as a possible indicator for predilection of heterotopic bone formation, especially if revision arthroplasty or THA of the contralateral side is needed. ","1480":"Within a prospective case group study, two hamstring fixation techniques, a pin fixation with RigidFix (RF) and an anchor fixation with EndoButton (EB), were compared. 67 patients were followed clinically and by MRI preoperatively (t0), at six months (t6) and at twelve months (t12). In one group (N = 21), EB was used for representing a juxta-articular graft fixation. The second group (N = 46) with RF was used to represent the ab-articular fixation. KT-1000 stability measurement, IKDC, Lysholm and Tegner scores were used to determine the clinical outcomes. Reflux and tunnel widening (TW) were investigated by MRI. The KT-1000 values were slightly more stable at t6 (EB: 2.1 +\/- 4.1 mm, RF: 1.0 +\/- 2.5 mm) in the RF group (p = 0.044) but equalised later at t12 (EB: 0.5 +\/- 3.1 mm, RF 1.0 +\/- 2.4 mm). The median Tegner score at t6 (EB: 4.3 +\/- 1.2, RF 4.1 +\/- 1.7) and t12 (EB: 5.9 +\/- 1.8, RF 5.4 +\/- 2.0) were comparable (p = 0.692). The mean Lysholm score at t6 (EB: 90 +\/- 11, RF: 91 +\/- 8.9) and t12 (EB: 95 +\/- 7.5, RF: 95 +\/- 7.4) was comparable in each group (p = 0.589). The same was valid in the median of the IKDC score at t6 (EB: II, RF III) and t12 (EB: II, RF III). The category \"femoral reflux\" showed slight minimal fringe in the EB group at t6 but aligned to \"no reflux\" together with the RF group at t12 (NS, p = 0.550).

We performed a single center retrospective data analysis after trapezium resection with suspension and interposition arthroplasty of the thumb-carpometacarpal joint with emphasis on quality of life and radiological parameters 3.4 years (1.2-8.7 years) after operation in 60 patients. Pre- and postoperative pain was analysed with VAS, function was measured using the DASH score, pinch grip power with a pinchmeter. Subjective outcome was rated excellent in 42 cases (64.6%), good in 17 (26.2%), fair in 3 (4.6%) and 3 times (4.6%) poor. 56 patients (93.3%) would like to be operated again; 4 patients (6.7%) would deny an operation retrospectively. In the VAS pain was reduced by about 75% compared to the preoperative value. The pinch grip was increased by 46.6% compared to the preoperative value. The rate of major complications was 1.5% and of minor complications 9.2 %. Trapezium resection with suspension and interposition arthroplasty can increase the quality of life and reduce pain in patients with severe osteoarthritis of the 1st carpometacarpal joint. The rate of complications is low. Outcome assessment is possible by subjective parameters. Objective values like the range of movement or the decrease of the distance between metacarpal I and scaphoid do not correlate with outcome.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical results after arthroscopic fixation of dislocated avulsion fracture of the intercondylar eminence depending on patient age and refixation technique. 24 patients (50% below 16 years) with anterior cruciate ligament avulsion fractures were treated either with arthroscopic screw fixation (n = 17) or transtibial suture refixation (n = 7). Clinical follow-up examination was conducted on average 4.1 years after operation. 17% of the patients presented with additional intra-articular lesions. Osseous integration of the avulsion fragment was documented on plain radiographs on average 6.1 weeks after surgery in adults and after 3.9 weeks in children. Free range of motion was accomplished after 11.3 weeks. The choice of surgical technique did not show any influence on healing period or rehabilitation. The complication rate was 16.6% in skeletally immature patients and 8.3 % in adults. IKDC scores: A10, B2 in children; A9, B3 in adults. Tegner scores: children 5.8, adults 4.1. Lysholm scores: children 93, adults 88. Neither the patients' age nor the refixation technique selected yielded a significant correlation to the accomplished clinical score.

In this study, a cartilage-polymer construct using mesenchymal stem cells from trabecular bone and a polylactic acid polymer was fabricated with a press-coating technique. We investigated whether cells from human trabecular bone fragments have the same chondrogenic differentiation potential as mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow and whether it is possible to reconstruct an osteochondral lesion in the nude rat with the fabricated construct. Cells were obtained from the femoral head of patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty. The fabrication of the constructs was performed by centrifugation of 1.5x10(6) cells to a cell pellet which was then placed in a polymer block. The fabricated cell constructs were cultivated for 3 weeks in a serum-free medium, supplemented with transforming growth factor beta1. Every third day, the chondrogenic differentiation was analysed using chondrogenic and osteogenic marker genes. After three weeks the constructs were implanted into 5 mm osteochondral defects of the knee joint of nude rats. After 4 and 12 weeks histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. At the end of the culture period the constructs showed a proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix with the expression of collagen types II, IX and X as well as aggrecan und COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein). No osteogenic markers except collagen type I could be detected. The analysis of the in vivo experiment showed a good defect filling with a reconstructed cartilage surface along with increasing resorption of the polymer. We have shown that it is possible to fabricate cartilage-polymer constructs from trabecular bone-derived cells, and that the cells have the same chondrogenic differentiation potential as mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. With the fabricated cartilage-polymer construct it is possible to reconstruct an osteochondral defect in the knee joint of the nude rat.

Recently there are some changes concerning the German guidelines, which are approved by 27 German medical societies. For the first time the guidelines give distinct recommendations for the different indications, the kind of thrombosis prophylaxis and its duration. Some of the recommendations will lead to changes of both processes in outpatient and inpatient management. In parallel 2 new oral anticoagulants have been approved for the prevention of thromboembolic events after elective knee and hip replacement. Dabigatran is an oral thrombin inhibitor. Compared to enoxaparin it has a comparable profile of side effects and efficacy. Rivaroxaban is an oral Xa inhibitor which shows a significantly better efficacy compared to enoxaparin and no difference in side effects. The significant reduction of symptomatic thromboembolisms after elective knee and hip replacement was shown for rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin in a pooled analysis of phase III data. This review discusses the main topics of the new German guideline and impact of the new oral anticoagulants on in- and outpatient treatment procedures.","1488":"Fractures of the femoral head rarely occur and are often combined with dislocation of the hip joint. A separate classification of the femoral head fracture was described in 1957 by Pipkin. The operative treatment depends on the type of injury and requires extensive knowledge of the various operative approaches. We report on a 40-year-old female patient with Pipkin II fracture and operative treatment of the injury through an anterior minimally invasive incision. We present a review of the literature, evaluate the type of fractures, the kind of approaches and treatment and the long-term results. The dislocation of the hip should be treated by prompt closed reduction followed by traction and immobilization. Open reduction and internal fixation of Pipkin fractures depends on the presence of an obstructive fragment, an inability to obtain and maintain reduction of either the dislocation of the fracture or both and comminution of the fracture bone. When closed methods have failed operation is indicated. The operative treatment may include the excision of small fragments, the internal fixation with bioabsorbable screws, Herbert screws and the internal fixation of femoral neck fractures and acetabular fractures. In some cases salvage procedures like endoprotheses are necessary.","1489":"A young woman had subcutaneous bleeding at the retinaculum of the left knee after minor trauma.

After that no further bleeding episodes took place.","1490":"Nowadays, complex arthroscopic procedures of the knee joint, such as ACL reconstruction, are routinely carried out on an outpatient basis. The reduced time spent with the patient places high demands on the surgeon with regard to the management of such cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current standards of perioperative management following outpatient arthroscopic surgery of the knee in Germany. A questionnaire consisting of 18 questions was sent to 215 members of the German Association of Outpatient Arthroscopy (BVASK e. V.), dealing with the following topics: antibiotic prophylaxis, DVT prophylaxis, use of a tourniquet and suction drain, physical therapy, physiotherapy, analgesia, anaesthesia and emergency management. More than 51% of the forms were returned and considered suitable for statistical analysis. A total of 62% of the surgeons reported the use of an antibiotic prophylaxis (i. v. single shot) in every arthroscopic case, while 19% administer antibiotics only occasionally, especially in ACL reconstruction. Postoperative antibiotic treatment was reserved for special situations, such as prior joint infection. Prophylaxis of DVT by means of low molecular weight heparin was carried out in 96% of the cases. 51% prescribed anticoagulant agents for 1 week, 39% for the duration of reduced weight bearing. Half of the surgeons used a tourniquet cuff, 22% exsanguinate the limb prior to cuff inflation. A suction drainage was applied by 36% of the surgeons regularly and by 45% occasionally. The drain is left for one day by 79% of the surgeons, while 11% reported a shortened use of only several hours. With regard to analgesia, 66% of all surgeons apply some kind of local anaesthetic into the knee joint post surgery. Systemic preoperative analgesics or anti-inflammatory agents are given regularly in 56 % of the cases. A total of 92% of the procedures are carried out under general anaesthesia. In 36% of the cases, some kind of additional regional peripheral anaesthesia is used. With regard to postoperative care, cryotherapy is considered standard (97%) and 64% of the surgeons recommend physiotherapy. Nearly all surgeons (97%) offer the patients the opportunity to reach them personally via mobile phone during the first night following arthroscopic surgery. DVT prophylaxis with LMWH, general anaesthesia, postoperative cryotherapy and personal availability by phone can be considered part of the standard perioperative management following outpatient knee arthroscopy in Germany. However, a wide variety of treatment options can be found regarding topics such as analgesia, antibiotic prophylaxis, tourniquet, knee drainage and physiotherapy. ","1491":"Angular deformities of the lower extremity are considered as prearthrotic factors. Osteotomy is regarded as a way of corrective treatment. But this intervention is considered as complex and requires a special after-treatment. During childhood and with remaining growth, guided growth offers an elegant solution for this problem. Resulting in a temporary hemiepiphyseodesis, the eight-Plate offers an alternative technique besides the Blount staples and the definitive epiphyseodesis. We evaluated the effect of this device on the correction of angular deformities in children with different diagnoses and at different ages. Since 04\/2006 22 patients with angular deformities of the lower extremities due to different diagnoses were treated at our department with the eight-Plate (42 eight-Plates). In this study we evaluated the outcome of 13 patients (26 eight-Plates) until the completed angular correction and removal of the eight-Plate. A special treatment after plate removal was not applied. All patients improved their mechanical leg axis. The average age at implantation was 9.4 years (2.3-13.7 years). The average time until plate removal was 10.7 months (6-34 months). No hardware failures, extrusions, growth arrests, wound infections or other complications were observed. Two patients did not achieve the desired axis correction because of insufficient remaining growth potential. An additional surgical intervention was realised. The average correction of the study group regarding the mechanical axis deviation (MAD) was 22 mm (6-43 mm) and 10.6 degrees (5-27 degrees) regarding the angular correction of the mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFW). The mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTW) changed by 8.0 degrees (3-15 degrees). In our opinion the eight-Plate seems to be a safe and reliable device for guided growth of angular deformities around the knee. The technique is easy to learn and the complication rate low compared to the staple technique. A special after-treatment is not needed and there is only minor operative trauma. At present there are only few data on long-term follow-up after plate removal until skeletal maturity. The definition of the ideal point in time for plate removal is still open.

However, this treatment option for advanced carpal collapse is not without complications, such as malunion, hardware impingement or incomplete correction of lunate extension. K-wires, staples, Herbert screws or, recently, locking plates are all possible fixation techniques after scaphoid excision. Only a few studies including mid-term results using K-wires are available. The aim of our study was to evaluate clinical and radiological mid-term results after scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis using K-wires for stage II and III scapholunate and scaphoid non-union advanced collapse. Twelve wrists of 11 patients (4\/SNAC II degrees, 3\/SNAC III degrees, 0\/SLAC II degrees, 5\/SLAC III degrees) were treated operatively by scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis. Four K-wires were used for osteosynthesis. After an average follow-up of 60.25 months, reexamination included subjective, objective and radiological values. Clinical examinations covered wrist motion, grip strength and pinch strength. These parameters were compared with preoperatively collected data and values of the unaffected side. The DASH score (disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand), Cooney score and the visual analogue scale (VAS 0-10) were analysed. Radiographic assessment of consolidation was verified by conventional X-rays. The carpal height was compared to the preoperative value by assessing the Youm index. All patients were satisfied, pain relief was reported and displayed on VAS from 7.4 (5-10) to 1.4 (0-5). The mean flexion-extension arc of 76.3 +\/- 28.8 degrees (59.7% of the opposite wrist), preoperatively 75 +\/- 17.3 degrees, was documented. The average total arc of ulnar and radial deviation was 37.5 +\/- 9.2 degrees (51% of the opposite wrist). The preoperative value was 33.5 +\/- 9.8 degrees. Further clinical evaluation yielded a mean grip strength of 39.3 kp (89.5% of the anaffected side) and pinch strength of 7.6 kp (81.7%). Total DASH score and Cooney score averaged 15 and 74.17 points, respectively. Osseus consolidation was observed radiologically in all patients already after 6 weeks. The Youm index decreased from 0.55 +\/- 0.054 to 0.51 +\/- 0.057. The radiolunate joint space remained unaltered in height. There were no infections. Except for wire removal, no additional surgery was necessary. Scaphoid excision and four-corner arthrodesis for advanced collapse of the wrist enjoy great satisfaction by the patients, with a high degree of pain reduction. This method shows persistent strength and movability in mid-term-results. Compared to alternative fixation techniques, the use of K-wires is a low-risk and low-cost treatment option, although removal of the K-wires is commonly necessary. ","1494":"The treatment of large bone defects remains a challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon. Regenerative therapies with the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) may provide an alternative to autogenous bone transplantation, callus distraction or the use of allografts. On the occasion of an expert workshop of the German Society for Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery, a literature search regarding studies with the use of MSC was performed to evaluate its potential for future clinical studies. Furthermore, the legislative requirements were examined. Various in vitro and animal studies showed the benefit of MSC in bone regeneration. However, there are sparse data from clinical studies. Due to recent legislative changes there are several regulatory demands to meet if clinical studies are performed with MSC. For further evaluation of the role of MSC in the treatment of bone defects there is a need for clinical trials. The current paper provides some assistance for the successful application for clinical trials with MSC. Planning and performance of these studies may require early consultation with the regulatory authorities and cooperation of research centres in order to obtain authorisation for the evaluation of MSC. Preclinical data have to be obtained according to good laboratory practice with equivalent protocols that will be used in the clinical trials. In the latter the implementation of the guidelines for good clinical practice are mandatory. ","1495":"Preoperative planning is regarded as an important requirement for successful implantation of a hip replacement. One of the crucial aspects of planning is the restoration of the normal anatomy of the hip as this increases the chances for good clinical function and reduces wear debris. Various systems for restoration of the hip are available including stem systems with different stem sizes and offsets and so-called modular stem systems which have the additional possibility of adjusting the neck length and angle. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent a good postoperative outcome can be achieved using a modular and a non-modular stem system in comparison with preoperative planning. Furthermore, the study assessed the difference between preoperative planning carried out by a senior surgeon and by an assistant surgeon. Standard preoperative and postoperative digitalised radiographs with an anteroposterior view of the pelvis centred over the pubic symphysis were made. Preoperative planning aimed for exact reconstruction of offset and equal leg length. Preoperative planning and evaluation of the postoperative outcome were performed by digitalised image-analysing software. The symptom-free contralateral hip served as reference for anatomic reconstruction. The postoperative results confirmed the preoperative planning. The preoperative planning was successfully implemented with both systems. Postoperatively, we observed a slightly reduced offset (Group 1: 3.6 mm, Group 2: 3.54 mm) and an increase in leg length of less than 5 mm in both groups. There was no significant difference between the preoperative planning carried out by the senior surgeon and the assistant surgeon. Implementation of preoperative planning with both the modular and the non-modular system was very satisfactory. It was irrelevant if the planning was carried out by a senior surgeon or by an assistant surgeon in the first year of training.

The screw dislocated from the tibial canal into the joint and caused damage to the retropatellar cartilage which was treated by debridement and lateral release. A material analysis was done on the explanted screw which showed no material fault. A review of the literature reporting adverse events connected to biodegradable implants was carried out. Nine papers reporting about adverse event are cited. There seem to be three main problems: delayed degradation, foreign body reaction and the filling of graft tunnels with non-ossified tissue. Instructions for the use of biodegradable interference screws were requested from seven manufacturers to compare the given information about the degradation behaviour. The information given on the period of time until the screws would be completely resorbed were heterogeneous, ranging from no specific information about the time span at all up to 24 months. More research is needed to identify the degradation behaviour more precisely and clarify the potential risks connected to biodegradable implants. Their use should be reconsidered critically.","1498":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of Pauwels' classification of femoral neck fractures. A study of literature was performed. It has never been proven that the inclination of the fracture plane has a prognostic relevance. A number of papers prove the contrary, there are no publications where Pauwels' classification has been used successfully in selecting treatment modalities. Pauwels' theory of fracture inclination angle has not been transferred into clinical practice. This discrepancy probably goes back to the fact that the angle cannot be determined preoperatively, that in the majority of femoral neck fractures the angle is within the range of 40 to 60 degrees, that the theoretical angle variations do practically not exist, and that the shearing forces are reduced to an unknown amount by friction resistance due to the uneven fracture plane. The mechanical laws of the pseudarthrosis of the femoral neck cannot be extrapolated to acute fractures. The theory of Pauwels has apparently no clinical relevance for the majority of acute fractures, except for the rare transcervical fractures, and should not be considered any longer as a classification of acute femoral neck fractures due to the lack of prognostic and therapeutic relevance. ","1499":null,"1500":"Luxations in revision arthroplasty are a serious complication with an incidence of up to 30 percent. In particular in patients with previous operation and resection of bone and soft tissue, the instability increases significantly. The use of the bipolar revision cup Avantage has to be proven valuable to avoid recurrent luxation. 27 consecutive revisions of the bipolar acetabular component were performed. The mean age at the time of revision was 67 years (range 40-91 years). The mean rate of previous operations was 5.1 cases (range 1-14). In 11 hips (40.7%) the acetabular cup was revised, in 16 hips (59.3%) an additional stem revision was performed. In 10 cases the revision was performed by a proximal femur reconstruction, in one patient by a total femur reconstruction. The follow-up was short-term, at a mean of 20 months (range 13-29 months). The clinical results were evaluated prospectively by the Harris hip score (HHS) and the activity score according to Sutherland (aSL). The migration of the cup and the change of the inclination angle were calculated radiographically. There has been one dislocation of the polyethylene liner in the recent follow-up, which could be treated conservatively by closed reduction. No patients required reoperation because of technical errors or loosening of the bipolar acetabular implant. The HHS improved from a mean of 40.5 (range 7-77.4) to 66.8 points (range 17.4-89.9). The modified Sutherland score improved to 5.9 (range 3-9) of 10 possible points. Radiographic follow-up revealed neither evidence of component loosening nor migration or polyethylene wear. Use of this bipolar unconstrained component was successful in restoring stability in hip revision arthroplasty, e.g., in patients with severely unstable hips. It has to be observed carefully if there are any disadvantages of these devices because of higher polyethylene wear in the mid- or long-term follow-up. The possible disadvantages of dissociations between the inner liner from the outer liner or damage of the polyethylene liner limits the indication of this device to serious revision cases.

The results were compared amongst the groups as well as with a reference group consisting of asymptomatic individuals. The question to be answered was whether or not professional volleyball players possess a characteristic strength profile in their trunk musculature and if differences exist with regard to the individuals' competitive playing level. In this comparative study 12 professional volleyball players (German Bundesliga) and 18 non-professional volleyball players were analysed with regard to their isometric strength profile in all three planes. The reference group was provided by the Proxomed company, which had previously analysed healthy untrained individuals (n = 1045) of various age groups. A sports-specific profile for the musculature of volleyball players revealed a significant reduction in the flexion and rotation strength as well as a well-developed lateral flexion strength (highly significant when compared to the reference group). With reference to the level played, better strength values in flexion and lateral flexion were found among the professional athletes. Professional volleyball players present with a characteristic trunk musculature strength profile. A detailed analysis of the muscle strength of the spine as part of a sports medicine work-up could prove helpful in preventing injuries and overuse problems in professional and hobby volleyball players. ","1502":"The clinical trial is the link between research and medical practice and facilitates evidence-based therapies. There are specific difficulties to be faced when executing clinical trials related to surgical services (learning curve of the surgeon, blinding etc.). As a result, surgical randomised controlled clinical trials (RCT) are underrepresented in the total number of RCTs. To make it easier to implement surgical RCT, the Clinical Trial Unit for Orthopaedics and Trauma Surgery was established. Training of the supporting physicians was reached by rotations in the structures of CHIR-Net, a BMBF-funded network created to build up a region-wide surgical research infrastructure. Supported by the regional CHIR-Net Center and the regional Clinical Trial Center, a research institute was thus founded with the aim of contributing to a long-term improvement in clinical research in orthopaedics and trauma surgery. ","1503":"Aim of our study was to create artificial labra for joint models of different diameters (28, 32 and 36 mm) and to measure their stability potential at rest (SPR). The experiment was performed under the same conditions as a previous one with capsulated joint models. Our target was to prove the hip stabilising effect of the atmospheric pressure (AP) as well as the parameters for joint stability and to test the function of the artificial labra. Uncapsulated joint models having 28 (A), 32 (B) and 36 (C) mm diameters were sealed with moulded preformed silicone labra. An increasing traction force was applied under water on the fixed joint. Using specially designed software, the exerted force and the dislocation distance were simultaneously and continuously recorded on a computer. The SPR of the examined joint models was calculated as the difference between the maximal exerted force and the weight of the ball-neck component. Statistical analyses showed that SPR had mean values of 58.12 +\/- 2.23 N for the 28 mm joint model (n = 118; A), 75.66 +\/- 2.75 N for the 32 mm model (n = 88; B) and 99.91 +\/- 1.30 N for the 36 mm model (n = 82; C). The traction force required for dislocation agreed closely to the expected precalculated SPR values of 58.6 N (A), 76.4 N (B) and 96.7 N (C), which proves the joint stabilising effect of AP in the presence of the essential prerequisites (spherical ball articulating in a hemispherical socket, hermetically closed joint capsule and\/or labrum, which contains a small amount of fluid and excludes air). The measured SPR was directly proportional to the square of the joint diameter. Indirectly, it was concluded that the dislocation work at rest is directly proportional to the joint diameter cubed. Consequently, the risk of dislocation after total hip arthroplasty (THA) can be reduced by applying bigger, size-adapted hip balls, whose diameter grows according to the outer diameter of the cup. The increasing range of motion is a favourable side-effect. With careful reconstruction of the capsule and insertion of an intracapsular drain, the risk of dislocation in the early postoperative period could be furtherly reduced. Theoretically, artificial labra could be a useful alternative to augment joint stability in THA with a high dislocation tendency instead of constrained liners. ","1504":"The critical incident reporting system (CIRS)and a surgical safety checklist (SSC) are considered to be the most powerful and important means for patient safety and for avoiding surgical errors. Nevertheless, these tools are not yet standard in orthopaedic surgery. We have implemented CIRS and a surgical checklist adapted to the specific conditions in orthopaedic surgery. In this article, we provide a guideline to put CIRS and SSC into practice and report on preliminary results one year after implementation in our department. A comprehensive statistical analysis of the reduction in surgical errors cannot yet be given. As a first effect after one year, an improvement in interdisciplinary team building, an increased sense of responsibility of each employee and a positive change in failure culture can be observed. SSC and reporting near mistakes enables a comprehensive failure analysis helping to avoid future complications and improve medical quality. ","1505":"The Monteggia lesion is a rare injury of the elbow in children. This lesion is defined as a shaft fracture of the ulna combined with a luxation of the radial head. The primary problem in this injury is the proper diagnosis because the misalignment of the radial head is often missed. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyse the results after Monteggia lesions in children. Ten children between two and nine years of age (six boys and four girls) were clinically assessed using the Morrey score. They were treated in our department between December 1999 and October 2004. The Morrey score after 54 months (min.: 26\/max.: 84) had a median value of 100 points with 100 being the maximum (min.: 95\/max.: 100). We found two complications, a combined lesion of the radial and ulnar nerves which completely recovered after six months. In one case a k-wire dislocated, which was removed earlier. If the Monteggia lesion in children is correctly diagnosed and treated early enough, only good and very good results may be expected. After delayed diagnosis and treatment, the clinical results are not as good or even very poor. ","1506":"The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the clinical and radiographic results after operative treatment of dislocated distal radius fractures with a new self-locking volar plate system. 67 patients (average age 61.4 years) with a dislocated distal radius fracture were treated with the ITS plate system. Clinical and radiographic evaluation was done with a mean follow-up of 9.3 months. The mean DASH score reached 14 points, the modified Gartland\/Werley score was 6.9. There was one loss of reduction on radiographic evaluation, which yielded to a dorsal osteosynthesis. Average postoperative radial inclination was 20.5 degrees (16-29 degrees) and the volar tilt 9.3 degrees (3-15 degrees). One plate had to be removed after three months because of dislocation of a malpositioned screw. There were no cases of infection or tendon ruptures. No patient required autograft bone. This new locking plate system offers an excellent option in the treatment of dislocated distal radius fractures, especially in osteoporotic bone with a dorsal comminution. ","1507":"The effectiveness of e-learning for reporting of x-ray-findings in a prospective, randomized trial was tested. Twenty advanced medical students were randomized into two groups. The test group practiced 4-6 hours with the newly developed software, the control group used conventional learning material. Afterwards, a test was carried out including 30 pathologic x-ray films that were randomly spread through 200 non-pathologic images. The required time, the number of correctly appraised images and the frequency of falsely suspected pathologies were recorded. In addition, we asked for an assessment of the own capabilities in evaluating x-ray films and of passing the radiology training. The test group showed a markedly improved efficiency in comparison to the control group in all parameters. The required time was 57.4% shorter than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05), 18.3% more cases were evaluated correctly (p &lt; 0.05). The frequency of falsely suspected pathologies decreased by 61% (p &lt; 0.05). There was no significant correlation of the objective abilities of a student with his\/her self-assessment or of passing the radiology course. This study shows that an effective standardized training of practical skills by means of e-learning is feasible and reasonable. ","1508":"In this prospective study we have analysed the clinical outcome of complex distal radius fractures that were reduced by a dorsal approach and fixed with 2 dorsal locking plates. In the period from January 2006 to June 2008 60 patients with a distal intra-articular instable radius fracture, who were treated with the above mentioned procedure, were prospectively included in this study. All fractures showed signs of a complex and dorsal instability. X-rays and CT scans were taken preoperatively. Follow-up examinations and X-rays were conducted after 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. The clinical outcome was measured with the aid of the disability of arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) score (0-100 points). The functional outcome was measured with the Gartland and Wearley score (0-21 points). Subjective pain levels were noted with the visual analogue scale (0-10 points). 60 patients were examined after 6 weeks and 6 months. 40 patients were examined after 1 year. The average age was 56 (range: 16-78 years). In 36% of the cases we found an accompanying injury of the upper extremity that had to be treated operatively. The DASH score improved on average from 47 points after 6 weeks (28 points after 6 months) to 24 points after 1 year. The subjective pain level after 1 year was 2.4 points under stress and 1.1 points in relaxation. The Gartland and Wearley score showed an improvement of function of the wrist from 9.9 points after 6 weeks to 7.4 points after 1 year, which is considered a good result. In 12 cases reoperations were necessary, in 6 cases due to a postoperative carpal tunnel syndrome (10%) and in 1 case due to an infection of the wound. Dorsal instable radius fractures can be stabilised in a satisfactory way. It is possible to achieve good results, assuming an exact analysis of the fracture and of the associated injuries is performed. ","1509":"Total disc arthroplasty is reported to maintain segmental motion. From finite element studies a rather posterior and central implantation of the prosthesis is recommended. However, there is yet no in vitro study with cadaveric specimens investigating the topic of implant positioning. Ten human lumbar spines were subjected to biomechanical testing. Flexion\/extension and side-bending moments were applied from 2.5-7.5 Nm on a spine load simulator. First, the intact specimens were tested in 3 load cycles while motion was monitored with regard to the facet joints under different loads by an ultrasound-based system. An unconstrained total disc prosthesis was then implanted in a central position and the different load cycles were repeated. Finally the implant was positioned in a decentral position with an average offset of 6.2 mm for repetitive data acquisition. Comparison of the facet joint motion in central and eccentric prosthesis positions resulted in the following averaged differences. During flexion of the lumbar spine an average difference of the reference point excursions of 0.38 mm was recorded on the ipsilateral facet joint with reference to the decentral position. For extension, the difference was 0.33 mm on average, for right side bending a difference of 0.63 mm was recorded while left side bending resulted in an average difference of 0.24 mm. The deviation of the reference markers on the contralateral facet joint showed the following average differences: for flexion 0.23 mm and for extension 0.54 mm, respectively. For side bending right\/left the differences amounted to 0.18 mm and 0.39 mm. With regard to segmental motion there was no statistically significant difference for both the ipsilateral (p = 0.0564) and the contralateral (p = 0.2593) reference marker. The comparison of the segmental motion after central and decentral implantation of a lumbar total disc prosthesis reveals differences that have, nevertheless, no statistical significance. However, for clinical use it is recommended to strive for a central position of the implant. ","1510":"The therapy for infected non-union is complicated and needs multidisciplinary action. The fixateur externe is usually used to stabilise an osteosynthesis temporarily or permanently. But it shows a high risk with adipose patients and when the bone is already damaged. That is why alternative modes of action have been looked for. For temporary stabilisation and simultaneous antibiotic therapy we have invented and now use a custom-made cement rod impregnated with antibiotics. We use a plastic high-lumen thorax drainage tube which is filled with cement mixed with antibiotics and a K-wire. When the cement has set the plastic is removed. The cement rod acts as a space holder. After the infection has calmed down we remove the space holder and a definitive stabilisation with a titanium nail is performed. The active substance levels tested in the wound exudation showed results clearly above the minimum inhibitory concentration. Early mobilisation with sole contact was mainly possible.The wound dressing could be performed without problems and an additional stabilisation was not necessary. Clinically the infection calmed down after 3 to 4 weeks. The therapy for infected non-union of tubular bones consists of the complete removal of metal, the resection of the pseudarthrosis, the filling of the defect and the re-osteosynthesis. Intramedullary space holders offer a biomechanical stabilization as an intramedullary carrier of weight with additional simultaneous antibiotic therapy. The use of an intramedullary spaceholder made of antibiotic-impregnated cement in infected non-unions avoids the specific complications of a fixateur externe and is definitely more comfortable for the patient. Locally high antibiotic levels are reached, the treatment takes less time. ","1511":"We report about our experiences with the elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) of traumatic humeral shaft fractures in children and adolescents. Children with traumatic humerus shaft fractures who were treated by ESIN were included. All patients underwent clinical follow-up examinations. 31 children (average age 11.4 years) with traumatic humeral shaft fractures could be included. There were 14 oblique, 12 transverse and 5 wedge fractures. In 5 cases the fracture was located in the proximal third, in 22 cases in the middle third and in 4 cases in the distal third. After an average period of 32 months a follow-up-examination with the Constant-Murley score was performed. All children attained 100 points and all patients could take part in sports activities like before the accident. 30 children and their parents were very satisfied with the treatment success and 1 patient was satisfied. The following complications were seen: 1 postoperative damage of the radial nerve in a patient with secondary fracture dislocation (complete remission), 1 skin irritation, 1 fracture dislocation with axial deviation, 1 secondary dislocation of the nails after a second accident and 1 secondary axial deviation. Elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) of humerus shaft fractures has a low complication rate if attention is paid to biomechanical principles. The observed complications are based on mistakes concerning the indication or technical errors. The ESIN shows very good functional and cosmetic results. It allows an early functional and cast-free follow-up with a quick pain reduction. The ESIN of humeral shaft fractures is a minimally invasive, simple and well reproducible technique with a steep learning curve. Because of the excellent objective and subjective results, the operative stabilization of humerus shaft fractures with ESIN should be recommended to the patients and their parents. ","1512":"Bleeding and clotting disturbances are not uncommon in trauma patients and require an early and consequent therapy. Under the prevalent pathophysiological circumstances of hypothermia, acidosis and clotting disturbances, desmopressin seems to be a possible option to control diffuse bleeding. We report about 2 trauma patients with diffuse bleeding and in whom desmopressin was used successfully to control bleeding from the point of view of the authors. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of desmopressin in the 2 patients.","1513":"The biochemical changes associated with rotator cuff tearing are still unclear. The aim of this study is to assess whether concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase in the synovial fluid are specifically altered in shoulders with torn rotator cuff tendons. Synovial fluid was extracted via arthroscopy in 21 patients with complete rotator cuff tears (RCTs). The control group was composed of 21 patients without complete tears. The catabolic cartilage metabolism markers MMP-1 (collagenase), MMP-3 (stromelysin1) and MMP-13 (collagenase3) were quantified by an ELISA test and these results were then statistically analysed using SAS. The mean concentration of the 21 samples with rotator cuff tears shows a higher concentration of MMP 3 (2601.73 ng\/mL vs. 1775.67 ng\/mL) and MMP 13 (2.69 ng\/mL vs. 2.35 ng\/mL) as well as a significantly higher concentration of MMP 1 (p=0.0047) in the control group. A significant variation in the concentration of catabolic cartilage enzymes in the synovial fluid in patients with and without rotator cuff tears could not be found. Nonetheless, there is a bias for the MMP-3 and MMP-13 values, which makes a conductive influence in the aetiology of osteoarthritis probable. ","1514":"ACL rupture is more common in females than in males. The injury can result in chondral and meniscal damage or chronic instability. Most often ACL rupture occurs during landing after throwing and jumping in ball sports. Many studies have reported on incidence, mechanism of injury and predisposing factors in professional athletes. In contrast, we have investigated the impact of mass sports on predisposing factors for the female ACL rupture. In an empirical analytical study leg-axis dynamics, proprioception and foot load of 44 women participating either in regular mass sports or in no sports were investigated by video analysis and on the Biodex-Stability Platform. Our study demonstrates that mass sports improves proprioception of the knee joint. Non-sportive subjects had an increased valgus leg axis during landing in comparison with mass sport participants. Here, we show to the best of our knowledge for the first time that moderate sports activity has a positive effect on predisposing factors of the female ACL rupture. We conclude that prevention programmes focussed on jumping and proprioception can lower the incidence of female ACL ruptures. ","1515":"A rarely described Achilles tendon lesion resulting from Haglund's disease and its repair is presented. An analysis of the respective clinical records was carried out. Haglund's resection was performed from a 3 cm lateral transverse approach. A coincidental anterior Achilles tendon partial tear was repaired by transversal U-sutures. A minimally invasive repair of a partial tear of the anterior Achilles tendon is feasible and effective. ","1516":"The purpose of this clinical study (matched-pair design) was to compare the functional short-term results obtained in patients with surface replacement of the humeral head and cemented glenoid prosthesis with those obtained after total shoulder arthroplasty. 20 patients (average age 67.7 [43-85] years, 17 women, three men) who received surface replacement of the humeral head with cemented glenoid prosthesis were matched to a control group of 20 patients (average age 67.55 [42-85] years, 17 women, three men) with a conventional total shoulder arthroplasty. Six patients were treated for osteoarthritis, two for post-traumatic arthritis, 1 each for osteonecrosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Preoperative status, perioperative results and postoperative status (Constant score, subjective assessment, range of motion, radiographic evaluation) were compared in all patients and controls. The adjusted Constant score improved from a mean of 37.25% to a mean of 87.75% in the hybrid group and from a mean of 30.8% to a value of 87.1% in the TSA group. Regarding the relative improvement at 12 months compared to baseline, patients treated with hybrid prostheses showed a comparable benefit in the Constant score, pain reduction and range of motion. Only the criterion \"strength\" revealed a significantly better result in the TSA group (p = 0.025). There was one irreversible injury of the brachial plexus in one case and neural injuries with a full recovery in two cases of Hybrid prosthesis. The combination of humeral surface replacement with cemented glenoid component offers a relatively new option for the treatment of different pathologies at the shoulder joint which need a total joint substitute.The short-term results are comparable with those of conventional total shoulder arthroplasty. Surface replacement of the shoulder facilitates later revision because of less loss of bone stock. It must be considered that surface replacement with implantation of cemented glenoid prosthesis is a difficult procedure because of the exploration of the glenoid. ","1517":"Displaced midclavicular fractures in children are generally treated non-operatively. But there is a lack of age-related data concerning the functional and cosmetic results following conservative treatment and patients' content with the treatment. In patients with displaced midclavicular fractures complications and pain was evaluated in relation to treatment option and age. Outcome was measured with the Constant Shoulder Score, a client satisfaction questionnaire (ZUV-8) about the satisfaction with the treatment and the cosmetic result and ultrasound of both clavicles. A review of emergency room and fracture clinic records revealed 101 children and adolescents in whom displaced midclavicular fracture had been treated between 1\/1997 and 12\/2007. The follow-up included 59 patients with 60 fractures 1-10 years after the accident. Of those, 50 fractures were treated with a sling and 10 by operation. All patients under the age of ten were treated conservatively and reached very good functional and cosmetic results. Only an eight-year-old girl suffered from a painful pseudarthrosis. After resection and stabilisation by flexible intramedullary nailing, the outcome was excellent. Patients over the age of ten received a conservative treatment in 28 cases and ten had an operation (K-wires fixation n=2, elastic stable intramedullary nail n=8 in 7 patients). Functional outcome independent of treatment method was as good as in younger children, but the global and cosmetic satisfaction score was much lower. Older patients with a non-operative treatment suffered from more pain and were dissatisfied with the long immobilisation. The method of choice in children under the age of ten with a displaced clavicular fracture is the non-surgical treatment supported by sufficient pain medication. Older children reach good results but suffer from more pain and are dissatisfied by the cosmetic results and immobilisation. Because of this, active older children and adolescents with a displaced clavicular fracture benefit from elastic stable intramedullary nailing. ","1518":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, sometimes even fatal though preventable complication after surgical interventions, especially in orthopaedic surgery. The risk can be reduced by more than 50 % by mechanical means and different anticoagulant drugs. However, only few patients receive adequate treatment. Medicamentous options are limited and somewhat difficult. Most anticoagulant substances act indirectly, therefore their efficacy can easily be impaired. For some, the pharmacokinetics are quite unfavourable. Furthermore, these drugs can cause severe adverse reactions; and since drug therapy either needs daily injections or routine blood checks, its acceptance is limited even further. Fortunately, new substances have reached phase III and will shortly be released. They have a broad therapeutic index, favourable pharmacodynamics and -kinetics and seem to cause only few adverse events. Rivaroxaban, for example, is approved for orthopaedic interventions like total hip or knee replacement. Orally administered, it interacts directly with factor Xa. It proved to be superior compared to the standard therapy with Enoxaparin, has a similar risk profile and needs no routine blood checks. The following article gives a critical survey of the problem, therapeutic options, current guidelines and new possibilities. Hopefully, these new simplified therapy options will increase the acceptance of VTE prophylaxis so that the rate of fatal complications after orthopaedic interventions can further be reduced.","1519":"The quantification of newly formed bone in experimental defect models is a problem in various experimental set-ups. Several methods have been described to evaluate and quantify the regeneration of newly formed bone in various animal models. Most methods only describe the amount of regenerated tissue on a semi-quantitative level, the results significantly depend on the subjective rating of the observer and such evaluation methods have not been validated in terms of objectivity and reliability. The aim of the present study was to introduce a novel evaluation method for the accurate quantification of bone regeneration on digital X-ray images using a freely available digital image software analysis programme (GIMP, GNU General Public Licence). The method introduced here contains 5 steps: standardisation of size and colour, determination of range of interest (ROI), defining different qualities of mineralisation, pixel analysis with histogram function, similar to the Hondsfield index, and quantification. In order to evaluate the objectivity and reliability, the quantification method was compared to semi-quantitative scores described by Mosheiff and Werntz for inter- and intraobserver variability. Six observers were asked to determine bone regeneration in 16 X-ray images of 2 different animal models. In order to describe intraobserver variability, the evaluation was repeated after a period of 4 weeks. Statistical analysis including determination of intra- and interobserver variability (Bland-Altman coefficient of reproduction) was performed using SAS software. For both experimental set-ups analysed in this project (rabbit and sheep bone defects), the objectivity was significantly higher in the GIMP-based evaluation compared to the evaluation according to Mosheiff and Werntz using the Bland-Altman coefficient (rabbit: GIMP: 0.095, Mosheiff: 0.272, Werntz: 0.283; sheep: GIMP: 0.098, Mosheiff: 0.658, Werntz: 0.668). Analogous results were obtained for reliability (rabbit: GIMP: 0.086, Mosheiff: 0.221, Werntz: 0.385; sheep: GIMP: 0.102, Mosheiff: 0.339, Werntz: 0.623). This quantification method introduced here has proved to be a reliable and \"easy-to-use\" tool in order to perform objective quantification of bone regeneration in 2 different experimental set-ups. It offers a more detailed and quantitative way for precise determination of regenerated tissue and is characterised by higher objectivity and reliability compared to other semi-quantitative evaluation methods. The objectivity seems to be independent of the animal model to which the method is applied. ","1520":"Local antiseptics are commonly used for perioperative skin and wound disinfection and as solutions for joint lavage. Therefore, we examined if an intra-articular use of these antiseptics is possible by using an IN VITRO chondrocyte model. Articular chondrocytes harvested from 7 patients were cultured. After reaching 80% confluency different concentrations (0%, 1%, 10%, 50%, 100%) of polyhexanide, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine were added for 5 minutes. Afterwards, the solution was removed and the chondrocytes were cultured for 24 hours. Subsequently the vitality and proliferation rate (DNA synthesis) were analysed with the WST-1 and BrdU tests. 1% povidone-iodine and 1% hydrogen peroxide solutions significantly (p=0.001) decreased the chondrocyte vitality as compared to our control group. There was no significant difference (p=0.71) after the application of 1% polyhexanide in the vitality ratios. A significant decrease in vitality was also observed after the application of 10% polyhexanide solution (p=0.001). Application of 1% povidone-iodine solution, 1% hydrogen peroxide solution and 10% polyhexanide revealed a decrease in the metabolic cell activity of 80% compared to our control group, whereas the activity was 65% (p=0.026) compared to the control group after application of 1% polyhexanide solution. Our results demonstrate the chondrotoxic effect of the tested antiseptic solutions in clinical used concentrations within short time points. Polyhexanide in a low concentrated solution (1%) was the antiseptic with the lowest influence on the vitality and the DNA synthesis of chondrocytes. Thus, this antiseptic solution seemed to be the best choice for intra-articular application. But overall, our study showed general limitations for the intra-articular use of local antiseptics. ","1521":"The aim of the study was to survey the current state of the conservative and operative treatment of anterior shoulder instability and its rehabilitation in German hospitals. A previously evaluated online questionnaire was sent out to all German hospitals with orthopaedic or trauma surgery departments. The Federal Statistical Office's hospital list was the basis for the selection of hospitals. The questions referred to the year 2007. The survey, including 3 reminders, was conducted over 3 months. The questionnaire consisted of 6 response categories: always (100%), almost always (99-81%), predominantly (80-51%), rarely (50-21%), almost never (20-1%) and never (0%). The response rate was 41% and 67% of these had carried out shoulder stabilisations. In total, 99.2% of the 67% were evaluable. The proportion of shoulder surgery was 8.4% of the total number of operations. Shoulder stabilisations represented 10.6% of these operations. A specialised shoulder department existed in 22.9%. Conservative treatment was carried out with an immobilisation of the arm \"predominantly\", \"almost always\" and \"always\" for internal rotation in 70.8% and in 23.4% for external rotation. The shoulders were \"predominantly\", \"almost always\" and \"always\" stabilised in an arthroscopic technique in 68.2% and in an open one in 31.8% of the clinics. With 92.9%, the Bankart repair was the most common operation. Shoulder instability was principally treated with the arthroscopic technique, regardless of the care level and department and is considered the best surgical technique. Physiotherapy was prescribed \"always\" and \"almost always\" in 99.3%. The rate of reluxation after conservative treatment was estimated at 35.5%, after operative open anterior shoulder stabilisation at 9.1% and after arthroscopic shoulder stabilization at 10.6%. Nevertheless, 49.4% of respondents expected the best results after arthroscopic treatment. Participants, who mainly applied the arthroscopic technique, expected a lower rate of reluxation in comparison to other techniques (p&lt;0.001).

Complication rates for junior and senior surgeons were evaluated as well as differences between daytime and nightshift surgery. We also assessed the duration of surgery for the two groups and its impact on the complication rate. The average duration of the procedure was 67 minutes (23-194) with statistically significant differences between junior and senior surgeons (77 vs. 61 minutes, p &lt; 0.001). Complications occurred in 27 (7.5%) of all cases. Postoperative infections were most frequently found (3.1% of all complications), followed by haematomas and dislocations of the implant (1.7% and 1.1 %, respectively). 25 patients required revision operations. More complications were found in cases performed by junior surgeons (9.56% vs. 6.25%). This difference was not significant (p = 0.248). During on-call duty we also observed more complications compared to daytime surgery (11% vs. 7%). There was no coherence between the duration of surgery and the incidence of complications.

A total of 24 test cylinders was implanted bilaterally into the femurs of 6 female adult Goettinger minipigs. 12 weeks after surgery the animals were sacrificed. 12 test implants were used for a push-out test and 12 test implants were evaluated histologically. The mean maximum shear strength of the bone-implant interface was 7.6 +\/- 2.0 MPa. Direct bone attachment was found in 7.4 +\/- 3.4% of the histologically analysed surfaces. In summary, porous-surfaced AMC test implants demonstrated good mechanical stability in spite of a low percentage of bone ongrowth.

The segmental angles were determined by Cobb's method preoperatively and after 12 months. Intraoperative parameters like time of surgery and blood loss as well as complications during the postoperative course were recorded. Clinical controls after 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months were done. Mean age was 44.3 years. In total, 101 devices in 70 patients (27 two level, 2 three level) were implanted. Average time for surgery amounted to 68 minutes per patient and 54 minutes per prosthesis. Average blood loss was 80 mL. There were no intraoperative complications. All patients, except for 3 surgical revisions, were examined clinically and radiologically after 8 weeks, 6 and 12 months. Study parameters like NDI and VAS for arm and neck pain showed a significant (p &lt; 0.001) improvement at all follow-ups compared to the preoperative situation. However, the value of VAS for arm pain in the follow-up rose again significantly (p &lt; 0.05). The motor deficit improved in 33% completely and in 67% incompletely. Sensory disturbances were unchanged in 17%, improved in 73% and completely resolved in 10%. The average segmental angle improved from 3.1 degrees preoperatively to 5.3 degrees (p &lt; 0.05) after 12 months. Up to the end of the follow-up 8.6% complications were recorded. These were 1 temporary dysphonia and 3 surgical revisions due to translations of the devices (4.3%) and 2 heterotopic ossifications (2.8%). This is the first study on the Discover. The results of clinical scores, intraoperative data and complications are encouraging and comparable to those from other commonly used types of cervical disc replacement. Regarding the duration of surgery, the correction of segmental angle and the amount of heterotopic ossifications, the Discover proved to be advantageous. However, for a definitive evaluation the follow-up period is still too short. ","1539":"Secondary osteoporosis with subsequent fractures are well-known symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. As a possible genetic component of osteoporosis, an association between bone mineral density (BMD) and polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene has been reported. In the present study, we investigated relationships between these polymorphisms, BMD, biochemical markers of bone metabolism and markers of disease activity in ankylosing spondylitis. AS patients showed osteoporosis more frequently than healthy controls. A mapping of activity indices and BMD showed an association of lumbar and peripheral BMD as well as of the current and median C-reactive protein over the last 3 years with the used FokI-genotypes of the VDR in male patients with AS. Female AS patients showed no significant association. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this association are unclear, especially with respect to the inflammatory activity. An early assessment of the risk for osteopenia\/osteoporosis in AS patients using molecular biological tests could make possible timely preventive measures or therapy.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying lesion at C7-T1, so we suspected a tumour. After a dorsolateral approach, an intradural disc herniation was found. Six months after the operation, the patient is free of complaints.","1550":"Translaminar approaches have been described for lumbar disc herniations which are displaced cranially or laterally into the neuroforamen. This technique provides the advantages of a minimally invasive approach with regard to postoperative instability or partial facet joint resection and avoids a medial arthrectomy. We describe this technique for the first time as an option for a caudally sequestrated disc herniation via a transaxillar sequesterotomy.","1551":"Lumbar discectomy is the most frequent spinal surgical procedure in Germany. Surgeons vary widely in their preferences with regard to patients' return to sports after spinal surgery. The self-reported sporting activity before and after microdiscectomy was evaluated in a prospective observational study with 5 year follow-up. One hundred and five patients (mean age 45.4 years) with self-reported sporting activity before lumbar single-level discectomy were re-evaluated after 5 years. The clinical outcome was graded using a modified Prolo scale (pain and medication). Based on the Prolo scale, an excellent (n = 80) or good (n = 17) outcome was achieved in 92.4% of patients. Altogether, 91.4% of patients (n = 96) resumed sporting activities: 87 patients returned to their previous sport. Only 8.6% of the patients (n = 9) were unable to return to sports, for various reasons (e.g., poor general health, lumbar pain, or lack of time). The mean time until return to sports after operation was 5.8 months (range 6 weeks to 24 months).The recurrence rate was 5.7% (n = 6), with 3 of the herniations occurring before the return to sporting activities (after 1, 2 and 7 months). The success rate of single-level microdiscectomy in athletes was frequently good or excellent, with over 90% of patients able to return to sports. The reherniation rate after postoperative athletic activity was comparable with results reported in the literature. ","1552":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate postoperative outcome and functional scores after single bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with the use of quadriceps tendon autografts after a 16 (12-24) month follow-up. 54 patients (9 women, 45 men, body mass index [BMI] 25.3 [18.1-36.3 kg\/m (2)]) were included in this prospective series, treated between January 2004 and December 2005. Ligament stability was assessed with the Lachmann and pivot-shift tests and a KT 1000 arthrometer. Tegner index, Lysholm-Gilquist score and the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) were employed to evaluate the functional outcomes. In addition, the single leg hop test was performed. Ligament arthrometry using the KT 1000 arthrometer demonstrated a mean side-to-side difference of 1.53 mm (0.2-4.1 mm). Regarding the Lachmann test, 17 patients (32%) showed 1+ laxity and no patient had an abnormal pivot-shift. The mean Tegner activity score was 4.22 (1-10), the mean Lysholm score was 80.8 (20-100) and the mean IKDC score 68.1 (29-87). Results of the single leg hop test revealed a mean decline of the treated leg to 87.7% (70-100%) of the contralateral side. The mean extension was reduced by 1.7 degrees (0-10 degrees) on the treated knee and the flexion by 2.1 degrees (0-10 degrees), compared to the contralateral knee. Single bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using quadriceps tendon demonstrates highly satisfactory results. Due to a moderate donor site morbidity and preservation of the medial stabilizing structures of the knee a wider use in primary cruciate ligament reconstruction may arise in the future. ","1553":"Femoral neck fractures after seizure are rare. This injury can easily be underdiagnosed due to generalised, musculoskeletal pain after seizure. In case of persisting groin pain and limited range of motion X-rays are indicated. Within the first 6 hours after the trauma a joint-preserving therapy is possible. After a delayed diagnosis total hip arthroplasty is necessary. As the result of prolonged intra-articular haematoma the incidence of a femoral head necrosis increases. When choosing the implant, an elevated risk of joint dislocation should be considered.","1554":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the application of a locked internal fixator in complex fractures of the proximal femur, in which the internal fixation with standard implants was not possible due to poor quality of bone or already failed internal fixation in the past. Ten patients suffering from a pertrochanteric (n = 5), periprosthetic (n = 1) or subtrochanteric (n = 4) femural fracture between 2003 and 2008 were prospectively registered, underwent open reduction and internal fixation with an \"upside-down\" femur LISS (less invasive stabilisation system) and were followed up. In all these patients a primary internal fixation had failed or the local bone situation and circulation were poor. The mean follow-up was 14 +\/- 25 months. X-ray images and a clinical examination were performed at each appointment. All fractures reached a primarily stable fixation with the locked internal plate fixator. Seven patients showed a complete bone healing after 3 months of follow-up and could bear full body weight afterwards. Three patients with preoperatively existing vascular disease or chronic osteomyelitis showed a deep wound infection postoperatively, which led to the explantation of the implant. The \"reversed\" locked internal fixator could be a successful alternative implant for stabilisation of proximal femur fractures which could not be fixated by standard implants due to poor bone quality and circulation. It can also be used as a salvage procedure after internal failed fixation in proximal femur fractures. ","1555":"The distal intraarticular fracture of the humerus, even in elderly patients, was treated so far with internal osteosynthesis. Due to the poor bone stock, in association with a complex fracture site, the achieved results may be disappointing. The use of an elbow joint prosthesis may be a solution for these specific problems in elderly patients as long as one takes the features of the prosthesis into account. Eleven patients with a mean age of 77 years were followed up for 12 months after implantation of an elbow joint replacement. In the other group we examined 15 patients (average age 73 years) after internal fixation for 20 months. Apart from radiological inspection, we applied the Mayo Elbow Score and documented all complications. There were only type B or C fracture sites in this study. The applied osteosynthesis ranged from the classical bilateral plating with osteotomy of the olecranon to minimal invasive screwing or K-wire pinning with additional postoperative immobilisation. The averaged range of motion amounted to 57 degrees in the osteosynthesis group, compared with 89 degrees in the prosthesis group. In 8 cases we used the semiconstrained Coonrad-Morrey system, and 3 times a hemiprosthetic replacement of the fractured condyles by the Latitude prosthesis. The Mayo score of the group after prosthetic replacement reached 91 compared to merely 77 points in the group after osteosynthesis. After osteosynthesis we saw several major complications, including in 4 cases a partial implant failure with consecutive loss of reposition, 1 case of heterotopic ossification and 1 incomplete sensitive N. ulnaris disorder. We recommend osteosynthetic management of type B fractures. The appropriate treatment of C-type fractures remains demanding and leads in cases of reduction malalignment with supportive immobilisation to poor results. Here the primarily implanted elbow prosthesis provides a safe solution for a painfree, stable and mobile joint. ","1556":"Treatment of distal radius fractures with the volar locking plate provides a stable fixation and early postoperative function. However, after intramedullary osteosynthesis systems for long bones had been established an intramedullary locking nail (Targon DR, Aesculap) for treatment of distal radius fractures was developed. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the outcomes after volar locking plate osteosynthesis (Aptus, Medartis) and intramedullary osteosynthesis (Targon DR nail) for the distal radius. Between 01\/07 and 11\/07 13 patients (average age: 60 [30-83] years) with distal radius fractures treated with the Targon DR nail were compared to 12 patients (average age: 57 [20-78] years) treated with a volar locking plate (Aptus, Medartis). Follow-up of the Targon DR group was 5.0 (1.9-8.9) months and 8.5 (2.1-11.6) months for the Aptus group. Parameters were: \"Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand\" (DASH), Gartland-Werley and Martini scores, range of motion (ROM) and radiological parameters. The Targon DR group achieved \"good\" results in the Gartland-Werley score with 6.9 (0-13) points and in the Martini score with 29.9 (20-38) points. A \"good\" result in the Gartland-Werley score (6.5 [3-11] points) and a \"satisfactory\" outcome with 27.9 (19-33) points in the Martini score were recorded in the Aptus group. The DASH score showed a higher subjective satisfaction after treatment with the Targon DR nail with 14 (0-39) compared to 23 (4-73) points after treatment with volar plating. ROM in both groups was not significantly different. The Targon DR group achieved an extension\/flexion of 99 degrees, an ulnar\/radial duction of 50 degrees and a supination\/pronation of 139 degrees. After treatment with the volar locking plate the patients showed an extension\/flexion of 103 degrees, an ulnar\/radial duction of 57 degrees and a supination\/pronation of 145 degrees. Postoperative radiographs revealed a better palmar inclination in the Aptus group (-2.5 degrees vs. 5.5 degrees) whereas reconstruction of the radial length was more successful in the Targon DR group (0.8 vs. -0.3 mm). The compared osteosynthesis systems achieved equally good functional outcomes after distal radius fractures. However, patients treated with the Targon DR nail showed a superior subjective satisfaction, probably because of the less invasive surgical approach. ","1557":"As an increasing number of patients suffer from osteoporosis-related disorders worldwide, the medical as well as the socioeconomic impact of this problem is significant. Although evidence-based guidelines for diagnosis and treatment are available, their application in daily practice is insufficient. The aim of our initiative was to develop a strategy for supporting this transfer. An expert group of the German Society of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (DGOU) has analysed the current scientific as well as health-care data bases regarding diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. Then a set of recommendations has been developed in order to improve this situation. The identified support strategy will focus on better identification of patients with osteoporosis and frailty, enhanced interdisciplinary approaches and increased activity to disseminate available guidelines. Additionally, more research activities are necessary in order to highlight the socioeconomic burden of the disease and to continuously improve surgical treatment strategies in the future. To ensure a successful application of the recommendations, continuous support of involved health professionals as well as political institutions, national health insurance systems, scientific societies and patient organisations is necessary.

The operation was done as a one-level (n = 13), two-level (n = 8)or three-level (n = 2) microsurgical fenestration followed by irrigation and drainage of the pus. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent triggering organism. After a follow-up of 7 months 1 patient had died because of septic complications. Neurological deficits improved in 14 patients but 3 patients were still disabled in their daily life. Epidural spinal empyema remains a challenge in spine surgery.

Based on instrumental gait analysis a system for three-dimensional motion analysis of the upper extremities has been developed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of instrumental upper extremity motion analysis with respect to dependence on sex and side dominance. 16 healthy subjects (8 male, 8 female, mean age 26 years) were included. Three-dimensional motion analysis was carried out with a video-based system and passive markers. All subjects performed two movement tasks representing activities of daily living (task A: reaching the neck, task B: removing a parking token). All joint angles of the upper extremity were recorded and graphically displayed. Additionally, a calculation of quantitative parameters was performed. Contrary to expectations the task \"reaching the neck\" was not combined with external shoulder rotation. Females performed most of the tasks quicker and with higher reproduction accuracy. Movement reproduction accuracy was rarely dependent on dominance. Three-dimensional upper extremity motion analysis of activities of daily living allows a precise and quantitative evaluation of movement patterns. The differences with respect to sex and side in a healthy group have to be respected in studies dealing with comparative shoulder function. ","1562":"Latissimus dorsi transfer (LdT) has been proposed for the treatment of irreparable rotator cuff tears of the infra- and supraspinatus. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the results of latissimus dorsi transfer in revision surgery in comparison to primary surgery. Between 1998 and 2005 a group of 124 patients has been treated with a latissimus dorsi transfer. From this group 34 patients (Group 1 = revision LdT n = 17, Group 2 = primary LdT n = 17)were examined in a retrospective matched-pair study after an average follow-up of 20 months (Group 1) and 28 months (Group 2) by clinical examination and X-ray. Functional results were assessed with use of the age- and gender-matched Constant Score (CS). The age- and gender-matched Constant Score increased significantly in both groups from preoperatively 51% in Group 1 and 57% in Group 2 up to a postoperative score of 73% in Group 1 and 84% in Group 2 (p = 0.001\/p = 0.007). By comparison of the 2 groups there is a significantly higher postoperative age- and gender-matched Constant Score for Group 2 (p = 0.03). Active ROM showed postoperatively no significant difference (Abd\/Flex p = 0.8). The Hornblower sign is significantly more frequently positive in Group 1(p &lt; 0.001). The comparison of arthroscopically and open previous surgery for the subgroups of revision latissimus dorsi transfer shows a trend for an increased postoperative age- and gender-matched Constant Score in the arthroscopic group (82%\/69% p = 0.06) with a preoperative CS of 50%\/52% (p = 0.9). There is no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications. Considering the correct indication for latissimus dorsi transfer there is no difference for reduction of pain and active ROM between primary and revision surgery. But the revision cases show a significantly lower age- and gender-matched Constant Score and a higher incidence of a positive Hornblower sign. A higher risk of postoperative complications for the revision group could not be found. In summary, the latissimus dorsi transfer was of significant benefit for both groups and we can also recommend this technique for revision surgery. ","1563":"Health economics and cost-efficiency are ubiquitously present issues in present day orthopaedic surgery. These subjects, however, are almost exclusively dealt with by economists and policy makers, while medical professionals rarely take part, quite often because of insufficient methodological knowledge. This report presents the basics of economic evaluation to orthopaedic surgeons to facilitate informed discussion. This text reviews the basic methodology of economic evaluation and pertinent findings for orthopaedic surgery. Economic evaluation combines costs and consequences of medical treatments. Partial analyses study costs only, while complete studies include different parameters of consequence. Cost-effectiveness analysis sets cost and effectiveness in natural metrics in relation, while cost-utility analyses present consequences as quality-adjusted life years. Cost-benefit analyses translate both costs and consequences into money value and thus produce a net benefit. Orthopaedic research focuses mainly on cost-utility analyses, yet their number and quality, despite both have been rising over the last years, are mostly insufficient to come to unequivocal conclusions or to produce clear recommendations. The trend for an increasing demand for economic evaluations in orthopaedic surgery will continue unabated. Both patients and medical professionals would benefit if orthopaedic surgeons received instruction in economic evaluations in order to be able to take part in such studies or to meaningfully discuss such matters. ","1564":"The typical asymmetry in infancy is recognized 2-4 weeks after birth and follows the development of a plagiocephaly. The unilateral flattening of the occiput leads to a permanent rotation of the head to one side, shortening of neck muscles and a triggering of the asymmetric tonic neck reflex (ATNR), also known as fencer response. Subsequently a muscle tone increase is forming on the side of the face while a decrease in tone is seen at the occiput side. Clinical signs like increasing neck stiffness, flexible positional scoliosis and pelvic obliquity may ultimately develop. Management includes early positioning, tummy time and physical therapy if asymmetry of posture or muscle tone are present.","1565":"The aim of our investigations was to study the question as to what extent the mono- and multisegmental mobility of the lumbar spine (LS) differs after implantation of a disc prosthesis (DP) and if, in case of postoperative complications (dislocation or migration of the disc prosthesis), a sufficient stability of the motion segment can be achieved with a spinal fusion. To answer these questions we examined in corpse the mobility of the LS before and after DP implantation as well as after spinal fusion by using a load simulator for mobility and stability investigations of the lumbar spine. After radiological exclusion of higher degenerative changes (X-ray in two planes) and exclusion of high-grade osteoporosis by using a pQ-CT scan with measurement of the bone mineral density (T score &gt; -3.0), the first step was the multisegmental measurement of the thirteen unfixated LS specimens without DP by automatic electromechanical load-bearing. The measurements of mobility of the LS were done in flexion, extension, side-bending and side-rotation with a reproducible load of 10 Nm. The analysis of the movements during flexion and extension as well as side-bending and side-rotation were done by an ultrasonic detection system (zebris). In the second step the excursions were measured after implantation of the DP in L3\/4 and in the third step after additional dorsal spinal fusion. After implantation of the artificial disc in L3\/4 the mobility in side-bending and side-rotation increases in comparison to the LS without surgery. For side-bending we found an increasing amount up to +74 % for the single motion segment L3\/4 and +3 % for the total LS, respectively, for the side-rotation an increase of mobility up to +72 % for the single motion segment L3\/4 and +30 % for the total LS. On the other hand a decreased mobility of -11 % for flexion and extension was found with an artificial disc in comparison to the lumbar spine. After additional dorsal spinal fusion of L3\/4 the mobility obviously decreases in all directions (flexion\/extension -74 %, side-bending -75 %, side-rotation -51 %). The DP preserves (flexion\/extension) and, respectively, improves (side-rotation\/side-bending) the mobility of the LS. In cases of complications like dislocation or migration of the DP and secondary degenerative changes, the dorsal spinal fusion with restricted movements of the LS afterwards is a possible treatment solution. ","1566":"Injuries of the atlas are always a challenge in diagnostics and therapy. Different clinical manifestations, inconspicuous neurological results, uncertain findings of radiological diagnostics and possible accompanying injuries require individual therapeutic concepts. Patients with injuries of C1 and C2 seen between 2001-2007 were evaluated and especially the morbidity and treatment of the C1-injured patients were verified. To systematise the injuries, a subdivision in isolated and combined trauma took place. Furthermore, the post-traumatic as well as post-therapeutic accompanying neurological deficits were evaluated. Altogether 121 fractures\/injuries of the upper cervical spine (C1\/C2) were counted, 22 (18.2 %) concerning the atlas. There were 11 fractures of type Gehweiler I, 9 of type III and 1 each of types II and IV. Isolated fractures of type I (5\/11) were treated conservatively, combined injuries (6\/11), depending on the stability and location of the attendant injuries, were treated with semi-rigid collars, anterior or posterior fusions. Stable fractures of type III (2\/9) were primarily treated in Halo extension. Because of an attending dens fracture type Anderson II in 1 case, a spondylodesis of the dens was additionally performed in the conservative treatment of the atlas. The therapy of isolated unstable atlas fractures of type III (4\/9) ranged, depending on the general conditions, from Halo extension, transoral C1 stabilisation, anterior transarticular C1\/C2 fusion to posterior occipitocervical fusions. The therapeutic regime of combined unstable type III injuries (2\/9) depended on the additional trauma: anterior fusion in C6\/7 luxation fracture combined with Halo extension for C1, posterior C0\/C3 fusion in unstable dens fractures of type Anderson II. The therapy for atlas fractures orientates on the type of the C1 fracture, the accompanying injuries and the general condition of the patient. Isolated stable C1 fractures without dislocation can be treated conservatively (cervical collar), unstable fractures, depending on the general condition, should be referred to surgical therapy or halo extension. In combined atlas fractures the strategy of treatment has to take the stability of the C1 fractures into consideration, but also the additional injuries of the rest of the cervical spine and the attendant circumstances. ","1567":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinical and functional outcome after arthroscopic transglenoid stabilisation of post-traumatic shoulder instabilities. Besides assessing the sports activity level, a special emphasis was put into evaluating the proprioceptive ability in a clinical-experimental setting as well as comparisons with a control group. We evaluated the functional results of 35 patients after arthroscopic stabilisation of post-traumatic, unidirectional anterior shoulder instabilities at a mean of 47.4 +\/- 12.8 months postoperatively. Criteria such as subjective level of contentedness, range of motion, stability and sports activity as well as the Constant and Rowe scores were recorded. Joint position sense was assessed in 30 degrees internal and external rotation with the passive angle reproduction test using an inclinometer. The difference between the discerned and the target joint position was used as a measure of proprioceptive ability. Results were compared to the contralateral shoulder as well as to a control group consisting of 31 volunteers without any history of shoulder pain or injury. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used for statistical analysis. The level of subjective satisfaction on a visual analogue scale was 9.3 +\/- 1.1 points. ROM testing showed a mean loss of 4.8 +\/- 5.1 degrees of external rotation compared to the contralateral shoulder. A mean Constant score of 88.9 +\/- 7.8 and a mean Rowe score of 86.7 +\/- 19.0 points were obtained. Four patients had a reluxation of the shoulder, in 3 cases due to an adequate traumatic event. 20 of 24 athletes (83 %) were able to return to their previous sports activity level without any restrictions. Passive angle reproduction testing showed no significant difference regarding the proprioceptive ability between operated shoulders in internal and external rotation (mean angle difference IRO = 2.6 +\/- 1.4 degrees , ARO = 3.3 +\/- 1.5 degrees ) compared to the contralateral shoulder (2.9 +\/- 1.5 degrees , 3.6 +\/- 1.8 degrees , p = 0.56\/0.36) as well as compared to the control group (3.0 +\/- 1.1 degrees , 3.4 +\/- 1.1 degrees , p = 0.67\/0.32). The results of this study indicate that arthroscopic transglenoid shoulder stabilisation is a sufficient technique for the treatment of post-traumatic shoulder instability.

Complications, functional outcome scores, and patient satisfaction were determined and the radiographs were evaluated for bony healing. The mean time interval until follow-up was 16 months (range: 7-27). All but 1 ankle showed a radiographically healed arthrodesis. 25 patients (89 %) were satisfied with the outcome.

After reconstruction of the ruptured achilles tendon, deep wound infections are difficult to handle due to impaired circulation of the bradytrophic tissue which leads to infection and a protracted healing process. Consecutive necrosis of the achilles tendon results in a poor clinical outcome. We could prove that vacuum therapy is the method of choice for wound healing complications in this delicate area. We treated 5 patients with deep wound infection and exposed achilles tendon after reconstruction. In all cases we achieved complete closure. The function of the achilles tendon was not impaired. Sonography confirmed the integrity of the tendon in all cases. Duration of therapy was 8.4 days for inpatient treatment and 64.4 days overall. 3 patients received a mesh-graft transplantation after wound ground preconditioning with vacuum therapy, all others achieved complete restoration with vacuum only. Vacuum therapy is a valuable option for the treatment of infected achilles tendon after surgical repair. After wound ground conditioning, it can protect mesh-graft transplants in this delicate area even in non-compliant patients. ","1571":"Amputation injuries in children occur in motor vehicle, farming and, importantly, lawn mower accidents. Treatment of lawn mower related injuries is complicated by gross wound contamination, avascular tissue, soft tissue defects and exposed bone. Many treatment options exist and often an adequate prosthetic supply is needed for rehabilitation. We report on an 8-year old boy who got under a ride-on lawn mower and sustained a subtotal amputation of his right foot. After initial surgery an amputation was subsequently necessary. For this, it had to be taken into account that the traumatic loss of the talus, calcaneus and parts of the cuboid bone would result in a length shortening of the right leg and so far not injured metatarsal and tarsal bones had to be sacrificed. Thus, we aimed to develop a new operation technique to optimize stump length as well as preserve tarsal bones and the possibility of limb growth. In order to achieve this, we performed a new stump forming operation in which we integrated uninjured tarsal and metatarsal bones. First a Lisfranc's amputation was performed and a metatarsal bone was kept aside. The talus, calcaneus as well as the cuboid bone were either completely or almost completely destroyed and were removed. The remaining cuneiform bones were transfixed by a notched metatarsal bone, thus achieving a tarsal arthrodesis, and the cartilages of the proximal joint surfaces were removed. The cartilage of the cranial and caudal navicular as well as the distal tibial joint surface was also removed and an arthrodesis between the distal tibia and the navicular bone was achieved by crossed Kirschner wires. Finally the cuneiform bones were placed inferior to the navicular bone. Further stump coverage was managed by skin and muscle flaps as well as split skin graft. Our patient was discharged on day 34. A fluent gait without crutches as well as sports activities were possible again as early as 6 1\/2 months after the injury. Using our stump forming technique we hope to prevent some complications of amputation injuries. Because of the intact epiphysis a bone overgrowth is hopefully prevented and growth potential is preserved and by inclusion of tarsal and metatarsal bones in the stump formation a length discrepancy is minimized. ","1572":"The Ponseti method has proven to be successful in the treatment of idiopathic congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot). In particular, if plaster cast treatment as recommended by Ponseti does not show the desired correction of the foot, tarsal coalitions as a rare cause for a secondary clubfoot deformity have to be ruled out. In these cases a surgical release of the coalition in addition to the tenotomy has to be performed to achieve a satisfactory correction.","1573":"","1574":"","1575":"","1576":"","1577":"","1578":"","1579":"","1580":"","1581":"","1582":"","1583":"","1584":"Fractures of the humerus shaft are a common injury, mainly in younger patients and often coming with other injuries.

Mid-term results of our patients after triple arthrodesis concerning clinical and functional as well as radiological outcome were assessed in this examination. In the retrospective study, 24 feet in 20 patients with triple arthrodesis after degenerative hindfoot malposition were examined. Sampling was done consecutively. The average age of the patients was 62.8 years (40-79), mean follow-up-period was 21.5 months. The patients were examined using the AOFAS score, assessment of subjective satisfaction and X-rays. In addition, the position of the foot was analysed using dynamic pedobarography and gait analysis. In the examined population, the mean AOFAS score was 74 (+\/- 12.41) out of 94 points, the improvement averaged 51 (+\/- 14.72) points. 75 % of the patients had no or only slight pain, 8 % reported limitations in everyday life. Mobility of the ankle was more than 30 degrees for 9 patients (38 %) and between 15 and 30 degrees for 13 patients (54 %). 23 patients out of 24 were satisfied with the result of the surgery. In most cases, dynamic pedobarography showed a rather physiological pattern of plantar pressure distribution with increased pressure remaining in the midfoot area. Valgus position of the hindfoot was 2.8 degrees (+\/- 2.9 degrees), gait analysis showed very good results in 11 cases and good results in 13 cases. Among the examined patients, two cases of wound healing disorders appeared, and one non-union of the talonavicular joint which had to be reoperated. In two cases, clinically relevant degenerative changes of the ankle were diagnosed. Triple arthrodesis using internal fixation followed by sufficient immobilisation is a good and reliable technique for the correction of fixed hindfoot deformities. A very high level of patient satisfaction and a good clinical outcome can be achieved. Plantar pressure distribution can be reconstructed to a satisfactory extent. Due to the relatively high rate of degenerative arthritis in adjacent joints, the decision upon performing a triple arthrodesis should be considered carefully. Clinical and radiological integrity of these joints are required. ","1590":"In accordance with international guidelines, the German Society for Cardiology and the Paul Ehrlich Society for Chemotherapy recently adapted their recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis of infectious endocarditis. The new version reflected the statistically lower risk for such infections as compared to former considerations and reduced the group of patients who would benefit from the prophylaxis. That paper as well as an increasing number of statements of orthopaedic\/traumatologic or dental societies stimulated our contribution on the prevention of prosthesis infections after dental care. With this article we intend to stimulate a position paper of the German Society for Orthopaedics and Traumatology. For our study we screened the international literature on the association between bacteremia and dental treatment, bacteremia and prosthesis infections as well as on the availability and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis for prosthesis infections. In addition, we included data on the responsible microorganisms and the importance of biofilms both in the oral cavity and on the infected prosthesis. Generally, the risk of prosthesis infections after bacteremia is lower than that of endocarditis. Also, the range of involved microorganisms only partially overlaps in both diseases. Of note, bacteremia regularly occurs due to normal dental hygiene measures or even after chewing. Because of this high background risk and because of the extended latency period between dental care and symptomatic prosthesis infections, the causality of professional dental measures for prosthesis infections has never conclusively been demonstrated, e.g., by employing molecular methods. However, the association remains plausible and the consequences for such patients are severe. We suggest an oral prophylaxis with an aminopenicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitor or clindamycin shortly before and 4 hours after dental care depending on the tissue invasiveness of the dental measures and the personal risk profile of the patient (prosthesis recently implanted, history of prosthesis infection, natural or iatrogenic conditions severely affecting the immune status). ","1591":"Concerning the biomechanical properties of the iliotibial tract different opinions can be found in the literature. Due to this fact it was the aim of this study to take measurements about the hip centralising forces of the iliotibial tract in a neutral position as well as in abduction, adduction and flexion of the hip joint at different femoral neck angles by using a custom-made hip prosthesis. By using a custom-made measuring endoprothesis with the capability for adjusting different femoral neck angles and lengths and, furthermore, by measuring the intra- and subligamentous forces at the height of the greater trochanter, we measured the forces for validating the influence of the iliotibial tract for hip joint centralisation. By increasing the CCD angle (coxa valga) a higher load on the hip joint results. By decreasing the CCD angle (coxa vara) a lowering of the coxalfemoral load results. Flexion of the knee joint leads to a decrease of the iliotibial tract tension. By extension of the knee joint and resulting tightening of the iliotibial tract, a triplication of the forces at the femoral neck was measured. Flexion of the hip joint exerted a ventralising of the iliotibial tract with an initial decrease of the centralising hip forces. Subligamentous measurement of the iliotibial tract showed increasing forces upon adduction as well as decreasing forces upon abduction of the hip joint. In the investigations about the forces with various femoral neck lengths, we saw a considerable increase by lengthening the femoral neck and resulting higher forces in the acetabulum. The clinical relevance of these results concerns the predictability of the in- or decreasing tension band wiring effect of the iliotibial tract in correlation to the CCD angle and the direction of motion of the hip joint. The measurements give the clinical users a benchmark for the expected subligamentous forces of the iliotibial tract and the resulting hip centralising forces. The influence of the lengthening of the femoral neck for the hip centralising forces clarifies the importance of the iliotibial tract when planning displacement osteotomies or hip joint replacement.

With each needle, 5 biopsies of an animal bone (lumbal vertebral body of calf, pig and lamb) were performed and compared to each other. The subjective assessment of force to obtain a sample, ease of needle use and ease of sample removal were graded on a 5-point scale. Each biopsy specimen was measured before and after fixation and the gross state was evaluated. For evaluation of histopathological quality, width and degree of fragmentation were also evaluated on a scale. The Somatex, Bone Marrow and Safe Cut 8 G and the Cardinal Health, Jamshidi 8 G needles were rated as being the easiest ones to use, while the Bloodline, Easy Trap 8 G and the RADI, Bonopty 15 G biopsy needles were rated as being the most difficult ones. Histological specimen quality was highest for the Somatex 8 G needles, the Cardinal Health, Jamshidi 8 G and the Bloodline, Easy Trap 8 G needles. The Inter.V, SnareLok 8 G and the RADI, Bonopty 15 G needles had the lowest yield. Furthermore, differences in length before and after fixation were recorded. The average decrease of core length after fixation was 18 %. The bone biopsy needles tested here vary significantly in performance and quality of the histopathological specimen.

Within the 309 departments, 26 % of the total number of 59,957 shoulder operations were rotator cuff repairs. Mini-open was the operation method in 49 %, open in 29 % and arthroscopic in 22 % of cases. Regarding the operational methods, there were differences between the departments and level of care. The arthroscopic technique was used sometimes in 48 % of the departments, whereas 52 % never used it. Specialised shoulder departments employed the total arthroscopic procedure more often. A set follow-up treatment occurred in 79 % of departments. Rotator cuff repair is mainly carried out using the mini-open method, which is nowadays regarded as gold standard. ","1595":"Post-traumatic supramalleolar deformities and malunions of ankle fusion require mostly a multiplanar correction. In cases of severe soft tissue damage, external fixation and gradual correction is a definite treatment alternative. Between 2003 and 2007 a correction of supramalleolar deformities was performed in 9 patients with the Taylor spatial frame external fixator. The mean age was 30 years (min. 12, max. 68). There were 6 patients with deformities after malunion of supramalleolar fractures and 3 patients with malunion after ankle fusion. The mean angular deformity was 30 degrees and 5 patients had a rotational malposition of 13.6 degrees (min. 5 degrees, max. 25 degrees). 5 patients needed also lengthening (min. 10 mm, max. 40 mm) of the post-traumatic deformed tibia. The mean time of the follow-up examination was 23 months (min. 12, max. 41). Anatomic correction could be achieved in all patients. The average correction time was 36 days (min. 10, max. 82) with an average time period of 163 days (min. 130, max. 218) until the fixator was removed. The healing index of the leg lengthening cases was 77 d\/cm. There were 2 pin-tract infections, 1 prolongated callus formation and 1 insufficient callus formation. In cases of post-traumatic supramalleolar deformities with poor soft tissue and bone quality the Taylor spatial frame is a useful tool. Angular, axial, translational and rotatory deformities are corrected simultaneously without complex and time-consuming fixator reconstructions.

Apart from various implants the intraoperative problem is the handling of these two injuries with appropriate reduction and retention. The existing and further developing soft tissue damage has to be taken into consideration. The aim of this study is to evaluate the surgical management of this type of fracture. Between 2000 and 2007 we treated 22 patients with tibia fractures and coexisting upper ankle fractures. All patients could be traced for follow-up examinations. We deduced the impact energy of the trauma and the soft tissue damage. The tibial and ankle fracture sites were categorised. The time elapsed until full weight bearing was measured. The ankle joint function was inspected. A high energy trauma existed in 10 and a low energy trauma in 12 patients. In the high energy group we found in 5 cases A3, in 2 cases B1 and 1 B2 and 1 B3 and 1 C2 fracture of the tibia. In 5 cases a bimalleolar ankle injury existed, once a medial ankle fracture und in 3 cases an isolated distal fibula fracture. One patient had an open ankle joint luxation. In some cases an additional fibula shaft fracture was seen. \"Fracture communication\" between the tibia fracture and the ankle injury was not seen at all. An intramedullary nail stabilisation was used in 9 cases, while in 1 patient due to the soft tissue damage an external fixator was applied. In the low-energy group there were 4 B1, 4 B2 and 4 C1 fractures of the tibia. We found 6 injuries of the posterior plafond and 6 cases with a central fracture line of the pilon. A fracture communication between ankle and tibial shaft was detected in all cases. In 7 patients we used a minimally invasive locking plate and in 5 cases a nailing technique for stabilisation of the tibia fracture. Overall, we saw 1 distraction fault, 1 valgus misfitting of the fracture, 1 pin infection and 2 soft tissue necrosis as postoperative complications. The time interval until osseous union was 3.5 months. Monoarticular fractures of the upper ankle joint had better results according to the Weber score. One can divide the distal articular tibial shaft fracture into two groups. In the high energy entity the ankle joint injury happens first, and afterwards the tibial shaft fracture occurs. Therefore, both fracture sites are usually not communicating, which means they are in fact two types of fracture. On the other hand, in the low energy group, both fractures are communicating. Here, the tibial shaft fracture is equal to the inner ankle fracture in a classic bimalleolar fracture. Therefore we have only one fracture site.

Within 20 months we prospectively included 50 patients. 25 had an isolated pelvic trauma, 25 patients had multiple injuries. 21 of them were polytrauma patients (average ISS: 31.4; min. 26 pts., max. 50 pts.), four patients had additional highly unstable spine fractures or fractures of the lower extremities. Low molecular-weight heparin (Enoxaparin 40 g\/d) was administered on average within 24 hours of injury in 44 cases, one patient received low-dose heparin (Liquemin 15,000 to 22,500 I. E.\/d), five patients received both. 31 patients were treated operatively and 19 conservatively. Colour-flow duplex ultrasonography was performed within 72 hours of injury and stabilisation of the pelvic and acetabular fracture, or weekly. By means of ultrasound, 97 to 100 % of the deep and superficial leg veins could be examinated safely, as well as 88 to 89 % of the external iliac veins and 64 to 66 % of the common iliac veins. Only in 36 to 40 % of the patients the internal iliac veins were visible by ultrasound. Proximal DVTs were detected postoperatively in two patients (4 %), one patient (2 %) died after a fatal P. E. before the scheduled duplex scan. Early medicamentous prophylaxis can prevent deep vein thrombosis after pelvic trauma. Delayed applications due to pelvic operations are risk factors.

Pathognomonic characteristics are absent and clinical, chemical and radiological parameters are not reliable. The consequences of a delayed surgical intervention are discussed based on a case report with 5 year follow-up. Both adequate early CT and MRI scans and identification of the pathogen are essential in order to plan the therapy.

The Dynesys (Zimmer, USA), which was inaugurated 7 years ago, consists of pedicle screws, flexible spacers and cords and is intended to control segmental motion and to realign the lumbar spine. Since this device is new, it was the goal of this study to analyse the perioperative morbidity of lumbar stabilisation with Dynesys retrospectively. 136 patients (74 men and 62 women) underwent posterior stabilisation of the lumbar spine with Dynesys between January 2002 and April 2006. We acquired retrospectively several patient-related variables, e.g. the number of instrumented and decompressed segments, the perioperative blood loss, the operation duration, prior surgeries and technical and general complications. The average age of the patients was 61.2 years (range: 33-84). 1.6 segments (range: 1-3) were instrumented and 1.2 segments (range: 0-3) were decompressed on average. The mean perioperative blood loss was 1100 ml (range: 50-3400) and the mean operation duration was 127.1 minutes (range: 30-270). Eighteen patients (13.2 %) had a urinary tract infection and 5 patients (3.7 %) had cardiovascular complications. Dura lesions were seen in 11 patients (8.1 %) with 1 patient having persistent bladder symptoms. Revision surgery was necessary in 3 patients (2.2 %) due to screw malposition with neurological deficits and radicular pain. Five patients (3.7 %) were revised due to postoperative seroma, 2 of them developing superficial infection.

In contrast, only sparse data exist regarding unicondylar arthroplasty due to its lesser use. In this study, we compare cemented with cementless unicondylar knee arthroplasty and aim to define both clinical and radiological differences in treatment outcome. In a retrospective study, 106 patients who had undergone a medial unicondylar replacement were examined after a mean postoperative period of 8 years. Of these, 42 patients (median age 81 +\/- 7 years) had received a cemented and 64 (median age 73 +\/- 7 years) a cementless knee arthroplasty by the same surgeon while 7 patients were deceased or could not be reached. Well-established clinical (VAS, HSS, KSS, UCLA, WOMAC) and quality of life (SF-36) scores were used to evaluate treatment outcome. X-rays were performed to evaluate periprosthetic loosening zones, according to Ewald's criteria. The cementless patient group presented significantly better clinical scores (HSS, KSS, UCLA, WOMAC), except in the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment. The quality of life was significantly better in the cementless group except in the subgroups for physical function, vitality and social role, in that it resembles the normal population. Moreover, radiographic analysis using antero-posterior X-rays revealed significantly more and larger periprosthetic loosening areas in tibial zone 2 in the cementless group. The inferior clinical results characterising the cemented group could be attributed to the higher mean age. Regarding the radiological loosening zones, we did not detect any differences in the techniques of fixation, although physical activity and accordingly mechanical stresses were higher in the cementless group. ","1622":"The aim of the present retrospective matched pair study was to compare the clinical results of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with 2 different operation strategies: tibia first vs. femur first for ligament balancing and rotational alignment of the femoral component. In this study 30 patients underwent TKA with the fixed bearing prosthesis Innex FIXUC between 2003 and 2005. In the same period of time the posterior stabilised prosthesis NexGen LPS was implanted in 123 patients. Out of these, 30 patients were matched to the 30 patients of the Innex group based on the parameters age, gender, height, weight and BMI. All implants were cemented. Clinical examination was rated using UCLA score, Knee Society score, Lequesne score for knees, a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain and the Feller patellar score. Three patients in the Innex group were lost to follow-up, and 27 matched pairs could finally be analysed. At a mean follow-up of 25 months (Innex) and 3 years (NexGen) statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) with advantages for the NexGen were found in the UCLA activity score (4.9 vs. 5.9, p = 0.013), in part A (knee score) of the Knee Society score (78.9 vs. 91.0, p = 0.002) as well as the total score (153.9 vs. 173.2, p = 0.012), VAS (2.1 vs. 0.6, p = 0.003) and in the Lequesne knee score (5.7 vs. 3.6, p = 0.024). No statistically significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) were found in the function score of the Knee Society score and the patellar score (Feller). In the described setting there were functional advantages for the NexGen prosthesis (femur first) at a comparable revision rate. However, satisfactory results with the Innex FIXUC are possible, too. ","1623":"For cemented hip prostheses, all requirements can be fulfilled by using forged Co\/Cr\/Mo stems. Co\/Cr\/Mo alloys, however, are contraindicated for allergy sufferers. For these patients, a cemented prosthesis made of titanium (alloy) would be indicated. Cemented stems from titanium (alloy), depending on the geometry of the prosthesis and its specific surface texture, however, may have loosening rates which are clinically not tolerable. In comparison to Co\/Cr\/Mo alloys, the greater roughness in conjunction with lesser abrasion resistance of titanium-based alloys leads to high loosening rates caused by abrasion. On the other hand, the greater surface roughness permits good mechanical retention of bone cement to the surface. Good mechanical retention enhances migration behaviour and reduces micromotions. However, there is no stable hydrolytic bond between bone cement and metallic surface; intermediate-term debonding between metal and bone cement is predictable. This debonding results in relative movements, consequently in wear particles which have their origin both from the rough metallic surface and from the PMMA cement. The roughness of the metallic surface operates as emery and with that, a rubbing wear from the PMMA. For the above reasons, a low or moderate roughness is essential for easily abradable implants such as shafts made of titanium (alloy) because low roughness provides a fail-safe running function in case of debonding. Thus, one must allow for inappropriate migration behaviour accompanied by greater micromotions due to insufficient mechanical retention in the case of low roughness. This can be accomplished by a silicate layer coating applied to the metal shaft surface via electrochemical \"ECD\" or physical vapour deposition \"PVD\". For analysis, specimens (screws for pull-out, cones for push-out tests) were sand-blasted, so that roughnesses between Ra = 0.8 microm (Rz = 4 microm) and Ra = 2.0 microm (Rz = 9 microm) were generated. The bond strengths observed in tensile tests for roughnesses of Ra = 1.7 mm were always well above 25 MPa for all periods of hydrolytic load. Therefore, the investigation shows that surfaces of moderate roughness (Ra = 1.7 microm), however coated, provide a steady retention. Cave-in and micromotions should widely be prevented. The abrasion, which is a consequence of and reason for debonding and loosening at the same time, should be avoidable if the bonding of cement on the metallic shaft is stabilised with the help of a suitable chemical bond system.

They have contributed essentially to the rapid detection of inferior products and, by encouraging a continuous process of quality improvement through feedback, have helped to avoid revision operations. However, national registers have a limited significance with regard to other countries and rarely used implants. In recent years, a great number of registers have been founded. The European Arthroplasty Register (EAR), an EFORT project, aims at supporting these projects, enhancing cooperation within a network, realising further benefit through registers, and fostering scientific activities. The registers have been conceived according to the successful Scandinavian model. It is, however, necessary to adapt the concept to the individual national circumstances. In order to increase the value of register publications for other countries, it makes sense to achieve a minimum of stardardisation in datasets, definitions, product designations, as well as in evaluation and publication methods. Since the datasets of national registers implicitly reflect the prevailing national circumstances, they are always more valuable for use in the respective country than evaluations from aggregated, supranational and therefore larger datasets. Supranational evaluations may yield additional findings, but they cannot replace a national register. Therefore, EAR has been conceived as a network of independent national registers considering itself as a supplement and by no means as a competitor of the established national registers.","1627":"","1628":"","1629":"","1630":"The aim of this study was to analyse and evaluate comparatively loosening mechanisms, failure frequency, surgical changing strategies and results after replacement of thrust plate prostheses (TPP) and ESKA Cut prostheses. Between 1993 und 2007, 465 TPP and in the years 2000 and 2001 82 ESKA Cut prostheses were performed and evaluated prospectively. Until 2007 46 change interventions of the TPP and 35 of the CUT prosthesis became necessary. All patients who received a stem revision procedure in our hospital were included within this study. Besides the evaluation of clinical results according to the criteria of the Harris Hip Score on the average at 15.6 months (+\/- 14.4) postoperatively, radiological loosening processes and surgical difficulties were registered. Furthermore, an analysis of perioperative data was performed according to some criteria of the German Federal Office of Quality Assurance (BQS), such as duration of the surgery, intraoperative blood loss and complications. Statistical investigations for comparative analysis as well as survival analysis of both groups were calculated using SPSS for Windows 13.0. The mean age of the 46 patients who had to undergo revision surgery after TPP was 60.1 years, that of 35 patients in whom revision surgery was necessary after receiving an ESKA Cut femoral neck stem was 56.6 years. The survival rate analysis according to Kaplan-Meier at 13 years was 89.4 % (TPP) and 53.6 % at 66 months (ESKA Cut). In all cases the partial osteointegration of the tripod surface of the loosened Cut prosthesis complicated the explantation. It led on the one hand to a significant difference of the surgery duration and on the other hand to an increased frequency of fractures of the trochanteric region. The conversion of the TPP on standard type stems was usually free of problems. The HHS increased significantly to the averages of 86.6 (TPP) or, respectively, 91.69 (ESKA Cut) after revision. In comparison with the usually problem-free changing procedure of the TPP to a standard type stem, the revision surgery of the Cut prosthesis becomes substantially more complex and leads frequently to complications. In view of unacceptable survival rates, the Cut prosthesis does not represent an alternative implant in young patients. Except for the implantation technique, which does not allow a less invasive surgical procedure, the TPP fulfils the requirements of femoral neck prosthesis due to acceptable survival rates and good convertibility. ","1631":"The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the postoperative walking ability after total hip replacement (THR) in terms of different surgical approaches by means of an evaluation of gait velocity. 21 patients underwent a total hip replacement using an anterolateral minimally invasive modified Watson-Jones approach (MIS group). 20 other patients received a THR using a transgluteal approach (standard group). Differences in functional indices of ground reaction forces and symmetry indices were measured one day pre-operatively, and at 6 and 13 weeks postoperatively on the walkway. The intervention of gait velocity was done by means of a digital metronome. The given step frequences were 70, 90 and 110 steps\/minute. The results were compared to an age-matched control group (n = 20). There are significantly reduced pain symptoms in both surgical groups at 6 weeks post-operatively. The MIS group has a higher functional ability, improved symmetry indices of stance time, loading rate and single limb stance compared to the control group at 6 weeks postoperatively. At 13 weeks postoperatively there are no differences between the two surgical groups, except for the parameter \"loading rate\". The patients in the MIS group had an increasing improvement already at 6 weeks after THR. From 6 to 13 weeks after surgery there were important changes in the control group. Obviously, the early postoperative advantages of the minimal invasive approach provide for an improved re-establishment of symmetry and load. In this clinical course study, the proof is validated because the trends in the biomechanical gait parameters are comparable by means of gait velocity standardisation. ","1632":"The aim of this study was to find the correct angle of the needle position for the epidural perineural injection at the lumbar spine without any help by imaging. In 11 human cadaver lumbar spines besides dura, nerve roots and bones all soft tissue had been removed to allow us to look into the anterior lateral epidural spaces between L3 and S1 in different angles with an operation microscope. The area between the dura (medial), facet joint (lateral) and the laminae (cranial and caudal) were photographed and planimetrically measured. This area is called the width of the injection canal. Degenerative lumbar spines show a width of the injection canal of 29.61 mm(2) in L5\/S1 with an angle of the needle position of 15 degrees to the midline. The optimal angle position of the needle brought a width of the injection canal in L4\/5 only for 7.3 mm(2) and in L3\/4 for 3.5 mm(2). In non-degenerative spines the injections canals were much wider. The epidural-perineural injection into the anterolateral epidural space only makes sense in the segment L5\/S1. Here the L5 nerve root is reached as well as the S1 root - the main causes of sciatica. In upper segments the injection canal is far smaller even at optimal injection angles. In case of nerve root compression at L4 and upwards other epidural injection techniques should be used such as the epidural dorsal loss of resistance technique or the transforaminal technique. With some training it is possible to perform epidural-perineural injection for sciatica without the help of imaging. ","1633":"The diagnosis of spondylodiscitis is often prolonged, but it is an important differential diagnosis of backache. The discrimination between a bacterial infection and an aseptic inflammation with laboratory examinations like ESG, CRP or leukocytes is not possible. The aim of the present study was to determine the value of procalcitonin (PCT) as a diagnostic tool and monitoring parameter for spondylodiscitis and for the discrimination between bacterial infection and aseptic inflammation of the spine. A total of 17 patients with spondylodiscitis and 18 patients with disc herniation as control were included in this study and ESG, CRP, leukocytes, fibrinogen, PNM elastase und PCT were examined for 50 days. The median age was 65 (17-78) years and the ratio of males to females was 8 : 9 in patients with spondylodiscitis and 62 (32-87) years and 7 : 11 in patients with disc herniation. For microbiological examination, CT-guided punctures were performed in patients with spondylodiscitis. In 64 % of the 17 patients with spondylodiscitis a microbiological agent was detected, in 73 % of these cases staphylococcus aureus was isolated. The laboratory parameters indicating an infection were increased except for two cases in patients with spondylodiscitis, the mean value of CRP was 115 mg\/dL. Influenced by the therapy these parameters decreased during the observation period. Except for one patient with an infection of a cardiac pacemaker, the PCT concentration was not elevated in both groups (&lt; 0.5 ng\/mL). In the group with disc herniation there were no elevated laboratory parameters during the entire observation period. PCT is not useful as diagnostic tool or monitoring parameter for spondylodiscitis. Furthermore, it is not useful for the discrimination between a bacterial infection and an aseptic inflammation of the spine. ","1634":"The aim of this study was to develop a suitable animal model for the clinical situation of progressive disc degeneration after microsurgical nucleotomy. Twenty sheep underwent standardised partial anterolateral nucleotomy at lumbar segment 3\/4. After randomisation, 10 animals were sacrificed after 12 weeks (group 1). The remainder was sacrificed after 48 weeks (group 2). For radiological examination X-rays, MRI and post-mortem CT scans were performed. Lumbar discs L 3\/4 with adjacent subchondral trabecular bone were harvested and analysed macroscopically and histologically. An image-analysing computer program was used to measure histomorphometric indices of bone structure. 17 segments could be evaluated. After 12 weeks (group 1) histological and radiological degenerative disc changes were noted. After 48 weeks (group 2), radiological signs in MRI reached statistical significance. Furthermore, group 2 showed significantly more osteophyte formations in CT scans. Histomorphometric changes of the disc and the adjacent vertebral bone structure suggest a significant progressive degenerative remodelling. The facet joints did not show any osteoarthrosis after 48 weeks. Partial nucleotomy of the ovine lumbar disc leads to radiological and histological signs of disc degeneration similar to those seen in humans after microsurgical nucleotomy. The presented in vivo model may be useful to evaluate new orthopaedic treatment strategies. ","1635":"We report on the case of an 81-year-old woman who was hospitalised because of severe pain at the sacro-iliacal joint radiating into the left leg without any accompanying neurological defect. X-rays demonstrated a step in the left massa lateralis of the sacrum, thus CT scans and MRI were performed, and multiple perineural cysts (Tarlov's cysts) were found. The patient underwent microsurgical treatment by fenestration of the cyst wall and evacuation of the fluid content in order to avoid further expansion of the cysts. Under consequent treatment with pain killers, complete mobilisation of the patient could be achieved. Ambulant follow-up by clinical controls and X-rays demonstrated a substantial resolution of the patient's preoperative symptoms. Symptomatic perineural cysts should be included into differential diagnosis of severe low back pain, thus CT or MRI scans should be performed in case of long-lasting or intrackable pain.","1636":"Extravasation of bone cement into the vertebral venous system during cement injection has been reported to be a major complication of percutaneous vertebroplasty. Therefore, high injection pressures during cement application into the fractured vertebral body are considered as one possible cause of cement leakage or extravasation. The aim of the current study was to measure the increase in intravertebral pressure caused by cement injection during vertebroplasty compared to the baseline venous pressure for the ascending lumbar vene. In context of a cadaver study of 19 unfixed lumbar cadaver spines (L2-L5) [9 female, 10 male, 72 +\/- 4.1 years] 19 vertebroplasties have been performed under operative conditions through a transpedicular approach. A manometer was placed in the lateral corticalis of each vertebral body for dynamic pressure measurement during 4 cement application cycles. Average and maximal intravertebral pressures as well as the average intravertebral pressure over the time of cement application [\"area under the curve\" (AUC)] were calculated. Average intravertebral pressure (10.9 +\/- 12.6 kPa [min.: - 15.2 +\/- 24.7 kPa; max.: 56.1 +\/- 70.1 kPa]) showed a 13.6-fold increase compared to the baseline venous pressure for the ascending lumbar vein and a 70-fold increase compared to maximal pressure. During the 4 cement application cycles a continuous increase of the average intravertebral pressure over the application cycle (AUC) occurred. The 13.6-fold increase in intravertebral body pressure caused by cement injection during percutaneous vertebroplasty in comparison to the baseline venous pressure for the ascending lumbar vein might be one possible cause of the high rate of extravasation of bone cement reported in the current literature. ","1637":"Screw misplacement affects the stability of the internal fixateur and may cause neurovascular complications. However, only a computer tomographic scan can show the exact position of the screws. This study was undertaken to assess the reliability of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging (3-D) to view screw positions. The prospective study involved 34 patients with thoracolumbar spine fractures between June 2006 until July 2007 who underwent an intraoperative 3-D-imaging scan after pedicle screw placement. The positions of 136 screws were classified according to the axial view of the 3-D scan into 6 categories. Pedicle and corpus perforation of the screws were measured in 2-mm steps. The quality of the 3-D scan was classified into 3 groups. We compared the results with the screw positions in postoperative CT scans. The computer tomography showed 122 screws in correct positions. 14 screws were misplaced. The average time of the 3-D procedure was 9.6 minutes. In axial C-arm reconstructions, 121 correct positions and 11 malpositions were classified correctly. With regard to the used classification a sensitivity of 3-D-imaging for all screws was 90.0 % and specificity was 97.6 %. The screw position was classified correctly by intraoperative scan in 97.1 % (132\/136). 3 of 4 malclassified screws were in the thoracic spine segment (T 1-T 10). Absolute conformity between computer tomography and 3-D imaging classification was reached when the scan quality was good. The quality of 3-D imaging correlated significantly with pedicle diameter (p = 0.004), BMI of the patients (p = 0.001) and the spine level (p = 0.001). Wide pedicles, spine level T 11-L 5 and a low BMI lead to a good quality of scans. Intraoperative imaging by 3-D fluoroscopy can predict very exactly the position of pedicle screws, especially, when a good scan quality is available and the spine section viewed is T 11-L 5. The scan offers the advantage of immediate correction of screw malposition. Thus, computer tomography to control pedicle screw position is dispensable. ","1638":"The aim of this study was to estimate the influence of concomitant diseases and the cooperation of patients on the duration of rehabilitation after femoral neck fractures. This study reviewed 493 patients with dislocated femoral neck fracture treated with hip endoprostheses. The duration of hospitalisation and rehabilitation periods were significantly shorter (p = 0.0001) for patients with high cooperation and motivation. Pulmonary diseases led to a significantly prolonged rehabilitation process (p &lt; or = 0.05). Other comorbidities like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases or concomitant neurological diseases did not have a significant influence on the duration of the rehabilitation process (p &gt; or = 0.05). Our results suggest that less cooperative patients and patients with pulmonary diseases have to be supported psychologically to improve the cooperation and to avoid long-lasting rehabilitation. Perioperatively, we recommend an optimizing treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases by a specialist. ","1639":"Correction of severe tibial deformity due to a non-union of the tibia is best achieved by a slow gradual correction which allows the compromised tissue to adapt. The Taylor spatial frame (TSF) is a hexapod-based ring fixator that allows a simultaneous gradual correction of a multiplanar deformity through a virtual hinge. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the application of the TSF and the clinical outcomes of ten patients with a non-union of the tibia. Ten patients with either a hypertrophic or atrophic non-union of the tibia were treated between 2003 and 2006 with the TSF. The mean age of these patients was 43 years (range: 12-73). There were 5 hypertrophic and 5 atrophic non-unions. Five of the ten fractures were initially open. The mean preoperative magnitude of the angulation deformity was 21.9 degrees (range: 5-44). In nine patients, the correction was performed in a closed manner; one patient had hardware removed prior to the frame application. In all ten patients, the deformities were corrected. The average duration of time that the frame was worn was 158.5 days (range: 89-300). The mean time for gradual correction was 23.1 days (range: 5-43) with an average correction speed of 1.3 mm\/day (range: 0.5-2). No additional bone stimulation was performed. In terms of complications, one patient had a residual valgus deformity of 5 degrees , one a pin tract infection, and one a stress fracture next to a pin hole. In patients with either a hypertrophic or oligotrophic non-union of the tibia and severe deformity, the TSF is a powerful tool to correct the deformity in a closed manner which preserves the remaining viability of the non-union.

The data of a physiological glenoid version vary widely among different authors and techniques. One reason may be that the previously used 2-D techniques suffer from a limited reproducibility and validity. The objective of this study was therefore to compare the 2-D and 3-D analyses of the glenoid version in patients with shoulder instability. The shoulders of 28 healthy volunteers and of 14 patients each with atraumatic\/traumatic instability were examined in an open MR scanner (0.2 T). The 2-D glenoid version was determined using post-processing techniques according to the technique of Friedman et al. (1992). Afterwards, the 3-D glenoid version was analysed independently of the slice orientation and patient position. The coefficient of correlation (r) between the 2-D and 3-D glenoid versions was calculated using the correlation z test. The 3-D post-processing technique showed a reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of 8.3 %. Patients with traumatic instability demonstrated no significant difference compared to the healthy control group (4.4 +\/- 2.1 degrees vs. healthy: 3.9 +\/- 1.3 degrees ). In atraumatic shoulder instability the glenoid retroversion was in the mean significantly increased (10.2 +\/- 4.9 degrees ). The individual values ranged between 2.6 degrees and 16.6 degrees . Also for the contralateral, unaffected side a significantly increased retroversion (6.3 +\/- 2.2 degrees ) was observed compared to healthy shoulders. There was a significant correlation (r: 0.84) between 2-D and 3-D retroversion. The presented techniques allow for a reproducible assessment of glenoid version independent of the slice orientation and patient position. Our results demonstrate in the mean only a small difference of +\/- 3 degrees between 2-D and 3-D glenoid versions. Therefore under standardised conditions the 2-D CT\/MRI should be adequate for measuring the glenoid version except for borderline cases. No significant changes in glenoid version were found in patients with traumatic instability. In atraumatic, posterior instability, in the mean an increased retroversion was observed on both sides. However, the magnitude of these changes varied widely among individuals and should be identified to initiate a causal treatment.

For this purpose, we have developed a simple patient questionnaire (Pationnaire). This includes the most important symptoms and signs of the entire musculoskeletal system including the vertebrae. The questionnaire was tested for construct validity and reliability. The experiences were gathered in separate centres within an outcome study after total hip arthroplasty and routine consultations. Construct validity was tested in 71 patients by comparing the questionnaire answers with details given by personal interview. Concordance was total in 95 %, partial in 3 %, and inadequate in 2 % (older patients with poly-morbidity). Concordance was improved by discussion, completion and correction of questionnaire answers together with the patient. Participants required an average of 9.9 minutes to complete the questionnaire. The test-retest reliability of the Pationnaire yielded, compared to the SF-36, more questions with a higher intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); the mean ICC for all Pationnaire questions was 0.76 versus 0.57 for the SF-36. The percentage of identical answers was between 69.7 % and 99.4 % with the Pationnaire and between 52.2 % and 96.8 % with SF-36. User experience showed that the questionnaire can be used for initial and differential diagnosis, for improved communication with the patient, and to measure outcome. The questionnaire proved valuable in the differential diagnosis of symptoms after endoprosthesis. Information on type and location are particularly valuable in differentiating mechanical, inflammatory or other causes. The questionnaire can be used for outcome measurements in endoprosthesis. In 66 patients, 6 months after total hip prosthesis, pain scores were reduced from 47.8 to 29.5, symptom scores from 30.8 to 11.6, and disability scores from 22.5 to 10.5 (all changes statistically significant, p &lt; 0.05). The questionnaire reliably measures symptoms and disabilities in orthopaedic disease. Interactive collection of patient history renders it more objective. The questionnaire can be used in outpatient consultations, for initial and differential diagnosis, to improve communication, and to measure outcome. ","1651":"The aim of this study was to investigate hyaline cartilage defects treated with cell-seeded artificial matrix systems (two different collagen type I gels) with the method of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and to correlate the results with conventional histological and immunocytochemical staining. Osteochondral blocks were harvested from 20 patients undergoing total knee replacement and trimmed to 2 x 2 cm. Under sterile conditions, chondral defects of 8 mm diameter were either filled with a collagen type I gel plug seeded with autologous chondrocytes (2 x 10 (5)\/mL gel), or with a corresponding gel plug which was stabilised by a 20-fold compression. Of each group, 5 specimens were cultivated for 6 weeks under standardised in vitro conditions (37 degrees C, 5 % CO (2), humidified atmosphere), while the remaining 5 specimens were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice (BALBc -\/-). Immediately after recovery, the repair tissue and bonding zones were investigated by OCT. Subsequently, specimens were decalcified and investigated by H&amp;E staining and collagen type II immunostaining. The results of OCT and conventional staining were correlated. By OCT, repair tissue could be investigated up to 1.6 mm in depth, physically limited by the utilised OCT system. In the denser hyaline cartilage regions, OCT resolution was reduced. Regardless of cultivation (in vitro or nude mouse), ultrastructural features of the repair tissue could be demonstrated. In particular, ultrastructural differences between the two investigated collagen gels could be detected. Moreover, the bonding region between repair tissue and hyaline cartilage could be evaluated by OCT investigation. The results of the OCT measurements were confirmed by H&amp;E and collagen type II immunostaining. By OCT, repair tissue generated by the treatment of cartilage defects with tissue-engineered matrix systems could be evaluated in vitro. Future studies may show if repair tissue quality may be monitored in situ by OCT. ","1652":"Several studies have shown that the rotation of the femoral component is an essential factor in total knee replacement. Consequently, different intra-operative landmarks for femoral implantation were established but most of them are either hard to define or have a high variance, so reducing their utility value. The aim of this randomised, prospective study was to prove that a preoperative CT scan is a usable help for femoral orientation. In 2006, 57 consecutive patients designated for implantation of a knee arthroplasty were split up in two groups (a and b) corresponding to a randomisation scheme. The implantation of the femoral component in group a) was done with a posterior condylar angle of three degrees of external rotation as invariable determined by the resection guide. In addition the surgeon could correct the rotation following any other landmarks (surgeon's own method). In group b) the posterior condylar angle was measured preoperatively with the help of a CT scan and transferred on a resection guide allowing variation of the posterior condylar angle in single degree steps. In this case variation of femoral rotation (surgeon's own method) was not possible. The rotation of all knee replacements (groups a and b) was measured postoperatively with a CT scan following the technique of Berger et al. The implantation with the femoral component lying parallel to the transepicondylar axis was regarded as correct. Differences were measured in degrees. Regarding the degree of femoral malrotation without consideration of the direction (external\/internal rotation) the difference between group a) and group b) was highly statistically significant (p &lt; 0.000001). The highest range of malrotation in group b) was two degrees versus six degrees in group a). In group b) 19 of 30 (= 63.3 %) femoral components showed no malrotation at all, in group a) only 5 of 27 (= 18.5 %) components were implanted completely correctly. Preoperative measurement of the posterior condylar angle was proven to be a simple, reproducible examination method which increases the rotational accuracy of total knee replacement. ","1653":"Isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty is discussed controversially. The aim of this nation-wide survey in Germany and review of the literature was to determine the current status of patellofemoral arthroplasty. A standardised questionnaire was sent to 744 German departments of orthopaedic surgery, traumatology and general surgery. In the first part, surgeons were asked general questions about their department size, case numbers of knee arthroplasties per year and non-endoprosthetic treatment of isolated patellofemoral disorders. If patellofemoral arthroplasty was conducted, parameters concerning age, gender, duration of complaints, indication for surgery, surgical approach, type of endoprosthesis used, additional surgical treatments and failures were evaluated in the second part. Furthermore we asked for the reasons if no isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty was performed. A systematic review of the literature was done including studies published until October 2007. The main inclusion criterion was the presentation of results after the implantation of a patellofemoral prosthesis for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis. A total of 225 analysable questionnaires were returned. Of 53,420 knee arthroplasties performed per year, only 195 (0.37 %) were isolated patellofemoral arthroplasties. The majority of patients (91 %) were between 40 and 80 years old. The aetiology of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis was believed to be idiopathic in 41 % and traumatic in 8 %. Patellofemoral dysplasia was held to be responsible in 47 % and patellofemoral instability in 4 % of the cases. The main reason for failure and surgical revision was ongoing tibiofemoral osteoarthritis of the affected knee. Negative attitude and disbelief towards the success of isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty were stated by the majority (62 %) of non-users. A lack of appropriate indications was reported by 22 % and lacking know-how by 16 %. We analysed 12 studies (459 implantations; 390 patients) in the literature review. The treatment was considered successful in 67.8 % of cases. The overall revision rate was 30.3 %. The highest failure rates were in patients with progression of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis or malalignment. Isolated patellofemoral arthroplasty has only low significance among surgeons performing knee arthroplasty in Germany. The majority of surgeons do not believe in the success of the procedure. Almost one third of published cases in the literature needed to be revised.

Weighted mean differences for postoperative pain showed 1.4 (95 % CI 1.8 to 1.0, p = 0.014) point better results for MIS. For function, standardised mean differences were calculated and showed better results for MIS, too (0.6 points, 95 % CI 0.03 to 1.12, p = 0.038). There were no significant differences in complication rates (OR 1.3, 95 % CI 0.6 to 2.9, p = 0.477) and implant position. Meta-regression showed no influence of navigation on any of the endpoints.

Between 2001-2003, 25 patients with an unreconstructible comminuted fracture of the radial head and elbow instability were treated with a bipolar radial head prosthesis. Using the Mason\/Johnston classification there were 15 type III and 10 type IV radial head fractures. In 17 cases the operation took place within a week. In 8 cases the prosthesis was implanted after 129 +\/- 113 days. The mean follow-up time was 21 +\/- 6 months. The range of elbow movement showed a loss of mean extention of 13 +\/- 8 degrees and a mean flexion of 126 +\/- 12 degrees .

The mean DASH score was 21.3 (0-74). Compared to a reference group, similar in age and gender, the patients showed no notable differences in quality of life. In one case the prosthesis dislocated and another patient experienced an aseptic loosening of the stem. Seven patients were diagnosed with heterotopic ossification, stage I and II on the Ilahi scale. 96 % of patients were able to return to their preoperative working life.

","1656":"The aim of the study was to evaluate the application of a navigation system (Brainlab) to control length and torsion intraoperatively while nailing a femoral shaft fracture. At first the system was tested with 10 fractured synthetic bones. The postoperatively reached length and torsion were measured and the difference to the envisioned values statistically evaluated. Clinically we used the navigation system for patients with complex femoral shaft fractures. We always performed a preoperative computed tomography of the opposite leg to analyse the axis and fixed the fractured leg on these parameters using the navigation system. We noticed as improvement opportunities, the duration of the operative steps and the radiation exposure. The operative result was radiologically controlled and the torsion and length differences to the intraoperative measurement evaluated. Furthermore, we analysed the duration of the operation steps including the additional radiation exposure. There were no technical problems during operations on the synthetic bones. The accuracy was with +\/- 5 degrees or +\/- 2 mm good enough to use the already approved system clinically. The navigation system was used for 17 operations. All navigation-assisted operations were completed successfully. It took an average time of 32 min to install the navigation system and required an additional X-ray time of 44 sec. The average postoperative rotational deviation was 5.5 degrees . The average difference in length was 2 mm. The application of a navigation system for repositioning of femoral shaft axes and controlling the length and torsion while nailing complex femoral shaft fractures is associated with some additional work. Nevertheless, in our study a relevant rotational deviation can be avoided by using the navigation system. To prove the advantage of the navigation system over the conventional technique, clinical studies with larger number of cases are necessary.

Data of accident and hospital records of novice drivers (licence &lt; 2 years) were analysed focusing on the following parameters: injury type, localisation and mechanism, abbreviated injury scale (AIS), maximum AIS (MAIS), delta-v, collision speed and other technical parameters and compared with those of experienced drivers. In 18 352 accidents in the area of Hannover (years 1985-2004), 2602 novice drivers and 18 214 experienced drivers were recorded as having an accident. Novice car drivers were more often and more severely injured whereas on motorcycles the experienced drivers were at higher risk. Novice drivers of both groups sustained more often extremity injuries. 4.5 % of the novice car drivers were not restrained by seatbelts as compared to 3.7 % of the experienced drivers and 6.1 % of the novice motorcycle drivers did not wear a proper helmet (versus 6.5 %). Severe injuries were sustained in 20 % at collision speeds below 30 km\/h and in 80 % at collision speeds above 50 km\/h. Novice car drivers drove significantly older cars. The risk profile of novice drivers is similar to that of drivers older than 65. Structural protection and special lectures like skidding courses could be proper measurements next to harder punishment of violations. ","1658":"The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluvoxamine (Flevarin) in patients with a chronic pain syndrome due to hip and knee arthritis. We prospectively investigated 60 patients in a single-centre double-blind study. The group was divided into two groups (M1 fluvoxamine; M2 placebo) each containing 30 patients, age ranging from 30 to 80 years. During treatment results were evaluated using several scales once at the beginning (V1) followed by weekly evaluations (V1-V8) and one final investigation at the end of treatment (V9). The investigated medication consisted of 50-150 mg fluvoxamine. In addition other drugs such as NSAID were administered (diclofenac, piroxicam, ibuprofen). Both groups (M1 and M2) showed a reduction of pain during treatment using the visual analogue scale (VAS). However, no statistical difference was found between both groups concerning pain reduction at any time. A significant pain relief was monitored in the patients of the M1 group towards the end of treatment. Concerning the daily impairment because of pain measured by the Griss scale an improvement was seen in 70 % of the patients receiving fluvoxamine versus 44 % in patients receiving placebo. Additionally, an improvement in the M1 group was seen in the WOMAC scale and in factors such as pain, stiffness and mobility compared to the M2 group. Using the CGI scale, 56.6 % of the M1 group compared to 37.9 % of the M2 group were stating that their overall status had improved \"much\" or \"very much\" at the end of the treatment (V9). A depression had been excluded in all patients. No statistical differences were seen in the Bf scale (von Zerssen) during all evaluations (V1 to V9). During the whole study 127 side effects were registered in 49 patients. None of the 5 severe events were related to the investigated drug. Considering the good effects in combination with very few side effects, a positive cost-effectiveness relation for the usage of fluvoxamine can be stated in patients with chronic pain syndrome due to hip and knee arthritis.

Relevant data like pain region, pain intensity, duration of treatment and geographic distribution are presented in detail. 503 persons selected by the \"quota procedure\" as representative for the Austrian population were interviewed face to face. 36.2 % of the interviewed persons reported pain in the musculoskeletal system within the last 3 weeks. The regions of the spine were mentioned most frequently (53.9 %).The groups of persons with and without pain differed significantly in age and geographic distribution. The results are well comparable to data from a similar study from 2006. A high prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in the Austrian population is ascertained. The spine regions are most frequently affected and associated with older age and high intensity of pain. Therefore further specific treatment for patients suffering from musculoskeletal pain and appropriate preventive measurements should be targeted in the future. ","1661":"Trauma or infectious diseases can cause destruction of the epiphyseal region of the knee with premature partial bridging of the physis and deviation of length and axis. There is only little information about tumorous lesions as pathogenetic factor for these deviations. We have been searching for an approach to take advantage of the particular growth potential in order to avoid further complex procedures. We report the case of a 6-year-old girl with progredient varus deformity of the left knee and reduction of walking distance. The X-ray and MRI investigations have shown a benign lesion like osteofibroma of the mediodistal femur with an affection of the medial physis. Because of the early and rapidly progredient deformity we planned an operative intervention, including the following two steps: 1) resection of the benign lesion and arthroscopically assisted resection of the bony bar with fat-patch interposition; 2) lateral hemiepiphyseodesis with an eight-plate. The histological examination revealed a cortical enchondroma, which had caused the above-mentioned growth disturbance. During follow-up (clinical and radiological examinations every 3 months) we saw a nearly normal growth of the mediodistal femoral physis with consecutive correction of the axial deviation. With surgical intervention (resection and temporary lateral hemiepiphyseodesis) we achieved a complete deformity correction in reference to the opposite side within one year post operation. Removal of the eight-plate has already been accomplished. Follow-up will be continued until completion of growth. In cases of rare partial bridging of the physis induced by a benign bone tumour one can achieve early correction of axial deviation during growth with resection, interposition of a fat patch and temporary hemiepiphyseodesis. With the help of such a procedure it is possible to prevent further progression of a pre-existing deformity and later aggressive surgical intervention. ","1662":"Various pericapsular procedures are available to surgically improve the acetabular coverage of the femoral head prior to closure of the triradiate cartilage. In this study the acetabuloplasty with the modification according to Westin (Pember-Sal) was applied. Indications for surgery were congenital hip dysplasia or luxation as well as Perthes' disease. To date, the standard procedures for acetabuloplasty include the transplantation of an autologous iliac crest bone graft and the fixation with K-wires. The aim of this study was to investigate if a modification of the operative procedure with the use of resorbable screws and allogenic bone transplants can minimise the operative trauma, avoid a second procedure, and permit MRI follow-ups without increasing the risk of the operation. 15 patients with a mean age of 6.7 years were included in this case series and treated with a modified acetabuloplasty for the indication hip dysplasia or Perthes' disease. The modification of the standard procedure included the transplantation of allogenic bone wedges customised from lyophilised femoral grafts. The fixation was performed with bioresorbable polylactide screws. Clinical and radiographical follow-ups were conducted. Procedure-related complications occurred neither in the intra- nor the postoperative period. The allogenic bone graft was remodelled successively as seen on radiographic controls. Dislocations of the bone wedges were not detectable. Subsiding of the allograft did not occur to a noticeable extent as the acetabular index showed no increase during follow-up. This study presents a gentle method of acetabuloplasty which avoids iliac crest bone harvesting with its known complications as well as a second procedure under anaesthesia for the removal of implants. ","1663":"The treatment of choice for skeletally immature patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency is an ACL reconstruction. In a retrospective study we analysed the clinical results after ACL reconstruction in skeletally immature patients. In 55 immature patients the ACL was replaced with a four strand-hamstring graft in an anatomic transepiphyseal origin. The fixation was by means of an extracortical button femoral and a suture washer or staple tibial. Patient mean age at operation was 13 years (8 to 16 years). The mean follow-up was at 3.2 years (1 to 7.5 years) postoperatively. The objective IKDC 2000 score was 90.7 % normal or almost normal values. The mean Lysholm score was 94.1 points (70-100), the mean Cincinnati knee score was 93.9 points (76-100) and 88 % of the patients went back to normal or almost normal sports according to the Tegner score. Stability testing performed with the KT-1000 arthrometer was 1.0 mm (0-4 mm) (preoperative average 5.8 mm). The traumatic re-rupture rate was 5.5 %. In two additional cases a partial rupture of the graft was analysed by arthroscopy. Growth deformities or leg length differences were not seen in any case. ACL reconstruction with hamstrings and extracortical fixation showed good results and might be the treatment of choice in immature patients. The complication rate was low and there were no postoperative growth deformities.

In 28 cases (72 %) the malpractice was confirmed, the average of confirmed failures in all proceedings being about 30 %. The failures could be classified as misdiagnosis followed by inadequate treatment and failures in operative treatment. Minor and moderate permanent disabilities due to malpractice remained in 8 cases, severe permanent disability resulted in 14 cases due to osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

Regarding PVS the knee joint is the most often involved joint and TSGCT are mostly located in the tendon-sheaths of fingers. Both diseases mostly occur in adults but are also observed in children. Symptoms of both diseases are non-specific. Optimal diagnosis includes an X-ray of the involved structure and a MRI. For PVS optimal therapy is a complete synovectomy, whereas, in TSGCT tumors resection of the tumor itself within marginal margins is sufficient. Because of the high rate of recurrence (up to 50 %) in cases suffering from PVS adjuvant therapeutical strategies such as postoperative radiation or radio-synoviorthesis are recommended. Although there are no significant analyses confirming the effect of an adjuvant therapy on the rate of recurrence scientifically at least there is a tendency that these strategies may reduce the rate of recurrence. Malignant dedifferentiation is rarely seen. The prognosis of the mostly benign disease depends on the extent of the disease, the involved structure, additional bony involvement and still existing degenerative changes. In TSGCT no severe sequelae are known. In contrast, PVS in the hip regularly is followed by a secondary osteoarthrosis, in other joints degenerative changes are depending on the still existing changes at the date of diagnosis. Data on the long-term prognosis are rare and only analysed retrospectively.","1667":"Gorham-Stout disease is a rare entity characterised by a massive osteolysis and typically starts monocentrically in an isolated bone. Concerning the pathogenesis, haemangiomatosis and an overstimulation of osteoclasts are discussed which cause a progressive destruction of the affected skeleton and involve neighbouring soft tissue in the further progress of the disease. This report is about a 45-year-old male who suffered a traumatic insult. X-rays showed an osteolytic lesion in the 4th lumbar vertebra with depression in the ventral roof plate. Further radiological investigation has ruled out a malignant lesion and suggested Gorham-Stout disease as a diagnosis. Therapy has been carried out using bisphosphonates as well as fractioned radiation of the vertebra with 30 Gy under which a remission was achieved. The progress of our case correlates with published data in the literature. Spinal lesions are rare, but possible neurological complications or a possible chylothorax reflect the high mortality rate. We found no complications in our case. Despite massive osteolysis with resorption of up to a whole bone segment, radiation with a dose of 22.8 Gy and the use of antiresorptive substances, as reported in our case, have often been shown to limit the destructive progression of the disease. A causal therapy of the disease is not known yet. ","1668":"Haemophilic pseudotumour is a rare disease occurring in 1 % of patients with severe haemophilia as a long-term complication. Because both haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) are X-linked recessive genetic disorders, pseudotumours are found almost exclusively in men between 20 and 70 years of age. Haemophilic pseudotumour has been defined as a progressive cystic swelling, produced by recurrent haemorrhage, which exerts increasing pressure on nearby structures. As a result, necrosis of skin, muscle and bone can be found. Neurovascular obstruction as well as pathologic fractures are severe complications of this disease. Most patients with pseudotumours are asymptomatic for a long time and many patients report sustaining an injury prior to the development of the tumour. Most haemophilic pseudotumours of the bone are located in the pelvis, femur and hand. We present the case of a 59-year-old male patient suffering from a haemophilic pseudotumour of the right distal femur. After verification of the diagnosis by means of an open biopsy, final surgery with curettage and plombage with bone cement was performed.","1669":"The stabilising effect of atmospheric pressure on the hip joint was first described by the brothers Eduard and Wilhelm Weber in 1836. Later in 1837, they conducted an experiment in which they examined a weight-bearing cadaveric hip joint in an evacuable container and could repeatedly demonstrate dislocation of the femur head due to the significant reduction of surrounding pressure and its repositioning by normalisation of the pressure. In our study we aimed to honour the contribution of the Weber brothers, to reflect on the historical argument about the hip stabilising effect of atmospheric pressure they initiated, to repeat the famous experiment they did in 1837 using advanced sensors and radiological equipment and to demonstrate the consequences of the effect on total hip arthroplasty. A weight-bearing human cadaveric hip joint was placed in a radiolucent evacuable container, in which the pressure was reduced with a vacuum pump and normalised by opening a valve. Pressure and dislocation distance were measured continuously by sensors. The state of the hip joint was documented both by X-ray as well as by permanent fluoroscopy with video recording. Conforming to the experiments published in 1837 we demonstrated dislocation of the hip joint as a result of a significant reduction of pressure. Normalisation of the pressure caused joint reduction. The ability of the cadaveric hip to bear weight depended to a great extent on its quality. Reduction of the pressure harmed the cadaveric hip and reduced the number of possible experiments. The stabilising effect of atmospheric pressure on the hip joint is a fact, which was proved in 1836\/37 by the Weber brothers, who conducted convincing experiments with human cadaveric hip joints. Nevertheless, the investigation into this relationship continues until today. We repeated and reproduced their experiment published in 1837 which irrefutably proved the stabilising effect of atmospheric pressure on the hip joint. The surgical application is of the utmost importance in the field of hip arthroplasty. Careful handling and reconstruction of the capsula, the use of size-adapted large hip balls as well as the intra-articular drainage provide the basis for maintaining the optimal mechanical environment and avoiding postoperative dislocation. Due to the variation in quality and anatomic characteristics of cadaveric hip specimens, we decided to use standardised model joints for further experiments.

After the second passage 2.2 x 10 (5) cells were seeded on flexible silicon dishes. A cyclic mechanical strain with an elongation of 2 % (D + 2; D - 2) or 8 % (D + 8; D - 8) was applied for three days with a stimulation time of three times for two hours each day. Cells were harvested on day 1, day 1 after stress (day 4) and day 4 after stress (day 7). mRNA expression of collagen I, II, III, tenascin C and Cbfa1 was investigated by RT-PCR.

","1671":"Recent pedobarographic analyses have shown that in spite of acceptable clinical and radiological results after hallux valgus surgery, there is decreased function of the big toe and the first ray, respectively. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate if physiotherapy can help to increase big toe function and to restore physiological gait patterns after hallux valgus surgery. 33 patients (31 females, 2 males, 34 feet) with a mild to moderate hallux valgus deformity have been included in this study. 22 patients underwent Austin osteotomy and 11 patients underwent Scarf osteotomy, respectively. Postsurgically, the patients wore the Rathgeber postop shoe for 4 weeks. After this period they received physiotherapy. Pedobarographic examinations were performed with the EMED-at platform 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 6 months after surgery. The AOFAS score and ROM of the first MTP joint were evaluated prior to surgery and 6 months after surgery. Also, patient's satisfaction has been evaluated 6 months after surgery. In the big toe region peak pressure increased from 80.7 kPa 4 weeks after surgery to 171.9 kPa 8 weeks after surgery (p &lt; 0.0001) and 336.1 kPa 6 months after surgery. In the same period maximum force increased from 18.6 N to 47.6 N and 90.9 N, respectively. In the first metatarsal head region peak pressure increased from 141.4 kPa 4 weeks postoperatively to 215.8 kPa 8 weeks postoperatively and 292.7 kPa 6 months after surgery (p &lt; 0.0001). The AOFAS score increased from 60.8 presurgically to 94.0 at 6 months after surgery and ROM of the first MTP joint increased during the same period from 66 degrees to 70 degrees . The authors conclude that postoperative physiotherapy improves big toe function and pressure distribution in the region of the first metatarsal head. This helps to restore physiological gait patterns after hallux valgus surgery.

Measurement differences and the learning curve during the different courses were evaluated. There was a significant (p = 0.001) improvement of the average angle between the basic (6.74 degrees [+\/- 1.46 degrees ]) and the advanced course (6.22 degrees [+\/- 1.17 degrees ]). However, there were no better results in the final course and no additional improvement. Participants had higher variations when measuring the beta-angle than the alpha-angle. A significant improvement was seen if the participants performed a large number of hip ultrasounds between the courses. Higher measurement differences were seen in pathological hip ultrasounds and in ultrasonographic examinations of poorer quality. During the educational courses on hip ultrasound using the Graf method, a high intra- and interobserver variability was seen. These findings were most prominent in measurement of the beta-angle, in pathological hip ultrasounds and in ultrasonographic hip examinations of poorer quality. The best results were achieved by participants who had performed a large number of examinations between courses. For the improvement of ultrasonographic measurements, a large number of self-performed examinations and a training in potential mistakes seem to be of great importance. ","1673":"Resection arthroplasty is an accepted surgical option to treat severe late periprosthetic infections. However, it is known that one has to consider that a persistence of infection is very often combined with a permanent fistula in approximately 10 % of the patients. In particular, the occurrence of a fistula and pain caused by the persistent infection is followed by a considerable reduction of the quality of life of these patients. We have analysed the effort and complications of treatment and the change of pain and function of these patients. In this study 11 patients (average age 68 years) with a Girdlestone situation and persistent infection with an average duration of 33 months were successfully treated by a multiple stage surgical therapy plan which included a radical surgical revision of the infection, stepwise leg lengthening and subsequent reimplantation. In all cases surgical revision of the infection was supported by both systemic and local (antibiotic-loaded cement spacer) antibiotic therapy. The choice of implants followed the general recommendations for revision hip arthroplasty. The mean follow-up after reimplantation was 16 months (min 4, max 24). We observed an average improvement of the Harris hip score from 27.7 points at the beginning of the therapy to 72.5 points at the end of the follow-up. None of the patients had suffered from a reinfection at the end of the follow-up. We observed no surgically related mortality. Surgical complications including spacer dislocations and implant dislocation were seen. The leg length discrepancy could be decreased from an average of 6.8 cm to 1 cm without the occurrence of a neurological deficit. The reimplantation of a hip prosthesis in cases of infected Girdlestone situations is complex, it can, however, offer the prospect of a marked increase in function and less pain for these patients.

Eigthy joints in 78 patients were treated surgically with the titanium implant for hallux metatarsophalangeal joints between January 2000 and April 2007. There were 56 women and 22 men. The mean age was 58 (range: 34 - 80) years, and the mean follow-up was 56 (range: 6 - 87) months. The pathological indications were hallux rigidus (85.5 %), metatarsalhead necrosis (8.5 %), revision of Keller-Brandes (3.6 %) and 2 cases were done as a revision of silastic to titanium prosthesis and a revision of pseudarthrosis after arthrodesis (2.4 %). The patients were subsequently examined by means of clinical and radiological assessments. The clinical function was classified using the score of Kitaoka et al. The mean time taken to get back to normal activities is 35.2 (range: 21 - 76) days. The average Kitaoka score improved to 75 points (p &lt; 0.05) at 3 months postoperatively and to 85 points (p &lt; 0.05) at 6 months postoperatively. The mean range of motion achieved was 38.6 degrees (range ex 21.5 degrees \/flex 17.1 degrees ). The clinical results of titanium arthroplasty were good. The advantages of this procedure are preservation of joint movement and good pain relief with an early mobilisation. ","1675":"To evaluate the differences in clinical outcome and economics of primary total knee replacements, the results with two implant types (cruciate retaining and sacrificing) were analysed. From 1\/2000 until 6\/2001 twenty-two consecutive patients with primary arthrosis of the knee underwent total knee replacement with the cruciate-retaining CKS-CC knee system (= group 1: 9 men, 13 women, mean age 65.68 years). Between 8\/2001 and 3\/2002 twenty-two consecutive patients received the cruciate-sacrificing NexGen Full Flex implant (= group 2: 4 men, 18 women, mean age 67.18 years). The operative procedures and rehabilitation regimes were standardised. The modified Insall score, patient satisfaction, as well as implant and rehabilitation costs were evaluated. Statistical analyses were based on two theses. I) There is no difference between the clinical early and five-year results of both groups. II) The more expensive NexGen implant is less economic regarding total costs per patient. The more expensive, cruciate-sacrificing NexGen implant showed significantly better clinical results (p = 0.0005) and higher patient satisfaction while rehabilitation costs were lower (p = 0.003). While the clinical results remained unchanged, the revision rate after 5 years for the NexGen System was lower. Not only minimally invasive surgery, but also choosing the right type of implant may lead to better early as well as mid-term clinical results in primary total knee arthroplasty. This may also reduce total costs per patient in primary total knee arthroplasty.

Extensive studies addressing evidence-based treatment criteria have been published, the indication for CT scans depending on clinical symptoms appeared to be one of the critical issues. In this study, the question was raised whether or not the developed evidence-based criteria may be transferred to the patients of a German level 1 trauma centre. Within 2 years (2004\/05) 1841 patients with a traumatic brain injury were treated, 1042 patients with a mild traumatic brain injury and with an age over 14 years were included in the study. The indication for a head CT scan was checked by criteria of a phase 3 study (New Orleans Criteria - NOC). Furthermore, the length of hospitalisation, number and character of secondary aggravation, and kind of inpatient care were analysed. 69.5 % of our patients were diagnosed with the help of a CT scan, according to the evidence criteria 98.8 % of the patients should have been scanned (p &gt; 0.001). A secondary aggravation caused by a cerebral lesion was found in 3 patients without a CT scan, all of these patients would have been scanned according to the NOC (n. s.). The fraction of patients with alcohol intoxication reached 44 %, a rate that is significantly higher compared to other international studies. These patients were not as often scanned (p &lt; 0.001) and had a shorter hospital stay (p &lt; 0.001) compared to other patients. Duration of hospital stay was prolonged depending on the severity of the brain injury and occurrence of secondary aggravation (p &lt; 0.001). Summarising, the high sensitivity of the investigated evidence-based criteria (NOC) could be confirmed, but the application would not have led to a reduction of CT scans within our population.

Nevertheless, non-union in femoral fractures is a common complication with an incidence of 12.5 percent, mostly arising for mechanical reasons. The aim of this study is to find out whether the increase of stability through an augmentive plate fixation (if necessary with bone grafting) with leaving the nail in situ is adequate to treat the non-union successfully. Between January 2001 and July 2005 32 patients with femoral non-unions after intramedullary nailing were treated in our hospital. Mean age was 42 years (min 22 and max 75). Distribution of gender was about (2\/3) male and (1\/3) female. In 17 patients the fractures were localised in the middle of the femur shaft, in 8 patients in the proximal third and in 7 in the distal third. The results were evaluated retrospectively by reviewing the patients' records and X-ray-films. If the success of treatment was not clearly determined through the records the patients were contacted by telephone and, if required, invited for a personal examination. In 29 cases our procedure led primarily to a definite consolidation of the non-union within 5 months on average. The nail was changed eight times, in three patients an additional operation was necessary due to screw breakage. Bone grafting was performed in 27 cases. The overall group included 24 non-smokers and 8 smokers. If indicated, the herein demonstrated procedure with an augmentive plate fixation while leaving the nail in situ is simple and safe. Although the intramedullary canal is potentially affected through the initial nailing, the healing of femoral non-unions was observed in the majority of cases in spite of the additional extramedullary approach for plating and bone grafting. ","1679":"In polytraumatised patients, fracture management depends on the overall injury severity. For decision making, patients are grouped in one of four categories (STABILE, BORDERLINE, INSTABLE and IN EXTREMIS). STABILE patients should and BORDERLINE patients may undergo primary definitive fracture stabilisation; in contrast, this is not recommended for INSTABLE or IN EXTREMIS patients. The marginal soft tissue envelope of the tibia predisposes for open fractures, compartment syndrome, and wound infections. Therefore the management of lower leg injuries is demanding, especially in polytraumatised patients. Bilateral tibia fractures and ipsilateral tibia and femur fractures represent a special entity. For these injuries special algorithms, which consider the soft tissue status of the tibia and the overall injury severity, have been developed. The indication for fasciotomy covers a wide field and may be performed prophylactically. The decision for amputation is based on the patient's general condition and the soft-tissue and neurovascular status. Scoring systems are useful for decision making, however individual decisions should be made.","1680":"","1681":"","1682":"","1683":"Extremity conserving treatment in hospitals of maximum care involves a combination of soft tissue replacement and segment transfer. In contrast some other countries favour the segment transfer without soft tissue replacement and can demonstrate good results. Thus, we posed the question of the effects of soft tissue defects in callus distraction. In an experimental study with two groups of sheep, a standardized fracture model in one group with bone and soft tissue defects and in the other group without soft tissue defects was compared. At specific dates the animals were euthanized and the bone quality combined with different soft tissue conditions were quantified. At the outset of callus maturation, animals without soft tissue defects have a lead over animals with soft tissue defects. At the end of the experimental study both groups show the same bone quality results compared to a healthy comparison group. At the terminal phase of the animal experiment the results of open segment transfer show no differences between the groups with or without soft tissue defects. This supports the experience of other countries. Because of the experimental set-up we cannot make any prediction regarding the biomechanical stability of the callus.

The experts of both specialties classified the learning objectives into 2 levels for knowledge, into 4 grades of competence for skills, as well as attitudes and social competence. The general part of the operative specialties contains 120 items classified into 39 learning objectives for knowledge and 83 for skills. Two learning objectives comprise both knowledge and skill. The part orthopaedic and trauma surgery comprises 141 learning objectives, six items for skills, 138 for knowledge, as well as three learning objectives for both knowledge and skills. In addition, 22 learning objectives deal with aspects of attitudes and social competence. In spite of the only recent alliance of orthopaedics and trauma surgery, the commission has developed not only a collection of topics, but also a usable joint catalogue of learning objectives for undergraduate training with a nationwide recommendation character. The catalogue paves the way for a forward-looking, modern education.

Furthermore, it exists a sterile osteitis pubis after repetitive periostial microtrauma. Chronic progressions are possible. Further problems are fistulas and abscesses. With involvement of symphysis or iliosacral joint, the development of septic pelvine instability is possible. Due to the anatomic complexity of the pelvis, this affection can be neglected or underdiagnosed. We have analysed septic pelvic operations performed during 1997 to 2006. We excluded septic affections of the hip joint after joint replacement. In 15 cases we found both radiological and microbiological signs of osseous inclusion in terms of pelvic osteomyelitis. 15 patients were operated after preoperatively performed bacterial asservation and conventional X-ray, fistula scanning and pelvic CT scans. In 3 cases we placed drainages into abscess formations under CT-guidance. In 14 cases osseous infected areas existed in the pelvic skeleton and we performed a local bony resection. In 3 patients we performed removal of bacterially contaminated metal implants. In 3 cases an additional pelvic instability due to involvement of the symphysis was present. Here we resected the infected joint and performed an arthrodesis to reestablish the pelvic ring stability. Due to the localisation of the infected pelvic bone, different regimes of therapy are necessary. Iliac osteomyelitis can be treated by resection or sequestrectomy, pubic osteomyelitis or sterile osteitis can be treated similarly. Septic iliosacral joint infections as well as septic symphysis joint infections can be treated by resection and can lead to a pelvic ring instability. Simple revision surgery of fistula without removement of the fistula's origin will fail, as 9 of our patients had already had several fistula revisions without any signs of healing. ","1688":"In a 40-year-old, previously healthy person presenting with initial septic signs, a purulent infection of the knee joint caused by Streptococcus uberis was detected. Known as a pathogen for bovine mastitis this Streptococcus can cause a purulent joint infection in healthy, young humans by haematogenic spread with a persistent loss of function.","1689":"The purpose of this study was to verify the possibility of monitoring the callus maturation biochemically. In an experimental study on sheep, animals with bone fractures with a length 5 cm each were divided into group A (with concomitant damage of the soft tissue) and group B (without soft tissue damage). During callus traction and maturation, biochemical parameters (osteocalcin, AlP, NTx, calcium, phosphate) were measured. Animals of each group (A+B) were euthanised at fixed points in time (according to protocol) and the callus was prepared histologically. Total AlP and NTx values were initially reduced during the callus traction and maturation, but increased significantly at the time of Docking+1 transportation time. At the same time, the histological evaluation showed a definite increase of the bone stabilisation, which approximately resembles the structure of a healthy bone as reference. With the combination of the AlP and NTx values already determined in the daily clinical routine the monitoring of callus maturation in animal studies becomes possible. ","1690":"Two case reports are presented in which segmental defects of the tibia after distraction osteogenesis have been filled with vitalised allogenic cancellous bone. Bone healing was achieved within three months. The effectiveness of this method for treating segmental defects of limbs should be investigated by means of prospective randomised trials.","1691":"Results of shoulder replacement in fracture sequelae are not satisfying. This is due to an insufficient function of the rotator cuff, mostly because of a secondary necrosis of the tubercles. The aim of this study was to investigate if the differentiated use of anatomic and reversed prostheses in dependence of the preoperative anatomic situation is able to optimise the results. The aim of this study was a comparison of 55 patients with secondary trauma prostheses in fracture sequelae. In 36 cases (especially fracture sequelae types 1 and 2 according to Boileau), anatomic head prostheses (Affinis, FU 24 months) and in 19 cases (especially fracture sequelae types 3 and 4 according to Boileau), inversed prostheses (Delta III, FU 18.3 months) were implanted. The Constant score of the patients with fracture sequelae types 1 and 2 according to Boileau and Walch improved from 19 to 68 on average (anatomic prosthesis), and for types 3 and 4 from 9 to 47.5 (inversed prosthesis). For these special indications, fracture sequelae types 3 and 4 show remarkably better results than those with an anatomic head prosthesis mentioned in literature. The preoperative score of the collective of patients we examined was 10 points less than the one in comparable publications. The postoperative improvement is therefore clearly more significant. The differentiated indication of anatomic and reversed shoulder prostheses in fracture sequelae leads to a noticeable improvement of the postoperative results. In slight malformations (fracture sequelae types 1 and 2) the anatomic prosthesis is the better choice. For severe deformations (fracture sequelae types 3 and 4) however, the implantation of a reversed prosthesis is the more convincing intervention. Moreover, the differentiated indication allows for a better prediction of the expected result. ","1692":"The indication for rotator cuff repair in elderly patients is controversial. Results after refixation of the cuff in dependence on age, size of rupture and retraction using the Constant-Murley and DASH scores were analysed. We wanted to examine whether the results of rotator cuff repair allow us to define the indication for the operative procedure. Over a period of six years 154 patients with symptomatic rotator cuff lesion had undergone repair of cuff tears, and 119 patients were evaluated for follow-up applying the Constant-Murley and DASH scores for self-assessment. On average a postoperative Constant-Murley score of 83.5 points was obtained. A significant difference between the operated and the opposite shoulder was observed. In the DASH score a mean point value of 23.6 was calculated. In all combined groups more than 50% of the patients and 27% of the patients in the Bateman IV group were satisfied with the postoperative results using both scores. Reruptures were seen mostly in the Bateman IV group. The difference of score points between the operated to the opposite site in Bateman II and III groups did not show unfavourable values at higher age whereas adverse data were found in the Bateman IV group. In the Bateman IV group, in addition to cuff repair a muscle flap or arthroplasty should be considered in the choice of operative procedure. ","1693":"Occult sacral meningoceles are a rare causative factor for neural claudication or radiculopathy. Facet joint cysts in the lumbar spine causing similar symptoms are much more frequent. We report the case of a patient with the radiological diagnosis of a facet joint cyst causing neural claudication. During surgery an occult sacral meningocele was diagnosed. In the literature there are only few cases reported. Hence, the findings and important differential diagnoses of cystic epidural lesions in the lumbar spine are discussed.","1694":"Echinococcosis of human pathogenetic relevance is a very rare disease in Europe. The vertebral manifestation of the latter zoonosis constitutes one percent of all cases. Intraspinal echinococcosis appears worldwide just sporadically, whereas extradurally located cysts are identified more often than intradurally located ones. The diagnostic and specific therapeutic consequences of this very seldom entity are discussed based on a case report.","1695":"The aim of the present study was the verification of the accuracy of 2-D fluoroscopy-based navigated pedicle screws at the thoracic and lumbar spine in a case series of traumatised patients. Within 36 months 111 pedicle screws in 29 patients were instrumented using C-arm based navigation, 60 at the thoracic and 51 at the lumbar spine. All screw positions were evaluated postoperatively by a routine thin slice CT scan using multiplanar reconstruction. The position of a screw in relation to its pedicle was classified in a) screw completely intraosseous, b) screw perforated less than thread level and c) screw perforated more than thread level. In 34 thoracic (56.7%) and 32 lumbar (62.7%) screws complete intraosseous placement was observed, 14 thoracic (23.3%) and 14 lumbar (27.5%) screws perforated less than thread level. Perforations more than thread level were found in 12 thoracic (20%) and 5 lumbar (9.8%) screws. Only medial and lateral perforations of the pedicle were documented (without neurological signs), cranial or caudal ones did not occur. Segmentation of the C-arm navigation into two comparable treatment periods showed a learning curve with a reduction of perforations in the second sequence (after 57 pedicle instrumentations) of about 15%, this was found to be not statistically significant. The fluoroscopic navigation of pedicle screws is a safe procedure at the lumbar spine with equal accuracy compared to the non-navigated conventional instrumentation. Application of C-arm navigation at the thoracic spine showed more inaccuracies, so that 3-D-based navigation seems to be advantageous in this region.","1696":"Maintaining segmental motion is one of the most reported theoretical advantages of total disc replacement (TDR). Several inlay sizes are available for reconstruction of the physiological disc height. The influence of the implant height on the range of motion (ROM) was investigated in a biomechanical study. A total of 10 human lumbar cadaver spines were subjected to biomechanical testing. Flexion\/extension and side-bending moments were applied from 2.5-7.5 Nm on a spine load simulator allowing for all 6 degrees of freedom. Motion under different loads was monitored by the Zebris system in 3 dimensions. Initially intact specimens were tested in 3 load cycles. Then a total disc prothesis was implanted with an 8.5 mm inlay and the cycles were repeated. Finally in 5 cases a 1-mm larger inlay was inserted while in the remaining 5 cases the inlay was exchanged with a 2-mm larger implant. Neutral zone (NZ) and ROM were recorded under the different loads. The average motion for the various loads showed no significant difference when the intact motion segment was compared to the specimen containing the 8.5-mm inlay. After the larger inlay had been mounted the average reduction of the ROM in flexion\/extension was 25% under the load of 7.5 Nm, 26% under a torque of 5.0 Nm and 30% when 2.5 Nm were applied. The NZ was reduced by 37%. For side-bending the ROM was reduced by 21% under a load of 7.5 Nm, by 26% under 5.0 Nm and by 35% under a torque of 2.5 Nm. The NZ was decreased by 27%. The reduction of the ROM was significant (p=0.0057). Segmental lumbar motion is maintained after TDR. The size of the inlay can significantly change the ROM in lumbar spine segments treated by TDR. ","1697":"The aim of this study was to evaluate of the efficiency of an internal fixateur used since 1998 in multisegmental spondylodesis of the lumbar spine. The prospective study included 105 patients with degenerative changes or instabilities of the lumbar spine, who underwent an anterior and posterior stabilisation of more than two segments. The minimum period of follow-up was more than 6 months. There were several objective scores used for the evaluation of the efficiency (Oswestry score\/visual analogue scale [VAS]). In addition, the quality of the new internal implant was assessed concerning the rate of loosening and failure of the implant. This new internal fixateur, produced as a titanium alloy, consists of pedicle screws and longitudinal rods with 5 mm diameter and connection elements. Upon pulling the nut a square stabilised situation is created. Altogether the three-segmental stabilisations predominated (n=77), 23 patients received a four-segmental, four patients a five-segmental stabilisation and one received a stabilisation of six levels, mainly involving the segments L3\/4 to L5\/S1. Because of severe deformities in 14 cases the pedicle screws were applied by computer-assisted navigation (Navitrak). In 12 patients (11.4%) radiological signs of loosening of the inserted pedicle screws in the vertebra were diagnosed. The radiological analysis resulted in pseudarthrosis of 4 (1.2%) of the 349 amalgamated segments. There were no cases of material failure. The average value of the pain score preoperatively (VAS) was 7.7 (5-10, SA 1.3) and postoperatively 4.6 (1-10, SA 1.8). With regard to the Oswestry disability index the preoperative average value amounted to 51.9% (30-91, SA 11.8) and postoperatively 35% (12-74, SA 11.8). In all 98 (93.3%) patients were satisfied, 7 (6.7%) patients reported a decline of the subjective outcome. This system achieved a high degree of patient satisfaction and showed a low rate of pseudarthrosis. Furthermore, it can be inserted for short and long fusions, as well in deformities. ","1698":"The use of a spine orthosis for the treatment of low back pain is an approved, but also a disputed therapy method. There have been numerous studies so far that attempt to examine the acceptance and the impact of this treatment method. But up to now there is no biomechanical assessment about the effective level of intervertebral disc decompression while wearing an orthosis. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to measure the reduction of the disc pressure while wearing an orthosis. The pressure between the sensor contact area and the lumbar region was measured with FSR sensors. Two sensors were fixed at the vertical rods of the plastic framework of the orthosis. The pressure sensors underwent a voltage change while a Tigges T-Flex-B orthosis was being worn. These voltage changes were recorded using the connected measurement amplifiers. Different series of measurements were conducted with 3 male test persons. The resulting pressures were recorded under the following test conditions: knees bent, in different flexion angles of the torso and lift of 10\/20 kg weights. Back muscle, shear, compressive and resulting forces were computed afterwards with the generally valid biomechanical formulas. The computations showed that the use of the Tigges T-Flex-B orthosis resulted in relief of the intervertebral disc L3-L4 of about approximately 96.91+\/-4.68 N. The highest intervertebral disc pressure reduction was measured during the body-far lift of 20 kg weight. For the first time relief of the lumbar spinal column was proven in the present study because the contact pressure was measured between the orthosis and the lumbal body surface.

Is it possible to differentiate traumatic from pre-existing pathology with the help of history, clinical findings and imaging features? The answers to these questions are of paramount importance in the setting of legal expert assessment. The diagnosis of an acute traumatic chondral injury is based on arthroscopic and\/or MRI findings. MRI is the diagnostic method of choice in a suspected isolated chondral injury. The method yields high accuracy in detecting chondral and osteochondral lesions. The MRI finding of a concomitant subchondral bone contusion (\"bone bruise\") adjacent to a cartilage lesion helps in the diagnosis of acute chondral lesions. Traumatic bone marrow alterations regress in most cases over the course of 6 months. For this reason the initial MRI should be performed within 1 to 6 weeks after trauma. A follow-up study should be undertaken not prior to 3 months after injury. Osteoarthritic cartilage lesions show a distinct regional pattern on MRI usually affecting the weight-bearing regions. In advanced stages, regularly concomitant osseous reactions such as osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and bone attrition are observed. Subchondral bone marrow lesions in osteoarthritis show a tendency to progress. The direct inspection and probing of the joint during arthroscopy allows for a detailed assessment of the chondral surface and the diagnosis of possible cartilage softening. An arthroscopic differentiation between acute traumatic chondral lesions and chronic cartilage alterations is possible in most cases within the first 6 to 12 weeks after injury. ","1705":"Different studies in the past have reported about the treatment of osteomyelitis. None of these analysed the long-term results and complications after surgical treatment of acute and chronic osteomyelitis. The aim of this study was to analyse the recurrence rate and sequelae of osteomyelitis patients. We analysed 53 children who were treated surgically between 1992 and 2004 for acute (n = 13) and chronic (n = 40) osteomyelitis. The histopathology was used for differentiation. With an average follow-up of 7.1 years (2 - 12.5 years) we examined the recurrence rate and the medical condition. A causative organism was identified in 53.9 % of the children with acute (AOM) and in 17.5 % of the children with chronic osteomyelitis (COM). In most cases Staphylococcus aureus could be isolated. Local antibiotics were applied intraoperatively to 92.3 % of the children with AOM and to 90 % of the children with COM. Additionally, the children with AOM were treated for 56.7 days (14 - 104 days) and the children with COM for 49.1 days (6 - 130 days) with parenteral\/oral antibiotics. 2 (15.4 %) children with AOM and 6 (15 %) children with COM had a recurrence. At the time of the last examination all children were free of recurrence. One of the patients with AOM had a painless motion deficit of the shoulder. 5 children with COM complained of either pain and reduced range of motion of the affected extremity or minor deformities. Infantile osteomyelitis requires a selective diagnostic approach and an immediate parental antibiosis. If the antibiotic treatment fails, abscesses or sequestra are formed, an operation is indicated. With an adequate multidisciplinary cooperation, recurrence and sequelae can be avoided. ","1706":"A seriously injured tsunami victim with complicated osteomyelitis is presented. The patient was treated with a new resorbable bone substitute, which can be loaded with different antibiotics. The successful treatment is illustrated by the clinical, radiological and histological features. Bilateral open fractures of the lower leg with open elbow fracture led to a bilateral amputation of the lower legs and the right arm because of a beginning sepsis. The following intramedullary osteitis with multiresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium was treated with the bone substitute PerOssal combined with systemic and local application of vancomycin and systemic application of ceftazidime and meropenem. This case report illustrates the concept of an additional local antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis by a bone substitute also functioning as a drug delivery system.","1707":null,"1708":"Resurfacing arthroplasty represents an alternative method to total hip replacement especially for the young and active patient. The main reasons for early implant failure are mal-positioning of the femoral component and notching of the femoral neck during femoral head preparation. In the context of a cadaver study of formalin-fixed cadaveric full body specimens 6 DUROM -Hip-Resurfacing prosthesis have been implanted under navigation control. The aim of the study was an evaluation of the functionality and accuracy of the computer-assisted planning and navigation system on the basis of a navigation module library from Surgitaix AG Aachen, Germany. The main angulation error between planning (135.2 +\/- 3.6 degrees ) and navigation (136.2 +\/- 2.8 degrees ) was 1.9 +\/- 1.1 degrees , the main anterior offset error between planning (2.2 +\/- 1.3 mm) and navigation (2.7 +\/- 2.3 mm) was 1.2 +\/- 1.9 mm. The main distance error between planning and navigation was 2.7 +\/- 1.3 mm. The mean time for all five planning and navigation steps was 20.2 +\/- 2.5 min. Against the background of a acetabular bone-saving approach in all 6 cases the smallest possible femoral component could be implanted. The computer-assisted fluoroscopic planning and navigation system for hip resurfacing showed within the scope of this cadaver study first promising results. The system approaches a practicable intraoperative planning with a high accuracy in operative implementation. Nevertheless, the potential benefit has to be evaluated in further clinical studies, especially from the perspective of a possible integration of this navigation system into the clinical work-flow. Further studies should consider a fluoroscopic-assisted range of motion assessment under consideration of an additional cup-module to enhance the postoperative range of motion after hip resurfacing procedures. ","1709":"An incidence of 10 % for anterior knee pain following total knee arthroplasty has been published. Often several factors can be found leading to functional deficits following total knee arthroplasty. The aim of our study on a consecutive series of revised total knee arthroplasties due to anterior knee pain is to show the pathological findings and their therapy. Between January 1, 2006 and March 31, 2007 13 revisions including 2 men and 11 women due to anterior knee pain following total knee arthroplasty were performed. Mean duration between index operation and revision was 13.2 months. In all cases lateralisation of the patella often accompanied by hypertrophy of the lateral facet could be detected. In one case severe medial and lateral instability of the collateral ligaments was found. A meniscoid could be described in 2 cases. In one additional case malpositioning of the tibial component could be found. After resection of the hypertrophic lateral patellar facet and lateral release and therapy for additional pathologies all patients were free of complaints after a mean follow-up of 9 months. For avoiding anterior knee pain following total knee arthroplasty an exact positioning of both the femoral and the tibial component is essential. Additionally stable collateral ligaments and exact gliding of the patella by means of the \"no thumb sign\" should be achieved, too. During the operation hyperextension of 5 degrees is essential. If, intraoperatively, a hypertrophic lateral patellar facet is detected we recommend its resection.

We discuss the clinical results for an exact anatomical reconstruction of the AC-joint by transosseal acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular FiberWire cerclage. 56 patients with acute AC joint dislocations type Rockwood III and V underwent operative treatment, using an exact anatomical reconstruction of the AC joint by transosseal acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular FiberWire cerclage. A clinical and radiological follow-up examination was performed. Clinical complications, objective results, radiological results, Constant and Rowe scores were evaluated. 43 patients could be examined on average 15.4 months after surgery. 24 patients (56 %) showed radiological signs of ossification of the acromioclavicular and coracoclavicular ligaments. Minimal postoperative clavicular displacement was observed in 14 patients (33 %). 2 patients (5 %) needed a second surgery due to complications, in one case because of reduction in the range of motion, in the other case due to abacterial inflammation. The advantage of this type of surgery is a minimal rate of complications and a good objective result with a high Constant score of 94 and Rowe score of 93, without the need for a second surgery. This procedure for an exact anatomic AC joint reconstruction shows good objective results with a high Constant and Rowe scores for shoulder function. Postoperative ossifications of the AC joint ligaments are common, but seem to have no influence on the clinical results. ","1712":"Post-traumatic humerus varus can develop after an insufficient reduction technique. Reduced abduction, anteversion or rotation is seen, often associated with painful impingement. The radiographic sign is a diminished shaft-head angle less than 140 degrees with a consecutive elevation of the greater tubercule above the head rim and a subacromial narrowing. We analysed the data of the Constant score pre- and postcorrectionem. Between 1992 and 1999 we treated 8 patients with post-traumatic humerus varus. The follow-up time lasted for 3 years after the correction procedure. By means of the Constant score we evaluated the pre- and postoperative results. In addition, we measured the radiological changes of the humerus head-shaft angles. Furthermore, we controlled the arm length before and after the corrective osteotomy. The age at the time of correction averaged 43 years (23 years to 65 years). In 6 patients a closing wedge was performed on the right shoulder and two times on the left side. 2 patients had an additional retrotorsional malalignment, which was corrected by means of derotation. In 5 cases cancellous bone was attached to the osteotomy plane. The average delay between the first and the second operation was 8 months (range from 4 weeks to 12 months). The Constant score improved from 39.5 to 75.5 points. The radiological head-shaft angle increased from 84 degrees to 130 degrees . The arm shortening decreased from 2 cm to less than 1 cm. Osseous consolidation of the osteotomy was established after 8.5 weeks. In one case we saw a pseudarthrotic osteotomy plane and treated it by plate extension and cancellous bone grafting. The valgus osteotomy of the humeral neck is an extra-articular reconstructive procedure to correct a malpositioning between humeral head and shaft. It improves both radiological and clinical results. It is a demanding procedure regarding indication and operative technique.

This study compares the results of two different prosthetic designs. A first generation design, the Neer prosthesis (SGE 1 G) and a third generation design, the Aequalis prosthesis (SGE 3 G) were investigated. The data (patients' charts, X-ray, and ultrasound) were collected and analysed in a retrospective manner. Self assessment was performed using the visual analogue scale (VAS), functional outcome was determined using the Constant score. For data analysis, methods of descriptive statistic were applied. 29 patients were treated with the SGE 1 G and 49 patients were treated with the SGE 3 G. Patients' age in the mean was 76 years, more women than men were affected. According to the Neer fracture classification, four-part fractures were the most frequent type of fracture. 64 % of the patients in the Neer (SGE 1 G) group and 68 % in the Aequalis (SGE 3 G) group were satisfied with the result according to VAS. The average Constant score in the Neer group was 50 points and in the Aequalis group 59 points. Better results were detected for the subjective parameters pain and activity than for the objective parameters motion and strength. The postoperative deviation from the age- and sex-related Constant score was smaller in the Aequalis group (5 points) than in the Neer group (17 points). Ultrasound examinations revealed in nearly all patients atrophy of the rotator cuff resulting in disturbances of motion between the corresponding gliding tissues. The SGE 3 G shows better results in the VAS and Constant score than the SGE 1 G. The advantages of the modular design of SGE 3 G are underlined by the clinical results.

Between 1\/2000 and 6\/2003, 117 minimally invasive T-plating procedures were performed on 116 patients by sliding through a T-plate from a small proximal incision. After application of the exclusion criteria, a total of 100 operations on 99 patients were left. The follow-up examinations were based on the Constant score and the DASH score.

Apart from the distal fracture of the radius and fractures adjacent to the hip joint, the proximal humerus fracture is the most common fracture in elderly people. From the point of view of evidence-based medicine it is still not possible to define the \"gold standard\" for stabilisation of fractures of the humeral head. Operative stabilisation of fractures of the humeral head is still a surgical challenge and remains the subject of many clinical and experimental investigations. New findings about the biomechanics and pathophysiology of bones and soft tissue have, in recent years, influenced and pointed the way in the design and function of new forms of osteosynthesis. In particular, the development of locking implants has strongly influenced modern surgical techniques.

Nevertheless, it can also occur in a primarily not injured calf, due to external muscle compression during lithotomy positioning. This complication is seen rarely after gynaecological, urological or abdominal operations performed in the Lloyd-Davis position. We present a case of calf compartment after prolonged lithotomy position of the uninjured leg during the nailing of a femur shaft fracture. Postoperatively a diffuse turgor of the healthy calf was seen. The compartment pressures were elevated and the enzyme creatine kinase was elevated up to 3000 U\/l. After dermatofasciotomy the enzyme level normalised, but in the further course we had to resect the necrotic peroneal muscle compartment. During operative procedures at the coxal femur, it is necessary to deposit the other leg in the lithotomy postion. By this means, the compartment pressures can increase in the calf muscles to critical values. Together with operation times longer than 4 hours and a high ponderosity a bedding compartment can develop. As it is in the assumed \"healthy\" leg, this syndrome can be overseen, especially in sedated patients. It has to be considered with high creatine kinase levels and the typical risk factors. If a compartment syndrome is suspected, we recommend early dermatofasciotomy, as this is a low-risk and low-complication operation, in comparison to a later performed compartment decompression.

In one patient the tumour-like lesion was localised in the fifth lumbar vertebral body, in the other in the left ischium and pubis. Arterial embolisation was performed in both cases. Follow-up at 6 and 24 months after embolisation showed a significant increase of sclerosis and a reduced volume of the cysts.

Between 1993 and 2001 twenty-one patients who were between 18 and 65 years old and suffered a monotrauma of the tibial pilon of the type C1 to C3 of the AO classification, were treated with a staged reconstruction. Stabilisation was done by small-fragment double plate osteosynthesis. In this retrospective study, we could review 17 patients clinically and radiologically and assess their outcome with the ankle hindfoot and the Bargon scores. In accordance with the ankle hindfoot score, there were 11 excellent and good results, 5 moderate and one poor. In accordance with the Bargon score, 41 % of the patients had a severe arthrosis, 24 % a moderate and 35 % a light to no arthrosis.

All 36 acetabular screws were placed correctly without any perioperative complication. The mean operation time per screw was 54 min, the mean fluoroscopic time per screw was 87 s. In the follow-up examinations (current rate: 71 %, mean follow-up: 13.1 +\/- 1.8 months) no fixation failure or development of post-traumatic osteoarthritis was seen. One wound infection occured.

The aim of this study was to define the perioperative risk profile in trauma patients suffering from Parkinson's disease in order to improve treatment options in these patients. Over a period of 13 years, 16 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease treated in the department of trauma surgery were retrospectively compared using matched-pair analysis with 16 controls not affected by PD. Both groups of patients were assessed regarding morbidity, length of treatment and rehabilitation. Trauma patients suffering from Parkinson's disease showed an increase in morbidity risk. Postoperative falls occurred significantly, infections of the urinary tract and pneumonia tendentiously more often in PD patients. Postoperative stay and length of treatment were significantly longer in patients with PD. These patients also tended to stay longer preoperatively and remained longer in intensive care. PD patients required on-ward rehabilitation significantly more often. Concomitant Parkinson's disease is a significant factor of perioperative morbidity in trauma patients. Perioperative morbidity in PD patients may be influenced by early diagnostic and therapeutic measures. ","1724":"Long-term results after resection of comminuted fractures of the radial head (Mason III and IV) may lead to valgus elbow instability, radius proximalisation and rotatory instability. Radial head replacement has been used to prevent and treat these complications. The aim of this study was to define the value of the bipolar radial head prosthesis of Judet for treating comminuted fractures of the radial head. Over a 5-year period, 14 radial head prosthesis were implanted in 12 patients. Retrospectively, we studied the clinical and radiological results. Eleven patients with thirteen implants were analysed at a mean follow-up of 33.4 +\/- 20.4 months. In all patients, the elbow was stable. Subjectively, we found good and excellent results with one exception. Compared to the pre-trauma status, the subjective rate was 78 +\/- 12 %. According to the score of Radin and Riseborough, five of the results were found to be good and eight to be fair. According to the Broberg and Morrey score, one result was found to be very good, seven to be good and five to be fair. The mean DASH score was 10.2 +\/- 10.1 points. Two temporary nerve lesions were observed. In comminuted fractures of the radial head (Mason III and IV), bipolar radial head replacement with the Judet prosthesis leads subjectively to very good and good and functionally to good and fair results on the medium-term view. Joint stability is achieved and secondary complications like valgus elbow deformity and proximal radial migration are prevented. Patients must be informed about the possibility of temporary nerve lesions, heterotopic ossification causing limitation of motion and the lack of long-term results. ","1725":"The displacement of the rotation centre of the humeral head in relation to the axis of the shaft varies strongly between individuals. The Affinis shoulder endoprosthesis has a double excentric adjustment possibility that permits us to adapt the head to the medial and dorsal offset. So far, such examinations have taken place exclusively on anatomic preparations. This raises the question of whether the need for such a prosthetic system can be derived from the anatomic variation of the pivot points. In 49 patients with an implanted Affinis shoulder prostheses, we calculated the individual rotation centres of the head from the position of the relocatable prosthetic cone and the excentric position of the head. In addition, we used the Constant score to record the clinical function. In the examined case material, we needed the entire setting range of 12 mm mediolateral and 6 mm dorsoventral of the prosthesis, as it presented a great variation of the rotational centres of the head. The majority of the head centres were displaced in a posterior-lateral direction. The examination showed that none of the found anatomic head centres could have been reconstructed exactly with a conventional prosthesis. Prostheses with a single excentricity would allow correct adjustment in only 9 cases, as the adjustable rotational centres of the head are situated in an orbit, which limits the setting possibilities. In 20 of the 49 patients humeral head prosthesis were implanted in cases of primary osteoarthritis. The Constant score of this group improved from 18 points preoperatively to 76 points after 24.1 months in the mean. The high variation of the head centres indicates the necessity of a freely adjustable system, such as in a double excentric bearing. This is a way that permits an optimal reconstruction of the anatomic conditions. Therefore all technical chances for bony balancing should be used to adapt the prosthesis to the bone and not the bone to the prosthesis. ","1726":"Glenohumeral arthritis with a massive rotator cuff tear is a devastating condition that seriously compromises the comfort and function of the shoulder. Cuff tear arthropathy presents a unique surgical challenge and many arthroplasty options were used for its treatment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results of Copeland cementless surface replacement arthroplasty (CSRA) applied in patients with cuff tear arthropathy and intact subscapularis function. The study was conducted on twenty-five shoulders in twenty-five patients with cuff tear arthropathy with the subscapularis tendon still intact. The patients were prospectively followed-up clinically and radiologically for a mean of 26 months (range: 15 - 38 months). There were 16 female and 9 male patients. The mean age was 69.04 years (range: 53 - 83 years). The mean operative time was 38 minutes (range: 28 - 56 minutes). The clinical assessment was performed with the Constant score. The Constant score significantly improved from a mean of 14.04 points preoperatively to 53.17 points postoperatively. Of the patients, 88 % considered the shoulder to be much better or better as a result of the operation. Radiologically, the humeral offset, the lateral glenohumeral offset (coracoid base to the greater tuberosity), height of centre of instant rotation and the acromiohumeral distance were significantly increased. No intra- or postoperative complications were encountered. Our early results with the use of Copeland surface replacement in selected cases with cuff tear arthropathy are encouraging. The patients showed significant clinical (pain and range of motion) and radiological improvements. Moreover, if the surface replacement were to fail for any reason, it can be revised to a reverse prosthesis type as there is no lack of bone stock. ","1727":"Minimising the soft tissue trauma and early rehabilitation are among the major aims using the MIS technique in joint replacement. The aim of this prospective randomised study is to compare the results after TKA using an MIS approach versus a standard approach. We compared 30 TKA using a mini-midvastus approach (MIS group) with 30 conventionelly performed TKA using a midvastus approach (control group). In all cases the same implants (NexGen LPS) were used. The Knee Society score (KSS), an activity score, the visual analogue scale, myoglobin and creatinine kinase as well as the blood loss were measured up to 12 weeks postoperatively. Implant positioning was evaluated using the Knee Society Roentgenographic evaluation and scoring system. Advantages of the MIS group were measured in KSS and activity score up to 12 weeks postoperatively. The increase of myoglobin and creatinine kinase was lower in the MIS group up to 24 hours or 72 hours, respectively. No differences were found comparing the implant positioning and blood loss. The MIS technique in TKA with minimisation of the soft tissue trauma leads to better clinical and functional results in the early postoperative time and does not modify the implant positioning. ","1728":"The present work aimed at evaluating the radiological mid-term results of femoral components of different materials in an identically designed total knee system. 31 knees with zirconium femoral components and 32 standard femoral components were evaluated about 4 years following surgery using the Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System of the Knee Society. In both groups, the implant position was correct. There was a statistically significant higher rate of radiolucent lines in zones 1 and 4 at the tibia site in the zirconium group. Our clinical results disagree with the results of biomechanical studies of the same type of prosthesis. However, there are some findings from animal studies showing that zirconium ions may inhibit the mineralisation of osteoid, which could be an explanation for the higher rate of radiolucent lines seen in the present study. ","1729":"For threaded cups, cup diameter, the shape of the threads and the shape of the cup have a major influence on the screw-in performance. The designs of standard implants vary greatly, making it difficult to carry out comparative studies to provide clear-cut results on the effect of individual parameters on the insertion process. 15 different prototype cups were manufactured for this study. Three sizes, three shapes and five thread designs were tested using artificial bone. Screw-in performance was measured with the slope of insertion torque before and after reaching the seating point, the torque at the seating point, the insertion angle and the change of slopes at the seating point. Modified trapezoid threads have the lowest insertion resistance and the clearest seating point as well as the most distinct change of slope at the seating point. Flat threads show lower insertion resistance and more increased slopes at the seating point than sharp threads. The slope of insertion torque before and at the seating point is higher for sharp threads in comparison to the other threads, the change of slop is however low. Larger cups show a higher insertion resistance. Screw-in performance is decisively influenced by the design of the threads. Modified trapezoid threads are the easiest to insert with excellent manual control, thus reducing the risk of intra-operative overturning. Flat threads also have a low screw-in resistance. Sharp threads have an unsatisfactory screw-in performance because the seating point cannot be \"felt\". ","1730":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate peri- and postoperative complications and the clinical\/radiological results after hip resurfacing with the ASR prosthesis in patients with osteoarthritis. A prospective cohort study was performed including all patients who received a hip resurfacing (ASR prosthesis, DePuy, Motech, Warsaw, IN, USA) because of osteoarthritis between 1\/2005 and 7\/2006. 115 prostheses were performed in 110 patients (58 female, 52 male). In all patients a dorsal approach was used. The mean age was 57.82 years (range: 34 to 72 years) and the mean follow-up was after 12.5 months (range: 6 to 23 months). At the time of follow-up an X-ray (a. p. and axial) of the operated hip was performed in addition to the to standard clinical examination. To measure the functional outcome the Harris hip score was used. We observed postoperative complications in 18 patients. Three non-trauma-related femoral neck fractures were seen after a mean of 58 days (range: 41 to 70 days). One trauma-related femoral neck fracture was found after 7 months. Neural complications were found in two patients. In 8 patients a revision of the acetabular component was necessary. 3 dislocations could be managed without further revision. One revision was necessary because of a persisting seroma without infection. No infections or thromboembolic complications were seen. The mean Harris hip score developed from preoperative 59 points (range: 50 to 65 points) to postoperative 96 points (range: 85 to 100 points). Excellent early postoperative results can be reached by hip resurfacing. Special attention is necessary performing the correct positioning of the femoral and acetabular components. If notching is seen intraoperatively the operation should be switched and a large head prothesis should be implanted. Long-term results are still lacking. ","1731":"The working conditions for medical staff in German hospitals with emergency units are characterised by stress peaks. In such moments mistakes are more likely to be made. Communication problems and misunderstandings caused by these settings are the most frequent causes for blunders, errors and mistakes. The aim is to show an easy way to reduce the incidence of these problems. Within this prospectively randomised trial we compare the ability of 50 physicians to remember standardised information on patient's data passed on to them in a briefing. Half of the subjects used the so called 5-finger method as an easy means of memorising standardised information. The other 25 physicians memorised the patient's data in the usual way. In order to assess the information recalled by the subjects, all of them were asked to answer 15 questions on the data they had been given an hour earlier. The subjects who used the 5-finger method were able to give on average 9.88 (of 15) correct answers and thus remembered significantly (p = 0.031) more information than the members of the control group. Communication errors caused by homophony, ambiguity, anticipation and mental models are can be avoided in well-structured communication situations. The rules for such a type of communication can easily be learned and applied. Standardised communication has already proved to reduce the error rates in aviation. We conclude that it can be helpful to introduce standardised communication rules such as the 5-finger method in medical communication.

The tests included chemical analyses, handling properties and testing according to the ISO standard for PMMA bone cements. The results obtained indicate clearly that the copolymers used in Refobacin Bone Cement R and SmartSet GHV differ from those used in the Palacos cements. There were also significant differences in viscosity behaviour and waiting time (p &lt; 0.01 for Palacos cements versus Refobacin Bone Cement R) as an expression of different handling properties. The hardening times under ISO 5833 conditions also differed significantly (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05 for Palacos cements compared with Refobacin Bone Cement R and p &lt; 0.01 for Refobacin Bone Cement R compared with SmartSet GHV). In view of these differences in material properties, the clinical data from long-term use of the bone cements Refobacin Palacos R and Palacos R + G cannot be extrapolated to the newly developed PMMA cements Refobacin Bone Cement R and Smart GHV. Before broad clinical use of these cements, prospective clinical studies using RSA or DEXA and, as a second step, statistically powerful prospective comparative studies should be performed. Until these data are available, patients in whom Refobacin Bone Cement R and SmartSet GHV are used should be informed that the material employed deviates from the standard procedures for cemented joint replacement in the Scandinavian arthroplasty registers and that the long-term consequences cannot, in the final instance, be foreseen. This is essential in order to avoid later malpractice claims on the grounds of inadequate information. ","1740":"The mechanical properties of acrylic bone cements are an important factor in determining an efficient load transmission between prosthesis and bone to guarantee the long-term stability in cemented hip arthroplasty. Palacos and Refobacin Palacos specimens from 21 aseptically loosened femoral compoments of cemented hip arthroplasties manufactured by the first to third generation cementing technique have been mechanically tested in a standardised four-point bending test (ISO 5833). In vitro manufactured Palacos and Refobacin Palacos specimens served as a control group. The fatigue fracture surfaces were morphologically analysed with light microscopy. Under in vitro conditions manufactured specimens had higher values of bending strength, with the exception of blood contaminated ones, compared to ex vivo specimens. Ex vivo specimens of the second and third generation cementing technique had higher values than specimens of the first generation. Acrylic bone cements are subjected to a multifactorial material fatigue in vivo. Here, the art and quality of cementing technique is of eminent importance in determining the long-term stability of cemented hip arthroplasty.

The purpose of the current study was to analyse the kinetics of antibiotic release and antimicrobial effects of the gentamicin- and clindamycin-loaded bone cement Versabond. Test cylinders of bone cements, containing gentamicin and clindamycin in different concentrations, were investigated in vitro with regards to the kinetics of antibiotic release by applying static and continuous elution methods. Antimicrobial effects of antibiotic-loaded bone cement were tested in an infection model with different strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and live\/dead dye plus fluorescence microscopy. For the surface analysis of antibiotic-loaded test cylinders contaminated with Staphylococcus epidermidis, scanning electron microscopy was used. The measurement of static and continuous elution revealed initially higher rates of gentamicin release in comparison with clindamycin. The gentamicin amount decreased within 24 h, whereas clindamycin-loaded test cylinders showed a prolonged release. After 24 h exclusive avital bacteria on antibiotic-loaded cement cylinders were seen, after 72 h on gentamicin-loaded cement bacterial growth was again detected. Application of antibiotics in bone cement revealed an inhomogeneous surface of the bone cement cylinder. On application of clindamycin in bone cement the features of increased antibiotic uptake and antimicrobial effect compared with gentamicin-loaded bone cement are observed. ","1742":"Little has been known until now about biomechanical intra-articular changes in the condition of adjacent joints following subtalar arthrodeses. We tested 5 cadaver specimens in a dynamic axially loaded foot model under computer-regulated load application on 9 extrinsic tendons of the foot regarding changes in load under native conditions and following an anatomically fixed subtalar arthrodesis. We saw an averaged native force transmission in the talonavicular joint of 87 N, increasing post-arthrodesis to 92 N. In the calcaneocuboid joint we measured an increase from 72 N to 74 N. For peak pressure, the increase was from native 3152 kPa to 3286 kPa in the talonavicular joint and in the calcaneocuboid joint we recorded a reduction from 3282 kPa to 3277 kPa. The effects are not striking from a statistical viewpoint. However, we observed a reduction in force from native 103 N to 90 N and in peak pressure from 4778 kPa to 4261 kPa in the ankle. When the ankle was divided into discrete zones in the sagittal and frontal planes there was no evidence of load displacement. Our measurements show that anatomically fixed arthrodeses of the talocalcanear joint do not lead to any striking increase in loads on adjacent joints. Any adjacent segment degeneration following subtalar arthrodeses may be the result of changes in joint kinematics or non-anatomically reconstructed hindfoot positions. ","1743":"Hallux valgus combined with flat foot is one of the most common foot deformities affecting patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The Lapidus procedure is indicated when the hallux valgus angle is more than 15 degrees or the first tarsometatarsal joint is hypermobile. We aimed to evaluate the results of the Lapidus procedure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. We performed the Lapidus procedure in 31 patients between 2002 and 2005. In ten patients we performed a bilateral procedure and in ten patients we performed a single Lapidus procedure. In 27 cases we combined the procedure with a resection of the second-fifth metatarsal heads (Hoffmann procedure), in four cases with a Weil osteotomy of the second-fifth metatarsal necks. We performed an excision of the articular surface of the first metatarsal head (Mayo) in 10 patients, a Keller resection procedure in 9 patients, an arthrodesis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint in 3 patients, and an Akin wedge osteotomy of the proximal phalanx of the thumb in 3 patients. Arthrodesis was fixed by two K-wires in 5 cases, by 2 compression screws in 7 cases, and in thirty-four cases we used memory staples. We evaluated the outcomes of forty-one procedures in thirty-one patients (24 female, 7 male). The averge age at surgery was 54.3 years. Thirty-two feet were without pain after the procedures, in five cases the patients felt moderate pain in the dorsal part of the foot and in four cases the patients felt pain in the transverse arch of foot. Complications included delayed primary wound closure in five cases, in one case we performed a revision procedure for a deep infection. Delayed hallux valgus developed in 5 cases. The mean first intermetatarsal angle before surgery was 19.5 degrees (range 12 - 27 degrees) and improved to 8 degrees after surgery. In 3 cases we found an unsatisfactory intermetatarsal angle correction with partial renewal of the hallux valgus.

","1744":"The aim of this study is to provide an analysis of the literature and our own experience in the conservative treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. Although lumbar spinal stenosis is treated mostly non-operatively there are only a few reports in the literature about the results of conservative treatment. All the recent articles about surgical procedures for LSS mention ineffective preoperative treatment without explaining it. So far there have been no randomised clinical trials to obtain evidence regarding the clinical outcome of non-surgical management. We provide an actual overview about the conservative treatment of LSS referring only to retrospective studies, guidelines and expert opinions. Solely the treatment of LSS with epidural steroids, which is recommended by most of the authors, has been evaluated by several randomised controlled studies with a high level of evidence. As far as we can summarise at present, a multidisciplinary conservative treatment programme is most effective not only for discogenic low-back pain but also for LSS with a concentration on physiotherapy, behavioural therapy, epidural injections and a special back training which is presented in this paper. Patients with LSS should receive a trial of the proposed conservative, aggressive treatment before surgery is considered.

After posterolateral instrumentation of 3 segments of a sheep spine the intervertebral space was filled with cancellous bone, osteoblasts or left empty after nucleotomy and elimination of cartilage. Radiological and histological analyses proved a significant osseous reaction in segments treated with cancellous bone or osteoblasts in contrast to the control segment. This outcome provides evidence of spondylodeses by spinal instrumentation in combination with osteoblasts in a sheep model. The results suggest a possible application of autologous osteoblasts as an osteoinductor after percutaneous nucleotomy in spinal fusion. The possible application in a human model should be examined. ","1746":null,"1747":"Androgens have proliferative effects on osteoblasts and increase fracture healing by systemic and local stimulation of bone formation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the systemic stimulation by androgens leads to increased bone-defect healing. 1.5-mm trepanation defects were created in the femoral diaphysis of 30 Sprague-Dawley rats. 10 animals were used as untreated controls and 10 animals per group were treated by intramuscular injection of 1 or 10 mg dihydrotestosterone two days prior to surgery. After 14 days the samples were explanted and examined by macroscopy, histology and histomorphometry. All animals were included into the study and were analysed. Clinical observation showed no complications. Macroscopic examination and histology showed no significant differences. All defects were filled with trabecular bone in direct contact to the surrounding bone. Histomorphometry showed a significantly decreased bone content in the controls in comparison to both therapy groups, while the therapy groups showed no significant differences between each other. The stimulation of healing of bone defects with androgens leads to a significantly higher bone content inside the defects. In clinical application, androgens may be a possibility to increase bone formation, especially in elderly patients. Furthermore, it may be possible to shorten postoperative rehabilitation because of the effects of androgens on muscles. ","1748":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate a strategy for the management of accompanying osteoporosis after inpatient treatment of fragility fractures. A prospective group of patients that was treated for acute fragility fractures between 9\/05 and 2\/06 was informed about a concomitant osteoporosis according to the national guidelines. Standardised letters with instructions for diagnostics and therapy for osteoporosis were given to patients, members of the family and outpatient care, rehab-clinic and GPs. Between 9\/04 and 2\/05 a retrospective review of a control group of patients with acute fragility fractures was conducted. This group was not informed about a concomitant osteoporosis. A telephone survey of all patients for analysis of the management of osteoporosis was conducted one year after clinical treatment. Both groups were comparable according to numbers of patients, age, distribution between the sexes and fracture localisation. The prospective group consisted of 144 patients. 29.9 % of these patients had already sustained a fragility fracture before treatment of the current fracture. In 45.8 % (32.6 % DEXA scans, 11.8 % Q CT, 1.4 % ultrasound) of the patients diagnostics were performed. A diagnosis of osteoporosis was documented in 42.4 % of the patients, and 57.1 % of the patients received specific treatments according to the guidelines. In the control group, 28.9 % of the patients had already sustained a fragility fracture before treatment of the current fracture. In 91.1 % of the patients no diagnostics for concomitant osteoporosis after clinical treatment for the acute fracture were performed within one year after fracture treatment. By use of a multifaceted osteoporosis intervention, more patients received diagnostics and therapy according to the guidelines of osteoporosis after fragility fractures. Without appropriate information, more than 60 % of the high-risk-patients did not receive adequate osteoporosis management. Future research should address barriers to appropriate osteoporosis management. Because of the chronic character of the disease and the necessity of a long-term therapy, continuous medical care and information of patients with osteoporosis is necessary to prevent subsequent fractures.

The routine use of CT scans is, however, still discussed controversially, especially with regard to its use in children. This is mainly due to the reportedly higher level of exposure to radiation of CT scans as compared to plain radiographs. The aim of the present study was to compare the dose of exposure to radiation of a whole body CT scan to that of a plain radiograph protocol in an animal model for severely injured children. We chose 3 female pigs of different weights to serve as a model for children at different ages. 4 film radiation dosimeters (positioned on the eye, under the breast, paravertebrally on the thoracic spine and in the small pelvis, respectively) were implanted into every pig for each examination. Plain radiographs of the chest and the pelvis in one plane and of the skull and the complete spine in two planes were performed. The CT scan included skull, cervical spine and the whole body from the thorax to pelvis. The radiation dose of CT scans was 7 times higher as compared to the X-ray protocol, but the performance of CT scans was faster (8 vs. 18 min). The radiation dose of the whole body CT scan was at about 15 mSv. Based on our data and a review of the literature we will use whole body spiral CT scans as the preferred method in the primary radiological imaging of severely injured patients. In our opinion, the evident benefit of a reduced time of imaging in combination with superior image information outweighs the higher level of exposure to radiation.

The osteochondral defects were reconstructed simultaneously with autologous monocortical cancellous bone cylinders or chips from cancellous bone and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation (CaReS). Data were analysed in accordance with the ICRS criteria and the Brittberg score. Patients were followed up to 36 months after the operation. The average age of the patients was 34.9 (16 - 47) years at the time of surgery. The size of the defect was 8.1 (3.8 - 13.5) cm(2). The subjective and objective IKDC scores, the Brittberg and the ICRS function score were statistically significantly improved during the observation time. In one patient the transplantation failed and another patient was not available for the follow-up at 36 months.

Due to the high clinical and statistical heterogeneity between studies a descriptive analysis has been done. 6 randomised controlled studies have assessed the effectiveness of ACT compared with microfrature or mosaic plasty. 4 studies report on no or only insignificant differences - one recently presented 5-year results - whereas 2 studies observed better results with ACT. Long-term results are good throughout, but the high quality of the regenerative tissue is a clear advantage of ACT. Cost-effectiveness models support ACT for the longevity of its results and thus relatively lower costs in the long-term. ACT is an expensive and complex procedure. In direct comparison with alternative treatments ACT produces results at least as good in the short-term, and most likely better in the long-term due to the high quality repair tissue. Thus higher initial costs are compensated for with time. ","1753":"The demand to routinely apply evidence-based methods in orthopedic surgery increases steadily.

The current study assessed whether the clinical and radiological outcome was equal to that of established bilateral surgical treatments. We also examined whether this approach leads to an adequate motor function improvement of the affected children. In 41 children with cerebral palsy and bilateral hip dislocation, a prospective study assessed the hip abduction, migration percentage (MP) and the motor function (Rancho los Amigos scale). Depending on the pretherapeutic status, all patients were grouped into 3 abduction and 3 MP groups. The less affected hip was treated with a hip abduction splint whereas the more affected hip of the same child was simultaneously treated with a subcutaneous adductor tenotomy.

After 4 years, 34% had undergone a motor function improvement. In 7% a motor function deterioration was observed. Posttherapeutically, the conservatively treated hips showed abduction and MP values that were comparable to those of surgically treated hip joints. In cerebral palsy children with bilateral hip dislocation, the conservative treatment of the less affected hip is suitable to achieve clinical and radiological results that are equal to the surgical treatment of the more affected hip. The concept of a combined conservative and surgical treatment of bilateral hip dislocation leads to an adequate motor function improvement that is comparable to established bilateral treatments. ","1766":"A possible complication in regard to osteosynthetic treatment of a lower radius fracture with a locking plate is perforation of the articular surface by screws or a malpositioned ulnar fragment. In order to create good conditions for a homogeneous, reproducible X-ray picture for post-operative imaging control, an appliance for the production of standardised X-ray views has been devised. The X-ray device was constructed at an angle of 20 degrees to the camera. The arm was positioned on the appliance in the side beam path, in shoulder adduction as well as in the dp-beam in 90 degrees abduction of the shoulder. Through standardisation of the X-ray technique the appliance it is able to supply comparable and reproducible X-ray images. In practice, the representation of both the joint gap and the bolt in the resulting image could be improved. Better and comparable picture series can be created by standardisation of the imaging technique using this X-ray device. ","1767":"The object of this study was to provide evidence for a time-reduced diagnostic space in multiple trauma patients by use of a digital X-ray system in the emergency suite. The same algorithm was used in the first attention of 66 severely injured patients. For 21 patients from October 2000 to March 2001 (group 1) conventional X-rays (thorax, pelvis, spine and extremities) were performed in the analogue way, for 45 patients from April to December 2001 (group 2) the new digital system (Philips Optimum and Philips PCR AC 500) was used. The two groups were similar concerning age, sex and injury severity. The time-space from the patient's delivery in the emergency suite to the handing over in the operation theatre or intensive care unit was significantly lower in group 2 (87 +\/- 33 min, p &lt; 0.001) than in group 1 (121 +\/- 49 min). Digital imaging with conventional X-rays in the first attention of multiple trauma patients reduces the diagnostic time by more than half an hour, when applying the same diagnostic algorithm. ","1768":"Limb-preserving surgery is the most common therapeutic approach in cases of malignant bone tumours near the knee joint. Although good functional results have been reported for tumours located in the distal femur, tumours in the proximal tibia have been investigated less frequently. The objective of the current study was to compare the kinematic gait patterns in patients with tumours in the femur vs. the tibia. 11 patients with an arthroplasty after a primary malignant bone tumour were included (5 femur, 6 tibia). Their speed-specific kinematic gait patterns were quantified. 10 healthy volunteers and 6 patients with normal knee arthroplasty served as a reference group. The tibia patients walked significantly more slowly than the femur patients. They showed a similar overall gait pattern predominantly characterised by a hyperextended knee during stance. The differences in walking speed between the two groups of tumour patients did not transfer to different gait patterns. Limb-preserving surgery is thus a valuable therapeutic option also for patients with primary tumours in the tibia. ","1769":"A case report of a metastatic caused loosening of a total hip arthroplasty one year after primary implantation is presented. A primary cancer was unknown at surgery. Due to suspected low-grade infection, a revision surgery was performed and the diagnosis of a metastatically caused loosening could be made. A bronchial carcinoma was identified as primary cancer. In spite of the rare incidence of the described metastatic loosening, the significance of a differential diagnostic strategy and the importance of a histological examination in revision surgery is depicted.","1770":"Limb salvage procedures in cases of bone tumours of the pelvis are established. In this retrospective study the clinical results after implantation of megaprostheses of the pelvis are reported. Between November 1994 and September 2004 an endoprosthetic replacement of the pelvis was performed in 24 consecutive patients, fourteen females and ten males. The mean age was 49.3 years (range: 17-64 years). In ten cases a complete and in fourteen an incomplete internal hemipelvectomy was done. Thirteen patients presented with a primary bone tumour and eleven with a bone metastasis. The tumour volume ranged between 50 and 1315 ml (median: 352 ml). The mean follow-up was 98 months. In 23 of the 24 patients an R0 resection was achieved. Local recurrences were observed in five patients (20.8%). Deep infections developed in ten patients (41.7%) postoperatively. In two of these ten patients a secondary external hemipelvectomy was necessary. Eight patients (33.3%) developed a paralysis of the femoral and\/or sciatic nerve, and a loosening of the endoprosthesis was observed in four cases (16.7%). Two patients died within 30 days postoperatively (pulmonary embolism, dissection of the abdominal aorta). Eight of the 24 patients are still alive, two of them after secondary hemipelvectomy and another after removal of the endoprosthesis due to infection. The functional results of the five surviving patients with an endoprosthesis, according to the MSTS scoring system, are good in two and poor in three patients. Internal hemipelvectomy and reconstruction of the pelvic girdle with endoprostheses is associated with a high rate of complications. Each single case should be critically evaluated and alternative procedures should be considered. ","1771":"The object of this study was to identify those factors with a direct influence on the treatment outcome of anterior cervical fusion. The clinical relevance of intervertebral cage subsidence in the course of disease is discussed. In a prospective clinical study we followed up 368 patients with degenerative disease of the cervical spine one year after anterior fusion and cage implantation. We found a statistically significant association between a good outcome and young adults with monosegmental fusion of the lower cervical spine. Early treatment of moderate degenerative cervical disc diseases using an intervertebral cage and anterior fusion leads to a good outcome. Subsidence of the cage does not correlate with a poor outcome. ","1772":"This study investigated the fusion properties of a new intervertebral spacer that is directly fixed to the adjacent vertebrae by screws. The new spacer was compared with an identical spacer without direct fixation but with an additional plate and with an autologous bone graft. A single-level, cervical fusion was performed on 18 mature Merino sheep. Three treatment groups of six sheep each were used. Group A used an autogenous bone graft and an additional anterior plate. Group B used a titanium solid spacer with a titanium plasma-sprayed (TPS) surface and an additional anterior plate. Group C used a similar spacer as group B that was directly fixed with the adjacent vertebrae with 4 screws. The standing period was 12 weeks. The substrates were evaluated radiographically and histologically. Dislocation of the spacer or the bone graft occurred in one of the 6 cases in each group A and B, while 5 of the 6 spacers were dislocated in group C. Successful fusion was found in 4 of the 6 cases in groups A and C and in 5 of the 6 cases in group B. The histomorphometry revealed a direct bone apposition at the interface of the bone graft (group A) at 11.6% of the surface. The surfaces of the spacers were osseointegrated in 1.1% in group B and 1.0% in group C. As the dislocation rate shows, the fixation of the new spacer (group C) seems to be less stable than the fixation of the bone graft or the spacer with the additional plate. Although the intervertebral fusion is comparable for all groups, the extent of the osseointegration is much higher for the bone graft than for the spacers. In conclusion, the bone graft may offer a much better long-term stability than do the spacers. ","1773":"The intention of this retrospective analysis with follow-up was to assess results after decompressive or additional stabilising operations in the clinical setting of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis. 74 patients, operated upon from 1995 to 2001, were investigated clinically, radiologically and with questionnaire score 1 to 8 years (mean 2.5) postoperatively. All data were compared and evaluated with the preoperative findings. The results of the group with decompressive operations were compared with those for the group with additional stabilising operations. The patients with stabilising operations showed an improvement of 78.3% on the visual analogue scale and of 76.1% on the Oswestry score. The patients with decompressive operations showed an improvement of 91.7% on the visual analogue scale and of 75.0% on the Oswestry score. The difference between the two groups was not significant. There was a poorer outcome for previously operated patients or patients with a prolonged course of disease. The choice of the operative treatment with regard to spinal stenosis requires a differentiated preoperative diagnostic procedure in accord with the respective living situation and age of the patients. Instability in terms of degenerative spondylolisthesis, lumbar scoliosis as well as intraoperatively recognised or generated instability has to be additionally stabilised with an instrumented fusion in regard to the functional aspect of the stenosis. ","1774":"Ventral stabilisation of thoracolumbar fractures is often done with autogenous iliac crest grafts as an alternative to other filling and stabilisation systems. Today the golden standard for this kind of reconstruction is the minimally invasive thoracoscopic stabilization. Often there was a problem with the determination of the size and the position of the graft, especially on video-assisted minimally invasive stabilisation. The aim of this study was now to develop a new instrument that would be able to minimise this kind of intraoperative problems. For measuring and for checking the exact position of the bone graft the vertebrometer as a new measuring apparatus was developed. With the simple and good handling of the vertebrometer, there is an easy possibility of determine the size and the position of the graft. As this tool is made of metal, it is possible to localise and to check the positioning and the right size of the necessary bone graft during the intraoperative radiological control. This tool may help to improve the prognosis of osseous integration of the implanted material and lower the rate of pseudarthrosis. Furthermore, the handling of the thoracoscopic ventral stabilisation may be somewhat easier and, even for the inexperienced surgeon, there is now an instrument available to fit in the graft with a satisfactory result. ","1775":"The aim of this study was to examine radiological and functional outcome measurements after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with a bone-tendon-bone (BTB) graft. Investigations included assessment of bony integration conditions regarding the use of bioabsorbable cross pins or a lateral screw for femoral graft fixation. A description of radiological parameters in contrast with IKDC findings is also given. After ACL injuries, 45 patients underwent an ACL repair. For tibial tunnel placement the tibial guide was used in full knee extension. A size-specific femoral aimer was placed by using the transtibial technique in the \"over the top\" position and the tunnel was reamed with the acorn reamer to 30 mm depth. In 15 patients the BTB graft was fixed with a titanium blunt nose screw from the lateral aspect. The cross-pin technique with bioabsorbable RIGIDFIX implants was used in 30 patients. All patients underwent a follow-up study 36 month postoperatively. Geometric tests of digitised X-rays were performed. For clinical and functional outcome studies of ACL repairs the IKDC score is widely accepted. The score was modified into numeric parameters for 15 selected groups of the IKDC score. All 15 categories were rated from 1 to 4 points (Category A = 4, B = 3, C = 2, D = 1). Clinical and radiological results were statistically analysed. According to the literature, tunnel placement tibial was physiological in 91% and femoral in 93% of the cases. The femoral tunnel was completely invisible in all patients. No necrosis or pathological findings in former pin holes were seen. In 24 patients the medial compartment space was smaller, but less than 50 % compared to intraoperative X-rays. Even if the mean of tibial tunnel widening was 2.65 mm it was statistically not connected to the results of the IKDC score or X-ray findings of the femoral tunnel. Results in the IKDC groups and categories were seen to be in accord with overall very good and good outcomes. The modified IKDC score showed a mean of 55 points with a range from 46 as lowest (1 patient) and 60 in 4 patients (9%) as highest numeric score. Lateral femoral fixation with screws or bioabsorbable cross-pins shows a biological bony incorporation of a BTB graft. Tibial tunnel widening was seen but without any functional effects. Overall radiological and functional outcomes based on the IKDC score demonstrate results in favour of ACL reconstruction with BTB grafts. Due to the narrowing of the medial compartment space, more radiological outcome studies with a special emphasis on degenerative aspects have to be done. ","1776":"Most surgeons favour a one-stage procedure for ACL revision surgery. Tunnel widening, limited range of motion or existent hardware can make a two-stage procedure necessary. Studies evaluating the results between both procedures are still lacking. Thus, we performed a prospective preliminary study comparing early results after one- and two-stage procedures for ACL revision reconstruction. Between 1\/2005 and 1\/2006 21 patients were operated on for ACL revision. The follow-up period of the 4 women and 16 men was 12 months. One patient was excluded due to a juvenile osteoporosis. Median age was 34 years. All patients had a subjective instability, including 11 patients (55%) with a traumatic rerupture. The indication for a two-stage procedure depended on tunnel widening under consideration of tunnel placement, disturbing existing hardware and extension deficits. Eleven patients received a one-stage procedure while 9 patients were operated in a two-stage process. Seven received autogenous bone grafting. The preoperative tunnel diameter was for one-stage revisions (OS) femoral 7.9 +\/- 1.8 mm and tibial 8.8 +\/- 2.2 mm. For the two-stage (TS) procedure mean femoral tunnel was preoperatively 10.1 +\/- 1.4 mm and tibial 12.1 +\/- 1.4 mm. Femoral tunnel placement after revision (OS\/TS) yielded a mean angle in anteroposterior view of 28.7 degrees \/26.9 degrees and in the sagittal view most tunnels were placed in the dorsal quadrant. Tibial placement was in the sagittal view at 46.1%\/46.9% in the anteroposterior direction and for mediolateral direction in the a. p. view at 44.2%\/44.5%. Results for Lysholm score were 85.7\/83.9 and for IKDC 73.6\/76.4. The anterior tibial translation compared to the healthy side was 1.5 mm\/1.8 mm. In one leg jumping patients obtained a distance of 83 %\/86% of the healthy side and stated their pain on a VAS to be as low as 1.9\/1.4 points. Both groups had similar ranges of motion as well. The success of ACL revision surgery crucially depends on preoperative planning and analysis. No functional or radiological differences could be observed between one- and two-stage procedures. Although the one-stage procedure might be favourable because of faster convalescence and shorter work incapacity, it should not be enforced at the price of an insufficient ACL. ","1777":"The results of 16 patients in growth age (mean age at surgery 13.7 years) with an ACL rupture that was treated with an ACL reconstruction using an periost-patella tendon-periost graft were reviewed. The follow-up was done 12 months postoperatively. All patients were satisfied with the result of the surgery. No leg length differences or abnormalities of the axis were found. 14 patients had already regained their original sports level. In the Tegner score, an average level of 8 was reached and a mean of 97 points in the Lysholm score. In the IKDC score we found a level of A (normal) 9 times and of B (nearly normal) 7 times. These follow-up examinations show that the treatment of an ACL rupture in growth age with a periost-patella tendon-periost graft leads to good results. It is a good alternative to the other methods (e.g., semitendinosus). Today, it can be regarded as a standard that an ACL rupture with open growth plates should be treated operatively. ","1778":"","1779":"","1780":"In a retrospective study, all patients with bilateral cementless Bicontact-Plasmacup total hip arthroplasty in the period May 1993 to June 2000 were followed up clinically and radiologically. Out of 537 hip replacements performed in this period with this combination of implants, 46 patients had bilateral surgery. At follow-up, the Harris Hip Score, the radiological changes between primary implantation and most recent follow-up and the radiologically visible wear of the polyethylene cup component were studied. Thirty-seven patients were followed up. One patient had died and 8 patients could not be contacted. The average age at the first hip replacement was 57.8 years and it was 59.1 years at the second operation. The follow-up period was 6.5 years (min 4.8 and max 9.8 years). The average Harris Hip Score at the time of follow-up was 91 points. Up to the time of follow-up, no stem or cup implant had to be revised. There were no radiological signs of stem loosening. In the case of the cup components, increased linear wear values of more than 0.15 mm\/year were found in 4 THAs that used a 28-mm ceramic-polyethylene bearing. In two of these cases, the cup was in a markedly steep position. One of these cup components was assessed as loosened. The results of this study have confirmed the biomechanical concept of the implant system employed. In contrast to the stem design, the cup design and slide bearing options have been supplemented in the meantime. The ceramic bearing was only available from 1997 and was used less often in this group of patients than would be indicated today for patients of the same age and degree of activity. ","1781":"Navigated implantation of the cup and stem components enables additional parameters to be recorded for joint reconstruction. The results and reproducibility of the implant position were studied in a consecutive series of implantations with femoral transmitter (femoral C-clamp) close to the hip joint. 107 consecutive cementless THA operations with the Orthopilot Software THA 2.0 were analysed. The preoperative planning for cup and stem position were compared with the intraoperative data from the navigation system and the postoperative radiograph. Cup inclination and anteversion, leg lengths and offset changes and the rotation position of the Bicontact stem were investigated. 98 % of the radiological cup positions were within 42.5 +\/- 10 degrees inclination and all cases were within 10 +\/- 10 degrees anteversion. The navigation system recorded 83 % of the relative leg length changes with an accuracy of +\/- 5 mm. 15 % were in a range of +\/- 10 mm. In 77 % of the operations, the Bicontact stem or the Bicontact B osteoprofiler could be positioned in the position measured by the Orthopilot of +\/- 5 degrees of the box osteotome (i.e. medullary cavity opening). In 20 % the deviation was +\/- 10 degrees . 73 % of the arthroplasties gave a relative offset change in a range of +\/- 10 mm. A tendency to medialisation of the hip joint centre was seen in 62 % of the procedures. The mean was a small offset change of only 1.2 mm with a high standard deviation of 17.8 mm. The navigated implantation of stem and cup components with a femoral transmitter close to the joint leads to reproducible results. The distribution of femoral offset and leg length changes corresponds to clinical experience. Analysis of the radiographs does not appear sufficiently accurate for all the recorded parameters. ","1782":"Due to new medical knowledge and legal restrictions, it is increasingly difficult to run a traditional allogenic bone bank so that alternative bone substitutes and methods of processing are being sought worldwide. In a prospective clinical study, the biological efficacy of thermodisinfected and then cryopreserved allogenic bank bone was investigated in 19 acetabular revisions in 18 patients. Simultaneously a newly developed titanium reconstruction ring was used. Any revision was regarded as an end point and the follow-up with radiological and clinical results were recorded. The mean follow-up period was 8.1 (7.9 - 9.8) years. The patients were 73.5 years old (46 - 91) at the time of the revision surgery. One case had a septic course necessitating revision surgery. The other cases showed increasing homogeneity compared to the opposite side and gradual adaptation to the radiological structures found there beforehand. Screw breakage was observed in 3 cases but no implant failure, migration tendency or change in the position of the reconstruction ring or PE-cup. Despite the low case numbers and different baseline situations, it can be concluded that thermodisinfected cancellous bone chips enable similarly good acetabular reconstruction as the routinely tried and tested cryoconserved, non-processed bone bank allograft, which is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain because of altered guidelines and legislation. The newly developed reconstruction ring has proven itself because of the improved range of sizes and the possibility of adjustment to the anatomical circumstances together with its outstanding material characteristics in clinical use. ","1783":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the uncemented primary Bicontact stem (B.Braun-Aesculap, Tuttlingen, Germany) as a possible adequate alternative to other revision systems in revision total hip arthroplasty. Twenty patients aged up to 58 years (34-58 years, mean age 5.7 +\/- 5.8 years) with minor bone defects underwent a revision total hip arthroplasty with the uncemented primary Bicontact stem. The patients were assessed clinically and radiologically at follow-up (follow-up: 8.0 +\/- 3. years). The postoperative Harris Hip Score, Motion and Pain Score improved significantly. There was only one further revision in these patients because of infection and only one case with mild stress shielding. The uncemented primary Bicontact stem seems to be a good alternative to other revision systems in total hip revision arthroplasty in young patients. ","1784":"With the steady growth in the number of hip arthroplasty revision operations, the concept and long-term results of the Bicontact revision stem with distal interlocking for the treatment of extensive femoral bone defects were investigated in this prospective study. The first 156 stem revision operations performed between January 1992 and December 2002 were evaluated. The indication for operation was aseptic loosening in 133, stem fracture in 14, recurrent dislocation in 2 and reimplantation following Girdlestone removal of a septic prosthesis in 7. The cup component was revised at the same time in 74 cases. Higher-grade femoral bone defects were found intraoperatively in 66 %. The average age of the patients was 71.4 (34 - 88) years at operation and 76.9 (44 - 94) years at the last follow-up. The average period until follow-up, re-revision or loss to follow-up was 5.54 (0.1 - 14.9) years. The clinical and radiological follow-up rate (with reference to the total number of patients) was 35 % (55 von 156), and 51 % (55 of 107) with reference to patients still living. The median Harris Hip Score was 63.7 points. In the observation period, 12 stems were exchanged for a cemented standard stem, 5 stems were removed because of infection and 2 stems were revised because of periprosthetic fracture. The calculated survival rate for the stems after 14.9 years was 85.9 %. The 15-year results confirm the biomechanical concept of the Bicontact revision stem with optional distal interlocking for the treatment of extensive bone defects in stem revision surgery. ","1785":"A prospective long-term study of the first 250 cementless Bicontact stems implanted in the BG Trauma Centre, Tuebingen, Germany. All of the patients in this series (treatment period June 1987 to April 1990) who were still contactable were invited for clinical and radiological follow-up. The radiographs were analysed for signs of loosening in the form of Gruen lysis zones, stress shielding, subsidence behaviour, heterotopic ossification and spot welds. The average follow-up period was 17.8 (16.7 - 19.5) years. The overall rate of follow-up was 65 % (162 of 250) and 91 % of patients who were still alive (162 of 179). The average patient age was 56.2 years at the time of operation and 74.0 years at follow-up. The average HHS was 81.6 points. In the course of the first 10 years (up to 03\/1998), a total of 8 stem revisions had to be performed. In the period from 03\/1998 to 01\/2007, 2 cases of loosening requiring revision occurred in the patients still alive at the time of follow-up. The survival rate calculated was thus 95.6 %. These outstanding results provide enduring support for the philosophy of the cementless and bone-preserving fixation principles underlying the Bicontact hip stem with proximal intertrochanteric transmission of forces and high primary rotational stability. ","1786":"Periprosthetic fractures in cases without prior loosening of the stem can be treated with open reduction and internal fixation, but cases with preexisting loosening and\/or bone defects present specific challenges to the surgeon. The keys to the success of intramedullary stabilization of femoral fractures--reconstruction of length, axis and rotation rather than meticulous reduction of the fragments and minimal impact on fragment vascularization by the surgical approach--can be transferred to the treatment of periprosthetic fractures. The Bicontact revision stem can be regarded as a combination of an interlocking nail in its distal part and a proximally coated femoral stem in its proximal part. The transfemoral approach respects the vascularization of the bone, although it is not minimally invasive. Forty-one patients with a mean age of 72.3 years and a periprosthetic fracture were included in this study. According to the Vancouver classification there were 2 type A fractures of the trochanteric region, 14 were B1, 8 were B2 with prior loosening, 13 were B3 with significant bone loss, and 2 fractures were distal to the tip of the prosthesis (type C). In all patients, intramedullary stabilization with a Bicontact revision stem was performed. All but three fractures healed (pathologic fracture with multiple myeloma in one case, impaired bone healing in two cases). In 7 patients, further procedures had to be undertaken (new periprosthetic fracture in 2, loosening and revision with a standard prosthesis in 2, revision with a long stem prosthesis together with bone grafting in 3 cases). At follow-up, after a mean of 4.3 years, all patients were able to walk, and the mean Harris Hip Score was 71.1 points. In conclusion, combined application of the principles of intramedullary nailing and of uncemented total hip replacement by use of the distally interlocked Bicontact revision stem enables successful treatment of periprosthetic femoral fractures. ","1787":"Mid-term result documentation of ceramic-on-ceramic cementless total hip replacement. From November 1998 to December 2005, 356 patients were submitted to 419 total hip arthroplasties of the hip with a cementless, ceramic-ceramic Bicontact\/Plasmacup type of prosthesis. Patients were controlled in a consecutive prospective study. The average age of the patient group is 47.9 years, with an average follow-up of 48 months. There was no case with release of osteolysis of the acetabular or femoral components. There was one ceramic head fracture in an obese patient. Articular wear was negligible and could not be measured radiographically. The ceramic-ceramic Bicontact hip joint replacement presents a low complication rate in young patients, with very low wear. ","1788":"In this prospective randomised study, the influence of different bearing materials on migration and wear was measured and their effect on the function of the artificial joint and the patient outcome was investigated. Mid-term results were recorded so that recommendations can be made on the use of certain bearings, which minimise wear and thus the danger of subsequent aseptic loosening. Sixty-six patients met the inclusion criteria and were willing to take part in the study. These patients were randomised to 2 groups. All of them had total hip arthroplasty with implantation of a cementless Bicontact stem and Plasmacup using a cementless press-fit technique. Thirty-five of these patients were given a ceramic-ceramic bearing and 31 patients a ceramic-polyethylene bearing (gamma sterilised\/nitrogen environment). At the most recent follow-up, they underwent detailed clinical and radiological examination and evaluation by means of the Harris Hip Score, Hannover function questionnaire and single-film X-ray analysis (EBRA). The overall follow-up rate was 65.2 % (43 of 66) and the mean follow-up period was 8.1 (7.1 - 9.2) years. The median Harris Hip Score at the time of follow-up was 90.1 (58.7 - 99.9) points. The average Hannover function score was 87.14 % (63.9 - 100). In 4 of 66 cases (6.1 %) there was a tendency for the Plasmacup to subsidence in the first postoperative months that was slight but detectable by EBRA; however, this stopped subsequently. This primary subsidence was independent of the chosen bearing material. No significant difference in the clinical and radiological parameters was found between the two groups. The very good results with regard to the rate of loosening confirm the press-fit cup fixation concept. The study shows a similar medium-term result for the ceramic-ceramic and ceramic-polyethylene bearing so that use of both bearings can continue to be recommended. Only long-term studies with sufficiently large numbers of patients will be able to show whether significant differences can be detected between the two slide bearings with regard to wear and migration behaviour and so that a recommendation can be given to the surgeon.

Up to date literature shows the advantages of intramedullary pin osteosynthesis, which can be considered as a minimally invasive procedure. In this study we compare the results of pin-osteosynthesis with the non-operative treatment in athletes. This prospective randomised trial compares the results of 68 athletes with an isolated fracture of the middle third of the clavicle. One group (n=35) received intramedullary splints, the other group (n=33) had a figure of eight dressing instead. Post-traumatic pain was significantly (p=0.05) lower in the group that had intramedullary splints. Furthermore, the postoperative mobility of the injured area was significantly better (p=0.05).

The intramedullary titanium pin osteosynthesis is a promising alternative with better results. Up to date literature and our own results prove the advantages of this minimally invasive osteosynthesis. This procedure allows sports activities to be resumed soon after the operation.

As a part of a clinical prospective pilot study, synovial fluid of 19 patients was examined before, as well as 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after matrix-based ACI. A synovial fluid analysis was performed and markers of bone and cartilage metabolism were evaluated. Molecular markers routinely examined included MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, TIMP, hCOMP, PICP und MIA. The levels were referenced to the total protein concentration of the synovial fluid and compared with clinical parameters (IKDC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With the exception of MMP3 all markers showed a drop of the concentration below preoperative levels at 6 weeks. All marker levels returned to below the preoperative concentration at 26 as well as 52 weeks after surgery. The MIA, MMP-3, PICP, hCOMP and TIMP levels showed significant changes over the period of 52 weeks (p&lt;0.01). Statistically significant correlations between the marker levels and the clinical scores could only be observed at several times of assessment. Under consideration of missing correlations to clinical parameters (IKDC\/MRI) non-specific osteochondral marker proteins of the synovial fluid cannot be used without further scrutiny to document changes in cartilage and osseous metabolism following matrix-supported ACI over the time of 52 weeks objectively. The drop of the concentrations below preoperative levels at 6 weeks can possibly be explained by the reduced traumatization of the joint with the CaRes procedure compared to the classic ACI. Specific markers for cartilage metabolism should be defined to permit a direct and objective comparison of the various conservative and operative methods presently available for the treatment of chondral lesions of the knee joint. ","1799":"Ruptures of the patellar tendon are less often observed compared to those of the Achilles or quadriceps tendon. A bilateral rupture is a rarity. Steroid medications or a variety of systemic diseases are associated with spontaneous tendon ruptures. Less often traumatic rupture is the result of severe overloading of the extensor mechanism of the knee. We report on a 60-year-old female without an obvious trauma, systemic disease or medication who suffered a spontaneous bilateral patellar tendon rupture.","1800":"The purposes of this study were to identify adaptational phenomena in running and walking characteristics as well as in muscle strength after an ACL injury and graft-type related ACL treatment in order to determine the effect of the different treatments on the regeneration of muscle capacity and functional motor skills for a given task. The investigation was conducted on 11 patients with patella reconstructions (PT: patella tendon), 12 patients with semitendinosus reconstruction (ST: semitendinosus tendon) and 10 patients without reconstruction. Besides a clinical examination, the subject's walking (1 m\/s) and running (2.5 m\/s) characteristics were recorded by 2 cameras operating at 50 Hz. During the same test session, we determined the force potential of the muscles surrounding the hip, knee and ankle joints during isokinetic contractions. The comparison between injured and non-injured limbs revealed significant changes (p&lt;0.05) only for the injured limb. For both types of reconstruction treatment the injured limb showed a significantly lower maximal knee extension joint moment as well as a lower angular displacement of the knee joint during the stance phase while walking and running (p&lt;0.05). Furthermore, patients with PT reconstruction showed lower maximal knee flexion and hip flexion joint moments, and a lower angular displacement of the knee joint in flexion during the stance phase while running (p&lt;0.05). The ratios of the maximal isokinetic knee extension moments between the injured and non injured limbs were lower for the reconstruction treatment compared to the treatment without reconstruction and further lower for the PT reconstructed compared to the ST reconstructed patients (p&lt;0.05). The findings of the present study indicate that, using a similar regeneration programme, the muscle capacities and functional motor skills show faster regeneration processes for patients without reconstruction compared to a reconstruction treatment after an ACL injury. Concerning the reconstruction treatment, PT reconstructions seem to affect the degeneration process of the muscle capacities of the treated limb more than ST reconstructions. ","1801":"Total hip arthroplasty within the field of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is discussed controversially in the current literature. Potential advantages of MIS should be minimised soft-tissue trauma and thereby less operative loss of blood as well as postoperative pain, resulting in a faster rehabilitation with reduced hospital stay. In this article the different minimally invasive approaches to the hip joint for total hip arthroplasty, including anterior, anterolateral, lateral, posterolateral and medial approaches, are reviewed. Potential advantages and disadvantages as well as published results are discussed against the background of evidence-based medicine. The results available so far on minimally invasive approaches for total hip arthroplasty are almost exclusively extracted from retrospective studies and case series. However, the results of randomised controlled studies in an appreciable number of patients are still lacking. Minimally invasive approaches to the hip joint have opened a new era in total hip arthroplasty. The current literature does not allow a final judgment about the advantages of MIS in total hip replacement. So far, increasing complications of MIS are reported in the current literature. Until evidence-based data are available, it is strongly recommended that these techniques should only be applied by experienced surgeons. ","1802":"Soft-tissue management is essential for the outcome in total knee arthroplasty. In combination with osseous resections and component positioning, correction of the underlying ligamentous dysbalance should yield a stable joint throughout the flexion arc. Different \"philosophies\" with regard to technique, timing and tactics in ligament balancing are described. So far, surgeons have not been provided with standardised devices that allow the objective measurement of this complex issue. Moreover, knowledge concerning the \"ideal\" soft-tissue stability following knee arthroplasty is still sparse. As part of the scientific project \"OrthoMIT\" (minimal invasive orthopaedic therapy) an approach to combine conventional soft-tissue management with navigation and force-sensing devices should be realized technically. The aim is to develop an instrument for the objective measurement of soft-tissue management in scientific and clinical applications.","1803":"\"OrthoMIT--minimal invasive orthopaedic therapy\" is a project to develop an integrated platform for less invasive operative procedures in hip, knee and spine surgery, supported by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). Twenty-seven industrial and clinical partners under the management of the Orthopaedic Department of the University Hospital Aachen (Prof. Dr. F. U. Niethard) intend to develop in 10 subprojects innovative aspects and modules of the \"OrthoMIT\" system. Within the project and amongst other procedures, joint-preserving correction osteotomies have been analysed to develop planning and navigation tools on the basis of improved and less invasive surgery. Therefore, the reproducibility and validity of the conventional methods were investigated and compared with the technical possibilities in computer-guided planning and navigated surgery for correction osteotomies of the upper extremities. Clinical needs, necessary innovative aspects and modules were defined out of these consolidated findings and passed on to the industrial partners of the \"OrthoMIT\" project to develop innovative techniques in the field of planning and navigation. The present article reports in a concise way about the essentials of the available current techniques in correction osteotomies of the upper extremities with the main focus being placed on navigation. ","1804":"The trend towards minimally invasive surgery leads to an increasing demand for methods enhancing in situ spatial orientation. Hence, navigation systems are being more and more used for many operations. At the beginning of a navigated surgery the coordinate systems of the patient need to be registered with the navigation system. Our registration method is based on intraoperative freehand ultrasound imaging and overcomes some problems related to landmark-based registration, such as invasiveness, inaccuracy and the time-consumption of the process. After a successful registration, the operation can be conducted safely with the aid of the navigation system which provides enhanced spatial orientation on high-quality preoperative image data (e.g., MRI, CT). Soft tissue is depicted especially well in MRI data. Since imaging of soft tissue close to the joints is of high diagnostic importance, MRI scans are often part of the preoperative routine. These data can also be utilised by a navigation system. In this article we present our first results on the registration of 3D ultrasound and MRI data of the knee. 3D ultrasound and T (1)\/T (2)-weighted MRI data were acquired from the distal femur and the proximal tibia. The ultrasound volume data were pre-processed to enhance the contrast of bone and surrounding tissue. A dataset combined from T (1)- and T (2)-weighted MRI images was also created. Points of the bone surface corresponding optimally to the bone surface demonstrated in the ultrasound images were extracted from the MRI volume data. For the surface extraction of the femur the T (1)-weighted image data were used, and for the tibia the combined MRI dataset was used. Based on the extracted bone surface, MRI and ultrasound volume data were registered with a surface-volume registration algorithm. Registrations of ultrasound data of both the femur and the tibia were successful. Bone and cartilage was depicted well in the ultrasound data and visual inspection showed the accurate overlay of bone structures in MRI and ultrasound volumes. We have demonstrated the feasibility of registering bone structures based on 3D-ultrasound and MRI data. Our method allows for minimally invasive routine surgery of orthopaedic diseases which so far had to be operated conventionally because other methods for navigated surgery are too expensive, inaccurate or time-consuming. ","1805":"INTRODUCTION The long-term stability in cemented hip arthroplasty depends not only on the mechanical properties of the acrylic bone cements but also on an improvement of cementing techniques. The bending strengths of 15 commonly used bone cements (CMW 3 Gentamycin; CMW 3; Refobacin Palacos R; Palacos R; Palamed G; Palamed; Cerafixgenta; Cerafix; Duracem; Simplex Tobramycin; Simplex P; Versabond; Sulcem; Sulcem 3 Genta; Copal) have been mechanically tested in a standardised in vitro four-point bending test (ISO 5833). The fatigue fracture surfaces were morphologically analysed with light microscopy. The highest values of bending strength were found in vacuum mixed specimens cured under pressure. The lowest values of strength were seen in with blood contaminated specimens. Fatigue cracks were often initiated from air bubbles or other inclusions such as antibiotics or blood in the bone cement. The present in vitro study highlights the supposition that the quality of the cementing technique is of eminent importance in determining the long-term stability of cemented hip arthroplasties. ","1806":"Intraoperative periprosthetic femoral fractures (PFF) during the implantation of primary non-cemented total hip arthroplasties (THA) are an increasing problem. Thus, the goal of this study was to analyse the postoperative performance of primary non-cemented THA in patients with intraoperative PFFs, with respect to the patient's subjective health-related satisfaction. 42 PFFs in 1216 primary THAs using the non-cemented BiCONTACT stem were monitored. Patients were compared to a control group of 42 non-cemented THA patients without intraoperative fracture complications, using the matched-pair analysis. Preoperative and after 2.2 years (0.8-3.2 years), patients were followed-up clinically and radiographically. Clinical parameters were Harris hip score, SF-36 health score, function and pain score and postoperative complications. Radiographic parameters were bone union, stem and trochanter migration. Fractures were graded using the Vancouver classification. Results showed a significant increase in both Harris hip score and motion score and a significant decrease in pain score in both groups (p&lt;0.001). The SF-36 health score increased significantly in nearly every dimension in both groups. Except for 2 patients with trochanter migrations of 25 and 20 mm, all fractures showed bony union. In 3 patients the stems subsided by 4.7 +\/- 2.9 mm. The stems showed no further migration at final follow-up. 2 patients without intraoperative fractures underwent stem revision. Overall increases and postoperative complication rates were not significantly different between the groups. Mid-term THA performance and patient satisfaction are not influenced by intraoperative Vancouver A and B1 fractures during implantation of the non-cemented BiCONTACT stem compared to a collective without intraoperative fractures during implantation. ","1807":"Total hip arthroplasty for high developmental hip dislocations should restore the anatomic hip centre by implanting the acetabular cup in the true acetabulum. The normalisation of the position of the hip may require femoral shortening to avoid the risk of neurological traction injury. In this study group a subtrochanteric transverse shortening with a cement-free stem (Alloclassic-SL) with a rectangular square diameter was used to secure rotation stability. With this technique seven primary hip arthroplasties were performed in Crowe grade types III and IV. The age at time of operation averaged 41.7 years (range: 29 to 64 years). Average follow-up was 18 months. An average subtrochanteric resection of 4.2 cm (range: 3 to 5 cm) by a transverse subtrochanteric osteotomy without external fixation was performed. There was one symptomatic stem loosening 15 months postoperatively. The average Harris hip score preoperatively of 43 points (range: 29 to 61 points) improved to a mean of 77 points (range: 66 to 90 points) at the time of follow-up. The hemispherical cups were implanted in all cases at the place of the original acetabular site. Meanwhile, there was no loosening on the acetabular side. All transverse osteotomies healed with evidence of union at the osteotomy site. At the last follow-up six of the seven Alloclassic-SL stems presented a secondary osseointegration. The subtrochanteric transverse shortening osteotomy in total hip arthroplasty is a safe and predictable method for restoring the anatomic centre in high development hip dislocation. The intramedullary stability will be secured by the distal rotation stability of the inherent cross-sectional geometry of this stem design without external stabilisation. A Z-shaped osteotomy of the subtrochanteric shortening or additional augmentation with allograft struts and cables is not necessary. ","1808":"It was the purpose of this prospective study to investigate the impact of preoperative functional status and pain on the early patient-centred outcome after total hip arthroplasty (THA). 67 consecutive patients scheduled for THA were included in this study. Outcome was analysed with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities' (WOMAC) Osteoarthritis Index preoperatively and after ten days and 12 weeks, respectively. Patients were grouped with regard to their preoperative function and pain according to the WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index. Statistical analysis was performed using a multivariate regression model considering further confounding variables (age, gender, affected side, duration of surgery, and anchorage of THA). All patients showed a significant functional improvement both at ten days postoperatively and after three months, respectively. Patients with a higher degree of disability preoperatively had a larger relative functional improvement according to their WOMAC score compared to patients who initially were less deteriorated. However, the latter had the better absolute scores postoperatively. Multiple regression analysis revealed gender (OR: -11.85, 95% CI: -22.65 to -1.06, p=0.03) and preoperative WOMAC score (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.59, p&lt;0.01) to be significant prognostic variables at ten days postoperatively. After three months, age (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.82, p=0.03) was the only variable predicting the patient-centred outcome. In our study sample, patient-related variables did significantly influence the patient-centred outcome after ten days (gender and WOMAC) and at three months postoperatively (age) whereas procedure-related variables did not have any impact.

Because of osteonecrosis in the femoral head in MRI the initial diagnosis was dysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris. The patient developed a progressive stiffness of the hip and a retinal detachment. A molecular investigation showed a Stickler syndrome. Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease. It has a very low incidence and a rare association with hip disease. Usually the patients suffer from hypermobility. In our case the course was atypical and diagnosis delayed.","1812":"The current study assessed the clinical and radiological outcome and motor function improvement after subcutaneous adductor tenotomy in children with cerebral palsy (ICP). It was also analysed if groups with different preoperative hip functions and radiological hip migrations differed in their final clinical, radiological and motor function outcome. A prospective study of 91 children with infantile cerebral palsy (ICP, mean age 4.9 years, range: 1.1 - 15.8) with 141 hip dislocations or subluxations analysed preoperatively the hip abduction and radiologically the migration percentage (MP). Depending on the preoperative status, all patients were grouped into 3 abduction and 3 MP groups. Additionally, the motor function was classified according to the Rancho los Amigos scale. A subcutaneous adductor tenotomy was performed mono- or bilaterally and all patients were treated for 4 - 6 weeks with a hip abduction splint. Patients were assessed annually for 4 years; clinical and radiological results and the motor function were analysed according to their preoperative status. The mean hip abduction was preoperatively 30.3 +\/- 1.2 degrees and was significantly improved to 50.3 +\/- 1.3 degrees 1 year and to 43.3 +\/- 2.2 degrees 4 years post surgery. The preoperative mean MP was preoperatively 42.3 +\/- 1.3 % and was significantly improved to 34.6 % 1 year and to 31.9 % 4 years post surgery. After 4 years, 41 % had undergone a motor function improvement and 52 % no change in motor function. After 4 years, patients with a hip abduction &lt;or= 20 degrees showed the most improvement; other abduction groups also improved significantly but to a lesser extent. The 4-year MP was significantly and to a relatively large extent improved in the groups with a preoperative MP between 25 % and 50 % and above 50 %. With a preoperative MP &lt;or= 25 %, there was a significant but only slight improvement. The motor function was improved when the preoperative hip abduction was most restricted and the preoperative MP was high. CONCLUSION The subcutaneous adductor tenotomy in hip dislocation and subluxation of children with cerebral palsy is a safe procedure that can treat and prevent hip dislocation\/subluxation in 76 % of the cases. In appropriately selected patients, the number of individuals that are \"freely walking\" and \"walking with aid\" can be doubled. MP and hip abduction are both predictors of therapy outcome. ","1813":"Endoscopic gastrocnemius recession is a new technique to treat gastrocnemius equinus. Smaller incisions and the ability to perform the technique in a supine position are purported advantages. This study was designed to evaluate the results and possible complications of this new technique. 47 patients undergoing 54 endoscopic gastrocnemius recessions were followed in a prospective study. Pre-operative criteria were a lack of ankle dorsiflexion with the knee extended to create a 90 degrees relationship of the foot to the leg in symptomatic patients. Pre- and postoperative ankle dorsiflexion were assessed, as were complications such as infection, nerve injury, haematoma, over-lengthening and poor cosmesis. Mean age of the patients was 49.4 years. Post-operative follow-up from the index procedure was 27 months (range: 12 - 62 months). Pre-operative dorsiflexion was - 8 +\/- 4 degrees; post-operative this improved significantly to 7 +\/- 4 degrees (p = 0.00001). Most patients had additional reconstructive procedures. There were no infections; six limbs had lateral foot or leg dysaesthesia, one haematoma, one over-lengthened gastrocnemius while six limbs has an unacceptable cosmesis (due to tenting of the skin). Two diabetic patients required additional Achilles tendon lengthening in subsequent surgery. Patients with pre-operative dorsiflexion of - 10 degrees or more had an untoward result, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). Lateral foot dysaesthesia was observed more often in patients having a combined procedure with calcaneal osteotomy (p = 0.03). The endoscopic gastrocnemius recession procedure can significantly increase ankle dorsiflexion, but has potential complications including lateral dysaesthesia (11 %), and unacceptable cosmesis (11 %) as the most common. Modifications to the technique may be needed. Overall, the endoscopic technique appears promising in decreasing gastrocnemius contracture. ","1814":"Three-dimensional motion analysis of the lower limb has been an approved method of diagnosis and therapy planning for several years. In this study we observed the range of motion of the shoulder and elbow in 10 activities of daily life (ADL) with a marker-based biomechanical model for the upper extremity. With this database we hope to improve the evaluation of different handicaps of the upper limb. The used biomechanical model is based on 14 infrared light-reflecting markers. The ranges of motion in ADL for shoulder and elbow were measured in a standardised case setting in seven test persons with a mean age of 25 years (SD 15 years). The 10 observed ADL were eating with a spoon, combing hair, genital hygiene, using a telephone, typing on a keyboard, drinking from a glass, turning a key, turning a page, pouring water in a glass and drawing. For the ten explored ADL, the test persons needed a range of motion in the shoulder of 91 - 0 - 9 degrees (total 100 degrees) flexion\/extension, 112 - 23 - 0 degrees (total 89 degrees) abduction\/adduction, and 91 - 0 - 114 degrees (total 205 degrees) external\/internal rotation. Most of the ADL were performed in external rotation and, excluding the motion genital hygiene, the test persons only needed an internal rotation of 10 degrees. Maximal shoulder flexion was used with opening a door, the minimum was reached with genital hygiene. The maximum angles of abduction and rotation were reached with combing hair and the minimum values were reached with genital hygiene. To perform the ADL, an elbow extension\/flexion of 0 - 36 - 146 degrees (total 110 degrees), and 55 - 0 - 72 degrees (total 127 degrees) pro-\/supination was needed. Maximal pronation was reached with \"pour from a pitcher\". Maximal supination was present with genital hygiene. The decisive benefit of 3D motion analysis is the exact capturing of complex and dynamic movements at any time. Therefore, not only static joint positions can be recorded, but also the dynamic course of a movement can be traced. By using our model on every day movements, we were able to collect data that can serve as the basis for the desired range of motion of the upper extremities in patients. ","1815":"The aim of this prospective clinical trial was to analyse the ventral fusion rate following circumferential fusion for degenerative spine disease using a radiolucent carbon fibre cage (Brantigan, Fa. DePuy-Acromed) loaded with either autogeneous bone graft (iliac crest) or with the tricalcium phosphate Cerasorb with PRP (Curasan AG, Kleinostheim, Deutschland). In 26 patients (15 female, 11 male, average age: 57.7 years) a circumferential fusion of the lumbar spine was performed (titanium posterior instrumentation and Brantigan, Fa. DePuy-Acromed). Autogeneous bone graft (iliac crest) and Cerasorb-PRP as cage filling substance were randomly assigned to each level in all patients. Anterior fusion was evaluated in a total number of 69 Brantigan cages by radiographs after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and by CT 1 year after surgery. The evaluation of radiographs resulted in a fusion rate 49 %. This was significantly different from the fusion rate accessed by CT scanning (28 %). None of the Brantigan cages (n = 33) filled with Cerasorb with PRP showed an anterior fusion in the CT while fusion was proven in 19 of 36 (49 %) Brantigan cages loaded with cancellous bone from the iliac crest. The use a of cancellous bone from the iliac crest as filling substance for Brantigan cages in circumferential fusion of the lumbar spine leads to a significantly higher anterior fusion rate than Cerasorb with PRP. ","1816":"Even today, different opinions can be found concerning realignment loss of the adjoining intervertebral disc after fracture followed by dorsal fusion. There is still disagreement on intervertebral disc excision and the subsequent necessity of intercorporal fusion. In this context, fractures of the thoracolumbar transition and its operative repair via instrumented bisegmental dorsal fusion at T11 - L1 and T12 - L2, respectively, have been examined. Immediately after the accident and after removal of the implant, sagittal MR images (T1-, TE-, T2-weighted) with a standard 4 mm slice thickness were made. Eighteen patients with fractures of the thoracolumbar transition (A3 and B1 according to the AO classification) could be included in this study. All fractures were of traumatic genesis. The implant was removed after an average of ten months. Allowing for planimetric measuring errors, our analysis generated a 14 % volume decrease of the upper and a 15 % volume decrease of the lower intervertebral disc. A volume change of 3 % in the bridged or fractured vertebral body was found to be without any verifiable significance. Tendentially, a slight volume loss of both adjacent intervertebral discs could be observed. In our opinion, the realignment loss after a mean ten months cannot be explained by the volume changes of the discs alone. The creeping of the intervertebral disc into the adjacent vertebral body accounts for the post-traumatic malalignment. ","1817":"Cemented revision of femoral components in total hip arthroplasty has shown high rates of early loosening due to reduced micro- and macroretention of the cement to the endostal bone stock. Enhanced stability can be reached by an amphiphilic bonder, which offers a covalent bonding of the hydrophobic cement to the hydrophilic bone. The aim of this study is to evaluate the biocompatibility of such a bonder and its effects on the mechanical stability of cemented hip arthroplasty stems in vivo. Total cemented hip arthroplasties were performed in 20 sheep. In the verum group (n = 10) the implant bed was preconditioned by application of the bonder prior to femoral stem implantation. To study the biocompatibility around the bone-cement interface fluorescent marking of osteoblasts was applied in vivo throughout the observation period of 9 months. Native X-rays of the hip joints were obtained immediately after implantation and after euthanasia. The bone-cement interface was examined histologically. All stems of the verum group showed firm bonding of cement to bone in manual testing, while in 7 of the 10 controls the stems with adherent cement could be easily pulled out off the bony implant bed. This was coherent with significantly higher rates of progredient radiolucent lines and soft-tissue interpositions between bone and cement in the control group. The bonder was biocompatible. When preconditioned with an amphiphilic bonder, cemented stems showed a markedly higher adhesive strength to the cancellous bone without signs of inflammation or neoplasia. This procedure might offer enhanced longevity of cemented femoral revision stems in hip arthroplasty. ","1818":"We aimed to prove the stabilising effect of atmospheric pressure (AP) on the hip joint experimentally. In the experiment, model joints of 28 mm, 32 mm und 36 mm diameter were subjected to increasing traction force. The acting force and the resulting dislocation distance were measured both with the capsule hermetically sealed, as well as with the capsula open. For the hermetically sealed capsule we measured maximum resistances of 7.6 kp for the 28 mm joint, 10.4 kp for the 32 mm joint and 12.4 kp for the 36 mm joint. With the capsule open we found resistances from 0.4 kp to 1 kp. Our experimental results exceeded the predicted resistances of 6 kp, 7.8 kp and 9.9 kp. Increased amounts of synovial fluid reduced the stability. Our measurements confirm the continual stabilising effect of AP on the hip joint, which can be quantified as the resting potential of stability (RPS) or luxation work (LW). The RPS is calculated by multiplying the difference of AP and saturated vapour pressure of synovial fluid with the cross-sectional area of the femoral head. It represents the force, necessary for luxation of the joint against the resistance of AP. The RPS is proportional to the square of the joint diameter. The LW, calculated by multiplying RPS with the luxation distance, is proportional to the joint diameter cubed. That is why a small increase of joint diameter leads to a significant increase of stability, while the rate of the increase of range-of-motion decreases. To achieve stability of a total hip arthroplasty the size of the joint components should depend on the size of the resected femoral head. Also the hermetically sealed capsule should be reconstructed carefully. ","1819":null,"1820":"Periprosthetic tissue was analysed by the combination of different investigation techniques without destruction. The localisation and geometry of polyethylene abrasion particles were determined quantitatively to differentiate between abrasion due to function and abrasion due to implant loosening. Non-polyethylene particles from implant components which contaminate the tissue were micro-analytically measured. The results will help us to understand loosening mechanisms and thus lead to implant optimisations. A non-destructive particle analysis using highly sensitive proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) was developed to achieve a better histological allocation. Five autopsy cases with firmly fitting hip endoprosthesis (2 x Endo-Modell Mark III, 1 x St. Georg Mark II, LINK, Germany; 2 x Spongiosa Metal II, ESKA, Germany) were prepared as ground tissue specimens. Wear investigations were accomplished with a combined application of different microscopic techniques and microanalysis. The abrasion due to implant loosening was histologically evaluated on 293 loosened cup implants (St. Georg Mark II, LINK, Germany). Wear particles are heterogeneously distributed in the soft tissue. In cases of cemented prostheses, cement particles are dominating whereas metal particles could rarely be detected. The concentration of the alloy constituent cobalt (Co) is increased in the mineralised bone tissue. The measured co-depositions depend on the localisation and\/or lifetime of an implant. Functional polyethylene (PE) abrasion needs to be differentiated from PE abrasion of another genesis (loosening, impingement) morphologically and by different tissue reactions. In the past a reduction of abrasion was targeted primarily by the optimisation of the bearing surfaces and tribology. The interpretation of our findings indicates that different mechanisms of origin in terms of tissue contamination with wear debris and the alloy should be included in the improvement of implants or implantation techniques. ","1821":"We have investigated the value of flexion osteotomy for femoral head necrosis with regard to the survival rate. We examined 40 patients who were treated by flexion osteotomy for femoral head necrosis at the Hannover Medical School in the years 1969 to 1995. The mean follow-up period was 14.1 years. The mean survival time of the flexion osteotomies was 9.6 years. In 23 of the 40 patients, it failed within 10 years after surgery, which implies a 10-year survival rate of 42.5 %. For these 23 patients, the implantation of a total hip arthroplasty (THA) became necessary after an average time of 6.6 years. Due to the poorly predictable success of the flexion osteotomy and the comparatively poor patient satisfaction, the indication for flexion osteotomy in such cases should be reconsidered. ","1822":"The open-wedge high tibial osteotomy is an established procedure for the treatment of the unicompartimental gonarthrosis in young patients. An adequate correction of osseous malalignment is crucial for a sufficient reduction of stress in a diseased compartment. We have examined reliability and precision of an intraoperatively used computer-assisted navigation system for high tibial osteotomy. The aim of the study is to show the equivalent safety and effectiveness of high tibial osteotomies carried out with the computer-assisted navigation system. It is assumed that a good correlation between the mechanical tibio-femoral axis as measured by radiography and by the navigation system can be achieved. 40 medial open-wedge osteotomies were performed with computer-assisted navigation on 39 patients (27 males, 12 females) between 1\/2004 and 8\/2006. The average age was 46.3 years (range: 26 - 64 years), the average weight was 83.2 kg (range: 54 - 118 kg). A good correlation between radiographic data and the data acquired with the navigation system was found for the tibio-femoral axis: preoperative data (8.0 +\/- 2.5 degrees, radiographic; 7.8 +\/- 2.1 degrees navigated) for varus alignment. The postoperative correlation was lower than the preoperative one (postoperative data (0.6 +\/- 3.2 degrees radiographic; - 0.7 +\/- 1.0 degrees navigated) for valgus alignment. In 2 patients a loss of correction occurred and had to be treated operatively. High tibial osteotomy is an established therapy procedure for unicompartmental gonarthrosis. It can be improved in its precision and reliability by computer-assisted navigation. ","1823":"Chondral or osteochondral avulsions of the lateral distal femur edge after luxation of the patella are well known. Less common are impression fractures of the retropatellar joint or the lateral trochlea. Furthermore, on standard knee X-rays these injuries may not be seen and thus not properly be treated. By presenting our cases we show clinical symptoms, diagnostic pathways and the therapeutic approach for osteochondral fractures of the distal femur. The first patient had a large osteochondral impression fracture of the lateral femur trochlea and retropatellar surface. The second patient had a chondral depression of the lateral trochlea femoris after kicking a football. The further examinations showed no other knee injuries in the first case, but a rupture of the outer meniscus plus ACL rupture and distortion of the medial collateral complex in the other one. In both cases the whole degree of the injury was not seen on the standard X-rays, but only on MRI or CT scans. The clinical signs were also not so overwhelming, as both patients could walk with crutches, but suffered from haemarthrosis. Both patients were operated by arthroscopy first with surgery on the meniscus injury and ACL rupture. The impression was revised by an open procedure with elevation of the subchondral spongiosa. In the follow-up examination we saw no dissection of chondral flakes or local necrosis. Osteochondral lesions of the distal femur can be neglected, as it is an uncommon diagnosis and the radiological signs may not be impressing. The more important is a subtle anamnesis and further diagnostic regime via CT or MRI as it is a prearthrotic injury. Intraoperatively the impression must be elevated or in the case of a dislocation refixed. Further knee injuries have to be detected. In the follow-up one should check for signs of flake dissection or necrosis. ","1824":"The aim of this study was to compare the different diagnostic features (symptoms, physical examination, radiographic features and intraoperative findings) of osteoarthritis of the knee before total joint replacement and consequently relate them with each other. Patients with primary osteoarthritis of the knee, who where accepted for total joint replacement in our clinic, were integrated in our study. The medical conditions were recorded by using the Womac score, the knee subscore (KS) of the Knee Society Clinical Rating System and a visual analogue scale (VAS). A physical examination was also performed. The radiological evaluation was performed by using standardised radiographs. Joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, knee alignment and the Kellgren score were recorded. During surgery an orthopaedic specialist documented the progression of cartilage lesions using the classification of chondromalacia described by Outerbridge. The analysis of correlation was performed by using the Spearman correlation (SpK) coefficient. 103 patients were integrated in the study (mean age: 68 years, 70 women). No significant correlation could be found between the Womac score or VAS and the results of the radiological examination (SpK [Womac - Kellgren score]: - 0.04; SpK [VAS - Kellgren score]: 0.08). There was a significant correlation between the KS and the results of the radiological examination as well as the progression of the cartilage lesions, caused by the results of the physical examination documented in the KS (SpK [KS - Kellgren score]: - 0.39). The radiographic features, with the exception of subchondral sclerosis, showed a significant correlation with the degree of chondromalacia (SpK [Kellgren score - chondromalacia]: 0.43). The amount of osteophytes correlated the most with the cartilage lesions: SpK: 0.43. The knee subscore appears to be an efficient method for staging the clinical progression of osteoarthritis of the knee for clinical practice as well as for clinical trials. The Womac score especially serves to record the level of pain. We were able to confirm that the presence of osteophytes is the most significant radiographic feature of osteoarthritis of the knee. The Kellgren score turned out to be a reliable method for monitoring the radiographic progression of osteoarthritis of the knee. ","1825":"The aim of this study was to summarise the impact of medical care and related costs due to the treatment of osteoarthritis in Germany. Data from different health care institutions, government authorities and public health insurances for the year 2002 were analysed. Amount and cost of acute and rehabilitation treatments (in-patient as well as out-patient), sickness leave and early retirement related to osteoarthritis were estimated. Advanced hip and knee osteoarthritis have a high socioeconomic impact in Germany. The number of people affected is growing, as is the overall incidence of joint replacement, especially knee arthroplasties and the percentage of in-patient rehabilitation for osteoarthritis. Our study confirms that the direct and indirect costs attributable to osteoarthritis are substantial and the resulting socioeconomic burden is significant. Since age is a major risk factor for osteoarthritis, the demographic changes will lead to an increased need for medical treatment of osteoarthritis patients in the future.

With this, a differentiated aim-oriented analysis of illustrated internal DRG data becomes possible. The group-specific difference of the coding quality between the DRG groups following primary coding by the orthopaedic surgeon and final coding by the medical controlling is analysed. In a consecutive series of 1600 patients parallel documentation and group-specific comparison of the relevant DRG parameters were carried out in every case after primary and final coding. Analysing the group-specific share in the additional CaseMix coding, the group \"spine surgery\" dominated, closely followed by the groups \"arthroplasty\" and \"surgery due to infection, tumours, diabetes\". Altogether, additional cost-weight-relevant coding was necessary most frequently in the latter group (84%), followed by group \"spine surgery\" (65%). In DRGs representing conservative orthopaedic treatment documented procedures had nearly no influence on the cost weight. The introduced system of case group analysis in internal DRG documentation can lead to the detection of specific problems in primary coding and cost-weight relevant changes of the case mix. As an instrument for internal process control in the orthopaedic field, it can serve as a communicative interface between an economically oriented classification of the hospital performance and a specific problem solution of the medical staff involved in the department management. ","1834":"In the year 2005 the German DRG system underwent further differentiation in many areas compared to previous years. The effects of an improved coding quality by a specifically trained orthopaedic surgeon (KBFA) at an orthopaedic university department are analysed. In a closed sample of 1 277 cases the following parameters were documented after primary coding at discharge and after the final coding by the KBFA: main diagnosis, number of additional diagnoses and procedures, the resulting G-DRG, PCCL, cost weight and revenues. These data were analysed for statistically significant differences and correlations. The final coding by the KBFA caused a significant (p&lt;0.001) increase in the number of diagnoses and procedures. The intervention of the KBFA changed the DRG grouping in 34 % of the cases. The cost weight increased significantly and the case mix index raised by 0.26 in the complete sample, corresponding to an increased revenue of euro 62 per case and day. The establishment of a KBFA in an orthopaedic department improved the quality of revenue-relevant DRG coding and the reflection of the economic complexity level of the cases. Compared to other reports, an above-average increase of cost weight as well as specification depth for diagnoses and procedures was achieved. ","1835":"3D-ultrasonic is gaining more and more significance in many medical disciplines, e. g., in angiology and prenatal diagnostics. The aim of this study was to make a comparison between the informative ability of conventional 2D-ultrasound with that of 3D-ultrasound for investigations of joints and to determinate whether 3D-ultrasound can reveal additional diagnostic information. During a defined period of time all clinically necessary ultrasonic investigations of joints were done with a 3D-sonograph. However, all data recorded need a manual post-processing stage for visualisation in a 3D-mode. Due to the small impedance differences between the tissue layers, an automated tissue differentiation was not possible. The substantial advantage is that all the DEGUM standard levels can be derived from the scanning volume without conversion of the ultrasound head. At the current time the benefit of 3D-visualisation in the diagnostics of joints is small. The introduction of this technique to daily routine is not yet justified. ","1836":"Postural insufficiency in children and adolescents is considered as a risk factor for back pain. The evaluation is performed through the Matthiass arm-raising test, a visual test procedure with a high risk of subjective interpretation. Therefore, the prevalence data for postural insufficiency differ over a wide range in the literature. This study is focuses on the prevalence of postural insufficiency before and during adolescence with an objective test procedure and a more accurate interpretation of the Matthiass arm-raising test. Pictures of 663 children, examined through the photographically documented Matthiass arm-raising test, were measured with specially developed software on the monitor. The degree of body trunk inclination indicating the postural stability power allows one to accurately define the following categories: postural stability, postural impairment and postural decline. 34% of children at the age of 8 to 9 years show a postural insufficiency which is evenly distributed between postural impairment and postural decline for both genders. At the age of 11 to 14 years, postural insufficiency decreases to 19%. The decline, especially for severe forms, is predominant in boys. Before the adolescence period, postural insufficiency is distributed evenly with regard to both form and gender, while a noticeable decline shows up as the age increases. The decline for girls seems to be less caused by the earlier entry into adolescence. ","1837":"There are many different possibilities for the treatment of the distal radial fracture. According to evidence-based medicine there is no gold standard for the treatment of this fracture. With the development of locking plates, the spectrum of indications for plate osteosynthesis has possibly increased. The aim of our investigation was the evaluation of the clinical results after stabilisation of distal radial fractures with the locking, 3.5 mm T-LCP. In a retrospective study we analysed all patients with distal radial fractures treated with a 3.5 mm T-LCP between 05\/02 and 05\/04. The complete medical histories and X-rays were analysed and a clinical follow-up examination with the Martini score was performed. 76 from 93 patients (82%) could be examined for the follow-up, the average age was 59 years (17\/88). According to the AO classification of Mueller and Nazarian we had 23 A-fractures, 7 B-fractures and 73 C-fractures. After reduction and plate osteosynthesis we found no secondary displacement. The median of the overall results according to the Martini score was 33 from 38 points (9\/38). As far as complications were found 1 CRPS, 3 CTS, 2 pseudarthroses, 1 wound infection, 1 delayed bony union, 3 implant failures, and 1 broken plate (after a new injury). In one case the median nerve was cut during operation and a suture was performed. According to our results the 3.5 mm T-LCP is a good implant for the stabilisation of displaced distal radius fractures if the fragments are not too small for the 3.5 mm screws. The anatomic reduction is maintained and the X-rays show very good results. Compared with other investigations we must ask ourselves if the benefit of the locking plates justifies its use as compared with non-locking (conventional) plates.

In spite of clinically resembling an osteochondroma, a subungual exostosis or a parosteal osteosarcoma, the lesion is characterised by distinct radiological and histological findings. The lesion is defined as a reactive heterotopic ossification and is mostly found in the hands and feet of adults in the third decade of life. A high rate of local recurrence of up to 50% has been described, but since it is defined as a benign lesion no metastases can be found. We report the instructive case of a BPOP (\"Nora's lesion\") in the area of the proximal phalanx of the big toe in which, after performing a biopsy, a resection of the lesion under preservation of the big toe was performed. At the last follow-up examination (4 years postoperatively) the patient showed no sign of recurrence of the lesion. The clinical, radiological and MRI appearance of the lesion are described together with the distinct clinical findings.","1839":"Lateral release is a substantial component of the distal soft tissue procedure, which plays a major role in the framework of the lapidus-fusion and the near-to-basis osteotomy in the hallux valgus surgery. The extent of release which is reached during this procedure is controversially discussed. The goal of this anatomic study was the evaluation of the effect of the sequential disconnection of lateral contraction structures on the alignment of the large toe. On 8 anatomical hallux valgus preparations in which each foot was fastened in a holding device under defined continuous lateral pull, the soft tissue at the lateral aspect of the large toe was surgically split in the following sequential order: the lateral joint capsule, the tendon of the adductor hallucis muscle and afterwards the transverse metatarsal ligament. Before each procedure an X-ray was taken. We documented the different changes of the hallux valgus angle, the intermetatarsal 1\/2 angle as well as the proximal and distal articulation angles. The hallux valgus angle was predominantly and significantly improved by capsule splitting and tenotomy of the tendon of the adductor hallucis muscle. A significant correction of the intermetatarsal angle did not take place however. It was shown that the substantial element of an effective distal soft tissue procedure for hallux valgus is the splitting of the capsule. The disconnection of the transverse metatarsal ligament did not lead to a further correction and can therefore be neglected. ","1840":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term results of joint preserving surgery with hamstring release and dorsal capsulotomy for the treatment of therapy resistant knee flexion contracture in patients with severe haemophilia. 16 patients having undergone hamstring release and dorsal capsulotomy were prospectively observed and clinically evaluated over a period of at least 10 years. Follow-up was on average 16.6 (10-26) years. The average age at the time of surgery was 29.4 (15-40) years and at the last follow-up 43.0 (29-65) years. Clinical assessment of the patients was performed at least twice per year and outcome was evaluated by using the Score of the Orthopaedic Advisory Committee of the World Federation of Haemophilia (WFH). The preoperative extension deficit of 21.1+\/-1.82 degrees (10-40 degrees) was improved to 16+\/-3.6 degrees (5-30 degrees; p=0.54) at the last follow-up. In the first 4 years after surgery there was a noticeable and continuous improvement of the preoperative extension deficit. The clinical score improved from 7.6+\/-0.4 preoperatively to 3.8+\/-0.4 one year after surgery. 14 years after surgery a significant difference to preoperative values was no longer evident for the remaining 10 patients. The first 4 years after surgery average range of movement (ROM) improved, yet these differences were not statistically significant. Based on the clinical outcomes as described by Rodriguez-Merchan, last follow-up showed one patient with a good, 11 patients with a moderate and 4 patients with a poor postoperative result. The Petterson score showed a marked and significant deterioration from 7 (5-10) to 9 (7-12) points at final follow-up. The joint preserving method of hamstring release and dorsal capsulotomy for the treatment of therapy resistant knee flexion contracture in patients with severe hemophilia does not prevent the progression of haemophilic arthropathy. Despite this, improvement of the flexion contracture leads to a better joint function over a number of years postoperatively. Especially for the younger patient suffering from manifest haemarthropathic changes of the knee joint, this management option is a feasible alternative to at least postpone joint replacement. ","1841":"Cysteine proteases as cathepsins K and L as well as matrix metalloproteases are considered to be basically involved in collagen turnover. Degenerative joint diseases such as gonarthrosis are characterised by massive cartilage degradation mediated by increased activities of these proteases. These enzymes are, therefore, interesting targets for the treatment of painful arthritic joint diseases. The aim of these studies was to reconsider the hypothesis that cathepsin activities are enhanced in patients suffering from osteoarthritis. We report on a 69-year-old female suffering from severe pain due to predominant retropatellar arthrosis. The clinical symptoms of this patient did not significantly differ from that of 30 other patients who were involved in this study. All patients undergone an endoprosthetic knee joint replacement. During the operation we harvested cartilage probes and isolated the chondrocytes from the joint cartilage for determination of the mRNA and the activities of cathepsins B, H, K and L. Compared to chondrocytes isolated from the control patients we found the activity of cysteine proteases to be extremely enhanced in chondrocytes of this patient. Moreover, the concentration of cystatin c, an endogenous inhibitor of cathepsins, was not detectable. The results raise doubts on the predominant role of cysteine proteases in severe cartilage destruction.

The human proximal femurs were evaluated with regard to their bone density by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Two pairs of human cadaveric femurs had an osteoporotic and two pairs an osteopenic bone stock. After implantation of the cementless femoral stems, the prostheses were loaded in a physiological position. Subsidence, rotation and interface motion of the stems were measured with load cycles up to 2000 Newton. There was no significant correlation between the bone density of the proximal femur and the primary stability of the femoral stem in subsidence (p=0.23) and rotation (p=0.79). Reduced bone density in the osteoporotic and osteopenic human femora did not increase the interface motion at the proximal or distal part of the prosthesis (p&gt;0.05). The initial stability of cementless femoral stems was not influenced by the bone density, at least in this biomechanical in vitro study. Thus, theoretical conditions exist that allow secondary osseointegration of femoral stems also in cases of reduced bone density.

In the last years many new helpful implants were introduced to the market, minimally invasive procedures were presented together with the technique of navigation. There is no scientific proof of the benefit of these procedures. The objective of this study was to collect data about the preferences of the surgeons for procedures and implants. In a countrywide anonymous survey, staff of 240 German trauma surgery and orthopaedic surgery departments were asked about their MIS procedures and their treatment strategies (August 2006). 184 of the questionnaires have been returned representing 64,569 THRs, 65% with cementless fixation, 12.6% with bone conserving implants and 4.1% with resurfacing. We found that 77% of the respondents were doing minimally invasive THR. 34% of all THR are minimally invasive (MIS) procedures, while 23% of the patients ask for MIS. Most of the surgeons (54%) define \"minimally invasive\" as the preservation of muscle, tendons and soft tissue, and 33% as the length of skin incision to be less than 10 cm. 78% are convinced that long-term survival is achievable even with less invasive methods. The most common MIS approach is the anterior\/anterolateral (42%), for the standard procedure (not MIS) the dorsal approach is the most used (42%), and for revision surgery the lateral approach (44%). 77% of the respondents never use navigation and 54% are convinced that there is no sense in it. 75% of MIS surgeons use special MIS instruments: 97% use redon drainage, 48% the cell-saver, 71% of the operations are performed by senior\/head surgeons. The assistant quota was largest in high-volume centres. Innovative implants are used with care, more than one-third of all implants are still fixed with cement. MIS is performed in one-third of the THRs and it is not driven by sensationalised reports in the media. Even the surgeons' philosophy is oriented by long-term survival, most of them are defining MIS by preventing soft tissue damage and not by the length of skin incision. The transgluteal approach is still widespread, the drawbacks are hardly detectable, the soft tissue damage irreversible. Still lacking an adequate definition of the term \"MIS\", it is unclear whether the soft tissue is spared or the damage to it is the same under a smaller skin incision. Computer-aided surgery in THR is not used by most of the surgeons, for the majority it is not favourable. ","1845":"According to the \"practice makes perfect\" hypothesis, the mortality rates of many surgical procedures are inversely related to hospital and surgeon procedure volume. Currently there is a discussion regarding the implementation of high-volume centres for total hip replacement. Nevertheless, the body of evidence describing such an association is weak. Therefore the American National Cancer Policy Board came up with four evidence criteria describing a valid association between volume and outcome: 1) the association must be logical, 2) the association must be consistent in all studies, 3) the size of the measured effect must be substantial and clinically relevant and 4) the effect has to be reproducible in clinical studies. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (1996 until November 2006) using the following \"medical subject headings\" (MeSH): \"Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip\" or \"Hip Prosthesis\" and \"Volume\". We searched for full articles that reported on an association between hospital and surgeon procedure volume and outcome after total hip replacement. No language restriction was applied. We found 17 relevant studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE. The outcome after primary hip prosthesis and revision hip prosthesis was better when performed in high-volume hospitals or by high-volume surgeons. Depending on the cut-off for the definition of \"high volume\" and \"low volume\" the results could be statistically significant. Many of the included studies were of minor quality, the data were often not comparable between studies. Therefore, the results are not directly transferable to our medical system in Germany. Applying the criteria designed by the American National Cancer Policy Board on the studies about procedure volume and outcome after total hip replacement yields the following result: 1) the association must be logical: Yes. 2) The association must be consistent in all studies: Yes. 3) The size of the measured effect must be substantial and clinically relevant and has to be analysed using validated statistical criteria: No. 4) The effect has to be reproducible in clinical studies: No. ","1846":"The aim of this study was to assess the volume-outcome relationship of total hip replacement and the effects of its application on medical care in Germany. Electronic bibliographic databases, the reference lists of relevant articles and various health services research-related resources were searched and selected studies were assessed. Additionally, the consequences of implementing a regulation based on volume-outcome relations were calculated by using administrative data in different settings. The results in the literature concerning defined outcome parameters are inconsistent, but a general correlation between high volume and low complication rate could be identified. Implementing a regulation based on volume-outcome relationship with cut-off points of 20\/50 total hip replacements\/year would lead to an exclusion of 216 (17%)\/483 (38%) hospitals, respectively, from medical care. This would result in a reallocation of 2214 (1.4%)\/11,476 (7.4%) patients\/year, respectively (extrapolation).

The current paper describes a novel bone replacement material, which is vitalised through injection of autologous bone marrow. Industrially processed bone allografts were used for bone replacement; the cancellous bone graft was gained from femoral heads from living human donors and processed by a French tissue bank (Banque de Tissus France, TBF). Sterile packed allogenic bone grafts can be stored at room temperature, are easy to handle and can be adapted to almost every bone defect due to their stability and versatility. From July 2003 to February 2006 125 patients,70 men and 55 women, underwent bone grafting with composite transplants composed of autogenous marrow cells and industrial processed bone allografts. The average age at surgery was 62 (14-84) years; the follow-up period was 11 months. The indication to use the allograft included the whole spectrum of bony defects conventionally treated with autologous cancellous bone grafts such as primary and revision surgery in THA (n = 64) and the treatment of pseudarthrosis particularly of the lower limb (n = 30). In comparison to current bone replacement materials applied in clinical use, this approach promises to replicate the biomechanical and biological properties of autogenous cancellous bone. This is an important advantage over conventional approaches to ensure successful healing and regeneration of bone defects. Hence application of vitalised bone allograft represents an important alternative to conventional autogenous cancellous bone which avoids certain complications associated with harvesting and transplantation of autogenous bone. This applies in particular in situations in which harvesting of autogenous cancellous bone is not or no longer possible.

Nevertheless the primary osteosynthesis is not able to prevent necrosis of the talus completely, that occurs in a frequency of 15%. Risk factors for a posttraumatic arthritis in addition to the type of fracture and the result of reconstruction are an accompanied soft tissue defect and local capsule-band complex with necessary temporary transfixation.

Surface replacement arthroplasty can be an alternative to other current implants. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the metacarpophalangeal joint kinematics after surface replacement arthroplasty. The kinematics of pyrolytic carbon as a surface replacement implant for the metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP) was compared with the intact MCP joint in eight fresh cadaver long fingers by means of an electromagnetic tracking system (Polhemus, Colchester, VT). The eight human cadaver MCP joints were tested before implantation, after implantation, after collateral ligaments resection, and after collateral ligaments reconstruction. The kinematics of the MCP joint is reproduced by the joint surface replacement arthroplasty when normal ligament tension was present. The maximum angular displacement of the pyrocarbon implant was 378 for lateral deviation and 338 for rotation during the passive flexion and extension motion. The instantaneus center of rotation (ICR) after implant insertion was nearly identical to the center of rotation of the normal joint. The results also indicated that the collateral ligaments provide the primary stability of the MCP joint. No significant differences in lateral and rotational stability after surface replacement arthroplasty were noted. While collateral ligaments resection significantly affected the stability of the MCP joint. The ICR of the pyrocarbon implant most closely matched that of the intact MCP joint. The pyrocarbon implant provides suitable stability to radio-ulnar deviation and rotational stresses as a resurfacing implant and it simulates the kinematics of the intact MCP joint. By using new materials and taking the anatomical and biomechanical requirements into consideration, the endoprosthesis of the finger joints has created an option to achieve good long-term results. The inadequate results of earlier and current prostheses are a consequence of their mechanical construction and their materials. The success of the new implants could be proven by preferably long-term, controlled studies.

Average radiation time was 59.5 (8-222) seconds. In educational operations, the duration of surgery was significantly longer than in procedures performed by experienced surgeons, but radiation times only were increased tendentially.

Elbow function was investigated isometrically and isokinetically with the CYBEX-NORM. The presence and extent of heterotopic ossifications were assessed by A\/P and lateral view X-rays. The Morrey score was used to evaluate the clinical outcome. 13 patients received distal biceps refixation with the bone tunnel method and 35 with suture anchors. The range of motion of the elbow was statistically not significantly different except for pronation, which was slightly but significantly reduced after bone tunnel refixation. Isometric and isokinetic results as well as Morrey scores were statistically not different between the two surgical techniques. Both groups showed excellent postoperative results. Bone tunnel and suture anchor techniques are both equal and sufficient methods for the refixation of distal biceps tendon ruptures with excellent clinical and functional postoperative results.

The aim of this study is to determine the risk factors for migration and loosening associated with implantation of the pedestal cup. In a retrospective study the first 50 implantations of the pedestal cup in our hospital for high-grade acetabular defects (Paprosky classification II and III) were examined after a medium period of 26 months. Differences between radiologically loosened and osteal integrated implants in consideration of the preoperative osseous situation(defect size and morphology, bone density)as well as the implant positioning were determined as risk factors of an implant failure. Three (6%) intraoperative implant-associated complications occurred, which were in the phase of the initial learning curve. In the early postoperative period 10 hip dislocations (20%)occurred. Two septic loosenings (4%) and 6 aseptic loosenings (12%) were observed. In 7 further cases a significant migration of the implant was assessed in the first months after surgery, a solid osteal integration did not appear. As risk factors for an implant loosening were determined:a missing reconstruction of the defect behind the pedestal cup with allogenous bone graft(p = 0.002), a lateralisation of the rotation centre(p = 0.023), the absence of the craniolateral wall (p = 0.002) and the presence of osteoporosis(p = 0.026). The pedestal cup is an implant that is well usable in many high-grade acetabular defect situations with good mid-term results; however,contraindications do exist. In cases with a significant osteoporosis, a missing sclerosis of the cranial acetabulum as well as extended damage of the lateral ilium and its absence, respectively, alternative procedures should be considered. ","1863":"The main complication in total hip arthroplasty is aseptic loosening. Wear-induced inflammatory processes lead to periprosthetic granulation tissue, which induces bone degradation due to aseptic osteolysis. At the site of bone degradation,the cell populations have not been further analysed so far. Therefore, the present study was designed to analyse bone degradation tissue in comparison to periprosthetic granulation tissue. Tissue specimens of 14 patients with failed modular cup components of cementless total hip arthroplasties were obtained during revision surgery. Immunohistochemistry was performed by using anti-CD 31 (endothelial cells),anti-CD 45 (granulocytes and lymphocytes) and anti-CD 68 antibodies (mononuclear phagocyte system, MPS). Fibroblasts and osteoblasts were immunohistochemically distinguished as CD 31\/45\/68-negative cells. Semiquantitative analyses,including a morphometric study, were then performed both in the bone degradation zone and in the periprosthetic granulation tissue. At the site of bone degradation, the majority of cells belonged to MPS (73.6 +\/- 3.31%),while fibroblasts were significantly less frequent (9.6 +\/-1.67%). A distinct population of endothelial cells (7.75+\/- 1.4%) as well as lymphoplasmacellular cells (5.75+\/-2.35%) were observed. In addition,only a small amount of neutrophilic granulocytes (0.7 +\/- 0.4 %) were detected. In the periprosthetic granulation tissue, findings were very similar to those of the bone degradation zone,with the exception of higher amounts of fibroblasts (15.69 +\/- 2.74%). This study confirms that, in aseptic hip arthroplasty loosening, the majority of cells detected at the site of bone degradation are of the MPS, which are predominantly involved in osteolytic processes. There is no pathologically significant difference between the cell population of periprosthetic granulation tissue and granulation tissue at the sites of bone degradation. ","1864":"The aim of this investigation was to prove how changes of the biomechanical joint load affect the distribution of the bone density around a cementless socket implant as the consequence of a total hip endoprosthesis (THEP). 43 patients with different diagnoses were treated with Duraloc cup implants. Using a known biomechanical model, the biomechanical situation, the changes of the joint load and their influence on the local bone density were determined. The periprosthetic bone was divided into three zones. By means of DEXA measurement on the 10th postoperative day as well as at 3 and 12 months after the implantation the change of periprosthetic bone density was analysed. Following THEP implantation the biomechanical parameters normalised. The mean biomechanical score (with a maximum of 12 points) increased significantly from 6.9 preoperatively to 9.7 postoperatively. Patients with dysplasia coxarthrosis showed the most significant improvement from 2.1 to 8.6 points. The periprosthetic bone density was reduced on an average of 14.4 %, with highest values after 3 months(- 9.5%). The zone- and the diagnosis-related analysis of bone density in combination with analysis of the biomechanical load showed normalised biomechanical parameters and harmonised values of bone density. A remarkable loss of bone was seen in regions with primary high values of bone density. These zones are the lateral cranial edge of the socket in patients with dysplasia coxarthrosis and patients with coxa valga as well as the zones from the lower socket entrance to the socket pole in patients with protrusio acetabuli. In order to ensure a long life-time of the artificial joint, treatment with a THEP of patients suffering from coxarthrosis should lead to a biomechanically optimal reconstruction of the hip joint. Preoperatively existing pathological deformities which, due to mechanical fail loading, lead to an unequal distribution of the bone density must be corrected in order to avoid higher loading of the implant and increased polyethylene abrasion of the socket layer. ","1865":"Morse taper junctions of modular hip revision replacements are predilection sites for fretting, crevice corrosion, dissociation and breakage of the components. In this report we present the results of a retrieval analysis of a morse taper junction of a MRP-titanium modular revision replacement (MRP-Titanium, Peter Brehm GmbH, Weisendorf, Germany) after 11.5 years of in vivo use. In the context of this case report the significance of morse taper junctions in modular hip revision replacement under consideration of the current literature is also discussed.","1866":"A systematic review of randomized controlled trials reporting on the comparison of minimally invasive THA and standard incision technique. An online search in Medline, CINAHL,EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register was performed. Data concerning the endpoints duration of procedure, blood loss,complications, and Harris Hip Score (HHS) were extracted and pooled using a random effects model. 8 Studies observing a total of 917 patients(481 MIS, 436 Std.) were included. The weighted mean difference in duration of the procedures was 4 min, which is not significant(p = 0.21). There was significantly less blood loss in the mini group (p &lt; 0.001). The difference in increases in HHS of averagely 4.14 pts. was only borderline significant (p = 0.06). The complication odds ratio showed no significance (p = 0.71). There is only a marginal difference between these techniques. The minimally invasive total hip replacement is a variance of the standard procedure with better cosmesis. Differences in postoperative rehabilitation, however,are not within the scope of this study. ","1867":"The aim of this study was to establish and assess a one-step reconstruction procedure of deep osteochondral defects of the knee joint with bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation in osteochondritis dissecans. Between 2004 and 200622 patients with osteochondral defects in the weight-bearing zone of the femoral condyles(ICRS OCD III and IV) were reconstructed simultaneously with bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation (NOVOCART 3D). All patients were analysed prospectively. 17 Males and 5 females(age 28.3, range: 17-49 years) were surgically treated with the above-mentioned novel method. Before reconstruction osteochondral defects had an average defect area of 4.8 (2.4-9.0) cm2 and a depth of between 4 and 15 mm. For reconstruction an average of 2.6 (1-6) monocortical cancellous bone cylinders (diameter 8mm) was used to fill the osseous defect and to reconstruct the subchondral bone plate with adequate positioning of the monocortical layer of the graft. Then a Matrix-ACT was used to cover the reconstructed subchondral bone plate. The average follow-up was 16 (6-36) months. The average Tegner activity score was 4 (3-7) of 10. The Lysholm-Gillquistscore and the Cincinnati Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center score were significantly improved postoperatively. The IKDC-2000 questionnaire was also significantly increased by 50%. The simultaneous reconstruction of deep osteochondral detects of the knee joint with bone grafting and matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation in osteochondritis dissecans is a biological, one-step alternative to previously reported methods with encouraging first results. ","1868":"Here we present first clinical results of the treatment of patellofemoral cartilage lesions with a 3D collagen gel (CaReS). Isolated patellofemoral cartilage lesions in 14 patients (13 patellar, 1 trochlear) were treated by matrix-based ACT using a collagen gel seeded with autologous chondrocytes. In this study, only those patients were taken into account who complied with the inclusion criteria of the German working group \"tissue regeneration and tissue substitutes\". Data were analysed in accordance with the ICRS criteria and the Brittberg score. We present the 2-year postoperative clinical follow-up. After 2 years the ICRS-IKDC and Brittberg scores revealed a statistically significant improvement. The preoperative rating of the objectiveIKDC and functional ICRS score improved from 0\/14 and 2\/14 (14.3%) to 11\/14 (78.6%) in the categories A\/B and I\/II, respectively. 11 Patients(78.6%) judged the clinical outcome as excellent or good. The subjective IKDC score improved from 32.4 +\/- 8.4 prior to operation to 67.8 +\/- 27.4 at the 2-years follow-up. The use of 3D matrix systems could represent a promising improvement of conventional ACT in the treatment of patellofemoral cartilage lesions, but the results have to be verified by long-term investigations. ","1869":"The value of athroscopy in osteoarthritis(oa) of the knee remains uncertain. Many studies claim to prove efficacy of arthroscopy in oa of the knee, while other authors report that there is no such effect. The purpose of this study was to identify factors to predict the outcome of arthroscopy in oa of the knee. The modified Lysholm score was used to assess the outcome of arthroscopy in 49 patients after a follow up of 2.5 yrs. This was a retrospective outcome study. No correlation between modified Lysholm score and patient age and gender could be detected. There were significantly better outcomes in the group of patient with no deviation of axis and in the group of patients which did not show a progression of oa of the knee in the radiographs during follow-up. Even if the patients had more severe osteoarthritis. Patient selection is an important factor for a good outcome after arthroscopy in older patients with oa of the knee. Deviation of the axis and the \"activity\" of the osteoarthritis at the time of surgery are predictors for outcome. There is the need to establish diagnostic tools to measure the \"activity\" of oa of the knee before surgery.
