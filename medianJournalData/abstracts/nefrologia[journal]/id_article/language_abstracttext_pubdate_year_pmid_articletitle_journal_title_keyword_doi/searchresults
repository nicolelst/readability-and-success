The electronic search covered research published until June 20, 2020, and included five databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Lilacs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Library). Eligible studies were those including data from AKI occurrence in adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The primary outcome was AKI incidence, and the secondary outcome assessed was the AKI mortality. Additionally, the estimated incidence of renal replacement therapy (RRT) need also was verified. Using a standardized form prepared in Microsoft Excel, data were extracted by two independents authors, regarding the description of studies, characteristics of patients and clinical data on the AKI occurrence. We included 30 studies in this systematic review, of which 28 were included in the meta-analysis. Data were assessed from 18,043 adult patients with COVID-19. The AKI estimate incidence overall and at the ICU was 9.2% (4.6 - 13.9) and 32.6% (8.5 - 56.6), respectively. AKI estimate incidence in the elderly patients and those with acute respiratory disease syndrome was 22.9% (-4.0 - 49.7) and 4.3% (1.8 - 6.8), respectively. Patients with secondary infection, AKI estimate incidence was 31.6% (12.3 - 51.0). The estimate incidence of patients that required RRT was 3.2% (1.1 - 5.4) and estimate AKI mortality was 50.4% (17.0 - 83.9). The occurrence of AKI is frequent among adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and affects on average, up to 13.9% of these patients.

In addition, chemotherapy agents can cause renal toxicity by affecting the small blood vessels, glomeruli, tubules, and interstitium. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib may cause endothelial and podocyte damage leading to renal limited thrombotic microangiopathy, manifested by proteinuria and hypertension. We report a case of an elderly man with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) on treatment with sunitinib who had as a complication of a thrombotic microangiopathy manifested with nephrotic syndrome and difficult-to-control hypertension, which was controlled by stopping this drug but with a fatal outcome due to its malignant neoplasm.","25":"","26":null,"27":"After kidney transplantation, there is an overall increase in weight, which may increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and graft loss. But, not all patients gain weight, and the impact on the graft of this different evolution has not been well studied. The objective was to determine the causes of this different evolution and its effect on the graft. Retrospective single-center cohort study of 201 patients followed up after transplantation, analyzing the determinants of the variation in weight at one year using logistic regression, and its effect on graft survival at the end of follow-up using Cox regression. Globally, there was an average weight gain of 4.5kg in the first year, but 26.6% lost weight. 37.2% increased their BMI, while 9.5% decreased it. The determinants of the different evolution of weight were age (OR for every 10 years: 0.6, P=.002), previous dialysis modality (ref. hemodialysis) (OR 0.3, P=.003), and BMI before transplantation (OR 0.9, P=.017). The different evolution of weight did not influence the final situation of the graft. The BMI at one year did influence as a continuous variable (HR 1.3, P=.003), and obesity, with a worse evolution (HR 7.0, P=.025). Although not all patients gain weight after kidney transplantation, the different evolution of weight does not influence graft survival.

The risk factors that predispose to suffering from gout include non-modifiable factors such as gender, age, ethnicity and genetics, and modifiable factors such as diet and lifestyle. It has been shown that the heritability of uric acid levels in the blood is greater than 30%, which indicates that genetics play a key role in these levels. Hyperuricaemia is often a consequence of reduced renal urate excretion since more than 70% is excreted by the kidneys, mainly through the proximal tubule. The mechanisms that explain that hyperuricaemia associated with reduced renal urate excretion is, to a large extent, a proximal renal tubular disorder, have begun to be understood following the identification of two genes that encode the URAT1 and GLUT9 transporters. When they are carriers of loss-of-function mutations, they explain the two known variants of renal tubular hypouricaemia. Some polymorphisms in these genes may have an opposite gain-of-function effect, with a consequent increase in urate reabsorption. Conversely, loss-of-function polymorphisms in other genes that encode transporters involved in urate excretion (ABCG2, ABCC4) can lead to hyperuricaemia. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods have made it possible to locate new gout-related loci associated with reduced renal urate excretion (NIPAL1, FAM35A).","30":"","31":"","32":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ACE I\/D gene polymorphisms on diabetic kidney disease (DKD) risk.

This favorable effect was later disclosed in non-diabetic CKD patients. The EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial was the first trial that showed a reduction for the need for dialysis in patients suffering diabetic kidney disease (DKD) by 55%. This figure is double the score achieved by the angiotensin receptor blocker, Losartan, in RENAAL trial. The need for dialysis in DAPA-CKD trial was reduced in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD patients by 33%. The renal-specific composite outcome was reduced by 39% in EMPA-REG trial, 40% in CANVAS study, 47% in DECLARE-TIMI 58 study, 34% in CREDENCE trial, and 44% in DAPA-CKD trial. The greater surprise is the significant favorable effect of SGLT2Is on overall mortality in CKD patients with or without T2DM. Similar survival benefit was not previously encountered with any of the medications used in CKD patients with or without diabetes. In this review, we disclose the results of the DAPA-CKD trial, the CREDENCE trial and those of several cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOT) that used different SGLT2Is and showed that patients with lower eGFR levels may have greater benefit with respect to cardiovascular morbidity than patients with normal kidney function. In addition, we discuss the different mechanisms of action that explain the renal beneficial effects of SGLT2Is.","40":"","41":"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD) is profoundly impaired by their frailty, disability and decreased physical capacity. Especially among older patients, a high prevalence of low physical activity levels and reduced functional performance has been reported. Physical exercise training has been shown to have a beneficial impact, counteracting these same hazardous consequences of inactivity and sedentarism both on CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients on hemodialysis (HD) treatment. The evidence-based knowledge on the effects of physical exercise on ESKD patients undergoing Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) treatment is scarce, even though this is a continually growing population that shares the same risk factors and desired clinical outcomes as the previously mentioned groups of patients. Further investigation will be necessary to clarify whether this exercise-based approach may be suitable for the PD population. This paper's purpose is to review the available literature, including randomized controlled trials, reviews and meta-analysis results that assessed the impact of physical exercise on patients under PD treatment bearing in mind their HRQoL, physical functioning and cardiovascular parameters. Furthermore, it aims to evaluate the perceived significant barriers and limitations of the PD population in what concerns physical exercise practice and how nephrologists should address them.","42":"","43":"The complement system is a first line of defence against infectious, tumoral or autoimmune processes, and it is constitutively regulated to avoid excessive or unspecific activation. Factor H (FH), a most relevant complement regulator, controls complement activation in plasma and on the cellular surfaces of autologous tissues. FH shares evolutionary origin and structural features with a group of plasma proteins known as FH-Related Proteins (FHRs), which could act as FH functional antagonists. Studies in patient cohorts of atypical Haemolytic-Uraemic Syndrome (aHUS), C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G), and IgA nephropathy (IgAN), have identified rare genetic variants that give rise to severe FH and FHRs dysfunctions, and are major genetic predisposing factors. These patients also have a higher frequency of a few polymorphisms whose relevance as disease risk factors is incompletely understood. In the last years, the availability of specific reagents has allowed a more precise quantitation of FH and FHRs in plasma samples from patients and controls. These studies have revealed that some aHUS, C3G or IgAN risk polymorphisms determine mild changes in FH or FHRs levels that could somehow perturb complement regulation and favour disease pathogenesis.","44":"Hypouricemia may be caused by disorders leading to decreased UA production, oxidation of UA to allantoin by drugs or increased renal tubular loss of filtered UA, renal hypouricemia (RHUC).

Clinical importance of RHUC entity is mainly determined by emerging of acute kidney injury (AKI) after strenuous exercise and urolithiasis. Here, we report a case of RHUC with increased fractional excretion of uric acid value of more than 100%, serum uric acid level of nearly zero, and exercise-induced AKI episodes clinically and a new unpublished homozygous (biallelic) mutation of c.1419+2T&gt;G (IVS11+2T&gt;G) in the SLC2A9 gene genetically for the first time to our knowledge.

Previous studies have shown that HLA-DR15 and HLA-DR4 increase the risk of presenting it, while HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR7 protect against its development. We describe the first case of two non-twin siblings with AGBM and identical HLA, with HLA-DR4 as risk factor and HLA-DR7 as protection factor. We propose the importance of analyzing HLA in siblings of patients with AGBM, to determine the degree of genetic susceptibility and to carry out a close follow-up on them, with the aim of achieving an early diagnosis and treatment in case of presenting the disease.","47":null,"48":"Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD) have a high prevalence of malnutrition.

The nutritional status was determined using anthropometric data, body composition by Bioimpedance, blood and urine biochemical parameters and a 24-h recall questionnaire. The nutritional intervention was carried out in three different ways: individual, collective and telephone recall. At the beginning of the study, the BMI showed a situation of weight excess with a mean of 28.83 kg\/m2 (5.4) in men and 26.96 kg\/m2 (4.09) in women. 70% of our patients had overweight. The abdominal circumference was 105.3 cm (10.2) and 92.3 cm (13.7) for men and women respectively without significant changes throughout the study. The percentage of fat mass (FM) was high in both groups for men and women throughout the study. We did not find biochemical parameters of malnutrition and only significant differences were observed in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which increased in the intervention group.

We performed a search of multiple databases, trial registries, grey literature and conference proceedings up to October 2019. We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that examined any pharmacological intervention for preventing complications of idiopathic hypercalciuria (given for at least four months and six of follow-up). The primary outcomes were stone-free patients, urinary symptoms and severe adverse events. We included five RCTs (n=446 patients, all adults, 4 in individuals with kidney stones and 1 in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis). Diuretics were likely to increase the number of stone-free patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.33-1.96, moderate quality of evidence (QoE)); 274 more stone-free patients\/1000 patients treated (95% CI: 148-432) and produced a slight decrease in the stone formation rate (mean difference -0.18, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.06, low QoE); 180 fewer stones\/year\/1000 patients treated (95% CI: 300 r to 60). No data on urinary symptoms were reported. The association between diuretic use and severe adverse events was uncertain (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.60-41.88, very low QoE); 4 more severe adverse events\/1000 patients treated (95% CI: 0 fewer to 39 more). The addition of diuretics to a normal or modified diet probably reduces the number of stone recurrences and may decrease the stone formation rate. It is uncertain whether diuretics increase the occurrence of severe adverse events. There were no studies investigating other outcomes or in children.

This option may be attractive in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (CKD), since they exhibit both high-thromboembolic and bleeding risks. To evaluate the prognostic impact of the presence of CKD in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing LAAC peri-procedure and during the follow-up as compared with patients with preserved renal function. Retrospective, observational study that included 124 consecutive patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing LAAC in a university hospital, and the results were evaluated according to the baseline renal function of the patients. The median age was 75.5 years (IQR 67.6-80) and 62.1% were men, the median of CHA2DS2-Vasc and HASBLED scores was 4 (IQR 3-4) for both scores. Up to 57.3% of the total sample had CKD. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, but CKD patients were older and had a higher HASBLED score. During the procedure, no thromboembolic, bleeding events, or deaths were observed. Combining the time of hospitalization and follow-up, no significant differences were observed between groups in the annual rate of thromboembolic events (0.97\/100 patient-years [100PY] vs. 4.06\/100PY, p=.09), but there was a higher rate of bleeding events (5.67\/100PY vs. 13.3\/100PY, p=.033) and mortality among CKD patients (6.50\/100PY vs. 17.2\/100PY, p=.009), with an odds ratio of 2.711 (95% CI 1.96-6.95). In the multivariate analysis, a preserved eGFR was independently associated with a lower mortality risk. LAAC is a valid alternative to oral anticoagulation in patients with CKD and atrial fibrillation, with a low-rate of peri- and post-procedure complications, although CKD patients exhibited a higher risk of bleeding and mortality during the follow-up. However, these higher rates may not be necessarily related to the procedure.

We report the case of a 64 years old woman on chronic hemodialysis with PCNSL successfully treated with HD-MTX-based chemoimmunotherapy with an adjusted dose of 100mg\/m2, instead of the usual dose of 3500mg\/m2, and daily hemodialysis started 24h later. The patient had no significant toxicity and was in complete remission at 1 year after the end of the treatment.

However, figures on LDKT in Spain that had been continuously growing from 2005 to 2014, have experienced a continuous decrease in the last five years. One possible explanation for this decrease is that the significant increase in the number of deceased donors in Spain during the last years, both brain death and controlled circulatory death donors, might have generated the false idea that we have coped with the transplant needs. Moreover, a greater number of deceased donor kidney transplants have caused a heavy workload for the transplant teams. Furthermore, the transplant teams could have moved on to a more conservative approach to the information and assessment of patients and families considering the potential long-term risks for donors in recent papers. However, there is a significant variability in the LDKT rate among transplant centers and regions in Spain independent of their deceased donor rates. This fact and the fact that LDKT is usually a preemptive option for patients with advanced chronic renal failure, as time on dialysis is a negative independent factor for transplant outcomes, lead us to conclude that the decrease in LDKT depends on other factors. Thus, in the kidney transplant annual meeting held at ONT site in 2018, a working group was created to identify other causes for the decrease of LDKT in Spain and its relationship with the different steps of the process. The group was formed by transplant teams, a representative of the transplant group of the Spanish Society of Nephrology (SENTRA), a representative of the Spanish Society of Transplants (SET) and representatives of the Spanish National Transplant Organization (ONT). A self-evaluation survey that contains requests about the phases of the LDKT processes (information, donor work out, informed consent, surgeries, follow-up and human resources) were developed and sent to 33 LDKT teams. All the centers answered the questionnaire. The analysis of the answers has resulted in the creation of a national analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats (SWOT) of the LDKT program in Spain and the development of recommendations targeted to improve every step of the donation process. The work performed, the conclusions and recommendations provided, have been reflected in the following report: Spanish living donor kidney transplant program assessment: recommendations for optimization. This document has also been reviewed by a panel of experts, representatives of the scientific societies (Spanish Society of Urology (AEU), Spanish Society of Nephrology Nursery (SEDEN), Spanish Society of Immunology (SEI\/GETH)) and the patient association ALCER.

Renalase metabolizes catecholamines and have an important role in blood pressure (BP) regulation. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of kidney transplantation on renalase levels and BP in kidney donors and recipients. Twenty kidney transplant recipients and their donors were included in the study. Serum renalase levels and ambulatory BP values were measured in both donors and recipients before and after transplantation. Factor associated with change in renalase and BP levels were also evaluated. In donors; mean GFR and hemoglobin levels decreased while night-time systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels and serum renalase levels increased simultaneously after nephrectomy. Day-time SBP and DBP levels did not changed and the night\/day ratio of mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased significantly. In recipients, mean GFR increased, while mean serum renalase levels, creatinine and BP levels decreased after transplantation. Correlation analysis revealed that changes in MAP correlated with alteration in serum renalase levels and GFR. After transplantation, serum renalase levels increased in donors and decreased in recipients. The renalase levels are associated with change in MAP and circadian rhythm of BP in donors and recipients.

However, it is not a sufficiently studied technique. Transversal study of 117 arteriovenous fistulas. Two QA measurements were taken with the method described by the manufacturer (MR) and another with RM. RM is based on the obtention of an inverted recirculation registry at the beginning of the session and a single subsequent recirculation measurement with the lines in normal position. In the concordance analysis, the Bland-Altman method and Cohen's Kappa index were used. Very good concordance between MR and RM was evidenced for QA below 700ml\/min, but it worsens as flow increases. The median variability between the MR measurements (intra-method variability) was 3.4% (-17.13). This value did not differ from the median variability generated between MR and RM (inter-method variability), which was 2% (-14,12) (P=.287). The degree of agreement between the 2 to identify arteriovenous fistulas susceptible to intervention was very good (Kappa=0.834). The time spent using the RM was significantly shorter (P=.000) without evidence of variations in the Kt of the measurement sessions (P=.201). The thermodilution RM is valid to determine the flow of the vascular access, especially in QA lower than 700ml\/min, with great time savings, simplification of the procedure and without modifying the dialysis efficiency. The variability between the measurement by MR and RM is similar to that of MR. The concordance between methods in identifying potentially pathological arteriovenous fistulas is very good.

We define renal response as a decrease by at least 30% of proteinuria and\/or stabilization or improvement of FG. We consider that an anti-inflammatory response is a decrease of more than 50% in serum amyloid protein (PSA) and\/or C-reactive protein (CRP). We collected 3 cases of patients with histologically proven AA amyloidosis treated with TCZ (2 men; 1 woman; aged 55, 74 and 75 years). The follow-up was 13, 14 and 75 months. FG was stabilized in two patients. The third patient remained on hemodialysis during follow-up, although with excellent control of her underlying inflammatory disease. In all three cases, reduced PSA and CRP were observed. There have been no adverse events. The TCZ may be an effective and safe option in treatment of AA amyloidosis with renal involvement.

We present three patients of the type without salt wasting, which we will call transient early-childhood hyperkalemia without salt wasting, and discuss its physiopathology according to new insights into sodium and potassium handling by the aldosterone in distal nephron. In three children from 30 to 120-day-old admitted with bronchiolitis and growth delay hyperkalemia was found in routine laboratory. Further studies revealed a normal creatinine with inappropriately normal or low fractional excretion of potassium, accompanied by inadequately normal serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity for their higher plasma potassium levels, but without urine salt wasting. They also presented hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis with fractional excretion of bicarbonate 0.58-2.2%, positive urinary anion gap during metabolic acidosis and normal ability to acidify the urine. Based on these findings a diagnosis of transient early-childhood hyperkalemia without salt wasting was made and they were treated sodium bicarbonate and hydrochlorothiazide with favorable response.

For this reason, the clinical guidelines for the treatment of the anaemia in Nephrology advise the correction of the deficiency in the presence of anaemia. Iron replacement therapy is indicated in patients with CRF and anaemia (Hb &lt; 12 g\/dL) in accordance with the guidelines. There is no unanimity in the indication of iron replacement therapy in patients with Hb&gt;12 g\/dL, regardless of whether they have an absolute or functional iron deficiency. Intravenous iron replacement therapy is safe, more efficient and rapid than oral therapy for achieving an increase haemoglobin levels and reducing the dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. For the administration of intravenous iron in non-dialysis chronic renal failure patients a strategy of high doses and low frequency would be preferred on being more convenient for the patient, better conserving of the venous tree, and on being safe and cost-effective. Iron plays an essential role in energy metabolism and other body functions beyond the synthesis of haemoglobin synthesis, for which the iron deficiency, even in the absence of anaemia, could have a harmful effect in patients with CRF. The correction of the iron deficiency, in the absence of anaemia is associated with functional improvement in patients with heart failure, and in muscle function or fatigue in patients without CRF. Despite the evidence of benefits in the correction of iron deficiency in patients with CRF, more studies are required to evaluate the impact of the correction of the iron deficiency in the absence of anaemia on morbidity and mortality, quality of life and physical capacity, as well as the long-term effect of oral and intravenous iron replacement therapy in this population.","133":"","134":"","135":"","136":"Hepatitis B is an important agent of liver disease in patients with chronic kidney disease and chronic HBV infection promotes the development of CKD in the adult general population. Patients with CKD have a suboptimal response to various vaccines, and it remains unclear how we boost the immune response of CKD patients to HB vaccine. We performed a narrative review to assess the mechanisms of lower immunogenicity of HBV vaccine in CKD population; multiple approaches to improve the response rate of CKD patients to HBV vaccine have been reported. This is a very important topic for nephrologists who often serve as primary case providers for patients with CKD. The recommended vaccine schedule for CKD patients including those on maintenance dialysis is based on recombinant vaccine, four doses (month 0,1,2, and 6; 40mcg each) by intramuscular route (deltoid muscle). According to RCTs or observational studies, some recombinant vaccines with adjuvants (i.e., HBV-AS02 and HBV-AS04) look promising. HBV-AS04 showed to give better seroprotection rates and durable immune response over extended follow-ups compared with licensed HBV vaccine in CKD patients. The seroprotection rate was 95% (97\/102) and 82% (202\/248) in pre-dialysis and dialysis patients, respectively, one month after completing vaccine schedule with HBV-AS04. HBV-AS02 was superior to licensed vaccine in terms of seroprotection rate, 76.9% vs. 37.6%. We suggest adjuvanted recombinant (HBV-AS04) vaccine (0,1,2 and 3 months; 20 mcg each dose) and post vaccination testing of anti-HBs antibody after vaccination. Booster doses to patients whose anti-HBs titers fall below the seroprotection level (&lt;10IU\/mL) during the follow-up are appropriate. The patho-physiologic mechanisms responsible for the poor immunogenicity of HBV vaccine in CKD patients are under active investigation.

Until now, however, we have not had an overview of the teaching of nephrology in Spain. We have integrated information available in public databases with a survey and personal interviews with those responsible for teaching in Spanish medical faculties. In 2019, there were 44 universities offering a medicine degree in Spain, in 16 Autonomous Communities (34 of which were public and 10 private). For learning purposes, students have a number of hospital beds ranging from 0.2 to 4.7, and there are Autonomous Communities that have a higher proportion of students per inhabitant or per physician, such as Madrid or the Community of Navarra. In 16 universities there are tenured teaching staff (professors and lecturers), in 8 contracted medical lecturers, and in 2 assistant lecturers. In 21 medical faculties, theoretical and practical nephrology is taught by associate lecturers. The subject is taught between the third and fifth years of the degree, the median being the fourth year. It is usually integrated with another subject and only in the University of Navarra is it an independent subject, with 3 credits. The total number of hours devoted to theoretical teaching (both theoretical classes and seminars) is highly variable and ranges from 11 to 35, with a median of 17.5. Variability is observed in both the number of theoretical subjects (range 11 to 31) and seminars (range 0 to 9). Among the faculties that teach seminars, the ratio of theoretical topics to seminars ranges from 1.6 to 18. Most faculties evaluate clinical practices with various modalities and percentage of assessment. Knowledge is mostly assessed by a multiple choice exam. In conclusion, there is a high level of variability in the curriculum for the teaching of nephrology as part of a degree in medicine in Spain. Teaching staff who are tenured or who have a stable affiliation with universities make up just 23% of the total and, in many faculties, teaching depends exclusively on associate professors.","139":"","140":"Epicardial and mediastinal adipose tissue (EAT, MAT) are linked to metabolic syndrome and coronary artery disease.

We analyzed a prospective series of 104 cases. EAT thickness was quantified by a multislice synchronized computed tomography (MSCT). The follow-up period was 112.68 (109.94 -115.42) months. The optimal cut-off point of EAT for prediction of total mortality was 11.45mm (92.86% and 43.75%). EAT thickness was associated with serum albumin levels, serum triglyceride levels, phosphorus and calcium phosphate product. The EAT was greater in haemodialysis patients compared to those with advanced CKD (P&lt;.001). Patients with diabetes mellitus had greater EAT and MAT thickness (P=.018). At the end of follow up, the survival average time of patients with EAT thickness &lt;11.45mm was 97.48 months vs. 76.65 months for thickness &gt; 11.45mm (P=.007).

We carried out a narrative review based on guidelines, consensus documents by main working groups and the latest relevant clinical trials on RRT in the critically ill. We did not find enough evidence of any RRT modality having superior benefits in terms of patient survival, length of intensive care unit\/hospital stay or renal outcomes among critically ill patients, in spite of optimization of clinical indication, modality, timing of initiation and intensity of initial therapy. This is still a controverted matter, since only early start of high-flux CRRT has been proven beneficial over IHD among hemodynamically unstable postoperative patients. Our objective is to portrait current RRT practices in multidisciplinary management of critically ill patients by intensive care and nephrology professionals. Implication of a nephrologist in the assessment of hemodynamic status, coexisting medical conditions, renal outcome expectations and management of resources could potentially have benefits at the time of RRT selection and troubleshooting.","143":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Subclinical cardiac structural alterations have prognostic value in these patients. The aim was to analyse the prevalence of valvular calcification, the evolution and the relationship with different risk factors. Part of the sample of the NEFRONA study was randomly selected. Aortic and mitral valve calcification were analysed in echocardiograms performed at the baseline visit and at 24 months. We included 397 patients, the estimated basal glomerular filtrate (eGFR) was 33ml\/min with significant decrease to 30.9ml\/min. There was an increase in the area of carotid and femoral plaque, as well as an increase in patients with aortic and mitral calcification at 24 months. A positive association of mitral calcification at 24 months with age, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and calcium-phosphorus product (CaxP) at baseline visit was observed, without association with eGFR. Aortic calcification at 24 months was positively associated with age, phosphorous and total carotid plaque area at baseline, with no relationship to eGFR. A significant prevalence of valvular calcification was observed in patients with CKD without known cardiovascular disease.Two-year progression was observed independently of the eGFR. Patients with higher risk of mitral valve calcification were those with older age, higher ABI and CaxP product.

Many studies have shown that in diabetic and non-diabetic CKD, blocking the renin- angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) system with conversion enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) decreases proteinuria, progression of CKD and mortality, but there is still a significant residual risk of developing these events. In subjects treated with ACEi or ARBs there may be an aldosterone breakthrough whose prevalence in subjects with CKD can reach 50%. Several studies have shown that in CKD, the aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) added to ACEi or ARBs, reduce proteinuria, but increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Other studies in subjects treated with dialysis suggest a possible beneficial effect of antialdosteronic drugs on CV events and mortality. Newer potassium binders drugs can prevent \/ decrease hyperkalemia induced by RAAS blockade, and may reduce the high discontinuation rates or dose reduction of RAAS-blockers. The nonsteroidal MR blockers, with more potency and selectivity than the classic ones, reduce proteinuria and have a lower risk of hyperkalemia. Several clinical trials, currently underway, will determine the effect of classic MR blockers on CV events and mortality in subjects with stage 3b CKD and in dialysis patients, and whether in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and CKD, optimally treated and with high risk of CV and kidney events, the addition of finerenone to their treatment produces cardiorenal benefits. Large randomized trials have shown that sodium glucose type 2 cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce mortality and the development and progression of diabetic and nondiabetic CKD.

It is a prominently respiratory infection, with potential cardiological, hematological, gastrointestinal and renal complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is found in 0.5-25% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients and constitutes a negative prognostic factor. Renal damage mechanisms are not completely clear. We report the clinical evolution of hospitalized COVID-19 patients who presented with AKI requiring attention from the Nephrology team in a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. This is an observational prospective study including all COVID-19 cases that required hospitalization and Nephrology management from March 6th to May 12th 2020. We collected clinical and analytical data of baseline characteristics, COVID-19 and AKI evolutions. We analyzed 41 patients with a mean age of 66.8 years (SD 2.1), 90.2% males, and with a history of chronic kidney disease in 36.6%. A percentage of 56.1 presented with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome, and 31.7% required intensive care. AKI etiology was prerenal in 61%, acute tubular necrosis in the context of sepsis in 24.4%, glomerular in 7.3% and tubular toxicity in 7.3% of the cases. We reported proteinuria in 88.9% and hematuria in 79.4% of patients. A percentage of 48.8 required renal replacement therapy. Median length of stay was 12 days (IQR 9-23) and 22% of the population died. Patients who developed AKI during hospital stay presented with higher C-reactive protein, LDH and D-dimer values, more severe pulmonary damage, more frequent ICU admission, treatment with lopinavir\/ritonavir and biological drugs and renal replacement therapy requirement. Hypovolemia and dehydration are a frequent cause of AKI among COVID-19 patients. Those who develop AKI during hospitalization display worse prognostic factors in terms of pulmonary damage, renal damage, and analytical findings.

However, the expression and performance of AKI biomarkers in acute injury superimposed on preexisting CKD (AonC) remain elusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether biomarkers which robustly expressed in acute kidney injury could predict acute injury based on CKD. Mice were classified into cohorts: AKI, CKD, AonC and sham. The AonC model mice were subjected to renal bilateral ischemia\/reperfusion (I\/R) injury fourteen days after intraperitoneally administrated with 20mg\/kg aristolochic acid. Severity of acute ischemic injury was stratified by clamping the dissected bilateral renal arteries with non-traumatic microvascular clips for 20 or 35min. The AKI mice were induced with renal bilateral I\/R injury and CKD mice were crafted with 20mg\/kg aristolochic acid administrated intraperitoneally. Histology, genetic and protein expression of biomarkers were measured in three cohorts. We found that serum creatinine dramatically increased in severe (sAonC) but not in moderate (mAonC) injury mice. Upregulation of Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) mRNA, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) mRNA and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) protein indicated the onset of mAonC. An increase in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), rhomboid-like protein 2 (RHBDL2), Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) mRNA and protein, and a decrease in IGFBP7 protein were associated with sAonC. Our study revealed the variational expression of AKI biomarkers in AonC kidneys, and uncovered IGFBP7 protein can be used as a sensitive biomarker to predict and differentiate AonC severity.

However, very few studies have assessed the performance of full age spectrum (FAS) equation and the Asian modified Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation in the approximation of GFR in Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of the above two creatinine-based equations. A well designed single-center cross-sectional study was performed and the GFR was determined by 3 methods separately in the same day: technetium-99m-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) dual plasma sample clearance method (mGFR); FAS equation method; Asian modified CKD-EPI equation method. The gold standard method was the mGFR. Equations performance criteria considered correlation coefficient, bias, precision, accuracy and the ability to detect the mGFR less than 60ml\/min\/1.73m2. A total of 160 patients were enrolled. The diagnostic performance of FAS showed no significant difference in the correlation coefficient (0.89 vs 0.89), precision (15.9 vs 16.1ml\/min\/1.73m2), accuracy (75.0% vs 76.3%) and the ability to detect the mGFR less than 60ml\/min\/1.73m2 (0.94 vs 0.94) compared with the Asian modified CKD-EPI equation in all participants. The FAS showed a negative bias, while the new CKD-EPI equation showed a positive bias (-1.20 vs 1.30ml\/min\/1.73m2, P&lt;0.001). However, they were all near to zero. In the mGFR&lt;60ml\/min\/1.73m2 subgroup and mGFR&gt;60ml\/min\/1.73m2 subgroup were consistent with that in the whole cohort.

The prevalence of baclofen-induced neurotoxicity in patients with severe CKD was 7.0% (28 of 401 patients). There was no significant difference in the presence of neurotoxicity when the patients were classified as CKD stage 4, stage 5, and dialysis patients. There were significant differences in serum albumin levels and the presence of diabetic nephropathy between the patients with neurotoxicity and those without. The results from a multiple logistic regression analysis showed that serum albumin was independently associated with baclofen neurotoxicity (p=0.007). The minimum daily dose for baclofen neurotoxicity was 10mg, 10mg, and 5mg in patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, and dialysis, respectively. In this study, the prevalence of baclofen-induced neurotoxicity in patients with severe CKD was 7.0%. Serum albumin was identified as an independent risk factor for neurotoxicity. We recommend initially administering a daily dose of 7.5mg for patients with severe CKD stages 4 and 5, and a daily dose of 2.5mg for patients receiving dialysis.

A study of changes in expression of certain miRNAs in the kidney has supplied evidence on their pathogenic role and therapeutic potential in nephrology. This review proposes a nanotechnology approach based on the binding of analogs or inhibitors of miRNAs formed by peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) to peptides with a transmembrane structure sensitive to a low pH, called pHLIPs (pH [low] insertion peptides). The review draws on the concept that an acidic pH in the microenvironment of the renal tubule may facilitate concentration and distribution of the pHLIP-PNA complex in this organ. In this context, we have demonstrated for the first time that targeted administration of miR-33 inhibitors with the pHLIP system effectively prevents the development of renal fibrosis, thus opening up this technology to new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases.","194":"","195":"","196":"The use of proprotein convertase subtilisin\/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9i) has changed the clinical practice of dyslipidemia and their effects in cardiovascular events.

Low concentrations of magnesium (Mg) in blood have been linked to the development of diabetes, hypertension, arrhythmias, vascular calcifications and an increased risk of death in the general population and in haemodialysis patients. The composition of the dialysis fluid in terms of its magnesium concentration is one of the main determinants of magnesium in haemodialysis patients. To study magnesium concentrations in haemodialysis patients, their predictive mortality rate and what factors are associated with hypomagnesaemia and mortality in haemodialysis. Retrospective study of a cohort of prevalent haemodialysis patients followed up for two years. Serum magnesium was measured every six months. The analysis used the initial and average magnesium values for each patient, comparing patients with magnesium below the mean (2.1mg\/dl) with those with magnesium above the mean. During the follow-up, three types of dialysis fluid were used: type 1, magnesium 0.5 mmol\/l; type 3, magnesium 0.37 mmol\/l (both with acetate); and type 2, magnesium 0.5 mmol\/l with citrate. We included 137 haemodialysis patients in the study, of which 72 were male and 65 were female, with a mean age of 67 (15) [26-95] years old. Of this group, 57 patients were diabetic, 70 were on online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) and 67 were on high-flow haemodialysis (HF-HD). The mean magnesium of the 93 patients with dialysis fluid type 1 was 2.18 (0.37) mg\/dl. In the 27 patients with dialysis fluid type 3 it was 2.02 (0.42) mg\/dl. And in the 17 with dialysis fluid type 2 it was 1.84 (0.24) mg\/dl (p=.01). There was a pronounced direct relationship between Mg and P and albumin. After a mean follow-up of 16.6 (8.9) [3-24] months, 77 remained active, 24 had died and 36 had been transplanted or transferred. Patients with magnesium above than 2.1mg\/dl had a longer survival (p=.008). The survival of patients with the three types of dialysis fluid did not differ significantly (Log-Rank, p=.424). Corrected for blood magnesium, patients with dialysis fluid with citrate have better survival (p=.009). The COX regression analysis shows how age, serum albumin, magnesium, dialysis technique and type of dialysis fluid have an independent predictive mortality rate. Low serum magnesium levels have a greater association with an increased risk of mortality compared to high levels. The type of dialysis fluid affects the magnesium concentration and the risk of death.

Regulated cell death, either through apoptosis or regulated necrosis offers the possibility of therapeutic intervention. Necroptosis and ferroptosis are among the best studied forms of regulated necrosis in the context of kidney disease. We now review the current evidence supporting a role for ferroptosis in kidney disease and the implications of this knowledge for the design of novel therapeutic strategies. Ferroptosis is defined functionally, as a cell modality characterized by peroxidation of certain lipids, constitutively suppressed by GPX4 and inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic antioxidants. There is functional evidence of the involvement of ferroptosis in diverse forms of kidneys disease. In a well characterized nephrotoxic acute kidney injury model, ferroptosis caused an initial wave of death, triggering an inflammatory response that in turn promoted necroptotic cell death that perpetuated kidney dysfunction. This suggests that ferroptosis inhibitors may be explored as prophylactic agents in clinical nephrotoxicity or ischemia-reperfusion injury such as during kidney transplantation. Transplantation offers the unique opportunity of using anti-ferroptosis agent ex vivo, thus avoiding bioavailability and in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics issues.","204":"","205":"The experience of a tertiary hospital and four hemodialysis centers attached to it during the COVID-19 epidemic is described.

Expression profiling of miR-9-5p and EMBP1 were performed in RCC cell lines and tumor samples. To evaluate miR-9-5p and EMBP1's role in proliferation, invasion, migration, and colony formation, we performed in vitro assays along with studies in a xenograft tumor model. In silico binding site analysis using the RNA22 algorithm, RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP), and luciferase reporter assays were used to validate a direct interaction between EMBP1 and miR-9-5p. Changes in key proteins were also analyzed. miR-9-5p was significantly down-regulated, and EMBP1 was significantly up-regulated, in RCC cell lines and tumor tissue. The clinicopathological characteristics of RCC patients significantly correlated with their expression. Overexpression of miR-9-5p or EMBP1 suppression in RCC cell lines significantly retarded their proliferative, migratory, and invasive behavior, in addition to promoting apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. EMBP1 directly binds to and negatively regulates miR-9-5p. The EMBP1-miR-9-5p axis dysregulated the expression of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers E-cadherin, claudin, and vimentin, the stemness markers KLF4 and Nanog, and the cell cycle checkpoint gene cyclin E2 (CCNE2) and its downstream mediator E2F1. miR-9-5p overexpression or EMBP1 suppression inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo, effects that were abrogated by CCNE2 overexpression.

This retrospective study included adult septic patients receiving intravenous CMS for at least 48h (January 2007-December 2014). AKI was assessed using KDIGO criteria. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was estimated by the 4-variable MDRD equation. Logistic and linear models were performed to evaluate the risk factors for AKI and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Among 126 patients treated with CMS; the incidence of AKI was 48.4%. Sepsis-severe sepsis (OR 8.07, P=0.001), sepsis-septic shock (OR 42.9, P&lt;0.001), and serum creatinine (SCr) at admission (OR 6.20, P=0.009) were independent predictors.

Randomized clinical trials (RCT) comparing an intervention that included an exercise component with a control group without physical exercise in non-dialysis patients with CKD from 2007 to 2018 in English and Spanish were included. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Ovid (Medline) and PEDro databases were used for the search. Effects of physical exercise were summarized by the standardized mean difference (SMD). No differences were found in glomerular filtration rate or proteinuria between the intervention group and the control group: SMD -0.3 (P=.81); SMD 26.6 (P=.82). Positive effects were obtained on peak oxygen consumption: SMD 2.5 (P&lt;.001), functional capacity: SMD 56.6 (P&lt;.001), upper limb strength: SMD 6.8 (P&lt;.001) and hemoglobin: SMD 0.3 (P=.003).

Most gratifying work aspects refer to professional excellence, successful transplants and relationship with patients and their families. The donation interview is considered to be the most stressful moment, in response to which coordinators develop different emotional paths, conditioned by their experience, families' response to donation and its interpretation by the health team and professional (self) evaluation.

We compared 66 pre-emptive with 66 non pre-emptive recipients, who received a first renal graft performed at our centre, matched by age and gender of donors and recipients, time of transplant, immunological risk, immunosuppression and cold ischaemia time. Early graft loss, incidence of acute rejection, delayed graft function, renal function at 12 and 36 months and graft and recipient survival were assessed in this period. The percentage of recipients who presented early graft loss, delayed graft function and acute rejection was similar in both groups. No differences were observed in their renal function at 12 and 36 months after transplantation, as well as the actuarial survival of patients (P=0.801) and grafts (P=0.693) in the studied period. The total calculated cost of the period on dialysis for the control group was 8,033,893.16 euros.

Molecular confirmation of PKDTS is important for a prompt diagnosis, which can be complicated by the phenotypic heterogeneity of PKD and the absence of a clear phenotype-genotype correlation. Herein, we report three PKDTS pediatric patients.

In this patient, chromosomal microarray analysis showed a gross deletion of 230.8kb that involved TSC2, PKD1 and 13 other protein-coding genes, plus a heterozygous duplication of a previously undescribed copy number variant of 242.9kb that involved six protein-coding genes, including SSTR5, in the 16p13.3 region. Given the observations that the case 3 presented the mildest renal phenotype, harbored three copies of SSTR5, and the reported inhibition of cystogenesis (specially in liver) observed with somatostatin analogs in some patients with autosomal dominant PKD, it can be hypothesized that other genetic factors as the gene dosage of SSTR5 may influence the PKD phenotype and the progression of the disease; however, future work is needed to examine this possibility.","315":"Instrumental Activities of Daily Life (IADL) requires a higher level of personal autonomy and interaction with the environment than the basic activities of daily life (BADL).

In recent years, its diagnosis in pediatric age has been more frequent because it has been known that it can debut with very different symptoms, in the absence of kidney stone formation. The discovery of genetic hypercalciuric stone-forming rats has allowed us to glimpse the pathophysiological mechanism of IH since they show many data in common with humans with IH as normal levels of blood calcium, intestinal calcium hyperabsorption, increased bone resorption and a defect in the renal tubular calcium reabsorption. In 1993, it was shown that in these animals there is an increase in the number of vitamin D receptors (VDR) in the intestine, which favors an increase in the functional capacity of calcitriol-VDR complexes that explains the increase in intestinal transport of calcium. The same happens at the bone level producing a greater resorption. In our opinion, IH is a 'metabolic anomaly' or, better, an inheritable constitutive metabolic characteristic. In this sense, what patients with IH would inherit is the availability of having a greater number of VDRs in their cells than those with normal urinary calcium excretion.

Despite the great technological evolution that has taken place in recent years, most patients are still treated with in-centre haemodialysis and their prognosis remains far from desirable. Since 1980, there has been an increasing interest in the development of a portable device for renal replacement therapy (RRT), which ultimately led to the creation of the Wearable Artificial Kidney (WAK) and the Wearable Ultrafiltration (WUF) system. Portable RRT devices may be acceptable alternatives that deal with several unmet clinical needs of ESRD patients. So far, 3 important human studies with WAK and WUF have been carried out and, although these devices require considerable technological improvement, their safety and efficacy in solute clearance and fluid removal is undeniable. In this article, we review the evolution of the WAK and the WUF and the main clinical trials performed, highlighting some of their technical features. Some of the main possible clinical advantages that could be achieved with these devices, as well as some economic aspects, are also pointed out. In the future, all renal replacement therapy techniques should evolve to perfectly match the clinical and personal needs of each patient, allowing for an improved health-related quality of life.","351":"","352":null,"353":"Renal haemorrhage is a potentially life-threatening event requiring emergency surgery.

A significant number of patients with CKD have decreased bone mineral density (BMD), are at high risk of fragility fractures and have an increased morbidity and mortality risk. With an ageing population, these observations are not only dependent on \"renal osteodystrophy\" but also on the associated OP. As BMD predicts incident fractures in CKD patients (partI), we now aim to analyse the potential therapeutic consequences. Post-hoc analyses of randomised studies have shown that the efficacy of drugs such as alendronate, risedronate, raloxifene, teriparatide and denosumab is similar to that of the general population in patients with a mild\/moderate decline in their glomerular filtration rate (especially CKD-3). These studies have some flaws however, as they included mostly \"healthy\" women with no known diagnosis of CKD and generally with normal lab test results. Nevertheless, there are also some positive preliminary data in more advanced stages (CKD-4), even though in CKD-5D they are more limited. Therefore, at least in the absence of significant mineral metabolism disorders (i.e. severe hyperparathyroidism), the potential benefit of these drugs should be considered in patients with a high or very high fracture risk. It is an important change that the new guidelines do not make it a requirement to first perform a bone biopsy and that the risk\/benefit ratio of these drugs may be justified.

However, profound effects and moderate evidence on the two drugs remains poorly defined at this period. The meta-analysis aims to summarize current best evidence on the efficacy as well as safety of TAC and CTX among IMN patients. We searched the publications on comparison of the safety and efficacy of TAC versus CTX for IMN up to April 2018. After rigorous reviewing on the quality, the data was extracted from eligible trials. All trials analyzed the summary hazard ratios (HRs) of the endpoints of interest. Moderate-strong evidence indicated that tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide had comparable effects on remission rate (either CR or PR) (p&gt;0.05). No significant differences were found in the following parameters: the rates of diarrhea, glucose intolerance (or diabetes mellitus), gastrointestinal syndrome, as well as hypertension because of adverse effects (p&gt;0.05). However, patients with TAC therapy had a higher chance to develop urinary tract infection (p=0.010) and tremor (p=0.006). Additionally, remarkably higher risk existed in leukopenia among the CTX group as compared with the TAC group (p=0.03). This meta-analysis presents a comprehensive assessment of current available evidence for the therapy of IMN, indicating a comparable remission rate with both TAC and CTX, while the long-term effects are needed for further verification. Nevertheless, different adverse effect profiles of two groups need careful consideration.

The primary endpoint was time from measurement to AKI diagnosis. AKI developed in 610 (30.8%) and 623 (31.4%) patients in the exploratory and validation samples, respectively. Estimated glomerular filtration rate using the MDRD-4 equation showed the best AKI prediction capacity, with values for the AUC ROC curves between 0.700 and 0.946. We obtained different cut-off values for estimated glomerular filtration rate depending on the degree of AKI severity and on the time elapsed between surgery and parameter measurement. Results were confirmed in the validation sample. Postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate using the MDRD-4 equation showed good ability to predict AKI following cardiac surgery one or 2days in advance.

Early detection might prevent patients from developing chronic kidney disease and requirement for renal replacement therapy. If we compare AKI with acute coronary syndrome, in which an increase in cardiac troponin may trigger early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention, we could extrapolate a similar technique in patients with early AKI without changes in urinary frequency or serum creatinine. The objective is to identify biomarker-positive, creatinine-negative patients that would allow therapeutic interventions to be initiated before finding changes in serum creatinine, preventing kidney damage. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 are cell cycle arrest biomarkers that have demonstrated, in recent clinical trials, to have good sensitivity and specificity for early detection of AKI. Other recent studies have shown that the joint use of these biomarkers with serum creatinine and urine production could improve the prognosis of AKI in critical patients. The application of these biomarkers in clinical practice would enable the early identification of patients at risk of AKI, establishing interventions that would improve the survival of renal function.","470":"","471":"","472":"","473":"","474":"","475":"","476":"","477":"","478":"","479":"","480":null,"481":null,"482":"Various genetic and environmental factors are involved in urolithiasis.

In C3 glomerulopathy, a high percentage of patients have circulating levels of the autoantibody called C3NeF, which causes systemic dysregulation of the complement system. In some cases, the presence of this antibody has been related with abnormalities of adipose tissue, causing acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome). Acquired partial lipodystrophy is an extremely rare disorder affecting the distribution of subcutaneous adipose tissue and that mainly onsets during childhood. These patients, in addition to possibly presenting with all the metabolic disorders associated with the adipose tissue defect, present with C3 hypocomplementemia and C3NeF and 25% have developed C3 glomerulopathy. Although it has been known for some time how the dysregulation of the complement system affects the kidneys, it remains unknown how it exactly affects adipose tissue; nevertheless, the relationship is quite clear.

Despite the fact that this has been known for decades, to date, an appropriate diagnostic strategy has yet to be established. Apart from bone biopsy, which is invasive and scarcely used, no other technique is available to accurately establish the risk of fracture in kidney patients. Techniques applied to the general population, such as bone densitometry, have not been subjected to sufficient external validation and their use is not systematic. This means that the identification of patients at risk of fracture and therefore those who are candidates for preventive strategies is an unmet need. Bone strength, defined as the ability of the bone to resist fracture, is determined by bone mineral density (measured by bone densitometry), trabecular architecture and bone tissue quality. The trabecular bone score estimates bone microarchitecture, and low values have been described as an independent predictor of increased fracture risk. Bone microindentation is a minimally invasive technique that measures resistance of the bone to micro-cracks (microscopic separation of mineralised collagen fibres), and therefore bone tissue biomechanical properties. The superiority over bone densitometry of the correlation between the parameters measured by trabecular bone score and microindentation with the risk of fracture in diverse populations led us to test its feasibility in chronic kidney disease and kidney transplant patients.","520":"Vascular calcification is a pathology characterized by the deposition of calcium-phosphate in cardiovascular structures, mainly in the form of hydroxyapatite crystals, resulting in ectopic calcification. It is correlated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and myocardial infarction in diabetic patients and in those with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Vascular smooth muscle cells are sensitive to changes in inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels. They are able to adapt and modify some of their functions and promote changes which trigger calcification. Pi is regulated by parathyroid hormone and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Changes in the transport of Pi are the primary factor responsible for the regulation of Pi homeostasis and the calcification process. Synthesis of calcification inhibitors is the main mechanism by which cells are able to prevent vascular calcification. Extracellular pyrophosphate (PPi) is a potent endogenous inhibitor of calcium-phosphate deposition both in vivo and in vitro. Patients with CKD show lower levels of PPi and increased activity of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase. Numerous enzymes implicated in the metabolism of PPi have been associated with vascular calcifications. PPi is synthesized from extracellular ATP by nucleotide pyrophosphatase\/phosphodiesterase from extracellular ATP hydrolysis. PPi is hydrolyzed into Pi by tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. ATP can be hydrolyzed to Pi via the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase family. All these enzymes must be in balance, thereby preventing calcifications. However, diseases like CKD or diabetes induce alterations in their levels. Administration of PPi could open up new treatment options for these patients.","521":"KDRI \/ KDPI are tools use in kidney donor evaluation.

The purpose of this study was to compare the inflammatory effect in immunocompetent blood cells of acetate dialysate and citrate dialysate.

ICAM-1 was determined and levels of reactive oxygen species and total microvesicles were quantified. Unlike the citrate dialysates, the dialysates with acetate (dialysate 3 and dialysate 4) induced increased ICAM-1 expression density in THP-1 cells; an increase in ICAM-1 expression was observed in the immunocompetent cells of healthy subjects with acetate dialysate (dialysate 3 and dialysate 4) but not with citrate dialysate (dialysate 1 and dialysate 2).

Reactive oxygen species expression and the number of microvesicles increased significantly with acetate dialysate but not with citrate dialysate in the cells of both healthy subjects and haemodialysed patients. At the concentrations in which it is generally used in clinical practice, acetate-based dialysate increases oxidative stress and the total number of microvesicles and may induce other pro-inflammatory stimuli typical of uraemic patients on haemodialysis.

Retrospective analysis of the graphs of all HD sessions performed during one month (October 2015) on 97 patients, analysing all recorded complications. The consideration of these complications as AEs was based on a consensus among 13 health professionals and 2 patients. The severity, frequency and detection of each AE was evaluated by the FMEA system. We analysed 1303 HD treatments in 97 patients. A total of 383 complications (1 every 3.4 HD treatments) were recorded. Approximately 87.9% of them was deemed AEs and 23.7% complications related with patients' underlying pathology. There was one AE every 3.8 HD treatments. Hypertension and hypotension were the most frequent AEs (42.7 and 27.5% of all AEs recorded, respectively). Vascular-access related AEs were one every 68.5 HD treatments. A total of 21 errors (1 every 62 HD treatments), mainly related to the HD technique and to the administration of prescribed medication, were registered. The highest risk priority number, according to the FMEA, corresponded to errors related to patient body weight; dysfunction\/rupture of the catheter; and needle extravasation. HD complications are frequent. Consideration of some of them as AEs could improve safety by facilitating the implementation of preventive measures.

Recent advances have improved our understanding of cell death in acute kidney injury. First, apoptosis results in cell loss, but does not trigger an inflammatory response. However, clumsy attempts at interfering with apoptosis (e.g. certain caspase inhibitors) may trigger necrosis and, thus, inflammation-mediated kidney injury. Second, and most revolutionary, the concept of regulated necrosis emerged. Several modalities of regulated necrosis were described, such as necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis and mitochondria permeability transition regulated necrosis. Similar to apoptosis, regulated necrosis is modulated by specific molecules that behave as therapeutic targets. Contrary to apoptosis, regulated necrosis may be extremely pro-inflammatory and, importantly for kidney transplantation, immunogenic. Furthermore, regulated necrosis may trigger synchronized necrosis, in which all cells within a given tubule die in a synchronized manner.

Despite this, the management of hyponatremia patients remains problematic. The prevalence of hyponatremia in a wide variety of conditions and the fact that hyponatremia is managed by clinicians with a broad variety of backgrounds have fostered diverse institution- and specialty-based approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

In addition to a rigorous approach to the methodology and evaluation of the evidence, the document focuses on patient-positive outcomes and on providing a useful tool for clinicians involved in everyday practice.

Vascular calcifications (VCs) directly contribute to overall morbidity and mortality, especially in CKD. In part, this high mortality is due to elevated levels of phosphorus in the blood. Therefore, control of dietary phosphorus is essential. Dietary phosphorus can be classified according to its structure in organic phosphorus (plant and animal) and inorganic (preservatives and additives). Plant-phosphorus (legumes and nuts), mainly associated with InsP6, is less absorbable by the human gastrointestinal tract as the bioavailability of phosphorous from plant-derived foods is very low.

Moreover, although only in experimental conditions, selective activators of the vitamin D receptor seem to have a wider therapeutic margin against CV calcification. Finally, calcimimetics seem to attenuate the progression of CV calcification in dialysis patients.

In forty postdilutional OL-HDF sessions, the reduction rates of toxins of different molecular weights were measured in 13 patients, including protein-bound molecules such as p-cresyl sulphate, indoxyl sulphate and homocysteine. Total convective volume was 28.3 (5.1) litres (range 16.3-38.0 litres). Mean reduction rate of protein-bound molecules was 44.4% (15.7%), 48.7% (14.1%) and 58.6% (8.8%) for p-cresyl sulphate, indoxyl sulphate and homocysteine, respectively. Moreover, a statistically significant direct association was found between the reduction rates of all three molecules, the replacement volume and the Kt\/V. High convective volumes during postdilution OL-HDF are associated with increased removal of protein-bound uraemic toxins.

Cross-sectional observational study including 76 stable patients. Dry weight was clinically assessed. BIS and echocardiography were performed. Weekly time-averaged fluid overload (TAFO) and relative fluid overload (FO\/ECW) were calculated using BIS measurements. Based on TAFO three groups were defined: A- dehydrated, TAFO &lt;-0.25 L 32 P (42%); B- normohydrated, TAFO between -0.25 and 1.5 l: 26 (34%); C- overhydrated, TAFO&gt;1.5 l: 18 (24%).

First group served as control, the second group (Gm group) was administered orally 80mg\/kg body weight gentamicin for 7 days, and the third group (GmP group) was administered same dose of gentamicin with propolis (500mg\/kg body weight) for 7 days. Various parameters were used to study the renal toxicity. Gentamicin caused significant renal damage as evident by the rise in BUN levels, diminished glomeruli hypocellularity, moderately dilated tubules, and mild loss of brush border, severe infiltration, extensive tubular degeneration and presence of tubular cast. Histochemistry results show presence of collagen and reticular fibres. Immunohistochemical reactions show kidney injury (Kim-1 gene-expression), oxidative stress (MDA gene-expression), and an increase in apoptosis (caspase-3 gene-expression). Co-administration of propolis with gentamicin showed significant decrease in BUN levels, appearance of healthy glomeruli with normal cellularity, reduction of tubular injury, decrease of collagen and reticular fibres deposition, reduction of apoptosis, kidney injury and oxidative stress.

We also justify the use of CV calcification assessment in regular nephrology clinical practice, because CV calcification is an important predictor of clinical outcome in these patients. Consequently, we believe that CV calcification assessment is a tool that could and should be used by nephrologists when making a decision concerning individual patients, consistent with the current trend of an ever-more-personalised therapeutic approach.","693":"","694":"","695":null,"696":"The intestinal microflora maintains a symbiotic relationship with the host under normal conditions, but its imbalance has recently been associated with several diseases.

By fermenting undigested products that reach the colon, the intestinal microflora produce indoles, phenols and amines, among others, that are absorbed by the host, accumulate in CKD and have harmful effects on the body. These gut-derived uraemic toxins and the increased permeability of the intestinal barrier in CKD have been associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress and have been involved in various CKD-related complications, including cardiovascular disease, anaemia, mineral metabolism disorders or the progression of CKD.

Calcium excretion is regulated by the distal convoluted tubule and connecting tubule, where the epithelial calcium channel TRPV5 can be found, which limits the rate of transcellular calcium transport. The dynamic presence of the TRPV5 channel on the surface of the tubular cell is mediated by an endosomal recycling process. Different intrarenal factors are involved in calcium channel fixation in the apical membrane, including the anti-ageing hormone klotho and tissue kallikrein (TK). Both proteins are synthesised in the distal tubule and secreted in the tubular fluid. TK stimulates active calcium reabsorption through the bradykinin receptor B2 that compromises TRPV5 activation through the protein kinase C pathway. TK-deficient mice show hypercalciuria of renal origin comparable to that seen in TRPV5 knockout mice. There is a polymorphism with loss of function of the human TK gene R53H (allele H) that causes a marked decrease in enzymatic activity. The presence of the allele H seems to be common at least in the Japanese population (24%). These individuals have a tendency to greater calcium and sodium excretion in urine that is more evident during furosemide infusion. Future studies should analyse if manipulating the renal kallikrein-kinin system can correct idiopathic hypercalciuria with drugs other than thiazide diuretics.","704":null,"705":"The kidneys are vital organs responsible for excretion, fluid and electrolyte balance and hormone production.

This latter covariate showed a beneficial effect over the development of SCD. By competing-risk regression, in which the competing event was non-sudden death from any cause, only age and comorbidity index remained significantly associated with SCD.

Its weapons are direct cellular cytotoxicity, identified from the beginning of organ transplantation, and\/or antibodies, limited to hyperacute rejection by preformed antibodies and not as an allogenic response. This resulted in allogenic response being thought for decades to have just a cellular origin. But the experimental studies by Gorer demonstrating tissue damage in allografts due to antibodies secreted by B lymphocytes activated against polymorphic molecules were disregarded. The special coexistence of binding and unbinding between antibodies and antigens of the endothelial cell membranes has been the cause of the delay in demonstrating the humoral allogenic response. The endothelium, the target tissue of antibodies, has a high turnover, and antigen-antibody binding is non-covalent. If endothelial cells are attacked by the humoral response, immunoglobulins are rapidly removed from their surface by shedding and\/or internalization, as well as degrading the components of the complement system by the action of MCP, DAF and CD59. Thus, the presence of complement proteins in the membrane of endothelial cells is transient.

An adequate bowel cleansing is one of the keys to achieving best results with this technique. Oral sodium phosphate solution (OSP) had a widespread use in the 90s decade. Its efficacy was similar to polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution, but with less cost and convenient administration. Series of patients with acute renal failure due to OSP use have been reported. However, large cohorts of patients found no difference in the incidence of renal damage between these two solutions. From 2006 to 2009 we identified twelve cases of phosphate nephropathy after colonoscopy prepared with OSP. All patients were followed up to six months. All patients had received just a single dose. We analyzed 12 cases with phosphate nephropathy; three patients debuted with AKI and nine patients had chronic renal injury. Four cases were confirmed with renal biopsy. One patient with AKI needed hemodialysis at diagnosis without subsequent recovery. Two patients (both with chronic damage) fully recovered their previous renal function. The remaining patients (nine) had an average loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate of 24ml\/min\/1.73m(2). The use of OSP can lead to both acute and chronic renal damage.

Aggregated data and individual patient records were used from participating regional renal disease registries and that National Transplant Organisation registry. The reference population was the official population on January 1st of each year studied. Data on incidence and prevalence were based on aggregated data, while the survival analysis was calculated from individual patient records. The study period was 2007 to 2013 for prevalence, incidence and transplantation, and survival was analysed for 2004-2012. The population covered by the registry was a minimum of 95.3% to 100% of the Spanish population for aggregated data. The EU27 age and gender distributions of the European population for 2005 were used to adjust incidence and prevalence for age and gender. Survival probabilities were calculated for incident patients between the years 2004 and 2013 using the Kaplan-Meier method to calculate unadjusted patient survival probability. The log rank test was applied to compare survival curves according to some risk factors. Cox proportional hazards model was created to study the potential predictors of survival. In 2013, the total number of patients in Spain that started RRT was 5,705 for 95.3% of the total Spanish population, with an unadjusted rate of 127.1pmp. The evolution from 2007 to 2013 showed a gradual decline from 127.4pmp in 2007 to 120.4pmp in 2012, with a small upturn to 127.1 in 2013. The adjusted incidence rate for the year 2013 was 121.5pmp for the total population, 158.7pmp for males and 83.1pmp for females. The most frequent cause of primary renal disease in incident was diabetes mellitus: 20.4% in 2007, which increased to 24.6% in 2013. The percentage of transplant as first RRT increased from 1.7% in 2007 to 4.2% in 2013. The total number of patients in RRT for 95.3% of the population in 2013 was 50,567, with an unadjusted prevalent rate of 1,125.7pmp. The adjusted prevalence rate for 2013 was 1,087.5 pmp (1,360.7 pmp for males and 809.8pmp for females). The percentage of diabetes mellitus in prevalent patients evolved from 13.9% in 2007 to 14.9% (168 pmp) in 2013. The percentage of transplanted prevalent patients with functioning grafts evolved from 49.3% in 2007 to 51.5% in 2013.

In 208 patients (12%), the UPE progressed, in 1233 (70.5%) it remained stable and in 306 (17.5%) an improvement was observed. We found that the level of UPE influenced graft survival, particularly if a progression occurred. Recipient's age and renal function at one year were found to be predictive factors for mortality, while proteinuria and renal function were predictive factors for graft survival.

To assess potential differences in initial clinical profile, course and prognosis of idiopathic membranous nephropathy depending on the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies. Eighty-five patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy were included (55 anti-PLA2R-positive and 30 anti-PLA2R-negative). Clinical, biochemical and pathological variables were recorded at the time of diagnosis. Frequency of spontaneous remission, incidence of response to first-line therapy, frequency and number of recurrences, survival of renal function free from renal replacement therapy, survival of renal function free from chronic renal insufficiency and frequency of occurrence of malignant, infectious or autoimmune diseases during follow-up were recorded. At the time of diagnosis, anti-PLA2R-negative patients were significantly older and had a higher frequency of spontaneous remission. No differences were noted in the response to first-line treatment, frequency and number of recurrences, survival of renal function free from renal replacement therapy, or survival of renal function free from chronic renal insufficiency. Anti-PLA2R-negative patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy were older and experienced spontaneous remission more often than anti-PLA2R-positive patients.

This pathway includes a high number of proteins, such as claudins. Within renal epithelium, claudins result in an ionic selectivity in tight junctions. Ascending thick limb of loop of Henle (ATLH) is the most important segment for calcium reabsorption in renal tubules. Its cells create a water-proof barrier, actively transport sodium and chlorine through a transcellular pathway, and provide a paracellular pathway for selective calcium reabsorption. Several studies have led to a model of paracellular channel consisting of various claudins, particularly claudin-16 and 19. Claudin-16 mediates cationic paracellular permeability in ATLH, whereas claudin-19 increases cationic selectivity of claudin-16 by blocking anionic permeability. Recent studies have shown that claudin-14 promoting activity is only located in ATLH. When co-expressed with claudin-16, claudin-14 inhibits the permeability of claudin-16 and reduces paracellular permeability to calcium. Calcium reabsorption process in ATLH is closely regulated by calcium sensor receptor (CaSR), which monitors circulating Ca levels and adjusts renal excretion rate accordingly. Two microRNA, miR-9 and miR-374, are directly regulated by CaSR. Thus, miR-9 and miR-374 suppress mRNA translation for claudin-14 and induce claudin-14 decline.

Even though it is reasonable to assume that NP may exert a relevant role in the adaptive response to renal mass ablation, evidence gathered so far suggest that this contribution is probably complex and dependent on the type and degree of the functional mass loss. In the last years NP have been increasingly used to diagnose, monitor treatment and define the prognosis of several cardiovascular (CV) diseases. However, in many clinical settings, like chronic kidney disease (CKD), the predictive value of these biomarkers has been questioned. In fact, it is now well established that renal function significantly affects the plasmatic levels of NP and that renal failure is the clinical condition associated with the highest plasmatic levels of these peptides. The complexity of the relation between NP plasmatic levels and CV and renal functions has obvious consequences, as it may limit the predictive value of NP in CV assessment of CKD patients and be a demanding exercise for clinicians involved in the daily management of these patients.

The progressive loss of renal function leads to calcitriol deficiency and homeostatic changes in calcium, phosphorus, FGF-23 and PTH, among others. All these changes can also influence vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation and the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). The biologic actions of both vitamin D and its synthetic analogues are mediated by binding to the same VDR, acting on different genes. There is a narrow relationship between low levels of calcitriol and SHPT. The combined approach of VDR activation and phosphate restriction, among others, plays an important role in the early treatment of the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).

In patients treated with tenofovir or with risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD), more frequent renal screening is recommended. In order to prevent disease progression, potentially nephrotoxic antiretroviral drugs are not recommended in patients with CKD or risk factors for CKD. The document provides indications for renal biopsy and advises on the optimal time for referral of a patient to the nephrologist. The indications for and evaluation and management of dialysis and renal transplantation are also addressed. ","943":"Despite the 40 years history, the comparable survival of Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis (PD), and the improved PD technique survival, the percentage of patients performing PD is low. After a short history review and data description, we analyze the many non-medical factors (&amp;ldquo;the vicious circle&amp;rdquo;) that contribute to the underutilization of PD: inadequate medical training, lack of infrastructures, small PD units, inadequate patient education for choice of dialysis modality, lack of multidisciplinary end-stage renal disease units, the proliferation of hemodialysis centers, or the trends in government reimbursement. Several of these factors are modifiable, and we propose future strategies to increase the use of PD. ","944":"In many centers patients are hospitalised to perform a renal allograft biopsy. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of outpatient renal allograft biopsies. Since December 2011 we perform renal allograft biopsies as an outpatient procedure. Exclusion criteria for performing an outpatient biopsy included: 1.) anticoagulant treatment, 2.) thrombocytopenia &amp;lt;50,000\/mm3, 3.) body mass index &amp;gt;35kg\/m2 and 4.) uncontrolled hypertension. The number and severity of complications were compared with an historical cohort of 124 biopsies done between 2007 and 2011 when all patients were hospitalised for the procedure and with 42 patients biopsied during hospitalisation between 2011 and 2013. Between 2011 and 2013, 210 (95%) out of 230 biopsies indicated in the outclinic were performed as an outpatient procedure (95%). The incidence of major complications (bleeding requiring blood transfusion and\/or embolisation) was 0.8% between 2007 and 2011 and 2.4% in biopsies between 2011 and 2013 in hospitalised patients (p=0.475). No major complications were observed in the outpatient biopsy group. Minor complications (hematuria, hematoma or fistula not requiring transfusion or embolisation) were also not different between groups (3.2%, 7.1% and 2.7%; respectively). Sample size adequacy according to the Banff criteria was not different among groups (p=0.052). Ambulatory renal allograft biopsy is a safe and efficient procedure. ","945":"Peritoneal infections are a common complication in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and are frequently the cause of the failure of the technique. Knowing the factors that can lead to their appearance helps to establish preventative measures. To understand the influence of climatic variables in the appearance of peritonitis, such as seasonal variation, the temperature and humidity in Asturias. A retrospective, observational study of all peritoneal infections that occurred in our PD department over a period of 5 years (2007-2011). The region was divided lengthways into three areas: the coast, central area and mountains, each of which has a climatological season for reference, which is defined by the State Meteorology Agency (AEMET) (in Gij&amp;oacute;n, Oviedo and Mieres, respectively). The AEMET provided us with data on the humidity and average temperature of the months in which all the cases of peritonitis appeared. There were 171 cases of peritonitis (0.498 episodes\/patient\/year) in 201 patients (58&amp;plusmn;16 years, 59% males, 33% diabetics, 20&amp;plusmn;19 months on technique). We did not find any differences according to age, sex, having diabetes, nasal carrier status for Staphylococcus aureus or therapeutic modality. Overall, there were no differences among seasons. However, using spring as a reference (value 1), the incidence rate of gram-negative peritonitis (95% confidence interval) in summer, autumn and winter was 0.666 (0.211-1.832), 0.248 (0.000-0.912) and 0.292 (0.000-0.833), respectively (P&amp;lt;.001). We do not see this variation upon analysing the incidence rates of peritonitis caused by gram-positive bacteria. The average temperature of the days on which peritoneal infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (15.46&amp;plusmn;3.71&amp;deg;C) was significantly higher than on those days when it was caused by gram-positive bacteria (13.61&amp;plusmn;3.89 &amp;deg;C) (P.022). There are no significant differences in relation to humidity (78.76 &amp;plusmn; 4.40 vs. 77.5&amp;plusmn;3.69 %) (P.227). Overall, the rates of peritoneal infection are similar in all four seasons of the year, although in the case of gram-negative bacteria there is an increase in its incidence in spring and summer. The higher the temperature, the higher the risk that a peritoneal infection will be the result of a gram-negative bacterium. ","946":"The daily pill burden in hemodialysis patients is one of the highest reported to date in any chronic disease. The adherence to prescribed treatment has implications on the quality of life, the survival of patients, and the economic cost of their treatment, this being a priority public health issue. To evaluate the adherence to pharmacological treatment examining, among the possible causes of non-adherence, psychosocial factors such as depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment and social support. Transversal-observational study of thirty five patients that suffer from chronic renal disease and who are on manteinance hemodialysis, evaluated by self-reported measures. Non-adherent patients have significant higher depression index than adherent patients. Anxiety, cognitive impairment and social support do not show a significant relation with the degree of adherence or compliance with farmacological treatment. These results suggest that psychological intervention in chronic haemodialysis patients with a severe depression index could increase the degree of fulfillment and general well-being of renal patients. ","947":"Breakage of peritoneal catheters is an emergency of the technique that is uncommon but which requires immediate action when there is leakage of the dialysate and risk of infection. Early and adequate intervention can save broken catheters without interrupting peritoneal dialysis. We report our experience repairing damaged catheters using the Quinton&amp;reg; Peri-Patch repair kit (Quinton Instrument Co., Tyco Healthcare Group LP. Mansfield, MA., U.S.A.). ","948":"Fluid overload is an important and modifiable cardiovascular risk factor for haemodialysis patients. So far, the diagnosis was based on clinical methods alone. Nowadays, we have new tools to assess more objectively the hydration status of the patients on haemodialysis, as BCM (Body Composition Monitor). A Relative Overhydration (AvROH) higher than 15% (it means, Absolute Overhydration or AWOH higher than 2.5 Litres) is associated to greater risk in haemodialysis. However, there is a group of maintained hyperhydrated patients. The aim of the present study is to identify the characteristics of patients with maintained hyperhydrated status (AvROH higher than 15% or AWOH higher than 2.5 liters). The secondary aim is to show the hemodynamic and analytical changes that are related to the reduction in hyperhydration status. Longitudinal cohort study during six months in 2959 patients in haemodialysis (HD) that are grouped according to their hydration status by BCM. And we compare their clinical, analytical and bioimpedance spectroscopy parameters. The change in overhydration status is followed by a decrease in blood pressure and the need for hypotensive drugs (AHT) and erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESA). The target hydration status is not reached by two subgroups of patients. First, in diabetic patients with a high comorbidity index and high number of hypotensive drugs (AHT) but a great positive sodium gradient during dialysis sessions; and, younger non-diabetic patients with longer time on hemodialysis and positive sodium gradient, lower fat tissue index (FTI) but similar lean tissue index (LTI) and albumin than those with a reduction in hyperhydration status. Those patients with a reduction in hyperhydration status, also show a better control in blood pressure and anemia with less number of AHT and ESA. The maintained hyperhydrated patients, diabetic patients with many comorbidities and young men patients with longer time on hemodialysis and non-adherence treatment, can profit from a constant monitoring of their hydration state as well as an individualized treatment (dialysis and drugs). ","949":"Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) is a disease that requires determined medications dosages to be adjusted. To assess the characteristics of pharmaceutical interventions concerning the dose adjustment of these drugs in patients with CRF who are admitted into hospital. A 10-month prospective and longitudinal study that calculated the glomerular filtration rate of patients who are brought into the emergency department and had values below 50ml\/min\/1.73m2. Subsequently, dosage recommendations were provided for the drugs that had not been adapted to the patient&amp;rsquo;s renal function. The renal functions of 5311 patients were reviewed. One-hundred and eighty-one (3.4%) had a glomerular filtration rate below 50ml\/min\/1.73m2 and were receiving drugs that needed to be adjusted. 221 interventions were recorded. Reductions in dosages were the more frequent results (65.6%); 65.6% of these recommendations were accepted by the doctor. The antimicrobial group had the highest number of interventions (57.5%). Internal Medicine (50.2%) was the unit with the most interventions. CRF patients that are admitted into the emergency department are a key objective concerning dosages in chronic renal failure. Pharmaceutical recommendations are highly esteemed by doctors, given their high acceptance. Revising antimicrobial drugs offers more opportunities. ","950":"","951":"","952":null,"953":"Hypertension (HT) represents a major public health problem affecting many individuals worldwide. It is well known to be an important risk factor for the development of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases. Classifying hypertension as &amp;lsquo;primary&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;secondary&amp;rsquo; depends on the underlying mechanism. In 5 to 10% of hypertensive patients, HT develops &amp;lsquo;secondary&amp;rsquo; to a separate mechanism that has been encountered with increasing frequency in the tertiary refferral centers. The frequent causes of secondary hypertension include renal parenchymal disease, renal artery stenosis, primary hyperaldosteronism, phaeochromocytoma and Cushing's syndrome. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) can involve any organ and in varying degrees. Here we present a young hypertensive patient diagnosed as PAN with the angiographic findings of multiple microaneurysms involving celiac, renal and superior mesenteric arteries and associated with a rarely seen neurological entity-PRES syndrome. ","954":"Sexual function, psychosocial status and quality of life (QoL) are important dimensions, often underestimated, in dialysis treatment schedules. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction and its associations, among peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The Index of Female Sexual Function (IFSF), the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Quality of Life EQ5D questionnaires were applied to a prevalent PD population of 57 enrolled patients. Multivariate analysis was conducted to investigate clinical independent risk factors for sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction was diagnosed in 67.9% of women and 44.8% of men. In females, serum albumin, creatinine and phosphorus levels and EQ5D positively correlated with IFSF score. For males, there was a significant negative correlation between serum calcium levels and the IIEF score. On multivariate analysis, nutritional parameters remained independently associated with sexual dysfunction in women; in males, increase in calcium concentration and decrease of testosterone were main determinants. On logistic regression analysis, the risk of sexual dysfunction in global population was associated with lower values of albumin (OR=6.94) and with a lower QoL score EQ5D (OR=6.93). Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent and strongly associated with impaired QoL of PD patients. Different clinical variables were related to sexual dysfunction in each gender, justifying an individualized preventive and therapeutic approaches. ","955":"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) has a growing incidence in which renal vasoconstriction and medullary hypoxia are important mechanisms. Therapeutic approaches are very restricted and there is a considerable interest in advancing preventive strategies. Adrenomedullin is a relatively novel peptide having antioxidant, vasoactive and vasodilatory properties. We aimed to investigate whether adrenomedullin might have a preventive role against the development of experimental CIN. Wistar albino rats (n=24) were allocated randomly into four equal groups of 6 each; Control (C), Adrenomedullin (A), Contrast Media (CM) and Adrenomedullin plus Contrast Media (ACM). All rats were deprived of water from day 1 to day 4 during 72 hours. Then, intravenous administrations of chemicals were performed. Adrenomedullin was given at dose of 12&amp;micro;g\/kg to groups A and ACM. A single dose of high-osmolar contrast media; diatrizoate (Urografin 76%, Schering AG, Germany) was injected to groups CM and ACM at dose of 10mL\/kg. On day 1 and 6 blood samples were drawn for renal function tests and inflammatory markers including TNF-&amp;alpha; IL-1&amp;beta;, IL-6 and IL-18. After sacrification, kidney histologies were examined with hematoxylin-eosin staining. Compared to CM group, serum cystatin-C levels on 6th day were found significantly lower in ACM group (p&amp;lt;0.05). Additionally, daily protein excretion rates, absolute changes in daily urine output and creatinine clearance values were significantly lower in ACM group than those in CM group (p&amp;lt;0.05). In histopathological evaluation, regarding the degree of tubular damage and medullary congestion scores, ACM group had slightly better scores compared to CM group; however the differences did not reach significance as shown in inflammatory markers. This study demonstrated a beneficial impact of adrenomedullin on deteriorated renal function tests in an experimental CIN model. Adrenomedullin might be a candidate agent for prophylaxis of CIN. However, further studies are needed to shed more light on this issue.

A decreased calcemic response to parathyroid hormone (PTH) contributes to the development of hyperparathyroidism and is presumed due to reduced calcium efflux from bone. Contributing factors to the decreased calcemic response to PTH in CKD include: 1) hyperphosphatemia; 2) decreased serum calcitriol; 3) downregulation of the PTH1 receptor; 4) large, truncated amino-terminal PTH fragments acting at the carboxy-PTH receptor; and 5) uremic toxins. Also, prolonged high dose calcitriol administration may decrease the exchangeable pool of bone calcium independent of PTH. The goal of the review is to provide a better understanding of how the above cited factors affect calcium efflux from bone in CKD.

","968":"Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has been widely studied in the field of dialysis patients. However, there are few studies that include relationships of psychosocial variables and adherence to treatment with HRQOL. The aim of this review is to systematically synthesise available information on the role that psychological variables (depression, anxiety and stress) and adherence to treatment have on HRQOL of dialysis patients through a systematic narrative review. We selected studies that included and related, in their results psychological variables (at least one of the following: depression, anxiety or perceived stress), adherence to treatment and HRQOL in adults on dialysis due to advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD). The studies included had to incorporate standardised instruments into their assessment protocol. We searched the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases from January 2002 to August 2012. Thirty-eight studies were included in this review and we assessed their methodological quality. The review revealed that 100% of the studies identified a negative association between indicators of anxiety, depression and stress and HRQL, indicating that these variables are risk factors for quality of life. Adherence to treatment was associated with psychological factors and HRQOL in 8% (N=3) of the studies included and has been demonstrated to be a protective factor for quality of life in 66% of studies (2 of 3) that included this variable. Considering the effect of these variables on HRQOL, it is important to screen for early indicators of anxiety, stress and depression or difficulties in complying with treatment in the ACKD population on dialysis. This will allow preventive interventions to be carried out before HRQOL deteriorates. ","969":"One of the most severe complications of repair surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) is acute kidney injury (AKI). Even small rises in serum creatinine are associated with increased mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the dynamics of AKI after elective AAA surgery using novel markers. The study group consisted of 22 patients with AAA. We measured urinary liver- (u-L-FABP) and heart-type fatty acid-binding proteins (u-H-FABP) before, during and within 3 days after surgery. We found an abrupt and significant elevation of both urine FABPs normalized to urinary creatinine; u-L-FABP reached its peak value 2 hours after aortic clamp release {137.79 (38.57-451.79) vs. 9.94 (6.82-12.42) ng\/mg baseline value, p&amp;lt;0.05; values are medians (lower-upper quartile)}.

The serum creatinine level did not changed significantly during the investigation period. The significant rise of both u-L-FABP and u-H-FABP after AAA surgery indicates renal proximal and distal tubule injury in this population. Our results suggest that, after AAA surgery, the distal tubules could be more affected than the proximal ones. u-FABPs could serve as sensitive biomarkers of kidney tubular injury and may allow to detect the very early phases of AKI. ","970":"This observational study was conducted to investigate the use and effectiveness of calcium acetate\/magnesium carbonate (CaMg) in the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in dialysis patients in real-world clinical practice. 120 adult CKD patients on dialysis who received CaMg alone or in combination with other phosphate binders were followed-up for 3-12 months. Serum phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, parathyroid hormone and albumin concentration was measured at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. In addition, CaMg dosage, use of concurrent phosphate binders, vitamin D and cinacalcet was documented. Patients were evaluated in 2 subgroups &amp;ndash; CaMg alone (n=79) vs. CaMg + concurrent phosphate binder (n=41). In both subgroups serum phosphorus levels decreased significantly from baseline at 3, 6 and 12 months of CaMg treatment. The percentage achievement of recommended serum phosphorus targets improved after CaMg initiation. At month 6, a total of 78% were within the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K\/DOQI) target range. Total corrected serum calcium increased during CaMg treatment, but mildly exceeded the upper limit of normal in three patients only.

The study&amp;rsquo;s objective was to evaluate the recent version of the 5008 monitor software, compared to the previous version, on the impact on total convective volume. We included 63 patients (44 males and 19 females), with a mean age of 65.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;nbsp;15 years, on OL-HDF. Each patient was analysed in 6 sessions; 3 with the 5008 monitor and 3 with the 5008 CorDiax monitor. The replacement volume, total convective volume and dialysis parameters were determined in each session. No significant differences were observed in blood, venous or transmembrane pressure, nor was there an increase in the number of alarms or coagulation of lines or dialysers. A significant increase of replacement fluid volume, from 27.2 to 31.2&amp;nbsp;L\/session, was observed using the CorDiax software. Total convective volume increased from 29.5 to 33.3 L\/session, representing an effective convective volume increase from 26&amp;nbsp;% to 29.6&amp;nbsp;% of total filtered blood. The 5008 dialysis monitor software update has meant a 13&amp;nbsp;% increase of total convective volume and a 3.5&amp;nbsp;% increase of total filtered blood.

Several epidemiological studies have observed that following a traditional Mediterranean diet reduces overall and cardiovascular mortality, as well as the incidence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, up to now, only one study has analysed the effects of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the PREDIMED (PREvenci&amp;oacute;n con DIeta MEDiterr&amp;aacute;nea) study. This trial included 7447 high vascular risk individuals who were randomly divided into three dietary intervention groups: Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, and a control diet (low in all types of fat). Analyses of intermediate markers demonstrated beneficial effects of the Mediterranean diet on blood pressure, lipid profile, lipoprotein particles, oxidative stress and inflammation markers and carotid atherosclerosis. However, the most important finding was the 30% reduction in the relative risk of major cardiovascular complications (heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular mortality) in both Mediterranean diet groups compared to those who followed a low-fat diet. The results of the PREDIMED trial demonstrate that a high unsaturated fat, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory diet plan such as the Mediterranean diet is a useful tool in reducing overall mortality and in preventing cardiovascular disease.

This has two objectives: customer satisfaction and continuous improvement. This paper presents the impact of certification ISO 9001:2008 on the sample transfer process in a Spanish biobank specialising in kidney patient samples. The biobank experienced a large increase in the number of samples between 2009 (12,582 vials) and 2010 (37,042 vials). The biobank of the Spanish Renal Research Network (REDinREN), located at the University of Alcal&amp;aacute;, has implemented ISO standard 9001:2008 for the effective management of human material given to research centres. Using surveys, we analysed two periods in the &amp;ldquo;sample transfer&amp;rdquo; process. During the first period between 1-10-12 and 26-11-12 (8 weeks), minimal changes were made to correct isolated errors. In the second period, between 7-01-13 and 18-02-13 (6 weeks), we carried out general corrective actions. The identification of problems and implementation of corrective actions for certification allowed: a 70% reduction in the process execution time, a significant increase (200%) in the number of samples processed and a 25% improvement in the process. The increase in the number of samples processed was directly related to process improvement. The certification of ISO standard 9001:2008, obtained in July 2013, allowed an improvement of the REDinREN biobank processes to be achieved, which increased quality and customer satisfaction.

The quantity of phosphorus contained in 118 processed products was determined by spectrophotometry and the results were contrasted with the food composition tables of the Higher Education Centre of Nutrition and Diet, those of Morandeira and those of the BEDCA (Spanish Food Composition Database) Network. Food processing frequently involves the use of phosphoric additives. The products whose label contains these additives have higher phosphorus content and higher phosphorus-protein ratio. We observed a discrepancy with the food composition tables in terms of the amount of phosphorus determined in a sizeable proportion of the products. The phosphorus content of prepared refrigerated foods hardly appears in the tables. Product labels provide little information on phosphorus content. We observed a discrepancy in phosphorus content in certain foods with respect to the food composition tables. We should educate our patients on reviewing the additives on the labels and on the limitation of processed foods.

However, the usefulness of monitoring antibody titre as a predictor of clinical response following the onset of treatment has not been formally analysed. The predictive value of the evolution of anti-PLA2R antibody titre on the clinical response of idiopathic membranous nephropathy patients treated with tacrolimus is analysed in the following study. 36 patients with nephrotic syndrome secondary to idiopathic membranous nephropathy with immunosuppressive treatment indication criteria were treated with tacrolimus in monotherapy. The level of anti-PLA2R antibodies was determined before treatment and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the onset of treatment. The study analysed the predictive value of the reduction in antibody titre and the relative and absolute reduction in antibody titre at 3 and 6 months over the period until remission and on the probability of remission at 6, 9 and 12 months. The relative reduction in the anti-PLA2R antibody titre was significantly greater in those patients with remission and it preceded the clinical response. No association was observed between the antibody titre prior to treatment and the mean response time or the response at 12 months. Reduction in antibody titre is significantly associated with the time until signs of remission. Relative reduction in anti-PLA2R antibody titre at 3 months had a high sensitivity and specificity to predict the response at 6 and 9 months, but not at 12 months; however the relative reduction in the antibody titre at 6 months had a high sensitivity and specificity for predicting the response at 12 months.

This study was done for 8 weeks on 40 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats divided into four groups of 10 rats each. Study groups included: 1-Control, 2-Nephrotic syndrome, 3-Nephrotic syndrome+soy protein diet and 4-Nephrotic syndrome+soy protein diet+genistein. Urine protein and urine creatinine were measured. After homogenization of kidney, total antioxidant capacities (TAC), activities of catalase enzyme, the concentration of malondialdehydes (MDA) and carbolynated proteins were determined spectrophotometrically. Pathological examination was done on kidneys with light microscope. Cell viability was evaluated with MTT assay on WEHI-164 fibro sarcoma cell line. The MMP2 enzyme activity was evaluated in different concentrations of genistein. Total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased in soy genistein. Catalase activity was significantly increased in soy and soy genistein groups. Protein carbonyl and MDA were significantly lower in soy and soy genistein groups. The scores of pathological examination showed significant improvement in soy and soy genistein groups. Genistein decreased the proliferation of the WEHI-164 fibrosarcoma cell line. It seems that soy protein decreases kidney damages in nephrotic syndrome. Adding genistein to soy protein causes improvements in antioxidant status of kidney tissue.

Prospective study carried out on 205 patients with ages ranging from 1 to 28 months and admitted with a diagnosis of mild or moderate dehydration due to AGE and treated with intravenous hypotonic fluids in a paediatric department in Madrid (Spain). The degree of dehydration at presentation was estimated using standard clinical measures. 198 children received 0.3 % glucosaline solution and in 7 patients, with baseline hypernatraemia, 0.2 % gluco-hyposaline solution was administered. We analysed the results according to whether children were hyponatraemic, normonatraemic or hypernatraemic at presentation. The blood and urine samples were analysed and the concentration of sodium and fractional sodium excretion (EFNa) before and after intervention were considered as outcome measures. The 205 patients included in the study were distributed in 3 groups according to the baseline natraemia results. In 37 cases we detected hyponatraemia (18.04%), in 133 cases isonatraemia (64.87%) and in 35 children hypernatraemia (17.07%). After administering hypotonic fluids we detected a significant difference between initial and final natraemia in all groups; in the group with hyponatraemia, sodium increased and in the groups with iso and hypernatraemia, sodium slightly decreased. A significant correlation between the EFNa and the evolution of natraemia was found. No cases of hyponatraemia post-infusion were seen and there was no correlation between free water administered and natraemia evolution.

To analyse normal treatment in advanced stages of CKD and establish which treatments are associated with better survival in dialysis as well as their relationship with causes of death. Cohort, prospective observational study of 591 patients who started dialysis (491 haemodialysis and 100 peritoneal dialysis), who had previously been monitored in the CKD clinic. The treatments analysed were: antihypertensive treatments, statins, antiplatelet drugs, xanthine oxidase inhibitors, correction of metabolic acidosis, treatment with (calcium or non-calcium) phosphate binders, vitamin D (calcitriol or paricalcitol), erythropoietin and the availability of an internal arteriovenous fistula (IAVF). The independent association of each of these treatments with mortality in dialysis was analysed using Cox regression models adjusted for age, sex, pre-dialysis monitoring time, renal function at the start of dialysis, comorbidity, serum albumin and C-reactive protein, and with stratification of the type of dialysis. With a median follow-up period of 28 months, the total number of patients who died was 191 (32%). In the multivariate models, we observed that, in addition to age, the comorbidity index, serum albumin, pre-dialysis treatment with angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and\/or angiotensin receptor blockers, correction of acidosis with sodium bicarbonate and IAVF at the start of haemodialysis were significantly associated with better survival in dialysis. We did not observe differences in causes of death between the different treatments analysed. These results suggest a potential delayed benefit of some treatments in pre-dialysis stages on the outcome of dialysis. Furthermore, beginning dialysis without an IAVF, resulting in the need for intravenous catheters, worsens prognosis in these patients.

Thyroidectomy is the definitive treatment, but in patients with risk of recurrence, ablative therapy is required using radioactive iodine I-131, which is predominantly eliminated by renal excretion, therefore its use in patients on dialysis poses a problem in terms of dosage.

Circulating PTH is a mixture of peptides, but only on its whole form (1-84 PTH) is responsible of PTH biological activity. Carboxyl-terminal fragments exhibit antagonist actions and their proportion differs at each stage of chronic kidney disease, as consequence of differences on their renal clearance. The aim of this study is to evaluate possible differences in the proportion of these fragments according to dialysis type: haemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Serum total (Ca) and ionized calcium (iCa), phosphate (P), carboxyl-terminal telopeptides of collagen type I (BCTx) were measured in 73 patients on PD (46 men and 27 women with an age between 22 and 82 years).

The most frequent and serious disorder is due to enzyme deficit of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase (PH type I) specific to hepatic peroxisome. As oxalate is not metabolised in humans and is excreted through the kidneys, the kidney is the first organ affected, causing recurrent lithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and early renal failure. With advance of renal failure, particularly in patients on haemodialysis (HD), calcium oxalate is massively deposited in tissues, which is known as oxalosis. Diagnosis is based on family history, the presence of urolithiasis and\/or nephrocalcinosis, hyperoxaluria, oxalate deposits in tissue forming granulomas, molecular analysis of DNA and enzyme analysis if applicable. High diagnostic suspicion is required; therefore, unfortunately, in many cases it is diagnosed after its recurrence following kidney transplantation. Conservative management of this disease (high liquid intake, pyridoxine and crystallisation inhibitors) needs to be adopted early in order to delay kidney damage. Treatment by dialysis is ineffective in treating excess oxalate. After the kidney transplant, we normally observe a rapid appearance of oxalate deposits in the graft and the results of this technique are discouraging, with very few exceptions. Pre-emptive liver transplantation, or simultaneous liver and kidney transplants when there is already irreversible damage to the kidney, is the treatment of choice to treat the underlying disease and suppress oxalate overproduction. Given its condition as a rare disease and its genetic and clinical heterogeneity, it is not possible to gain evidence through randomised clinical trials.

We studied 64 adults with nephrotic syndrome who were diagnosed with MN, confirmed by renal biopsy. Forty-seven patients had idiopathic MN and 17 had secondary MN. We determined the presence of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and their titre by ELISA, and we analysed the presence of anti-PLA2R antibody renal deposits by immunohistochemical techniques. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the IIF and ELISA techniques for the identification of patients with renal deposits and for the identification of those with idiopathic MN and we tested whether there were differences in the clinical profile of the disease at the time of diagnosis according to the presence or absence of anti-PLA2R antibodies. We did not observe significant differences in the clinical-demographic variables between patients with idiopathic and secondary MN. The prevalence of anti-PLA2R glomerular deposits by IHC was 76.6%. The IIF and ELISA techniques had a similar sensitivity (IIF 94.4% and ELISA 97.2%) and specificity (100%) for the identification of patients with anti-PLA2R renal deposits and the detection of circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies. The determination of anti-PLA2R by IIF identified patients with idiopathic MN with a sensitivity of 72.3% and a specificity of 94.2%. A titre of antibodies &gt;15RU\/ml measured by ELISA had a sensitivity of 74.45% and a specificity of 94.2% for the identification of patients with idiopathic MN.

No statistical correlation was observed between the antibody titre measured by ELISA and age, glomerular filtration rate or 24-hour proteinuria or albuminaemia. The techniques employed to determine anti-PLA2R in patients with MN are highly specific for the diagnosis of idiopathic forms of the glomerular disease. The frequency with which patients with MN and anti-PLA2R were identified is similar to that reported in previous studies. Staining by immunohistochemistry is the most sensitive method for detecting cases of MN associated with the presence of anti-PLA2R antibodies. The IIF and ELISA techniques allow circulating anti-PLA2R antibodies to be detected in most patients with renal deposits, but they may very infrequently have false negative results. The concordance of these tests is high.

The recently published 2013 KDIGO guidelines base the definition and classification of CKD on glomerular filtration values and albuminuria as staging criteria and prognostic markers of the disease. The MDRD and MDRD-IDMS equations (when creatinine values can be traced to the reference method) are those most used, but both the 2013 KDIGO international guidelines and the new 2013 CKD consensus document, in which ten scientific societies participated under the direction of the Spanish Society of Nephrology, recommend to be replaced by the CKD-EPI equation. Our objective has been, as with previous equations, to develop tables that display the estimated glomerular filtration rate value using the CKD-EPI equation from serum creatinine concentration, age and sex, and thereby provide an instrument that facilitates the dissemination of this new equation, particularly in settings where it is not calculated automatically.

As such, we used a semi-structured distance professional consensus procedure via e-mail (modified Delphi method) on a representative nephrologist panel, under the direction of a coordinating committee. To analyse the group's opinion and the type of consensus reached on each issue raised, we used the median of the group's scores and the \"level of agreement\" reached by those surveyed. On a total of 86 issues, a consensus agreement and disagreement was achieved in 70 (81.4%), of which 60.5% (52 items) agreed with the statement and 20.9% (18 items) disagreed. In 16 items (18.6%), there was insufficient unanimity in the panel's opinion, either due to professional opinion disparity or due to the lack of opinion established in the majority of the expert committee. Accepting the study's limitations, we considered that the items for which there was a consensus reinforce some CKD-MBD concepts with their impact on daily clinical practice and allow the degree of homogeneity that we could expect in this area to be assessed. The items in which there was no consensus help us to know the areas of uncertainty and are very useful for clarifying which aspects have a greater need for further knowledge and which areas require prospective studies to be conducted to improve the management of these disorders.","1046":"Free choice is not easy when there is a lack of information.

The proposal should be based on consensus and on the experience of medical specialists, defining thus complementary paths to improvement. A Delphi study on the quality of care in Nephrology, comprising three phases: assessment results, necessary means for quality, and importance of medical advice and surveys among specialists. The questionnaire was administered to a panel of 32 nephrologists. The nephrologists accepted the outcome criteria on quality of care 55\/62 (89%), as well as the proposed means for quality of care 87\/92 (95%). 81% of the nephrologists reported the validity and topicality of providing patients with specialist advice as to the most adequate department to better treat their kidney diseases. 86% of the panellists deemed appropriate to include surveys on medical advice as additional criteria for the evaluation of quality of care. It is possible to obtain a consensus-based methodological proposal for the evaluation and improvement of quality of care which includes results on quality of care, means for quality of care, and medical advice based on surveys carried out among specialists to identify the best Nephrology departments.

In order to determine the main current needs in Nephrology, a group of Spanish Nephrology Services was involved. Needs were recorded through semi-structured interviews with the medical team and questionnaires for professionals and patients. A set of requirements were garnered from professionals and patients. In parallel, the group of biomedical engineers identified requirements for patient telecare from a technological perspective. All of these requirements drove the design of modular architecture for the telecare of peritoneal dialysis and pre-dialysis patients. This work shows how it is possible to involve users in the whole process of design and development of a system. The result of this work is the design of adaptable modular architecture for the telecare of nephrological patients and it addresses the preferences and needs of patient and professional users consulted.

However, a report on PD in Spain was developed for various conferences and meetings over several years from data provided by each registry in the autonomous communities and regions. The main objective of this study is to analyse this data in aggregate and comparatively to obtain a representative sample of the Spanish population on PD in recent years, in order that analysis and results in terms of demographic data, penetration of the technique, geographical differences, incidence and prevalence, technical aspects, intermediate indicators, comorbidity, and outcomes such as patient and technique survival may be extrapolated to the whole country. DESIGN, MATERIAL AND METHOD: Observational cohort study of autonomous PD registries, covering the largest possible percentage of the adult Spanish population (over 14 years of age) on PD, at least in the last decade (1999-2010), and in the largest possible geographical area in which we were able to recruit. A precise data collection strategy was followed for each regional registry. Once the information was received and clarified, they were added as aggregate data for statistical study. The regional registries that participated represent a total geographical area that encompasses 32,853,251 inhabitants over 14 years of age, 84% of the total Spanish population older than that age. The mean annual rate of incidents per million inhabitants (ppm) was variable (between 17.81 ppm in Andalusia and 29.90 ppm in the Basque Country), with a discrete and permanent increase in the overall PD incidence in Spain being observed in recent years. The mean annual prevalence per million population (ppm) was very heterogeneous (from 42 to 99 ppm). A mean progressive increase in the use of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) was observed. The peritonitis rate was approximately one episode every 25-30 months\/patient, with a slight decrease being observed in recent years. The causes of discontinuing PD were distributed fairly evenly between communities; almost a third was due to patient death (mean 28%), a third was due to renal transplantation (mean 39%) and a third was due to transfer to haemodialysis (technique failure: mean 32%). The main comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (30.2%) and diabetes mellitus (24.2%). The overall accumulated mean survival was 92.2%, 82.8%, 74.2%, 64.8% and 57% after one, two, three, four and five years respectively. There was significantly and independently worse survival for older patients and those with cardiovascular disease, patients with diabetes mellitus, those on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (vs. APD), those who started PD before 2004 (analysed in Andalusia and Catalonia), and patients with lower residual renal function at the start of PD (analysed in the Levante registry). Similarly, the technique survival has improved, showing a mean figure above 50% after 5 years. The incidence and prevalence of PD in Spain are growing moderately and in a generalised manner and continue to maintain an irregular distribution by autonomous community. Both patient and technique survival were greater than 50% after 5 years, with an improvement being observed in recent years, and are comparable to countries with better results in this treatment.

There are few data in the literature regarding complications from biopsies in renal grafts. To evaluate the rate of complications in renal graft biopsies performed at our centre. We performed a retrospective observational study, including data from patients who underwent renal graft biopsies from January 2000 to September 2012. Major complications were defined as: anemia requiring blood transfusion, intraparenchymal arteriovenous fistula or arterial bleeding requiring embolisation, nephrectomy, other surgery and exitus. And as minor complications: anemia without blood transfusion, intraparenchymal arteriovenous fistula without embolisation, haematomas or perirenal collections, hematuria and fever. Kidney biopsies were performed with ultrasound guidance and automatic devices. We performed 390 kidney graft biopsies. 49 complications occurred. 22 were major: 12 per anemia that required blood transfusion, 6 requiring embolisation (5 arteriovenous fistulae and 1 arterial bleeding), 2 exitus, 1 trasplantectomy and 1 surgery (haematoma). 27 were minor: 12 perirenal collections, 9 arteriovenous fistulae without embolisation, 3 hematuria, 2 anemisation without blood transfusion and 1 fever.

After studying 141 Caucasian patients with biopsied IgA nephropathy and a \"benign\" clinical profile and after they were classified histologically in accordance with the new Oxford classification, it could be concluded that the renal prognosis of these patients was excellent. This is the first study in the literature that demonstrates the usefulness of this new classification in patients who clinically have normal renal function and proteinuria below 0.5 g\/day. The latest advances in the genetics of this disease, as well as in the collaboration of complement pathways in its pathophysiology mean that these results cannot be extrapolated to all the populations studied. In addition, the analysis and follow-up of microhaematuria has regained importance as an independent prognostic factor for developing renal failure, although there are no consistent studies in this regard yet. However, it is a subject that should be examined again by the nephrology community.","1064":null,"1065":"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cardiovascular risk factor and is associated with mortality in the general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Patients receive an initial standard dose and tacrolimus levels are measured in blood. If necessary, the dose is adjusted to reach a blood concentration within the accepted range. There is great interindividual variability in the dose required to achieve the target blood level, and many patients require multiple modifications of the dose to reach the range. One of the main determinants of these differences is a CYP3A5 gene polymorphism that determines that about 80% of Caucasians are poor metabolisers and require lower doses compared to the extensive metabolisers. It has been proposed that transplanted patients could receive an initial Tacrolimus dose based on the CYP3A5 genotype. This could reduce the time to achieve the optimal blood level, reducing the number of dose modifications. However, to be accepted by clinicians and translated to the clinical practice this adapted dose procedure should give additional advantages such as a significant reduction of the rates of nephrotoxicity and rejection, or a lower cost due to less dose modifications of Tacrolimus and less antibody induction therapy.

Relationships between somatic symptoms and predictor variables were analysed through bivariate correlations and multiple regression analysis. Patients showed much higher somatic symptom values than control individuals, especially with regard to immunological, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and skin-allergy symptoms. Anxiety, with a positive association, was the main independent predictor in most of the symptom categories, explaining 24.9% (p&lt;.0001) of variance in the total number of reported symptoms. Depression, the degree of worry, and passive coping strategies (helplessness-despair and fatalism) were also associated with higher levels of somatic symptoms. By contrast, the active coping strategy of fighting spirit, self-efficacy (coping capacity) and social support were associated with lower levels of symptoms. These results have clinical implications with respect to the aspects on which psychological interventions intended to reduce somatic symptoms in chronic haemodialysis patients should be based and they suggest that psychological-emotional variables may explain some symptoms that do not have a clear aetiology in kidney patients.

The increased bone resorption and tubular reabsorption of calcium due to the action of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) appear to be the main mechanisms involved in hypercalcemia. At the time of the renal transplantation (RT), PTH is the factor that determines the development of post-RT hypercalcemia, although it is sometimes masked in patients who are well controlled with medical treatment. The number of dialysis patients receiving treatment with cinacalcet for secondary HPT is increasing. The withdrawal of the calcimimetic at the time of renal transplantation results in a higher prevalence of hypercalcaemia and hyperparathyroidism in these patients. In patients with PTH well controlled with cinacalcet before transplantation, there is a direct relationship between the dose and the subsequent development of hypercalcemia, probably because it indicates the presence of a more severe secondary HPT. Hypercalcemia may have deleterious effects on the renal graft, resulting in tubulointerstitial calcification. Persistent hypercalcemia is a marker of an increased risk of bone disease deterioration in these patients.

Recent works have established that these molecules can be secreted to extracellular environments, enabling their detection in peripheral body fluids such as urine and serum. Moreover, circulating miRNAs detected in body fluids turn into suitable biomarkers of kidney diseases, including acute kidney injury. This new generation of renal biomarkers could have a great impact in the clinical practice, significantly contributing to improve patient management.

","1112":"Proteinuria is the main predictor of chronic kidney disease progression. Drugs that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system reduce proteinuria and slow down the progression of the disease. However, their effect is suboptimal, and residual proteinuria persists as an important predictor of renal impairment. Vitamin D has pleiotropic effects that could have an impact on these parameters. In this study, we critically review the molecular and experimental bases that suggest an antiproteinuric effect of vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation and the available evidence on its antiproteinuric effect in clinical practice. In animal models, we have observed the antiproteinuric effect of VDR activation, which could be due to direct protective action on the podocyte or other pleiotropic effects that slow down RAA system activation, inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical trials have generally been conducted in patients with a vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency and the main trial (VITAL) did not demonstrate that paricalcitol improved the study's primary endpoint (decrease in the urine albumin to creatinine ratio). In this sense, the information available is insufficient to advise the use of native vitamin D or VDR activators as renoprotective antiproteinuric drugs beyond the experimental level. Two Spanish clinical trials and one Italian trial attempted to determine the effect of paricalcitol and vitamin D on residual proteinuria in various clinical circumstances (PALIFE, NEFROVID and PROCEED).","1113":null,"1114":"Non-medical staff members in hospitals are highly credible at population level, and are a source of opinion even though they do not have sufficient medical training.

The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence, evolution over time and prognostic significance of PEW in a Spanish dialysis centre for the first time in Spain. an observational study that included 122 prevalent haemodialysis patients at our centre. Between January 2010 and October 2012, three visits were carried out in which clinical, biochemical, anthropometric and body composition parameters were collected using BIS (bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy) along with their respective dialytic characteristics, in accordance with the criteria of the new definition. We analysed the prevalence of PEW in each visit, progression of the malnutrition parameters and factors potentially associated with PEW. After a mean follow-up period of 461 days, we analysed survival. Statistical analysis was performed using the R software. The prevalence of PEW remained constant over time: 37% at baseline visit, 40.5% at 12 months and 41.1% at 24 months. With the introduction of the dynamic variable muscle mass loss, included in the definition of PEW, prevalence increased to 50% at 24 months. The PEW situation is dynamic, as demonstrated by the fact that 26%-36% of patients without PEW develop it de novo each year and 12%-30% annually recover from this situation. The presence of PEW was associated with higher rates of resistance to erythropoietin (irEPO) and higher pulse pressure at the end of dialysis. In the multivariable regression model, PEW predictive clinical variables were over-hydration, irEPO, intracellular water and the extracellular water\/intracellular water ratio. Twenty-six (21%) patients died. The Kaplan-Meier curve did not show any differences in mortality risk between patients with and those without PEW, but the loss of muscle mass was associated with increased mortality. The present observational study highlights the high prevalence of PEW, which has a dynamic nature in haemodialysis patients. Only the criterion of muscle mass loss (increased protein catabolism) was associated with increased mortality, while the other PEW criteria according to the ISRNM classification were not associated with increased mortality. We also observed a state of over-hydration in patients with PEW. This state of over-hydration (increased extracellular water due to occupation of muscle loss without an increase in total body water) cannot be evaluated by dry weight or the body mass index.

CKD prevention programmes can be more cost-efficient over time without negative impacts on quality of care.

Traditionally, &amp;ldquo;pay for services&amp;rdquo; has been used in state-assisted dialysis centres, but this model has the risk of inducing an increase in demand. Integrated management would respond to this challenge with comprehensive solutions that manage kidney disease at all levels of health care risk.

The rate of reimbursement directly depends on the achievement of previously defined quality control parameters. The third model is based on a &amp;ldquo;capitation&amp;rdquo; model that consists of the provider receiving a set amount of resources per population for a particular time regardless of the volume of services provided. The complexity and the progressive nature of CKD along with the associated morbidity rates in these patients force us to consider a global approach rather than a sum of different services.

The more \"natural\" a diet is, the more likely that the patient will reach an acceptable phosphorus to protein ratio of less than 16mg\/g, which does not increase mortality. There is clearly a need for an educational program on nutrition and phosphorus sources in which food ratio tables could be a useful tool for the multidisciplinary teams caring for renal patients.

Ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is a new preparation of non-dextran iron which, due to its pharmacokinetics and stability, may induce less toxicity than other iron molecules. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of FCM on inflammation and adhesion molecules in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Forty-seven patients with predialysis CKD and iron-deficiency anaemia received a single dose of FCM (15 mg\/kg, maximum dose 1 gram). At baseline and after 60 minutes (acute effect) and after 3 weeks and 3 months (sub-acute effect), we determined inflammatory markers: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and endothelial dysfunction: intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular adhesion molecule (VCAM). Treatment with FCM was associated with a significant increase in haemoglobin levels: 10 (0.7) vs. 11.4 (1.3)g\/dl, p&lt;.0001. CRP, IL-6, ICAM and VCAM levels did not correlate with baseline haemoglobin or ferritin levels and there was no relationship between changes in these markers and those of haemoglobin after administration of FCM. No significant, acute or sub-acute changes occurred in any of the inflammatory or endothelial markers studied. Statin therapy was associated with lower VCAM concentrations. Treatment with high doses of FCM in patients with predialysis CKD has no proinflammatory effect and does not alter levels of adhesion molecules ICAM and VCAM in this population.

In children affected by dRTA there is stunted growth, vomiting, constipation, loss of appetite, polydipsia and polyuria, nephrocalcinosis, weakness and muscle paralysis due to hypokalaemia. This work summarises progress made in dRTA genetic studies in populations studied so far. DRTA is heterogeneous and as such, transporters and ion channels are analysed which have been identified in alpha-intercalated cells of the collecting duct, which could explain cases of dRTA not associated with the hitherto studied genes. DRTA can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. Autosomal recessive dRTA appears in the first months of life and progresses with nephrocalcinosis and early or late hearing loss. Autosomal dominant dRTA is less severe and appears during adolescence or adulthood and may or may not develop nephrocalcinosis. In alpha-intercalated cells of the collecting duct, the acid load is deposited into the urine as titratable acids (phosphates) and ammonium. Autosomal recessive dRTA is associated with mutations in genes ATP6V1B1, ATP6V0A4&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;SLC4A1, which encode subunits a4 and B1 of V-ATPase and the AE1 bicarbonate\/chloride exchanger respectively. By contrast, autosomal dominant dRTA is only related to mutations in AE1.","1186":"Nephropatic Cystinosis (NC) is a rare metabolic disorder due to mutation in the CTNS gene in which more than 90 different mutations have already been reported so far. This study was performed to investigate mutations of the CTNS gene and its promoter in a number of Iranian patients with NC. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing were performed for molecular characterization of the CTNS gene in 25 patients from 24 unrelated Iranian families with NC. None of the patients showed the 57 kb deletion in heterozygous or homozygous manner. One was homozygous for a novel mutation, which was termed as \"c.153-155insCT\", while one of the cases was homozygous and another was compound heterozygous for the second novel mutation c.923G&gt;A. Moreover three known mutations c.18-21delGACT, c.1017G&gt;A, and c.681G&gt;A in 11 of the patients were detected. No apparent mutation was observed in the rest of patients (44%, n=11).

","1187":"ImmuKnow is an in vitro diagnosis method that uses patient samples of whole blood polyclonally stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin. It also measures adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production by CD4+ T cells. The test aims to offer an objective and overall measurement of each individual's cellular immune response. The assay was designed with the idea of individually monitoring the immunosuppression administered to transplant patients. At the same time, it aims to help achieve a balance as a way of avoiding immunosuppression excess and the associated adverse effects (infections, cancer, etc.) or an immunosuppression defect and the subsequent risk of allograft rejection. The majority of studies that have evaluated its clinical usefulness display great diversity in terms of patient recruitment, the immunosuppressant treatment received, the clinical variables analysed and, above all, the time between performing ImmuKnow and the evaluated clinical event. The most consistent data show that this assay on CD4+ T cell functioning is useful for predicting the risk of infection in renal transplant patients. However, its use as a rejection risk indicator is unclear. Lastly, given the great variability of immune response amongst individuals and that of existing publications, it can be deduced that the isolated ImmuKnow value does not have diagnostic capacity and only individual serial monitoring could provide definitive assistance in clinical decision making and immunosuppressant treatment changes. Other aspects of ImmuKnow application in the clinical routine, such as assay cycles, require randomised prospective studies for more comprehensive information.","1188":"Magnesium containing compounds present promising oral phosphate binders for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the impact of magnesium in CKD patients still remains unclear in clinical routine practice. Therefore, this publication provides a practicable overview of knowledge about the physiological role of magnesium in general and in particular in CKD patients. Prevalence of hypomagnesaemia is high in the general population and especially in intensive care unit patients, but often not being detected. Magnesium deficiency increases the risk for several diseases, like diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension and atherosclerosis. Moderate hypermagnesaemia, however, seems to have beneficial effects on vascular calcification and mortality rates in CKD patients. On the other hand, higher serum magnesium levels are reported to be linked to lower PTH levels and results on the effects on bone are controversial. In addition, low magnesium levels are associated with low bone mass, osteoporosis and vascular calcification. In dialysis patients serum magnesium levels are dependent mainly on the dialysate magnesium concentration. To confirm the potential delay of arterial calcification and improved survival outcomes by long-term intervention with magnesium powered randomized studies are required in dialysis patients. Since a recent trial revealed that a phosphate binder containing a combination of magnesium carbonate and calcium acetate was as effective as the polymer-based agent sevelamer hydrochloride and had an equally good tolerability profile, it is time for a re-examination of the role of magnesium in CKD patients.","1189":"","1190":"","1191":"","1192":"","1193":"","1194":"","1195":"","1196":"","1197":"","1198":"","1199":"Spondylodiscitis is an infection of the vertebral body and adjacent intervertebral discs, whose most common means of spreading is the haematogenous route.

Hormonal derangements discussed are prolactin retention, testosterone deficiency and the low trioodothyronine syndrome, all of which have traditionally been interpreted as innocent bystanders of uremia and received relatively scarce attention by the Nephrology community.

But, these patients have a high mortality rate with respect to the general population despite new immunosuppression treatments and improved clinical management. This justifies that the excellent results obtained in the short terms do not have a parallel clinical benefit in the long term. This worrying situation is probably due to a high prevalence of cardiovascular conditions and infectious and neoplastic entities amongst this population against a backdrop of immunosuppression treatment. Furthermore, there is interaction between these processes, which share causal factors and common pathogenic mechanisms. Mortality thus increases. Therefore, identifying the causes of death and the risk factors, applying morbidity and mortality predictive models and intervening in causal factors could constitute some of the strategies for improving renal transplantation results in terms of survival. This review analyses some of the evidence conditioning this high mortality rate following TX, as well and the therapeutic and prognostic aspects associated with co-morbidity: 1) Magnitude of the problem and causes of death among sufferers; 2) Identification of mortality risk factors; 3) Therapeutic strategies for decrease post-TX mortality and; 4) Prediction of mortality and ischaemic heart disease.","1209":"Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis denotes a general pattern of glomerular injury that is easily recognised by light microscopy.

On the contrary, in CIN-induced rats administrated with alpha-tocopherol group, a significant reduction of renal function and renal MDA, together with a significant increase of renal SOD, were observed. Interestingly, a reduction in MDA and an increase of TAC in serum, along with prevention of tubular injury, were demonstrated in this group, as compared to the CM group.

The rates of non-compliance with the K\/DOQI objectives for calcium, phosphorous, intact PTH, and calcium x phosphate product among these patients were 45%, 22%, 70%, and 4%, respectively.

Atypical HUS (aHUS) is a sub-type of HUS in which the TMA phenomena are the consequence of decreased regulation of the alternative complement pathway on cell surfaces due to a genetic cause. aHUS is an extremely rare disease that, despite the administration of standard treatment with plasma therapy, often progresses to terminal chronic renal failure with a high associated rate of mortality. In recent years, research has established the key role that the complement system plays in the induction of endothelial damage in patients with aHUS, through the characterisation of multiple mutations and polymorphisms in the genes that code for certain complement factors. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the terminal fraction of the complement protein, blocking the formation of a cell membrane attack complex. In prospective studies in patients with aHUS, administering eculizumab produces a rapid and sustained interruption in the TMA process, with significant improvements in long-term renal function and an important decrease in the need for dialysis or plasma therapy.

This survey demonstrates that the level of implementation of the S.E.N.-sem- FYC consensus document for CKD has much room for improvement, above all among primary care physicians. The application of this consensus document can improve clinical practice. Several critical aspects have been identified in the evaluation and referral of patients with CKD that must be addressed through the establishment of strategies for disseminating information and continued training for the scientific societies involved in treating these patients. ","1268":"Although blockade of renin-angiotensin system have been cited as the first line of therapy for the management of diabetic nephropathy (DN), however in a substantial number of patients, progression of renal disease are not completely halted by these agents. We have conducted a double blinded clinical trial to assess the additive effect of pentoxifylline on reduction of proteinuria among patients with type 2 DM under blockade of angiotensin system. The dosage of PTX used in our trial was at a low dosage of 400mg daily and to our knowledge, we did not found article which evaluated the antiproteinuric effect of pentoxifylline in this dosage. One hundred patients with DN and persistent proteinuria despite treatment with losartan and enalapril in at least 3 months before inclusion in the study were randomly assigned to two groups. Control group (n=50, 26 males and 24 females) received losartan and enalapril, while treatment group (PTX Group) (n=50, 28 males and 22 females) was given losartan, enalapril and pentoxifylline 400mg\/day for 6 months. At the beginning of the study there were no significant differences in demographic and clinical characteristics of patients including serum creatinine, HbA1c, blood pressure and urinary protein excretion between two groups (P&amp;gt;.05). In the PTX group, the mean rate of urinary protein excretion have significantly decreased from 616.66mg to 378.24 after 3 months (P=.000) and to 192.05mg after 6 months (P=.000) whereas no significant changes were observed in the control group. The beneficial antiproteinuric effect of PTX was not associated to the degree of metabolic control and a reduction of blood pressure. In addition, at the end of study, the mean clearance of creatinine was significantly higher in PTX group (P=.04). In conclusion, PTX can significantly provide additive antiproteinuric effect and slow the decrease in GFR among patients with type 2 DM under blockade of angiotensin system.","1269":"There is a deficit of information regarding the factors that influence peritoneal protein excretion (PPE) during PD therapy. In particular, the effects of the modality of PD and other conditions of the dialysis prescription remain unclear. This prospective, observational study analysed the effects of prescription characteristics on 24-hour PPE (study variable) in a cohort of patients starting PD. Our statistical analysis included a multi-level mixed model and standardised estimations of peritoneal protein transport during serial four-hour peritoneal equilibrium tests in order to control for disparities in the characteristics of patients managed on different regimens. We evaluated 284 patients, 197 on CAPD and 87 on automated PD (APD), at the start of PD treatment. The two groups differed in terms of clinical characteristics and peritoneal function. Univariate, serial estimates of 24-hour PPE were marginally higher in CAPD patients, and remained essentially stable over time in both groups. Multivariate analyses identified CAPD (B=888.5mg, 95% CI: 327.5\/1448.6), total dialysate volume infused per day (B=275.9 mg\/Ll; 153.9\/397.9) and ultrafiltration (B=0.41 mg\/mL; 0.02\/0.80) as independent predictors of 24-hour PPE. The model also revealed a minor trend for a lower 24-hour PPE as time on PD increases. The individual characteristics of peritoneal protein transport are the major determinants of 24-hour PPE. The use of CAPD as the dialysis modality is associated with higher PPE rates than the APD technique, although this difference is counterbalanced by a direct correlation between PPE and the volume of dialysate infused per day. Ultrafiltration and time on dialysis also act as minor independent predictors of PPE during PD therapy.

We selected patients from a Primary Care Centre who had received NSAIDs for the first time. We checked if renal function was measured and\/or controlled 2 months pre\/6 months post-NSAID administration in order to assess if patient renal function was known at the time of prescription and afterwards. During the study period, there were 42 822 prescriptions made. Of these, 8611 were new drug prescriptions, of which 482 (5.6%) were NSAIDs in patients older than 14 years of age. A total of 450 patients (64% female) were treated with NSAIDs. Ibuprofen (66.0%) was the most commonly prescribed. NSAIDs were more frequently used in patients between 14-45 years of age. Only 168 (37.1%) patients underwent any analytical tests over the course of the study (68% female). Before prescription, renal function was measured in only 14% of cases (63 patients). Two patients received NSAIDs despite having high serum creatinine levels. During the follow-up, serum creatinine was measured in 129 patients (28.7%). In primary care, NSAIDs represent a substantial percentage of the drugs prescribed (5.6%). Ibuprofen is the most commonly prescribed. NSAIDs are more frequently used in women between 14-45 years. Musculo-skeletal pain is the main indication for prescription. Only 14% of patients receiving these drugs had previously measured levels of serum creatinine. These values are rarely taken into account when prescribing NSAIDs. Control of renal function after NSAID prescription was unusual.

Donations from non-heart-beating donors (NHBD) can provide as many as one-third of all organs. Controlled patients awaiting cardiac arrest following limitation of life support techniques, or type III Maastricht donors, constitute an alternative that still has yet to be systematically developed. Descriptive series of 10 cases occurring between January and April 2012. Over a period of 6 months, we designed a protocol for extracting and managing kidney transplants and providing immunosuppression therapy. Patients are evaluated in accordance with the criteria agreed by a different team responsible for transplant coordination. We established a maximum duration of time between limitation of life-sustaining therapy and death of 120 minutes and 60 minutes warm ischaemia. Two types of graft perfusion were used, one in situ through direct application to the surgical area, and another using ante mortem vascular canalisation. Immunosuppression therapy included induction with thymoglobulin, steroids, and mycophenolate, with introduction of tacrolimus on the seventh day. Data are expressed as median and (range). We included the first 10 cases of kidney transplants with organs from 5 NHBD (type III Maastricht): 4 males, mean age of 57 years (45-66 years), with limitation of life-sustaining therapy due to anoxic encephalopathy (2), intoxication (1), acute stroke (2) and terminal respiratory failure (1). The following mean time intervals were recorded: effective warm ischaemia: 20 minutes (8-23 minutes) and cold ischaemia: 7.5 hours (4-14.1 hours). Recipients had a mean age of 58 years (32-71 years), with various aetiologies (2 cases of glomerulonephritis, 1 polycystic kidney disease, 2 tubulo-interstitial nephropathy, 4 vascular, and 1 unknown), with a mean 31.7 months on haemodialysis (11-84 months); the kidney was a second transplant in two cases. No patients were hyper-immunised. Six patients required a dialysis session at some point, and four had prolonged acute tubular necrosis, over a mean hospitalisation period of 24.5 days (8-44 days). Mean creatinine (Cr) one month after transplantation was 2.1mg\/dl (0.7-3.2mg\/dl), and mean nadir creatinine was 1.2mg\/dl (0.7-3.2mg\/dl). One patient did not improve upon Cr values &lt;3.2mg\/dl, despite the absence of evidence of toxicity or rejection in a renal biopsy, and the transplant pair reached a Cr of 1.4mg\/dl. Throughout the series, similar surgical complications were recorded to those observed in conventional donor situations. Despite the limitations of this preliminary study, the use of this type of transplant produces favourable short-term evolution. Expanded use of this type of donor could reduce the waiting-list time for a kidney transplant.

In this article we report on the development and testing of an instrument for measuring spiritual well-being within a sample of haemodialysis patients. The main instrument, a 21-item Meaning in Life Scale (MiLS), comprises four scales: Life Perspective, Purpose and Goals, Confusion and Lessened Meaning, Harmony and Peace, and Benefits of Spirituality. A total score for spiritual well-being is also produced. We also used the following variables: clinical (time on haemodialysis, modified Charlson comorbidity index), sociodemographic (age, gender), and self-assessments of health, quality of life (general and recent), personal happiness, religiosity, and belief in the afterlife. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 94 haemodialysis patients. This study demonstrates that the MiLS-Sp is a psychometrically sound measure of spiritual well-being for dialysis patients (reliability, validity) as they manage the complex demands of a chronic illness. Spiritual well-being was significantly associated with various quality of life variables, health status, personal happiness, or religiosity in patients on dialysis. There was no relationship between spirituality scores and comorbidity, HD duration, gender, or age. Spiritual well-being is relatively low in dialysis patients. Spirituality may play an important role on psychological well-being, quality of life, and self-rated health for patients on haemodialysis. Spiritual well-being in these patients is relatively low. Results suggest that assessing and addressing spiritual well-being in dialysis patients may be helpful in clinical practice. ","1276":"In the chronic kidney disease population metabolic acidosis is prevalent presenting already in the early stages of renal dysfunction. The pathogenesis associates the lack of bicarbonate production with the accumulation of organic\/inorganic acids and the development of tubulointerstitial damage through ammonium retention and complement deposition. The empiric use of oral sodium bicarbonate represents an interesting therapeutic option that has been documented in a few clinical trials in human subjects. The availability of oral sodium, in its diverse forms, represents an inexpensive and simple way of treating an entity that could hasten the progression of kidney disease, as well as protein catabolism, bone disease and mortality.","1277":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) represents a rare complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD) with high mortality. It is characterised by diffuse peritoneal membrane fibrosis, which develops into encapsulation and manifests as clinical signs and symptoms of intestinal obstruction. Its incidence varies from 0.7%to 3.3%. The most significant risk factor in its development is exposure time to PD solutions, although young age and peritonitis episodes can also contribute. Its aetiopathogeny has not been clearly explained and it is thought that a second hit like peritonitis, hemoperitoneum, surgery, genetic predisposition, etc on an already damaged peritoneal membrane, could also trigger the development of EPS. Some cases appear after transfer to haemodialysis or after transplant. In these cases, the use of calcineurin inhibitors is believed to be related. The presence of clinical symptoms and signs of intestinal obstruction, along with compatible radiological and\/or anatomical findings could also confirm the diagnosis. At present there are no clinical or biochemical markers capable of predicting its onset. Therapeutic management comprises the use of immunosuppressors like steroids and tamoxifen, nutritional management and even surgery in advanced cases, all of which provide varying results. This article discusses the diagnosis and treatment of EPS, it encourages the participation in the European Registry and it advocates the need to centralise the management of this medical complication.","1278":"","1279":"","1280":"There are no pathophysiolgical therapeutic approaches to acute kidney injury (AKI) and the mortality remains high. In addition chronic kidney disease (CKD) predisposes to AKI and AKI contributes to progression of CKD. Recently a transcriptomics approach unveiled a relationship between AKI, inflammation and the regulation of ageing. A transcriptomics analysis of experimental AKI revealed increased kidney expression of Fn14 and transmembrane chemokine CXCL16, as well as a decreased expression of the kidney-secreted anti-ageing hormone Klotho. Fn14 is the receptor for tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), a member of the TNF superfamily. In AKI kidneys there was a positive correlation between Fn14 and CXCL16 mRNA expression and an inverse correlation between Fn14 and Klotho mRNA. Tubular cells were the site of Fn14, CXCL16 and Klotho expression in vivo. Research on the relationships between these three molecules disclosed that TWEAK activation of Fn14 promoted inflammation through secretion of chemokines such as CXL16 in tubular cells in culture and in vivo. Furthermore, TWEAK activation of Fn14 decreased expression of Klotho mRNA and protein in culture and in vivo. Interestingly, both TWEAK activation of CXCL16 mRNA transcription and suppression of Klotho mRNA transcription were mediated by the NF&amp;kappa;B transcription factor. In conclusion, TWEAK engagement of Fn14 is a central event promoting NF&amp;kappa;B-mediated activation of inflammation pathways and suppression of anti-inflammatory\/anti-ageing pathways. This information may influence future therapeutic approaches to AKI and inflammation\/aging.","1281":"","1282":"","1283":"","1284":"","1285":"","1286":"","1287":"","1288":"","1289":"","1290":"","1291":"","1292":"","1293":"","1294":"","1295":"","1296":"","1297":"Despite advances in the pharmacological treatment of arterial hypertension (AHT) and the use of multiple antihypertensive drugs, a small but significant percentage of true severe refractory arterial hypertension patients are still not reaching their target blood pressure.

We present the case of a 52-year-old patient diagnosed with essential hypertension, resistant to treatment with seven antihypertensive drugs. After 10 hospitalisations without achieving adequate blood pressure control, we decided to propose renal sympathetic denervation as an addition to medical treatment. The procedure was performed without complications in the short to medium-long term, achieving a significant improvement in blood pressure with the intention of reducing overall vascular risk.","1298":"Metformin is a drug widely used in type 2 diabetic patients. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) in diabetic patients is rare but can be serious. However, the relationship between metformin and lactic acidosis is under debate. We present seven cases of patients with MALA who came to our centre over a period of one year and who were treated early with haemodiafiltration. There are some risk factors that appear to predispose patients to this pathology, such as: acute renal failure, situations of hypoxemia and sepsis, cardiac or respiratory failure, previous history of lactic acidosis, liver disease and dehydration. As such, the use of metformin is discouraged in patients with GFR below 30 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2). All patients in our study were treated early with haemodiafiltration. The mortality in our study was 16.6%. We believe that MALA is a serious condition that requires prompt diagnosis and early treatment. Renal replacement therapy is not the solution for all patients, but can improve prognosis in more severe cases if started early. We should limit the use of metformin in diabetic patients with impaired renal function, although there is still controversy in the medical literature.","1299":"At present, there is no adequate system available for evaluating dialysis centres. To construct an overall haemodialysis results weighting system, acceptable to the different stakeholders involved which allows the comparison of centres using a compound marker. The Quality Management Work Group of the Spanish Society of Nephrology (WG) established a set of preselected indicators. A Focus Group, independent of the WG, was established. It was made up of nine individuals: three patients, three clinicians and three clinical managers, who assessed these indicators using an approved methodology and established the selected indicators. Finally, the indicators were weighted through three weighting stages, each separated by two debate periods, which involved the distribution of 100 points between each variable, according to the personal assessment and the debate sustained. The clinical results included: haemodialysis doses, anaemia, plasma calcium and phosphorus, type of vascular access, and hospitalisation days. The weighting given to each variable following the third weighting process, expressed as an average of all the factors, was as follows: clinical results 38.9; annual mortality 25.0; satisfaction with the centre 12.2; health-related quality of life 15.6; and cost 8.3 (total 100).

We examined 251 patients, 146 of which were men, with a mean age of 62.5 (11.5) years and 43% prevalence of type II DM. Levels of FGF 23 rose progressively, in a very significant manner, in correlation with the evolution of CKD, especially in stage 4 as compared to stage 1 (110.61 ng\/L vs 31.32 ng\/L). The same happened with iPTH values. Additionally, levels of 1,25 vitamin D decreased in a similar manner. Calcium values did not change. 25 vit D3 levels were low at all times and showed no tendency for a steady decline. Phosphorus rose in stage 4 CKD. Levels of FGF 23 were negatively correlated with renal function indicators and positively correlated with PTH and P. During the evolution of CKD, changes of FGF 23 and PTH would be the earliest markers. Calcium and 25 vit D3 do not vary with changes in the progression of CKD.

The HHRH is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance and is an extremely rare form of hypophosphatemic rickets. The diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent bone sequelae of rickets and nephrocalcinosis. A correct differential diagnosis with other forms of hypophosphatemic rickets has implications on the treatment, as the management based only on phosphorus supplementation usually corrects all clinical and biochemical abnormalities, except for the loss of phosphorus in the urine.

All dysfunctional radiocephalic fistulas due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis were included (n=96). The diagnosis was made by fistulografy in low flow cases and clinical evidence in cases of thrombosis. The repair was performed using a new proximal radiocephalic anastomosis in all cases. Patency following surgical intervention was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method.

Retrospective study. Between January 2005 and December 2009, 108 Hax-AVF were implanted. From June 2007 a T-AVF was established. A preoperative duplex was performed and a follow-up control carried out a month after the intervention and subsequently every 3 months. An analysis was made of the permeability of 57 Hax-AVF carried out between June 2007 and December 2009 (T-AVF Group), in comparison to 51 interventions performed during the previous 30 months (Control Group). No differences in the permeability achieved were found at 12 and 24 months, with a secondary permeability at 12 months of 49% in the T-AVF Group and 52% in the Control Group. The percentage of patients needing to be re-operated was inferior in the T-AVF Group (35%) than in the Control Group (67%) p=0.02. The re-operation per patient average was lower in the T-AVF Group than in the Control Group (0.49 vs. 1.18 p=0.01). The patients of the TAVF Group underwent a lesser number of re-operations for obstruction as opposed to the Control Group (0.42 vs 1.04 p=0.01). In our experience, the intensive follow-up controls did not improve the permeability of the Hax-AVF, although re-operations due to obstruction did diminish.

This cross-sectional study includes 304 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (ADOs) and a glomerular filtration rate (estimated GFR) &amp;lt;60ml\/min\/1.73m2. Patients were attended in consecutive visits to primary health centres or in hospital departments of endocrinology or nephrology during 2010. We studied the frequency of metformin and other ADO prescriptions according to renal function and the department in which the patient was treated. The ADO most frequently prescribed was metformin (54.9%), followed by repaglinide (47.7%), DPP4 inhibitors (28.6%), and sulfonylureas (18.4%). However, in nephrology departments, repaglinide was more frequently prescribed than metformin (P&amp;lt;.001), whereas in primary health centres, the prescription of DPP4 inhibitors increased. In patients with an estimated GFR of 15-29ml\/min\/1.73m2, metformin (13.3%) and sulfonylureas were the least prescribed, whereas metformin was much more frequently prescribed (70.0%) when estimated GFR was 45-59ml\/min\/1.73m2 (P&amp;lt;.001). In contrast, patients with an estimated GFR of 15-29ml\/min\/1.73m2 were mainly prescribed repaglinide (76.7%), as opposed to patients with an estimated GFR of 45-59ml\/min\/1.73m2 (38.9%) (P&amp;lt;.001).

Possible risk factors included the following: age, sex, body mass index, body surface area, diabetes, polycystic kidney disease, previous surgery, time of surgical procedure, omentectomy, omentopexy, wound infection and postoperative incisional hernia. During the first year, 47 patients (20%) required a catheter replacement due to poor function. The most common complications were catheter migration and peritonitis (4.3% in both cases), followed by obstruction from omental wrapping (3.7%). Univariate analysis showed that patients with catheter dysfunction or requiring catheter replacement were younger, with a lower body mass index and body surface area (P&lt;.05). There was a significant association of wound infection and post-operative incisional hernia with catheter replacement. Omentectomy was associated with a low incidence rate of catheter dysfunction\/replacement in the univariate and logistical regression analyses (odds ratio: 0.275; 95% confidence interval: 0.101-0.751; P&lt;.012).

The combination of the two processes can exacerbate inflammation, resulting in increases in both resistance to erythropoietin (EPO) and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of heart disease in a representative group of non-dialysis patients with stage 4-5 CKD, and the influence of that entity on EPO requirements and on mortality during a period of 36 months. 134 patients (68% on EPO at the beginning, increasing to 72.3% during follow-up) were monitored for 36 months. To evaluate the dose-response effect of EPO therapy, we used the erythropoietin resistance index (ERI) calculated as the weekly weight-adjusted dose of EPO divided by the haemoglobin level. The ERI was determined both initially and during the last six months before the end of the study. 39 patients (29.1%) had history of heart disease; 22 (16.4%) had suffered from heart failure (HF). The ERI was higher in patients with a history of heart disease or HF and those treated with drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitors or ARBs). Using ERI as the dependent variable in the multivariate analysis, the variables that composed the final model were ferritin, haemoglobin, glomerular filtration rate and history of HF. The 36 month mortality rate (n=39 patients) was higher in the group having ERI above the median (2.6IU\/week\/kg\/gram of haemoglobin in 100ml) (P=.002), and in the groups with heart disease (P=.001) or HF (P=.001) according to the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

These pregnancies are not exempt from both maternal and foetal complications, and so their management requires the joint efforts of nephrologists, gynaecologists, nurses, and nutritionists. Currently, we have been unable to establish consistent systematic treatment from both nephrological and gynaecological specialists in these patients. The main changes that need to be made are: increased time on dialysis, maintaining low levels of pre-dialysis urea, avoiding: maternal hypertension and hypotension, anaemia, urinary tract infections, and fluctuations in electrolytes. Adequate foetal monitoring is also necessary.","1370":null,"1371":null,"1372":null,"1373":"Persistent nephrotic syndrome that does not respond to treatment may cause progression to kidney failure.

In addition to classical risk factors (e.g. age and pre-existing cardiac diseases), other potential reversible abnormalities linked to CKD such as anaemia, volume overload, or vascular access placement may also influence the incidence and severity of acute exacerbations of CHF. This study aims to determine the incidence and main determinants of CHF in a cohort of patients with stage 4-5 pre-dialysis CKD. The study group consisted of 562 patients (mean age: 65 +\/- 15 years, 260 females, 31% diabetics). Native arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) were created in 160 patients who chose haemodialysis as the initial technique for renal replacement therapy. The main outcome variables were: acute decompensated CHF (defined by standard criteria), dialysis initiation (planned and unplanned), and death before dialysis initiation. In addition to demographics, comorbidities, and clinical and biochemical data, AVF creation was also included as a potential determinant of CHF in multiple logistic regression models. Ninety-five patients (17%) developed at least one episode of acute decompensated CHF, and the incidence rate was 19 episodes per 1000 patient-years. In addition to classical risk factors (age, female sex, obesity, diabetes, and previous history of CHF or coronary artery disease), creation of a successful AVF significantly increased the risk of CHF (OR=9.54, 95% CI: 4.84-18.81, P&lt;.0001). In 47 out of 95 patients who developed CHF, a functioning AVF had previously been created, 92% of which were upper arm native AVF, with a median of 51 days between the surgical procedure and CHF episode. The mortality of patients with CHF was similar to that of the rest of the study patients, although unplanned dialysis initiation was significantly more frequent in those who developed CHF. Acute decompensated CHF episodes are common in pre-dialysis CKD patients. In addition to classical risk factors, pre-emptive AVF placement was strongly associated with the development of CHF. ","1399":"Gross haematuria is a common manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). It can be spontaneous or the result of trauma, renal calculi, tumour, or infection. Spontaneous cyst bleeding is important in this particular group of patients, since it can be prolonged by local activation of fibrinolysis by urokinase. The management of haematuria in ADPKD is usually conservative, including bed rest, blood transfusion, correction of blood disorders, and use of vasopressin and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. In some patients, the management of gross or life-threatening haematuria may require embolisation and\/or nephrectomy. Nonetheless, other methods have been tried to avoid prolonged hospitalisation and nephrectomy and preserve kidney function, such as the use of anti-fibrinolytics. Tranexamic acid was recently suggested as a tool to treat gross haematuria in ADPKD in isolated cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the response to tranexamic acid in a group of 8 patients with ADPKD and gross haematuria unresponsive to conventional treatment. The massive bleeding stopped within 2 to 5 days in all patients. The haemoglobin level and renal function subsequently stabilised. There were no side effects or thromboembolic events. In this case series, the largest prospective study so far published and the only one including different degrees of renal function, tranexamic acid is confirmed as a promising tool for treating haematuria due to intracystic bleeding in ADPKD. In summary, tranexamic acid can be used safely in ADPKD patients with chronic renal impairment or preserved renal function to treat severe haematuria poorly responsive to conventional therapy. Tranexamic acid can be administered orally or IV; and dose adjustment for renal impairment is important. Tranexamic acid therapy may preserve renal function in ADPKD directly, by stopping haematuria episodes, or indirectly, by preventing embolisation and\/or nephrectomy. The major limitation of this study is the small sample size and the lack of an untreated control group. We suggest a prospective, randomised controlled study to confirm the efficacy of this treatment, its long-term safety, and the optimal dosage. Further larger and multicentre studies are needed to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio and the limits of this therapy in the clinical setting.

During the study period, 218 chronic renal failure patients were managed on haemodialysis for a minimum of 90 days. In 17 cases (8%), it was possible to interrupt dialysis after 95 to 529 days. The probability of renal function recovery was higher in patients with chronic interstitial nephritis (P=.04) or autoimmune diseases (P=.07), as well as in those starting haemodialysis treatment at a frequency of two sessions per week (P=.02). No significant differences in age, gender, glomerular filtration rate at the beginning of haemodialysis treatment, or comorbidity rate were observed.

Two patients died for reasons unrelated to renal failure treatment, and another patient was moved to another hospital following 35 months without dialysis. The other 14 patients are alive and 8 are dialysis-free, with a monitoring period of 13 to 106 months.

We discuss the management of pain and symptom control, as well as communication skills and other psychological and ethical aspects in the renal patient. We conclude that in chronic renal patients, a palliative care approach can provide a positive impact on the quality of life of patients and their families, as well as optimizing the complex treatment of the renal patient.","1434":"","1435":"","1436":"","1437":"World Kidney Day on March 8th 2012 provides a chance to reflect on the success of kidney transplantation as a therapy for end stage kidney disease that surpasses dialysis treatments both for the quality and quantity of life that it provides and for its cost effectiveness. Anything that is both cheaper and better, but is not actually the dominant therapy, must have other drawbacks that prevent replacement of all dialysis treatment by transplantation. The barriers to universal transplantation as the therapy for end stage kidney disease include the economic limitations which, in some countries place transplantation, appropriately, at a lower priority than public health fundamentals such as clean water, sanitation and vaccination. Even in high income countries the technical challenges of surgery and the consequences of immunosuppression restrict the number of suitable recipients, but the major finite restrictions on kidney transplantation rates are the shortage of donated organs and the limited&amp;nbsp; medical, surgical and nursing workforces with the required expertise. These problems have solutions which involve the full range of societal, professional, governmental and political environments. World Kidney Day is a call to&amp;nbsp; deliver transplantation therapy to the one million people a year who have a right to benefit.","1438":null,"1439":"The current definition and classification of acute kidney injury is based on consensus criteria (RIFLE and AKIN systems). Creatinine is the most commonly used of the recommended parameters (creatinine, glomerular filtration rate and diuresis). If the baseline value is not known, it can be calculated based on the simplified MDRD equation, assuming a filtration rate of 75 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 for the calculation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic impact of using estimated baseline creatinine compared to the actual value measured in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Analysis of patients undergoing major cardiac surgery, who were prospectively included in a database. The maximum RIFLE stage reached was calculated for each patient using the measured and estimated baseline creatinine levels. The impact on the diagnosis was analysed using intraclass correlation coefficients, concordance analysis and Bland-Altman plots. The incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in 2103 cases between 2002 and 2007 was 29.1%, according to estimated creatinine (14.3% with the measure). This represents an overestimation of 104%, with an intraclass correlation of 0.12. By excluding patients with known chronic kidney disease (glomerular filtration rate [&lt;60 ml\/min\/1.73 m2), both the overestimation (2.4%) and the correlation (0.57) improved. The calculation of baseline creatinine using the MDRD equation overestimates the incidence of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery, and is an inadequate method for detection when the baseline value is unknown.

In this study, pain and the relations between arterial pressure and pain threshold were compared at the beginning and end of the haemodialysis. 14 patients with chronic renal disease participated in the study. Pain thresholds were evaluated with pressure algometry bilaterally at two tender points: the second rib and the knee. Arterial pressure and pain thresholds were assessed twice: 1) 15 min alter dialysis onset and 2) 30 min before dialysis ended. Arterial pressure remains unchanged through the dialysis. The course of dialysis was associated to a decrease in pain threshold in the second left rib and left and right knees. At the beginning of dialysis arterial pressure were uncorrelated with pain, while at the end of the dialysis both systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were strongly associated to pain thresholds (rs between 0.552 and 0.806): increased arterial pressure was associated to lower pain in terms of increased threshold. Haemodialysis is associated to changes in pain sensitivity and in the relationships between arterial pressure and pain, suggesting a modification in the ascending pain inhibition system arising from the cardiovascular system. Possible explanations of this effect include the changes produced by haemodialysis in cognitive-perceptive functions, in autonomic cardiovascular regulation, and in the habituation of stress-related variables.

The perception of quality of life is affected by psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression that have a high prevalence in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These factors are also linked to lower life expectancy. It is therefore surprising that the psychological aspects of people with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have received so little attention in the medical literature, despite their importance for the overall health of these patients. The relatively new discipline called psychonephrology provides a broader view of the impact that these aspects have on individuals with chronic kidney disease, with a consequent practical application. In this article, we examine the consequences and prevalence of psychological problems that can be related to CKD and ADPKD. Firstly, we will focus on the field of CKD and ADPKD within the scope of psychonephrology. Secondly, the article introduces the concept of quality of life as a basic pillar of health that is affected when a person is diagnosed with CKD.

Electrical bioimpedance (EBI) is a non-invasive and objective procedure, which is increasingly being used for this assessment. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between the phase angle determined by EBI at a frequency of 50kHz (AF50) and other nutritional parameters, and prospectively evaluate its ability as a marker for long-term mortality. We included 164 patients (127 on haemodialysis and 37 on peritoneal dialysis) who underwent an EBI analysis while simultaneously determining inflammation and nutrition parameters. The Charlson comorbidity index was then calculated. In the linear correlation analysis, we found that the AF50 had a direct association with lean mass, intracellular water, extracellular water and interdialytic weight gain, while having an inverse association with age and fat mass. Patients with AF50 &gt;8&amp;ordm; had a better nutritional status, were younger and had significantly longer survival at the six-year follow-up. Among the patients studied, both the AF50 and the other body composition parameters were better in peritoneal dialysis than in haemodialysis, but these differences may be attributable to the fact that the first patients were younger. In the multivariate analysis, only the AF50 &lt;8&amp;ordm; and comorbidity adjusted for age persisted as independent risk factors for mortality. We conclude that AF50 has a good correlation with nutritional parameters and is a good marker of survival in dialysis patients. Nevertheless, intervention studies are needed to demonstrate if the improvement in EBI parameters is associated with better survival.

A large proportion of these patients have associated chronic kidney disease (CKD), which may require renal replacement therapy (RRT). Due to the complications associated with liver disease with coagulation disorders and tendencies towards spontaneous hypotension, there are significant problems associated to RRT, especially haemodialysis (HD).

AC is tightly associated with aging and arterial remodeling, including intima-media thickening, but also changes of the geometry and function of aortic valves. Evidence has accumulated pointing to the active and regulated nature of the calcification process.

Emphasis is given to its usefulness to control hyperparathyroidism and its impact on morbidity and mortality. We also analysed pharmacoeconomic studies that have been published which compare active vitamin D metabolites. From this review, we are able to conclude that there is still not enough scientific evidence to be able to prefer one active vitamin D over another.

The relationship between proteinuria and graft survival is likely to be due to the factors that cause proteinuria. It is unknown why proteinuria and patient survival are related, but it could be due to a relationship between proteinuria and traditional cardiovascular risk factors or a relationship between proteinuria, endothelial function and inflammation.

Observational and cross-sectional study; we included 526 patients with DM2 and arterial hypertension (AHT). We collected data on: demographics, anthropometrics, harmful habits, history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), blood pressure, kidney function, glycaemic control, lipid profile, and drug treatment, among others. The mean age (SD) was 66 (10.6) years, 61% were male, 12.8% were smokers, 39.4% had a history of CVD, 72% had hypercholesterolemia, and 44% were obese. Seventeen point five percent of patients had tight BP control (&lt;130\/80mm Hg) (95% confidence interval [CI]:14.3-21.0), while 36.9% had BP below 140\/85mm Hg.

The aim of this study was to establish if renal function tests are useful in determining which cases of mild to moderate dilatation of the urinary tract do not require an initial cystography. The study was conducted on 79 infants (57 males, 22 females) with pyelectasis. Seventy-three were diagnosed in utero and 6 after birth.

Sickle-cell disease is an autosomal recessive haemoglobinopathy that involves a qualitative anomaly of haemoglobin due to substitution of valine for the glutamic acid in the sixth position of 3-globin gene on the short arm of chromosome 11. For the full disease to be manifested, this mutation must be present on both inherited alleles. The severity of the disease is proportional to the quantity of haemoglobin S (Hb S) in the red cells; sickle-cell trait (Hb S &lt;50%) and homozygous sickle-cell disease (Hb S &gt;75%). In sickle-cell disease, the abnormal Hb S loses its rheological characteristics and is responsible of the various systemic manifestations including those of the kidney, such as macroscopic haematuria secondary to papilar necrosis. Despite the generally benign nature of the sickle-cell trait, several potentially serious complications have been described. Metabolic or environmental changes such as hypoxia, acidosis, dehydration, hyperosmolality or hyperthermia may transform silent sickle-cell trait into a syndrome resembling sickle-cell disease with vaso-occlusive crisis due to an accumulation of low deformable red blood cells in the microcirculation originating haematuria from papilar necrosis. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated an earlier onset of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), in blacks with ADPKD and sickle-cell trait when compared with blacks with ADPKD without the trait. We studied 2 african-american families (4 patients) which presented with both ADPKD and sickle-cell trait (Hb S &lt;50%). The diagnosis of sickle-cell trait was confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis. The renal volume was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The proband subject in family 1 presented frequent haematuria episodes, associated to increase of renal volume, developed very early ESRD and was dialyzed at the age of 39 years. The other 3 patients in family 2 presented different degree of renal function. The presence of sickle haemoglobin should be determined in african-american and west-african patients with ADPKD because it is an important prognostic factor. Coherence of sickle-cell trait may have influence on ADPKD evolution to ESRD and other complications, such as cystic haemorrhages. MRI can identify intracystic haemorrhage and permit renal volume measure.

However, the pathophysiological mechanism of sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome has been intensely debated for decades. Several clinical and experimental observations argue against the classic or \"underfill\" hypothesis of oedema formation in nephrotic syndrome. In many patients, oedema formation in nephrotic syndrome is due to the kidney being intrinsically unable to excrete salt and is unrelated to systemic factors (i.e. hypoalbuminaemia, decreased &amp;ldquo;effective&amp;rdquo; arterial blood volume, and secondary hyperaldosteronism). The cortical collecting duct is the nephron site of sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome. Activation of the epithelial sodium channel in the cortical collecting duct is responsible for sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome. In nephrotic syndrome, a defective glomerular filtration barrier allows the passage of proteolytic enzymes or their precursors, which have the ability to activate the epithelial sodium channel, thereby causing the the subsequent sodium retention and oedema.","1563":"Vascular calcification has traditionally been considered to be a passive process that was associated with advanced age, atherosclerosis, uncommon genetic diseases and some metabolic alterations such as diabetes mellitus and end-stage kidney failure. However, in the last years, vascular calcification has been proven to be an active and regulated process, similar to bone mineralisation, in which different bone-related proteins are involved. Recent results question the classic classification of vascular calcification into intimal and medial calcification, at least in capacitance arteries. Pro and anti-calcifying mechanisms play an active role in calcium deposition in vascular cells, making this area an active focus of research. The identification of therapeutic targets which can slow down the progression or even reverse vascular calcification could be an important step forward in the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease.","1564":"","1565":"","1566":"","1567":"","1568":"","1569":"","1570":null,"1571":"The combination of renin-angiotensin system blockers with calcium channel blockers appears to be one of the most effective options for treating hypertension and diabetes.Nevertheless, not all calcium blockers behave in the same manner.

In addition,T-type channels are related to proliferation, inflammation,fibrosis, vasoconstriction and activation of the renin-angiotensin system. The inhibition of these factors could explain the non-haemodynamic effects of manidipine as compared to other blockers.","1572":"The prevalence of chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients with chronic kidney disease is higher than in the general population. The estimated prevalence is 13% in haemodialysis, with wide variations geographically and between units in the same country. A liver biopsy is a useful tool for deciding whether to start antiviral therapy and to exclude concomitant causes of liver dysfunction. Examples of this include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, whose incidence is on the rise, and haemosiderosis, which may affect the progression of the disease and determine the response to antiviral therapy. In addition, the transjugular approach can be used to measure the hepatic venous pressure gradient and confirm the existence of portal hypertension. Chronic hepatitis due to HCV has been shown to reduce survival in haemodialysis, renal transplantation and graft survival. It is the fourth leading cause of death and the leading cause of post-renal transplantation liver dysfunction. HCV behaves as an independent risk factor for the occurrence of proteinuria; it increases the risk of developing diabetes mellitus, de novo glomerulonephritis and chronic allograft nephropathy; it leads to a deterioration in liver disease and causes a greater number of infections. An increased frequency of fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis has also been described which, together with the rapid evolution to cirrhosis, can significantly increase morbidity and mortality and lead to the need for liver transplantation. In addition, immunosuppression in renal transplantation predisposes a reactivation of HCV. However, as the pharmacokinetics of interferon and ribavirin is impaired in kidney failure and their use has adverse effects on function and graft survival, a combination therapy must be limited to non-transplanted individuals with an estimated glomerular filtration rate greater than 50ml\/min, and with the interferon being used as monotherapy in dialysis. The fact that a quarter of HCV-positive patients evaluated for a renal transplant have bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis in the liver biopsy may renew renal pre-transplant treatment planning.","1573":"Live-donor kidney transplants are being done since more than fifty years ago. In recent years, a marked increase in live donations is observed, as a result of the limited availability of organs from deceased donors. Also, the use of laparoscopic nephrectomy has contributed to increase live donations. A systematic review of the literature shows that short and long-term risks of morbidity and mortality of the donor are reasonably low. Even so, an increased incidence of high blood pressure and mild proteinuria has been reported. On the contrary, no detrimental effect on renal failure is observed and the incidence of long-term chronic renal failure is lower in the donor population when compared with the incidence observed in the general population. In any case, a regular follow-up of the donors is advisable in order to prevent or early detect those medical conditions that would represent a health risk, in particular those conditions that possibly will affect renal function: hypertension, diabetes, proteinuria and obesity. It would be also necessary to establish a nation-wide scientific registry, with prospective regular data collection, that will make possible a more accurate assessment of the long-term risk of uninephrectomy and early detection of new medical information that would contribute to redefine the risk of kidney donation or to establish new requisites in the donor evaluation protocols.","1574":null,"1575":"The most important factor in life expectancy for children on renal replacement therapy (RRT) is to have a functioning graft when they reach adulthood (63 years&amp;nbsp; on transplantation vs 37 years on dialysis).

There are several reasons that make LDT the most recommended RRT in children: pre-emptive transplant avoiding dialysis, good renal mass, minimal cold ischemia time, better HLA-matching and the possibility to program the time of surgery. Long term graft survival in LDT is significantly better than in cadaveric donor transplantation (CDT) (81.3%&amp;nbsp; LDT vs 60.8 % CDT at 10 years follow-up). Calculated half-life graft survival for recipients aged 2-5 years reaches 27.5 years in some series, making LDT the ideal option for these children.

However, preemptive LDT has a 70% of graft survival at 10 years. Late rejections episodes associated with non-adherence factors are found in all series. Unrelated LDT in pediatric recipients outcome remain unclear.","1576":"Living donor kidney transplantation allows immunosuppression individualization based on clinical and immunological criteria. Living donor kidney transplantation allows administration of immunosuppressive drugs days before transplantation, for a better acute rejection prevention. A 3-day course of tacrolimus and a micophenolic acid derivative is recommended. In recipients HLA-identical related to the donor, a tacrolimus-micophenolic acid r&amp;eacute;gimen is recommended. Tacrolimus withdrawal after 6 months may be advisable. In all non-HLA-identical recipients, basiliximab induction is recommended, with the exception of high immunological risk patients, in whom thymoglobulin is a better option. The use of a kidney from an expanded criteria donor might imply a reduction in tacrolimus exposure since the very beginning, to optimize kidney graft function. In general, and depending on immunological risk, steroid withdrawal after the first 3 to 6 months is recommended. ABO-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation is feasible after specific immunoadsorption, gammaglobulins, a dose of rituximab and conventional immunosupression.","1577":"Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy has shown less morbidity than the open approach, with less pain and analgesia requirements and allowing a quicker recovery and an earlier return to normal activity. Furthermore, many studies have shown equivalent results between both approaches in terms of graft functions and recipient complications.

The implementation of this minimally invasive technique in most centers has led to an increase in the rate of this kind of organ procurement, due to its better acceptance by the donors. In order to decide which kidney is better to extract, it is mandatory to maintain the best kidney in the donor. In case equal conditions, it is advisable to perform left nephrectomy.","1578":"The objective of the study is to evaluate the risk of graft failure. The presence of donor specific alloantibodies and the HLA incompatibilities between donor and receptor must be identified. There are several methods to identify alloandibodies that has different sensitivity and different Prognostic Value. Some define a high risk of hyperacute rejection, others an increase in the risk to loss the graft in defined subgroups. First steps of the pretransplant study identify: a) HLA typing of the receptor and available donors; b) alloantibodies by Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity against Panel (PRA-CDC) and screening of alloantibodies against HLA by Solid Phase; c) in sensitized receptors it can be useful to identify acceptable incompatibilities using Single Antigen Solid Phase technique and to evaluate the &amp;laquo;Virtual Crossmatch&amp;raquo;. Pretransplant study (10 days): a) crossmatch by Citotoxicity (CM-CDC) between receptor and donor; b) crossmatch by Flow-Cytometry (FCCM) between receptor and donor specially indicated in the retransplant. Useful also to discard IgM auto-antibodies. Receptors desensitization: the necessity and success probability of desensitization should be evaluated before treatment. Post-Transplant Monitoring: identify alloantibodies for: a) the differential diagnostic of corticorresistant rejection episodes with humoral component, and b) as a marker of long term reduced graft survival probability in the long term. Final remarks: Evaluation should consider the allosensibilization history of the receptor. The cytotoxicity crossmatch indicates a high risk of hyperacute rejection and is considered a contraindication. The Flow Cytometry crossmatch indicates an increase in the probability to loss the graft in the first year that is low for first transplants (&gt;10%) but higher for retransplantation (&gt;30%). The virtual crossmatch by solid phase indicates an increase in the probability to have an antibody mediated rejection (from 5% to 55%) but did not contraindicate always the transplant.","1579":"Donor protection should always be taken account during the selection and assessment of a living donor. On these terms, the evaluation of a potential donor must include these issues: 1) The donor act is altruistic, consciousness and out of coercion; 2) Life expectancy and quality of life of the recipient will improve after the living donor kidney transplantation; 3) The donor has normal renal function and the potential risk of developing nephropathy in the long term follow up is scarce (familiar nephropathies and other processes that may increase the potential risk for renal disease in the future, like severe hypertension, diabetes, etc must be ruled out). The glomerular filtrate should meet criteria for the normal function corresponding to age furthermore the absence of proteinuria and urine smear is normal; 4) The screening in the donor should contemplate those clinical situations or diseases non related to the kidney function but might elevate the surgical and\/or anesthesia risk besides disease transmission to the recipient (as neoplasia or infections); 5) The surgical act is possible without technical difficulties and always performed after a negative result of the crossmatch between donor and recipient. The living donor evaluation process will follow a different schedule based on each particular case and the center facilities. Any case, the mentioned process is divided in two parts: The first one contains an initial screening (using non invasive and low cost tests) that allows discarding contraindications for donation (in both donor and recipient). In a second phase the assessment of the donor varies with donor characteristics. However, a test for renal function is mandatory besides imaging techniques (like angioTC), screening for transmissible diseases and a detailed evaluation for psychosocial aspects preferably made by professional. Moreover Spanish policy on living donation requires a report with information about the consent for donation developed by an independent board (ethics committee) besides the consent for donation given at the civil registry.","1580":"The living donor kidney transplant should be considered a priority option providing better quality of life and survival for those needing renal replacement therapy. To increase their number, both nephrologists and patients, should be informed more and better, offering this option compared with LDKT alternatives (dialysis or kidney transplant from a deceased donor). The clinical nephrology consultations or specific pre-dialysis are the space where in stages 3 and 4 of renal failure should be started on LDKT informational approaches. Later, when seeking more detailed information and\/or evaluation of potential donors, this could be provided at times and spaces specifically reserved for awareness professionals with the use of brochures or Internet addresses. Information should focus especially on the additional benefits of pre-emptive LDKT, the risks of nephrectomy and long term controls for the donor. Finally, donor, recipient and family should know that the donation will only be justified and may be accepted if the studies of risk\/benefit for the donor and recipient have been faithfully evaluated according to the highest ethical standards.","1581":"Kidney transplant is the best therapy to manage end-stage kidney failure. The main barriers limiting this therapy are scarcity of cadaveric donors and the comorbidities of the patients with end-stage kidney failure, which prevent the transplant. Living kidney donor transplant makes it possible to obviate the problem of scarcity of cadaveric donor organs and also presents better results than the cadaveric transplant. The principal indication of living kidney donor transplant is preemptive transplant. This will allow the patient to avoid the complications of dialysis and it has also been demonstrated that it has better results than the transplant done after dialysis has been initiated. Priority indications of living donor transplant are also univitelline twins and HLA identical siblings. We will also have very favorable conditions when the donor is young and male. On the contrary, the living donor transplant will have worse results if the donors are over 60-65 years and the recipients are young, this possibly being a relative contraindication. There is an absolute contraindication for the living donation when the recipient has diseases with high risk of aggressive relapse in the grafts: focal and segmental hyalinosis that have had early relapse in the first transplant; atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome due to deficit or malfunction of the complement regulatory proteins; early development of glomerulonephritis due to anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody in patients with Alport Syndrome; primary hyperoxaluria.","1582":"Living donor kidney transplantation is regulated in Spain by the transplantation law 30\/1979 and developed by Royal Decree 2070\/1999.

It further specifies that the destination of the organ must be the transplantation in a specific person (this specification allows for the donation, not only among emotionally related, but between people that do not know each other, provided it is done altruistically, without any purpose of profit and without coercion). The donor must be competent, healthy and had reached 18 years old (which is evidenced by a medical certificate) and should be well informed of the consequences of their decision. The donor must give their consent to donation, free from inducement and consciously in the courts of civil registration. In order to guarantee the quality and safety of the procedure, the centers that performed this therapeutic must be authorized both for the nephrectomy and the transplantation.","1583":"Living donor kidney transplantation is considered an established treatment for end-stage renal failure and is accepted in different transplant forums, nationally and internationally, while ensuring the safety of the donation, the information, the motivation and caring, the free consent and the absence profit. the living donor nephrectomy is not extent of risks so a good assessment of the donor's health status and psychosocial situation must be performed to evaluate if the benefits to donor and recipient outweigh the risks assumed. Information and Consent: to be considered ethically acceptable, the donor must be able to give his free consent to the donation after understanding the information provided, accepting the risks and benefits of organ donation, knowing the treatment alternatives for the recipient and the long-term consequences of his decision The absence of profit: offering or receiving money for an organ or other human tissue violates the principles of justice and equity and it is considered ethically and legally unacceptable it is important to make a good psychosocial assessment to identify whether the motivation is altruistic or not and, in other terms, to detect any kind of coercion (ex, in the family). Living donation must not be offered in desperate family situations so it is important to assess family relationships to rule out the absence of freedom in donor's choice.The Role of Health Care Ethics Committees: there exists a normative in our country that regulates living donation and establishes that the hospital ethics committees should participate in the process of living donation in all cases. Their job is to assess the process and develop a report on the donor free consent to donation. The responsible person of the living transplant program should provide the documentation necessary to the committee. An interview with the potential donor can be required in some cases.

The reasons why living donor kidney transplantation is emerging in our country are diverse and can be focused in four main areas. 1) Better outcomes obtained when using living donors for kidney transplantation than those obtained with kidneys from deceased donors. Younger recipients with better HLA matching, the good health of the donor, the absence of any damages that occur in the kidney secondary to brain death, the small ischemic time and the possibility of preemptive transplantation can explain the best graft and patient survival. 2) The scarcity of sources: the relaxation of entry criteria on the waiting list implies an increasing challenge of the demand for transplant without the contribution of living donor kidney transplantation, especially in young recipients where the chances of obtaining an age-appropriate deceased donor are lower, due to the change in the profile of the deceased donor (increasingly older). 3) Improvement in the safety of the donor: the excellent evaluation and monitoring of donors (based on international standards) plus the use of less invasive surgical techniques are related to a low complication rate and to survival expectancies of living donors being similar to those of the general population. 4) Barriers overcome: The training effort by the transplant teams, hospital and regional coordinations, and the National Transplant Organization is giving excellent results, visible in the gradual increase in the number of hospitals with a program of living donor kidney transplantation and its activity. In addition, desensitization programs and the national cross-over kidney transplantation program have removed barriers to transplantation in cases of ABO incompatibility or positive crossmatch.","1585":"","1586":"","1587":"","1588":"","1589":"","1590":"","1591":"","1592":"","1593":"","1594":"","1595":"","1596":"","1597":"","1598":"","1599":"","1600":null,"1601":null,"1602":null,"1603":"The work climate (WC) affects the performance of service providers and has an impact on the care provided to users.

This is a retrospective observational study of 106 patients with ESKD followed up in the Ramon y Cajal Hospital. They were classified in two groups. Group one was made up of 50 failed native kidney patients who started dialysis between 2000 and 2009. Group two was comprised of 56 transplant patients with graft dysfunction who returned to dialysis between 1997 and 2009. We studied parameters of kidney function, anaemia, calcium-phosphorus metabolism, cardiovascular risk factors and nutritional status at the time both groups started on dialysis and one year later. Both groups had a similar clinical status at the time they started on dialysis in most of the parameters analysed with the exception of anaemia. This was more severe in transplant patients, despite the fact that transplant patients received a higher dose of erythropoietin than non-transplant patients. One year later the main difference between both groups was the residual kidney function rate, higher in non-transplant patients. There were no significant differences in the parameters analysed in patients with a failed graft according to the modality of kidney replacement therapy. Failed transplant patients start dialysis with more severe anaemia than patients entering dialysis for the first time. Twelve months later both groups present a similar clinical condition with the exception of residual kidney function, higher in failed native kidney patients. The method of dialysis treatment after kidney transplant failure did not have a bearing on the clinical improvement of our patients.

Its estimated prevalence is 1 per 800 individuals. ADPKD patients constitute 8% of the population on dialysis or kidney transplantation. The disease can be diagnosed using radiological or genetic procedures. Direct genetic diagnosis of the disease can now be performed in Spain; however, it is not an easy or cheap test. This is why every case should be considered individually to determine whether genetic testing is appropriate, and to determine which genetic test is most adequate. Genetic testing in ADPKD is of special interest for living donors and neonatal and sporadic cases. Genetic testing offers the chance of performing prenatal or pre-implantation testing of embryos in families with severe cases of the disease. Also, this will enable the disease to be treated, when specific treatment becomes available, in cases that would not be candidates for treatment without genetic confirmation.","1610":"Calcineurin inhibitor drugs (CNI) are the mainstay of modern immunosuppression in renal transplantation. However, they contribute significantly to the chronic loss of renal grafts and the high morbidity and mortality in this population due to their deleterious effects on the renal graft, cardiovascular profile and tumour pathology. Anti-mTOR drugs, sirolimus (SRL) and everolimus (EVE) are potent immunosuppressants with antiproliferative and anti-migratory capacities. These properties mean that they have a potential protective role in graft dysfunction, in renal function optimisation and the appearance of malignant tumours. Indeed, clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that conversion from CNI to anti-mTOR-based maintenance therapy has beneficial effects on transplant outcomes in terms of renal function, without significant increase in acute rejection rates. This review article examines the evidence of the use of anti-mTOR in the following clinical situations following renal transplantation: 1) prevention of immune dysfunction and renal function preservation in de novo renal transplantation and after early or late CNI withdrawal; 2) chronic dysfunction of the renal graft; 3) cardiovascular effects; 4) de novo post-transplant diabetes, and 5) de novo tumour pathology.","1611":"","1612":"New directions in dialysis research include cheaper treatments, home based therapies and simpler methods of blood purification. These objectives may be probably obtained with innovations in the field of artificial kidney through the utilization of new disciplines such as miniaturization, microfluidics, nanotechnology. This research may lead to a new era of dialysis in which the new challenges are transportability, wearability and why not the possibility to develop implantable devices. Although we are not there yet, a new series of papers have recently been published disclosing interesting and promising results on the application of wearable ultrafiltration systems (WUF) and wearable artificial kidneys (WAK). Some of them use extracorporeal blood cleansing as a method of blood purification while others use peritoneal dialysis as a treatment modality (ViWAK and AWAK.) A special mention deserves the wearable\/portable ultrafiltration system for the therapy of overhydration and congestive heart failure (WAKMAN). This system will allow dehospitalization and treatment of patients with less comorbidity and improved tolerance. On the way to the wearable artificial kidney, new discoveries have been made such as a complete system for hemofiltration in newborns (CARPEDIEM). The neonate in fact is the typical patient who may benefit from miniaturization of the dialysis circuit. This review analyzes the rationale for such endeavour and the challenges to overcome in order to make possible a true ambulatory dialysis treatment. Some initial results with these new devices are presented. We would like to stimulate a collaborative effort to make a quantum leap in technology making the wearable artificial kidney a reality rather than a dream.&amp;nbsp;","1613":"","1614":"","1615":"","1616":"","1617":"","1618":"","1619":"","1620":"","1621":"","1622":"","1623":"","1624":"","1625":"","1626":"Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is a chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with essential hypertension.

The aim of this study is to investigate whether a polymorphism of MYH9 in Caucasians is linked to essential hypertension and nephrosclerosis. The secondary objective is to identify the clinical risk factors of progression to end-stage CKD. This is a retrospective study that will compare patients with nephrosclerosis and essential hypertensives without renal disease, and also patients with nephrosclerosis and impaired renal function with those that are stable. Between October 2009 and October 2010, 500 patients with stages 3-5 CKD attributed to nephrosclerosis according to usual clinical criteria, and 300 essential hypertensives (eGFR&gt;60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; microalbuminuria &lt;300 mg\/g) are to be recruited.

We reviewed in the scientific programs of the AENP's meetings of the past 20 years: number of presentations, number of participating institutions, institutions that provided the majority of the presentations, presentation format, number of studies involving experimental nephrology, topics most commonly presented. There have been 1,119 presentations in the past 20 years, 45\/year between 88-92 and 67\/year between 03-07. Ninety-one institutions participated in the meetings, 17\/year between 88-92 and 34\/year between 03-07. Pediatric Nephrology unit from the H. La Paz (Madrid) contributed the most presentations. Poster presentations were accepted at the ANEP meetings after 1995. Since then, 369 of the 815 presentations followed this format. Between 88-07 only 16 presentations dealt with experimental nephrology. The most common topics of presentation were glomerular disease (203) and urinary tract infection\/VUR (132). Fifty-one presentations dealt with dialysis (almost 2\/3 peritoneal). Transplantation was the topic of 123 presentations. Of the 21 presentations on molecular genetics only one happened before 1998. The poster is a useful alternative in scientific presentations which has allowed an increase in presentations, authors and institutions participating in the ANEP meetings. The main topic of presentation was glomerular disease. The frequency of presentations dealing with transplantation has increased in the last years. The past decade has seen more presentations on molecular genetics, but presentations dealing with experimental nephrology are still infrequent. ","1629":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) represents a heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by a proliferation of lymphocytes occurring after solid organ transplantation. Most cases of PTLD are B-cell and their development has been closely associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), whose proliferation is encouraged by the inhibition of the cytotoxic function of T lymphocytes due to immunosuppressive drug treatment for transplant recipients. Several risk factors have been described for the development of this disorder, such as the seronegative state of the EBV receptor, the degree of overall net immunosuppression, especially with the use of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, acute rejection and cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease. We studied the incidence of PTLD and its relationship with EBV as well as its evolution and possible risk factors in 1176 adult recipients of cadaveric renal transplantation performed in our hospital between 1988 and 2009, with a follow-up of 1-255 months. The presence of EBV in the lymphoproliferative tissue was determined using in situ hybridisation. We analysed the incidence of PTLD over two time periods, 1988-1998 and 1999-2009 with 472 and 704 patients respectively. A total of 28 recipients (2.38%), 22 men and 6 women with a mean age of 46.5 (15.36) years (18-70 years) with a mean post-transplant evolution of 72.9 (56.3) months (1-180 months), developed PTLD. Thirteen (46.4%) did not show any of the classic risk factors described. The presence of EBV in lymphoproliferative tissue was detected in 18 out of 26 patients studied (69.2%). In terms of histology, 25 out of 28 were type B (89.2%). Ten out of 28 patients diagnosed (35.7%) received treatment with rituximab, six died during the follow-up, five as a direct result of their illness. The incidence for the two time periods was very similar for both groups, with 0.003922 cases\/year-patient in the 1988-1998 period and 0.003995 cases\/year-patient in the 1999-2009 period. Overall post-transplant survival for patients with PTLD was 73.6% at 5 years and 36.9% at 10 years, versus 87.8% and 75.9% for disease-free recipients (P&lt;.0001). We calculated a graft survival of 62.6% at 5 years and 27.3% at 10 years versus 72.4% and 53.9% for grafts in disease-free recipients (P&lt;.0001). In our study, patient survival one year after presenting the disease was 30.9% and 23.2% at year two. For the graft, survival was 15.5% and 7.7%, respectively. We conclude that PTLD is a disorder that is generally type B; it is significantly associated with EBV. Its incidence has not changed over time and half of all PTLD cases had no identifiable risk factors, which led to a poor prognosis despite the development of new treatments.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of megestrol acetate, an appetite stimulant used in cancer patients, as a treatment for anorexia in dialysis patients. In 2009, 16 patients in our haemodialysis unit, three with diabetes mellitus, were treated with megestrol (160 mg\/day single dose) for anorexia defined according to a Likert scale of appetite. The schedule and dialysis dose were not changed during the study. In the third month of treatment there was, in the overall group, an increase in dry weight (60.8 vs 58.9 kg, P&lt;.01), in albumin concentration (4.02 vs 3.8 g\/dl, P&lt;.05), in creatinine concentration (9.73 vs 8.26 mg\/dl, P&lt;.01), and protein catabolic rate (1.24 vs. 0.97 g\/kg\/day, P&lt;.0001). Non-significant variations in the concentration of haemoglobin, erythropoietin dose, and lipid concentrations were found. One patient with diabetes mellitus had to increase the dose of insulin and two other patients suffered mild hyperglycaemia. Megestrol acetate did not suppress the secretion of pituitary sex hormones, but in 3 of 10 patients studied was found inhibition of ACTH secretion. The response was not homogeneous: one patient did not respond and reduced his dry weight, in 5 the weight gain was minimal (less than 1 kg) and in the remaining ten the response was good, with an increase in dry weight ranging between 1.5 and 5.5 kg. Megestrol acetate can improve appetite and nutritional parameters in patients treated with periodic haemodialysis who report anorexia. Megestrol acetate may induce hyperglycaemia and inhibit the secretion of ACTH in some patients. These side effects should be assessed when administering this treatment.

Moreover it decreases the release of endothelin-1 (ET-1), as well as mononuclear cell binding. Seventeen patients with proliferative glomerulopathies (PG) and 15 patients with non-proliferative glomerulopathies (NPG) were examined by percutaneous renal biopsy. As a control 11 biopsy specimens of the kidneys removed because of trauma were used. The immunoexpression of ghrelin and ET-1 was assessed semiquantitatively whereas the interstitial monocytes\/macrophages and interstitial area were evaluated quantitatively. The mean value of the immunoexpression of ghrelin was significantly diminished in PG patients as compared to both NPG group and controls while the mean values of ET-1, interstitial CD68+ cells, as well as interstitial area were in PG group increased in comparison with controls and NPG patients, most of them significantly. In all groups there were significant negative correlations between immunostaining of ghrelin and ET-1, whereas negative correlation between immunostaining of ghrelin and CD68+ cells was significant only in PG group. We can confirm the presence of ghrelin in tubular epithelial cells in normal and diseased human kidneys. Lack or low level of this protein in proliferative glomerulopathies may be, in part, responsible for interstitial accumulation of monocytes\/macrophages in these cases.

During fasting, 55% of the glucose comes from gluconeogenesis. Only 2 organs have this capability: the liver and kidney. The latter is responsible for 20% of total glucose production and 40% of that produced by gluconeogenesis. Today we have a better understanding of the physiology of renal glucose transport via specific transporters, such as type 2 sodium-glucose cotransporter&amp;nbsp; (SGLT2). A natural compound, phlorizin, was isolated in early 1800 and for decades played an important role in diabetes and renal physiology research.

This is all the more true at times of economic uncertainty, such as the current conditions, which have a direct impact on health services. Professionals need new Competencies for new times. Over the last decade initiatives have emerged in various Anglo-Saxon countries which have defined a framework of basic Competencies that all medical specialists should demonstrate in their professional practice. In addition to this, we must respond to the creation of the European Higher Education Area which has implications for specialised training. In Spain, training for medical specialists was in need of an overhaul and the recently passed law (Real Decreto 183\/2008) will allow us to move forward and implement, in medical education, initiatives and innovations required in our medical centres, to respond to the new society and bring us in line with international professional education and practice. The way forward is a Competency-based model for medical education with assessment of these Competencies using simple instruments, validated and accepted by all the stakeholders. The institutions involved (hospitals, medical centres and other health care services) should trial different approaches within the general framework established by the current legislation and be conscious of the duty they have to society as accredited training organisations. Accordingly, they should consolidate their teaching and learning structures and the various different educational roles (Director of Studies, Tutors, and other teaching positions), showing the leadership necessary to allow proper implementation of their training programmes. For this, the Spanish Autonomous Regions must develop their own legislation regulating Medical Specialty Training. So, medical professionals should receive training, based on ethical values, behaviours and attitudes that considers humanistic, scientific and technical factors, developing an understanding of the scientific method; ability to put it into practice; skills to manage complexity and uncertainty; a command of scientific, technical and IT terminology to facilitate independent learning; and a capacity for initiative and teamwork, as well as skills for dealing with people and for making an effective, democratic contribution both within health organisations and in the wider society.","1639":"","1640":"","1641":"","1642":"","1643":"","1644":"","1645":"","1646":"","1647":"Enlargement of renal size plays an important role in the development of hypertension in patients with autosomic dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and normal renal function.

The evidence currently available suggests the existence of at least two possible mechanisms of IgA deposition in the renal mesangium. In a small percentage of patients, mesangial deposition of IgA1 colocalizes with secretory component, indicating that the deposited IgA1 in glomeruli originates completely or partly in the mucose-associated lymphoid tissue. This deposition pattern has been associated with activation of complement by the lectin pathway and has been associated with a worse prognosis, although this last statement needs to be confirmed in long-term studies. The mechanisms responsible for secretory IgA deposition are not known. In the majority of patients with IgA nephropathy secretory component is not detectable in the mesangium. In these cases, the presence of elevated circulating levels of galactose-deficient IgA, produced by bone marrow plasma cells would be a predisposing factor but not sufficient to induce nephropathy. To produce kidney disease, galactose-deficient IgA1 must be deposited in the renal mesangium, and once there, either by interaction with specific receptors (CD71?), by direct activation of complement or by being the target of an IgG autoimmune response anti-IgA, induce activation, proliferation and increased mesangial matrix synthesis and eventually cell injury. In parallel, galactose-deficient IgA, through interaction with the RR Fc alpha\/gamma, may activate circulating lymphocytes and monocytes and enhance their response to chemoattractants produced by the mesangial cell, causing, thus, the inflammatory infiltrate to initiate and maintain the interstitial injury. In the next few years, advances recently added to the knowledge of the pathogenesis of nephropathy IgA1 could provide new variables that allow walking in the direction of having a classification of patients based not only in clinical and morphological criteria but also having a greater pathogenic basis.","1653":"","1654":"","1655":"","1656":"","1657":"","1658":"","1659":"","1660":"","1661":"","1662":"","1663":"","1664":"","1665":"","1666":null,"1667":"We report four patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing haemodialysis therapy, which had exhausted conventional venous access (internal jugular, subclavian) and non-conventional access (axillary, innominate) in the upper hemithorax for haemodialysis.

Low 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels were significantly related with age, diabetes, female gender, obesity, MDRD glomerular filtration rate and previous cardiovascular disease. Pulse pressure was the Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring parameter that was better correlated with 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels. We could not find any association between vitamin D levels and other bone and mineral metabolism parameters. No relationship was seen between low vitamin D levels and left ventricular hypertrophy. On multivariate analysis lower levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D were independently associated with female gender, previous cardiovascular disease, MDRD4-GFR and higher pulse pressure. Our study confirm a high prevalence of 25 hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in advanced chronic kidney disease patients, this was associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk markers and previous established cardiovascular disease. However we could not see any relationship with left ventricular hypertrophy which is a known predictor of future cardiovascular events in this population. ","1672":"Cardiovascular disease and other complications of atherosclerosis are the most common cause of death in patients with chronic renal failure in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Carotid ultrasonography is a simple non-invasive tool to investigate the vascular system, by means of intima media thickness (IMT) measurement and carotid wall calcifications. To determine IMT and the presence of plaques, and their possible clinical relationships; finally we tried to investigate whether they would predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients in MHD. We studied 60 MHD patients (age 68 +\/- 13 years, 48% male, 50% diabetics, time on MHD 32 +\/- 11 months) and a control group of 274 people matched for age and sex. Follow-up period was 66 +\/- 13 months. Demographic and clinical data, serum levels of homocysteine (tHcy), folic acid (FA) and B6 and B12 vitamins. IMT was measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. IMT was higher in MHD patients than in those in the control group (0.947 +\/- 0.308 vs 0.619 +\/- 0.176 mm; P &lt; 0.001). IMT was related with age (r = 0.268; P = 0.038), diabetic (r = 0.650; P &lt; 0.001) and hypertensive condition (r = 0.333; P = 0.012), but not wih lipids, tHcy or FA. Patients who suffered from coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease or stroke had higher IMT than those without those events (1.156 +\/- 0.371 vs 0.875 +\/- 0.285 mm; P &lt; 0.001; 1.205 +\/- 0.374 vs 0.911 +\/- 0.231 mm; P = 0.007; 1.195 +\/- 0.264 vs 0.844 +\/- 0.251; P &lt; 0.001 respectively). Something similar occurred with the presence of plaques. During the follow-up period 36 patients died (60%), 67% of them due to cardiovascular causes. IMT was higher in patients who died than those who survived (1.020 +\/- 0.264 vs 0.858 +\/- 0.334 mm; P = 0.044). The survival rate during the observation period was significantly lower in the final IMT fourth (20%) than in the first (72%) (P = 0.014). The presence of carotid plaques was an independent predictor of cardiovascular mortality. These findings suggests that measurement of carotid IMT and the presence of wall plaques are useful tools to predict cardiovascular events and mortality in patients in MHD. ","1673":"The aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of high activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on renal lesions observed in autopsies of HIV patients. Clinical records and renal pathologic samples from 100 HIV patients, who had died between 1984 and 2006, were reviewed, 61 before 1997 (group I) and 39 after. 24 of them had not received HAART (group II) and 15 had (group III). Premortem clinical and analytical data were obtained. Renal samples were stained with hematoxilin-eosin, PAS, Masson trichrome and silver-methenamine. The final pathologic diagnosis was recorded along with the findings at glomerular, tubular and interstitial levels. HIVAN was defined as the presence of focal or segmental glomerulosclerosis with glomerular collapse and microcystic tubulo -interstitial lesions. The main causes of death were infections 68%, tumours 14%, and others 18%, especially liver diseases. Renal failure was present in 42% at the time of death. A predominance of tubular lesions exists in the three study groups, followed by interstitial lesions and glomerular lesions. The main diagnoses were acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and septic nephritis. Four cases of HIVAN were found. When the subjects who received HAART treatment were compared with those who did not, a significantly higher percentage of interstitial lesions in the group with HAART was observed. There were also more cases of acute tubular necrosis but these differences were not statistically significant. Renal lesions were frequent in HIV patients independent of the presence or absence of HAART. ","1674":"To compare the dynamics of calcium-regulated PTH secretion in vitro from adenomatous versus hyperplastic glands and to investigate the relationship between the parathyroid cell cycle and the calcium-regulated PTH secretion in these glands. A total of 31 parathyroid glands (8 adenomatous and 23 hyperplastic) from 8 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and 7 with secondary hyperparathyroidism respectively were studied. For the evaluation of calcium-regulated PTH secretion, small parathyroid pieces of 1 mm were sequentially transferred to wells with varying Ca concentrations: 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.25 and 1.35 or 1.5 mM. PTH concentrations were determined in the medium. For the parathyroid cell cycle studies, parathyroid cells were isolated without the use of enzymes and cell cycle was analyzed using the method described by Vindelov. The nuclei were acquired by flow cytometer and analyzed using the CELLFIT software. In parathyroid tissues from hyperplastic glands, the increase in extracellular calcium produced a decrease in PTH secretion which was apparent with a calcium level as low as 0.8 mM and the maximal inhibition of PTH secretion was obtained with a calcium of 1.25 mM, by the contrary, adenomatous glands required a calcium of 1.2 mM to produce a minimal decrease in PTH secretion. In hyperplastic parathyroid glands but not in parathyroid adenomas there was a significant correlation between the percentage of cells in G0\/G1 phase with the set point (r = 0.914; P &lt; 0.005) and the basal serum Ca (r = 0.862; P &lt; 0.02). The control of the extracellular calcium-PTH release in vitro is less sensitive in parathyroid adenomas than hyperplasic parathyroid glands. In parathyroid hyperplasia the cell proliferation may be regulated by the extracellular calcium concentration (higher calcemia less proliferation). ","1675":"Hemodialysis (HD) cost analysis provides information about the economic impact of the disease on the community. Its knowledge is crucial to adequate and optimize health resources. Our aim was to study sanitary and non-sanitary direct costs of HD, based on patients individual data. Furthermore, the effect of sociocultural factors and comorbidity on costs was evaluated. Retrospective and observational study of prevalence costs produced during one year of HD therapy. All patients from North Health District of Tenerife province (Canary Islands, Spain) included for at least 3 months on HD were considered for the study. Sociodemographic parameters and comorbidity data were collected from a generic individual survey and reviewing database records. Direct sanitary and non-sanitary costs were organized in 6 categories: HD sessions, medication costs, hospitalization costs (evaluated by Diagnosis-Related Groups classification system), outpatient care (including consultation and complementary studies); healthcare material and patient transportation. Finally, 161 patients were included (63 +\/- 16 years, 63% males, 38% diabetics). Of note, the proportions of sociocultural deprivation was high among this population (75-85% did not complete first school and had non-qualified jobs). Mean cost of global therapy was 43,070 +\/- 13,932 euro. Proportional allocation of costs was as follow: HD sesion 51%, pharmacy 27%, hospitalization 17%, transportation 3% and ambulatory care 2%. There was no association between sociocultural profile, comorbidity and therapy cost. This is the first study of HD costs, itemized by components of expenses, based in individual data and introducing GRD model for hospitalization cost. The highest expenses corresponded to HD sessions and medication (79%), both very homogeneous to this patient population. The saving in economic terms should be, fundamentally, the prevention of CKD. ","1676":"Hypertension (HT) is recognized as one of the major risk factors for vascular damage. Although current guidelines recommend an aggressive drug treatment with blood pressure control goals ever lower, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension is still apparently high. It is often forgotten that BP is a very labile hemodynamic parameter, which requires a correct methodology measurement that meets only rarely, leading to a misdiagnosis and wrong hypertensive monitoring. Even being an arbitrary limit the definition of HT has been set at 140\/90 mmHg, based on casual BP taken in the office. This register itself can provide useful information beyond systolic and diastolic values, and with a certain hemodynamic meaning (pulse pressure and mean blood pressure). For a proper diagnosis of hypertensive patients is essential to enhance measure BP in any area with an strict methodology, and to incorporate into clinical practice new techniques such as 24 hours MAPA and AMPA at home, which still require definition of specific reference objectives. The application of these techniques has led to the emergence of several subgroups of hypertensive patients, such as white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension, which have their peculiarities in relation to the therapeutic management and prognosis. These techniques, together with the publication of new clinical trials using criteria of evidence, have led to the review of the Guidelines for the management of hypertension by modifying the limits of BP for some special clinical situations, and changing the paradigm of the lowest BP is the best, by that of: as early and more associated vascular risk factors were controlled it's better.","1677":"Cell replenishment is critical for adult tissue repair after damage. In some organs this process is facilitated by stem cells. In contrast to the liver, the kidney has limited regeneration capacity and has even been considered over several years as not being able to regenerate itself. Nevertheless, there are several recent studies suggesting the presence of stem cells in the adult kidney. Stem cell renal niches have been identified in the renal papillae in animals as well as in the urinary pole of the Bowman's capsule in humans (CD24+CD133+ stem cells). Although these cells may contribute to organ regeneration, how these cells exert this effect and their role after kidney injury is not known. Nevertheless, renal stem cells may be therapeutic targets for treatment of renal diseases. On the other hand, bone-marrow-derived stem cells may also contribute to renal repair, particularly mesenchymal stem cells. However, the mechanism for producing such effect has not been elucidated. Some studies suggest there is cell fusion between bone marrow and resident tubular cells; others suggest that bone marrow cells are able to differentiate in resident cells, while some authors propose bone marrow cells facilitate organ regeneration by a paracrine action; that is by secreting growth factors such as HGF, VEGF and IGF1. All these secreted molecules would provide a regenerative milieu able to constrain renal damage and to amplify stem cells migration to the damaged organ.","1678":"","1679":null,"1680":"In Venezuela has been described a new form of nephronophthisis, called adolescent nephronophthisis, with clinical and histological findings very similar to others varieties described. However, pathogenesis in not well known. The aim of this study was to determine the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in tubular epithelial cells of patients with adolescent nephronophthisis. Renal biopsies of 8 patients with adolescent nephronophthisis were studied by immunohistochemistry to determine renal expression of EGFR. In all patients, there was no expression of epidermal growth factor receptor. These findings indicate a deficiency of growth factor receptor in undifferentiated epithelial cells, which could be one factor in the development of cysts in nephronophthisis.

Strategies that aim to prevent catheter-related bacteremia (CRB), ranging from the application of topical antibiotics to the use of different catheter-lock solutions, have been studied, but limited interest has been shown about following standardization of aseptic care and maintenance of CVC by experienced staff. This study reports CRB incidence obtained with a strict infection prophylaxis protocol based on universal precautions against infection adopted in our Unit by qualified nursing hemodialysis staff. During a period of 20 months, 32 patients received 42 CVC. There were 2 CRB, with an incidence of 0.24 CRB\/1000 days-catheter. This study shows that an optimal catheter-use management reduces the incidence of CRB to excellent rates.

Our technique bases on placing Oreopoulos-Zellerman catheter along a straight Guyon s guide with atraumatic tip, visually guaranting optimal placement. Catheter can be repositioned if desired by reentering the guide. Median follow-up was 25 months. Mean operating time was 32 minutes (range 15-55 minutes). One patient suffered an immediate postoperative catheter obstruction that required surgical repositioning. No other technical intra or early postoperative complications related to technique were reported. Mean time to discharge 1.02 +\/- 2.2 days. Catheter outflow failure rate was 7.6%. Conversion to haemodialysis due to peritonitis 13%. Peritonitis per patient\/year was 0.27. Catheter 6 mo, 1 year and 2 year survival rate was 94%, 87% and 72%. Catheter migration rate was 4%.

","1700":"Post-dilution on-line hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) is the most efficient infusion mode to obtain maximum clearances of uremic toxins, with a recommended manual infusion flow (Qi) of 25% of the blood flow with the main limitation that causes alarms by hemoconcentration throughout the session. Recent technical advances allow automatic prescription of Qi if hematocrit and total protein (TP) values are specified. As these analytical results are not possible to obtain in each dialysis session, a practical way to prescribe Qi is to make an automatic prescription adjusting the hematocrit and total protein values at the beginning of the session to obtain the manual prescription required and we will call it automatic-manual prescription. The aim of this study was to compare manual Qi with automatic-manual Qi in postdilution OL-HDF. 30 patients (16 men and 14 women), 59.9 +\/- 15 years old, in hemodialysis program for 50.1 +\/- 67 months were included. Every patient underwent four OL-HDF sessions, two with manual Qi (4008-S and 5008 monitors) and two with automatic-manual Qi (A-M), one with the same Qi and one with manual Qi +20 (A-M+20). The same usual dialysis parameters were maintained: helixone dialyzer, dialysis time of 266 +\/- 39 minutes, blood flow of 420 +\/- 36. Recirculation, Kt and intradialysis alarms were measured at each session. No significant differences in the fistula recirculation or dialysis dose measured using Kt. Total infusion volume was 24.9 +\/- 4 (4008 S), 23.4 +\/- 4 L (5008) with manual Qi, 23.6 +\/- 4 L (A-M) Qi (NS) and 25.8 +\/- 5 L (A-M+20). Only 14% of patients had no incidents. The number of alarms was significantly higher with manual prescription 55 alarms with 4008 and 40 with 5008 vs. AM (11) p &lt; 0.01) and A-M+20 (16 alarms) We concluded that automatic-manual Qi is a practical way for post-dilutional OL-HDF prescription where the same efficiency and total reinfusion volume with an important reduction of intradialysis alarms are obtained, allowing to rise Qi by 20% without increasing intradialysis alarms.","1701":"To evaluate the prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its association with cardiovascular risk factors, as well as their control in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients under maintenance hemodialysis (HD). A total of 265 patients with ESRD on maintenance HD from a University Hospital and 4 dialysis units were included in this multicenter and cross-sectional study that analyzed the prevalence of CVD and the possible association with classic and new cardiovascular risk factors. Usual biochemical and haemathological parameters were analyzed, as well as plasma levels of homocysteine, troponin-I, BNP, lipoprotein(a), C reactive protein, IL-6, fibrinogen, asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), malondialdehyde, adiponectin, osteoprotegerin, and fetuin. In a subset of patients an echocardiography and carotid artery Doppler echography were also performed. The prevalence of CVD was 52.8%. Factors positively associated with prevalent CVD were age, BMI, left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus, dialysis vintage, Charlson s comorbility index, levels of fibrinogen, osteoprotegerin, BNP and CRP, as well as carotid intima-media thickness, left ventricular mass and pulse pressure. Factors negatively associated with prevalent CVD were: previous renal transplant, ejection fraction or levels of LDL-c and phosphorous. In the multivariate analysis dyslipidemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, age and LDL-c (negatively) were associated with CVD. In HD patients the prevalence of CVD is high and is associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors and subclinical CVD.

Hepler, in 1930, suggested that they may be caused by a tubular obstruction. We prospectively studied the presence of hypercalciuria or hypocitraturia as well as the family history of urolithiasis in a group of children diagnosed sonographically with simple renal cysts. The average age of the 22 patients (12M, 10F) was 6.04 +\/- 2.9 years at the time of diagnosis. The ultrasound examination had been requested due to urinary tract infection, abdominal pain, haematuria or other disorders. The cysts were slightly more frequent on the left side (54.5%). All were located in the upper kidney pole. 14 patients were found to have hypercalciuria and\/or hypocitraturia (hypercalciuria n = 11, 50%). Thirteen families had history of renal stones. The metabolic abnormalities associated with calculi in children and\/or family history of stones were present in 19 families (86.3%). Our hypothesis is that both entities, renal cysts, and genetic predisposition to kidney stones, are related.","1703":"The haemodialysis dose is a good marker of dialysis adequacy, and we usually monitor it with Kt\/V measure. The dialysis dose monitored with Kt allows a better discrimination, detecting a percentage of the patients that perhaps do not get an adequate dose for their gender or body surface area after treatment with a minimum recommended dose of Kt\/V. The objective of this study was to evaluate Kt as a clinical indicator referred to dialysis adequacy in the haemodialysis population. The aim was that more than 85% of the patients would achieve the recommended Kt target for their gender (at least 50 litres in men and 45 litres in women), or their body surface area. In each of the patients (mean 129) the Kt mean value was determined for three consecutive dialysis sessions, one every two months, during the follow-up period (14 months). At the beginning, the Kt\/V value was on target (&gt; 1.3) in 93.2% of the patients, but only in 58% according to Kt measure for their gender. After 4 months, we observed that 85% of patients' Kt target increased for their gender, but only 68% did if we used the Kt individualised for their body surface area. From month 6 to the end of the follow-up period, more than 85% of patients obtained an adequate Kt for their body surface area (p &lt; 0.001). A significant increase of Kt mean (5.4 litres) was observed at the end of the study (p &lt; 0.001). The usual dialysis prescription parameters were modified increasing blood flow rate (34.14 ml\/min, p &lt; 0.001), session effective duration (8.04 minutes, p &lt; 0.001), dialyser surface area (24.1% of patients changed from helixone 1.3 to 1.6 m2, p &lt; 0.001) and haemodialysis modality (56.8% of patients changed from conventional haemodialysis to on-line haemodiafiltration, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that monitoring dialysis dose with Kt is a good clinical measure of adequacy, and using it as a quality indicator can be done in line with the more demanding quality standards.","1704":"Chronic kidney disease is associated with a wide range of stressful situations causing important physical and psychological repercussions. It is not usual that psychology professionals are active members of the nephrology teams. In consequence, these alterations are not properly assisted. Our aim is to present the introduction process of a psychologist in a nephrology department and its preliminary results. We designed a clearly defined introduction process, starting with a therapeutic communication training program for all the staff. In the model we have priorized pre-emptive interventions in order to promote the adaptation process, far from simple psychological symptom control. It is assumed the binomial patient-family as the major objective for care, choosing an interdisciplinary approach. We worked more from a health psychology perspective than from a mental health perspective. Over the year 2008 the number of patients assisted by the psychologist were 571 (mean 48 patients\/month). The total number of interventions was 1,022. Majority of cases (45.2%) were derived from the advanced chronic kidney disease program, mostly related to demands about emotional impact of renal replacement therapy commencement. Others were: suspect of depression episode, adherence, primary caregiver emotional overwhelming, bereavement, anxiety and support in decision making process. This experience is a stimulus for the integral approach of the renal patient.","1705":"Bisphosphonates are synthetic compounds similar to organic pyrophosphates. The bioavailability of intravenous preparations is 100%, whereas the availability of oral therapy ranges from 1 to 5%. About 50% to 80% of free bisphosphonates are incorporated into bone. Because of their urinary elimination, bisphosphonates must be carefully administered in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. In spite of this, bisphosphonates can safely be used in all CKD stages, including dialysis and kidney transplant. The renal toxicity seems different among these compounds, and it is due basically to their protein binding and the average lifespan in renal tissues. In practice, renal toxicity have been associate to the infusion velocity and excessive dosage In patients with CKD, it is very relevant to maintain the time of infusion and in haemodialysis patients we recommend the administration during the haemodialysis session. When bisphosphonates are given to 4-5 CKD patients it seems reasonable to reduce the dose to 50%. No renal pathology has been associated to oral administration. The indications of bisphosphonates in CKD include: hypercalcemia episodes, prevention of bone loss after renal transplantation, treatment of low bone mineral density in all CKD stage including transplantation. They are too a promising therapy of calciphylaxis and to prevent vascular calcifications. When suppressed bone turnover is suspected, bone biopsy is mandatory before bisphosphonates therapy.","1706":"","1707":"","1708":"","1709":"Cholesterol embolism is a disease caused by distal showering of cholesterol crystal released from disintegration of arterial atheromatous plaques. It may occur spontaneously or more often after invasive vascular procedures or thrombolytic\/anticoagulant agents. Forty five cases were diagnosed between 1989 and 2005 in three Spanish hospitals. The diagnosis was confirmed by histology or diagnostic ophthalmoscopic findings. The majority were male (93.3%), elder (55.5% were older than 70 years), smoker (91.1%), had hypertension (95.6%), with high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. At the time of diagnosis all patients presented acute renal failure. Mean serum creatinine at diagnosis was 4.3+\/- 2.4 mg\/dl. The acute renal failure was accompanied with eosinophilia (64.4%) and cutanous lesions (57.7%). 20% of cases occur spontaneously and 46.7% after endovascular manipulation (coronary angiography\/arteriography) and only 8% after changes in anticoagulant treatment. After a follow-up of 12 +\/- 16.3 months the 55.6% of patients need chronic dialysis, 64.4% died, 8 of them after the beginning of dialysis. Nine patients recovered renal function, with a mean creatinine of 3 +\/- 1.7 mg\/dl at the end of follow-up. The cardiovascular comorbididy and the clinical severity of the embolism don t have impact in the renal or patient survival. Renal survival (Kaplan-Mier) were better in spontaneous than in iatrogenic cholesterol embolism. Fifteen of 45 patients were treated with steroids. In treated patients we observed a high incidence of death (73.3% versus 60%) and fewer recovery of renal function (13.3% versus 23%), without statistical significance. The mean time to dialysis was shorter in treatment patients (p= 0.017). Statins treatment was not associated with outcome (renal or individual). In summary, atheroembolic renal disease represents an acute renal failure with special characteristics. Renal and individual outcome is poor, but some patients have spontaneous recovery of renal function. Renal survival was significantly better in spontaneous disease. We don t observe beneficial effect of steroid treatment.","1710":"Hypertensive nephropathy is the second most common cause for starting renal replacement therapy in Spain with a steady incidence since 1997. Data on incidence of hypertensive nephropathy previously to dialysis are scanty because there are not registries similar to those used for renal replacement therapy. Retrospectively we studied the records of our hospital Nephrology outpatients clinic from January, 1991 to December, 2007. Diagnosis was commonly made using clinical criteria in most of cases. There were 60 cases with proteinuria higher than 1 g\/day and so that renal biopsies were performed. During this time 479 (44.0 pmp) patients were diagnosed of hypertensive nephropathy (mean age 66.6 +\/- 12.1 years and 43.0% were women). Incidence increased from 33.3 pmp (1991) to 76.2 pmp (2006). There was a steady trend to increase incidence since 16.7 pmp in 1991 up to 89.5 pmp in 2007. Mean incidence was 31.8 pmp between 1991 and 1995, 32.1 pmp in the period 1996-2000; and 54.4 pmp from 2001 to 2006. The mean age of incident patients showed a J curve. 53 subjects (11.6%) have started renal replacement therapy. Survival before starting renal replacement therapy was 96.0 at first year, 85.9% at five years and 81.6% after seven years of follow-up. Incidence of hypertensive nephropathy seems to have increased last years specially in spite of therapeutic improvements the prognosis is still unfavourable.

Several methods have been used to predict glomerular filtration rate, however the results have been variable depending on the population studied. We aimed to compare the performances of 4 glomerular filtration rate tests with inulin clearance in patients with chronic renal insufficiency and in healthy subjects. Inulin clearances performed in 51 individuals with stable renal function were selected. For each of them, we computed 4 estimates: the 24-hour creatinine clearance, technetium (99mTc-DTPA) clearance, Cockcroft-Gault and Levey formulas. Their respective performance was assessed by correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient) and agreement (Bland and Altman method). Each glomerular filtration rate test closely correlated with inulin clearance. Nevertheless, all GFR tests displayed considerable lack of agreement with lower limits ranging from 15 to 42 ml \/ min, for comparison with inulin-technetium and inulin with Levey formula, respectively and upper limits of agreement that could range from 20 to 56 ml \/ min, for comparison with inulin-technetium and Inulin with Levey formula,respectively.

The aim of our study was to analyze the UF capacity and its relation with the peritoneal permeability and sieving of sodium, performing the peritoneal kinetic study with hypertonic glucose solutions. We performed 184 peritoneal kinetic studies with hypertonic glucose solutions in stable patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), with a mean time on PD of 16 +\/- 22 months. We measured the mass transfer coefficient of creatinine (CrMTC), dialysate to plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/PCr), UF capacity and sieving of sodium at 60 minutes (difNa60). The mean values were: CrMTC: 9.1 +\/- 4.5 ml\/min, D\/PCr: 0.71 +\/- 0.09, UF 759 +\/- 233 ml\/4 h and difNa60: 4.7 +\/- 2.3.

In this work, we present the results of the clinical analysis of 48 patients diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The objectives of this work were to analyze the main clinical aspects of the disease. The average age of appearance of the first symptoms was 41.17 +\/- 13.41 years in women and 49.91 +\/- 12.52 years in men (p &lt; 0.05). Arterial hypertension was the first sign of the disease (68.42%), with more cases in men than in women (p &lt; 0.05), followed by chronic renal failure (68.29 %). The most common renal symptom during the evolution of the disease was chronic renal failure, which was present in all the patients of the study, followed by proteinuria (92.31%), end-stage renal failure (89.58%) and arterial hypertension (87.23%). In summary, our results reveal a high prevalence of patients with polycystic kidney disease who received a late diagnosis. This could possibly explain the high morbi-mortality associated to this condition. Given the high prevalence of chronic renal failure and endstage renal failure secondary to polycystic kidney disease in our study, the early diagnostic of the disease would carry better prognostic in relation with a more strict clinical followup.

In vivo studies of the PTH secretion curve were obtained by induction of hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia with a continuous endovenous infusion of sodium EDTA and Ca gluconate, respectively. For the in vitro studies, small parathyroid pieces of 1 mm were sequentially transferred to wells with varying Ca concentrations: 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.25 and 1.5 mM. iPTH concentrations were determined in the medium.

Multicenter, observational, retrospective, 16-weeks study, which included stable patients undergoing dialysis who were converted from DA QW to DA Q2W in clinical practice. Conversion was done according to product specifications (duplicating QW dose). The ERI to DA was calculated by dividing the weekly DA dose per kilogram of weight (microg\/wk.kg)*200 by the Hb level (g\/dL). ERI evolution with time was evaluated by multivariate repeated measures ANOVA, adjusting for significant covariates. A total of 202 patients were included (137 patients undergoing haemodialysis [HD], intravenous (IV) DA, and 65 patients receiving peritoneal dialysis [PD], subcutaneous DA). Mean (SD) age was 66 (17) years; 61% of patients were men. Large intercentre variability was observed for the ERI at conversion time (coefficient of variation of 88%, p &lt; 0.001 for differences between centres).

Our recommendation is that SHPT patients who are initially non responders to medical therapy should be investigated using parathyroid scintigraphy and cervical ultrasound. 99mTc-MIBI uptake can be graded in a semiquantitative scale. Intense uptake indicates a low probability of success using medical treatment and parathyroidectomy should be considered. A moderate to faint uptake indicates that a more intensive medical therapy would probably be beneficial. In the case of no uptake of 99mTc-MIBI, PET should be performed.

The overall prevalence of Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative grades 3-5 CKD was 6.8%, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.4 to 8.2 (3.3% for age 40-64 years and 21.4% for age &gt; 64 years). The prevalence estimates of CKD stages were: 0.99% for stage 1 (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] &gt;or=90 ml\/min per 1.73 m2 with proteinuria); 1.3% for stage 2 (GFR 60-89); 5.4% for stage 3a (GFR 45-59); 1.1% for stage 3b (GFR 30-44); 0.27% for stage 4 (GFR 15-29); and 0.03% for stage 5 (GFR &lt; 15). An important prevalence of classical cardiovascular risk factors was observed: dyslipemia (29.3%), obesity (26.1%), hypertension (24.1%), diabetes (9.2%) and current smoking (25.5%). The independent predictor factors for CKD were age, obesity and previously diagnosed hypertension. The prevalence of CKD at any stage in general population from Spain is relatively high, especially in the elderly, and similar to countries of the same geographical area. Independently of age, two modifiable risks factors, hypertension and obesity, are associated with an increased prevalence of CKD. ","1766":"The traditional evaluation of acid-base status relies on the Henderson-Hasselbach equation. In 1983, an alternative approach, based on physical and chemical principles was proposed by P. Stewart. In this approach, plasma pH is determined by 3 independent variables: pCO2, Strong Ion Difference (SIDm), which is the difference between the strong cations (Na +, K +, Ca ++, Mg ++) and the strong anions (Cl-, lactate) and total plasma concentration of nonvolatile weak acids (ATot), mainly inorganic phosphate and albumin. Bicarbonate is considered a dependent variable. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acid-base status using both perspectives, physical chemical and traditional approach. We studied 35 patients (24 M; 11F) on hemodiafiltration, mean age was 67,2+\/-15,7, 8+\/-19,2 kg. We analyzed plasma chemistry including pH, pCO2, HCO3-, base excess and Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca++, Mg++, lactate and SIDm. The SID estimated (SIDe) was calculated by Figge's formula (1000 x 2.46E-11 x pCO2 \/ (10-pH) + Album gr\/dl x (0.123 x pH-0.631) + P in mmol\/l x (0.309 x pH-0.469) and Gap of the SID as the difference SIDm-SIDe. pH preHD was 7,36+\/-0,08 and pH posHD 7,44+\/-0,08 (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant differences between pCO2 pre and pos-HD. HCO3 - and base excess increased during the session (p &lt; 0.001). SIDm decreased from 46,2+\/-2,9 preHD to 45+\/-2,3 mEq\/l postHD (p &lt; 0.05). On the opposite, SIDe increased from 38,5+\/-3,8 to 42,9+\/-3,1 mEq\/l (p &lt; 0.001). The Gap Anion descended from 18,6+\/-3,8 preHD to 12,8+\/-2,8 mEq\/l mEq\/l postHD (p &lt; 0.001) and the Gap of the SID 7,6+\/-3 to 2,1+\/-2 (p &lt; 0.001). Anion Gap correlated with the Gap-SID so much pre-HDF as pos-HDF. Delta Base excess correlated only with Delta of the Gap SID. Stewart-Fencl's approach does not improve characterization of acid-base status in patients on chronic HDF. In presence of normocloremia the SIDm does not reflect the alkalinizing process of the session of hemodialysis. According this approach, hemodialysis therapy can be viewed as a withdrawal of inorganic anions, especially the sulphate. These anions are replaced by OH - and secondarily for HCO3-. The approach only improves the evaluation of unmeasured anions by the Gap of the SID, without the effect of albumin and phosphate.

This equation has been developed from a population of 8,254 subjects who had the GFR measured by iothalamate clearance (mean 68 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, SD 40 mL\/min\/1.73 m2). It includes variables such as serum creatinine, age, sex and race with different formula according to race, sex and creatinine value. The CKD-EPI equation improved the accuracy and precision results of the current first-choice MDRD-IDMS (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-Isotopic Dilution Mass Spectrometry) formula, specially for GFR &gt; 60 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 in a group of 3,896 subjects. The goal of our study was to compare the estimated GFR by using the new equation CKD-EPI with MDRD-IDMS in a wide cohort of 14,427 patients (5,234 women and 9,193 men), and to analyze the impact of the new CKD-EPI formula on the staging of patients with CKD. Mean estimated GFR was 0.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 higher with CKD-EPI as compared to MDRD-IDMS for the whole group, 1.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 higher for women and 0.2 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 lower for men. The percentage of CKD staging concordancy between equations varied from 79.4 % for stage 3A and 98.6% for stage 5. For those patients younger than 70 years, 18.9 % and 24 % MDRD-IDMS stages 3B and 3A were reclassified as CKD 3A and 2 by CKD-EPI, respectively. For the same stages in the group younger than 70 years, the percentage of reclassified patients increased up to 34.4% and 33.4%, respectively. The new CKD-EPI equation to estimate the GFR reclassifies an important number of patients to higher CKD stages (higher GFR), specially younger women, classified as CKD stage 3 by MDRD-IDMS.

In our population, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis causing nephrotic syndrome is the more frequent biopsy demonstrated glomerulopathy. Our aim was search for alterations in some slit diaphragm-associated proteins in patients with nephrotic range proteinuria. Renal tissue from 40 patients with nephrotic range proteinuria, 10 patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria, 3 with isolated hematuria, and 10 samples of normal renal tissue (deceased donors) were studied, by indirect immunofluorescence, for expression of nephrin, podocin, and alpha-actinin-4. Expression of these proteins was lineal, homogeneous, in the glomerular capillary walls in normal renal tissue and in patients with isolated hematuria. In nephrotic proteinuria this normal appearance was altered and immunostaining showed a fine granular appearance. In 18 cases (45%) of patients with nephrotic proteinuria and 3 cases (30%) of patients with non-nephrotic proteinuria there was loss of at least one of these proteins (p = 0.49). These alterations were found in the diverse glomerulopathies more frequently causing nephrotic syndrome.

","1787":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a multi-organic hereditary disorder. It is responsible for 7-10% of cases of end stage renal failure. It is caused by mutations in the genes PKD1 and PKD2. Both polycystic kidney disease's forms have a pathogeny and similar clinic, but in the patients with mutation in PKD2, the clinical manifestations appear later and the progression to end stage renal failure happens 10 years later than in the patients with mutation in PKD1. The diagnosis of this disease can be performed through ultrasounds, but the molecular diagnosis offers some advantages, such as the early detection of asymptomatic individuals who carry this genetic defect, in order to perform a preventive monitoring and genetic counselling. In this work, we present the results of the mutational analysis of the PKD2 gene in 18 patients diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The objectives of this work were to analyze the profitability of the genetic study compared with the radiologic study, and perform an early genetic diagnosis in the descendants of patients who were affected by a mutation in the PKD2 gene, trying to establish a correlation between phenotype and genotype. After the genetic analysis, only one family was diagnosed with a mutation in exon 13 of the PKD2 gene (5.56%), which consists on a substitution of the nucleotide adenosine by cytosine (c.2398A&gt;C), which implies that the amino acid methionine is replaced by leucine (p.800Met&gt;Leu). In our population, contrary to what was published in the literature, the mutation of the gene was clinically significant and did segregate with the disease. All the members with a clinical and ultrasound diagnosis of polycystic renal disease presented the above mentioned mutation. We could not confirm any clinical-genetic correlation. Due to the high prevalence of chronic renal failure and terminal chronic renal failure secondary to polycystic kidney disease in our study, an early genetic diagnosis would involve a better prognosis in connection with a closer clinical monitoring.","1788":"We evaluate the incidence of acute rejection, opportunistic infections and non-dermatological malignancies, graft and recipient survival between a group of high immunological risk renal transplant recipients and a group of patients without immunological risk, who received grafts from the same cadaveric donors since 2001 to 2006. This is a prospective and observational study. The risk group (n= 50) included patients with high rate of antibodies (&gt; 50%), recipients who had lost their first graft due to early rejection, cross match positive, black race or important histoincompatibility.

Both groups were similar respect to donor and recipient gender and age, HLA incompatibility, but the percentage of patients with high rate of performed antibodies and second transplant recipients was higher in the high risk group according to the criteria of the study The incidence of acute rejection histologically diagnosed was higher in the normal risk group (30% against 6 %, p=0.03). There was no difference in opportunistic infections or malignancies, although 2 recipients of the normal risk group developed lymphoproliferative disorders. The recipients survival was 97,9% at 1 and 3 years in both groups, and the graft survival was 89,8% and 84,8% in the high risk group against 93,8 % and 90,4% at 1 and 3 years in the normal group (p=NS).

During a ten-year period (1999-2008), from a total of 175 patients with chronic renal failure undergoing CAPD, we retrospectively studied 10 cases of fungal peritonitis analyzing the predisposing factors, clinical aspects, etiological agents and treatment. Diagnosis was based on elevated CAPD effluent count (&gt;100\/microl) and isolation of fungi on culture. Fungal peritonitis represented 3.6% of all peritonitis episodes. Nine patients had a history of previous bacterial peritonitis and all of them were under antibiotic therapy. Other common findings were: age higher than 70 years old (50%) and diabetes mellitus (40%). Direct microscopic examination of the peritoneal fluid was useful for the suspicion of fungal infection in six patients (60%). The responsible agents for peritonitis were: Candida parapsilosis (4), Candida albicans (2), Candida tropicales (1), Candida glabrata (1), Candida famata (1) and Fusarium oxysporum (1). Intraperitoneal and oral fluconazole, intravenous and oral voriconazole and intravenous amphotericin B were the antifungal agents used in the treatment. As a result of fungal infection, eight patients were transferred to hemodialysis. One patient died before the diagnosis and three other during the episode of peritonitis. Patients with previous bacterial peritonitis and antibiotic treatment were at greater risk of developing fungal peritonitis. Candida parapsilosis was the most common pathogen.

Nearly 40% of the EC nephrologists also go on duty at their RH. More than three quarters of the EC nephrologists are alone during their workday. Bidirectional telephone communication is very frequent between EC and RH. Around a third of the patients sent from RH to EC arrive without current viral serology and\/or without a functioning vascular access. Most of the patients sent from EC to RH bring an up-to-date complete medical report. 41,3 % of the EC answered that they were usually consulted by their RH doctor colleagues about decisions to be taken regarding their patients. Routine blood and other medical protocol tests of CE are well defined in the formal agreement with their RH in 65 % of the cases, although they can be modified by the EC through consensus with the RH in more than 50 % of the cases. 60 % of the EC can directly consult other specialists in the RH but more than 50 % need to do so through the RH nephrologist. Parenteral medication used in the ECs is mostly supplied by their RH, but a third of ECs have some limitations with uncommon or not concert-specified parenteral drugs. RHs refer that most of the vascular accesses are done in the hospital, whereas ECs say that this is true only in half of the cases. More than a third of the fistulae of predialysis patients are done in the ECs as part of their collaboration with RHs.

ARF was pre-renal in 52,7%, renal in 34,8% and post-renal in 8,5%. 35,8% of ARF patients had oliguria or anuria. The mean duration of ARF\/hospitalization was 22,47 days (22,47 21,83). The percentage of resolved ARF was 70,1%. Mortality was 30,8%. The univariated analysis showed comorbility Index of Charlson, oliguria, low serum albumin and cholesterol, and anemia were significantly associated with mortality (p&lt;0,05). The lineal regression analysis found three factors associated to the mortality rate: Comorbility Index of Charlson, oliguria and low serum cholesterol. Mortality predictive model was carried out. Highest basal comorbility of patients, oliguria and malnutrition-inflammation dates are princess prognosis and mortality factors in ARF today A new approach is needed in ARF because this new type\/class of population. ","1819":"Obesity increases the risk of proteinuria and chronic renal insufficiency and hastens the progression of renal diseases. Increased activity of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and elevated levels of aldosterone are common in obese patients. No studies have compared the efficacy of the currently available antiproteinuric strategies (ACE inhibitors -ACEI-, angiotensin receptor blockers -ARB-, aldosterone antagonists) in obese patients with proteinuric renal diseases. Single centre, prospective, randomized study. Twelve obese patients (body mass index &gt; 30 Kg\/m2) with proteinuria &gt; 0.5 g\/24 h were selected from our outpatient renal clinic. Patients were consecutively treated during 6 weeks with an ACEI (lisinopril 20 mg\/day), combined therapy ACEI+ARB (lisinopril 10 mg\/day + candesartan 16 mg\/day) and eplerenone (25 mg\/day) in random order. A drug washout period of 6 weeks was established between the different treatment periods. The primary outcome point was the change in 24-h proteinuria at the end of each treatment period and the number of patients showing a proteinuria reduction greater than 25% of baseline. The reduction in proteinuria induced by lisinopril (11.3+\/-34.8%) was not statistically significant with respect to baseline, whereas that of lisinopril plus candesartan (26.9+\/-30.6%) and eplerenone (28.4+\/-31.6%) showed a statistically significant difference both with respect to baseline values and to lisinopril group. The number of patients who showed a greater than 25% proteinuria reduction was significantly higher with eplerenone (67%) and lisinopril+candesartan (67%) than with lisinopril (25%). Monotherapy with an aldosterone antagonist and combination therapy with ACEI+ARB were more effective than ACEI monotherapy to reduce proteinuria in obese patients with proteinuric renal diseases. ","1820":"Hemodialysis (HD) patients have an impaired response to hepatitis B(HB) vaccines, and the persistence of immunity, the efficacy of revaccination and the periodicity of post-vaccination testing are not well defined. We present the experience during 13 years in an outpatient dialysis center of 136 HD patients who completed a HB vaccination program consisting in 3 doses of 40 microg intramuscular recombinant B vaccine (Engerix-B). In all patients anti-HBs titers were determined annually and in 31 patients every 6 months. Nonresponders patients and responders patients that lost their antibodies(&lt; 10 UI\/ml) received annually a booster double dose of vaccine. Seventy-four patients(54.4%) developed immunity and the remaining 62 patients were considered nonresponders. When compared both groups, gender and the etiology of chronic kidney disease did not differ between the two groups; nevertheless, nonresponders patients were significantly older than responders. After 1 year of follow-up, 32% of responders had no detectable anti-HBs levels, and only 18% of patients remained immunoreactive 6 years afer vaccination. The peak anti-HBs titer immediately after completion of the vaccination schedule was found to be a major predictor of maintaining immunity: 75% of patients with anti-HBs titers greater than 1000 IU\/ml remained immunoreactive 3 years after vaccination compared to 47% of patients with titers between 100-999 IU\/ml(p=0.08) and 34% of patients with titers between 11-99 IU\/ml(p=0.02). The administration of additional doses of vaccine were effective in 24% of the nonresponders patients, and 69% of them remained seropositive at the end of the 1-year follow up. Repeated booster doses of vaccine in nonresponders patients to the first booster dose afforded seroconversion in 19.6% of the patients. Performing post-vaccination testing every six months it would have allowed to give booster doses of vaccine in 16% of responder patients before the annual period. This current study demonstrates that a HB vaccination schedule with a regular serological follow-up and repeated booster doses , affords an acceptable seroprotection in HD patients. ","1821":"In postoperative critically-ill patients who develop Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) it is important to focus on survival and quality of life beyond hospital discharge. The aim of the study was to evaluate outcome and quality of life in patients that develop AKI after major surgery. This retrospective study was carried out in a Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit with five intensive care beds during 2 years. Patients were followed for the development of AKI. Preoperative characteristics, intra-operative management and outcome were evaluated. Six months after discharge, these patients were contacted to complete a Short Form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) and to have their dependency in ADL evaluated. Chi-square or Fischer's exact test were used to compare proportions between groups. A \"t test\" and a paired \"t test\" for independent groups was used for comparisons. Of 1584 patients admitted to the PACU, 1200 patients met the inclusion criteria. One hundred-fourteen patients (9.6%) met AKI criteria. Patients with AKI were more severely ill, stayed longer at the PACU. Among 71 hospital survivors at 6 months follow-up, 50 completed the questionnaires. Fifty-two percent of patients reported that their general level of health was better on the day they answered the questionnaire than 12 months earlier. Patients that met AKI criteria after surgery had worse SF-36 scores for physical function, role physical and role emotional domains. Six months after PACU discharge, patients that met AKI criteria were more dependent in I-ADL but not in P-ADL. Patients that develop AKI improved self-perception of quality of life despite having high rate of dependency in ADL tasks. For physical function and role physical domains they had worse scores than PACU patients that did not develop AKI. ","1822":"Several organizations recommend using estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in kidney function monitoring, preferably calculated with Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula. The role of this formula is not clear in the risk stratification of contrast induced acute kidney injury (CIAKI) in nonsteady state patients. Comparative evaluation of the MDRD eGFR in risk stratification of CIAKI. GFR was measured twice (pre- and post-examination) by Tc-99m-DTPA, along with serum levels of urea nitrogen and creatinine in 32 patients (mean age+\/-SD; 60.1+\/-13.2 years) needing hospital care for various reasons and underwent to x-ray examination with contrast media (mean; 90.2+\/-16.8 ml). eGFR was calculated by the dedicated formula. Agreement between measured GFR (mGFR) and MDRD eGFR was assessed and patients were scored and stratified for CIAKI by using first mGFR, then eGFR and results were compared. A moderate correlation was obtained between mGFR and eGFR (r=0.47, p &lt; 0.001) and the difference was not significant. However, Bland &amp; Altman analysis revealed large limits of agreement between mGFR and eGFR (-80.3 to 55.2) with a mean difference of -12.5 ml\/min\/1.73m2. In ROC analysis, when mGFR values were classified as normal (&gt;60ml\/min\/1.73m2) and decreased (&lt;60ml\/min\/1.73m2), AUC was 0.80 (95%CI; 0.62-0.92) for eGFR, with a sensitivity of 29% and specificity of 100%. Furthermore, the risk group categorization, using eGFR instead of mGFR was resulted in a group change for four patients (13%); from moderate to low risk group. It seems that MDRD eGFR differs from mGFR. In nonsteady state patients CIAKI classification using eGFR should be considered with caution. ","1823":"FGF23 is a recently identified hormone regulating mineral and vitamin D metabolism. In patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), circulating FGF23 levels are progressively elevated to compensate for persistent phosphate retention, which result in reduced renal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and thereby stimulate secretion of parathyroid hormone, suggesting its critical role in the pathogenesis of altered mineral homeostasis in CKD. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that FGF23 directly acts on parathyroid gland and mediate secretion of parathyroid hormone in the presence of Klotho as a cofactor, although such effects are not yet confirmed in patients with CKD. FGF23 can also be used as a predictor of mortality as well as future development of refractory hyperparathyroidism in patients undergoing dialysis therapy, where FGF23 levels are markedly elevated in response to hyperphosphatemia and active vitamin D treatment. This brief review summarizes recent insights into the role of FGF23 in the pathogenesis of mineral and bone disorders in CKD.","1824":"Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is increased in several pathologies associated with fibrosis, including multiple renal diseases. CTGF is involved in biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, migration, adhesion and angiogenesis. Its expression is regulated by various factors involved in renal damage, such as transforming growth factor- , Angiotensin II, high concentrations of glucose and cellular stress. CTGF is involved in the initiation and progression of renal damage to be able to induce an inflammatory response and promote fibrosis, identified as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of kidney diseases. In this paper we review the main actions of CTGF in renal disease, the intracellular action mechanisms and therapeutic strategies for its blocking.","1825":"","1826":"Patients with stabilized kidney transplant receive optimal management care when there is effective coordination between the transplant centre and the community nephrologist (Evidence level C). A good coordination with regular interactive communication between the transplant centre and community nephrologist is very positive for patients and beneficial to the transplant centre and community nephrologist (Evidence level C). Many of the clinical objectives for management of kidney transplant recipients are similar to those related to chronic kidney disease patients (Evidence level C). A good coordination between the transplant centre and community nephrologist needs organizational requirements and clinical management protocols (Evidence level C).When irreversible renal allograft failure occurs, the community nephrologist must assume the preparation for dialysis as with other patients with advanced chronic kidney disease: choose dialysis methods, create arteriovenous fistulae or place peritoneal catheter and identify dialysis treatment centre. Moreover, the transplant centre and the community nephrologist will jointly decide the best moment to start dialysis or the possibility of preemptive kidney transplant (Evidence level C).","1827":"Despite the advances in immunosuppressive therapy and in patient care, about 20-30% of patients will have lost their grafts after 3 years and this loss will continue by 3-4% per year. These patients are included in maintenance dialysis programmes and account for 4 to 10% of those admitted every year for maintenance dialysis therapy. Among those patients who loss their grafts 40-60% are included in transplant waiting lists. This increases the number of patients waiting for a graft and raises the dilemma about the rights to be included in deceased donor programmes. A common characteristic of these patients waiting for a second or even third transplant is the presence in the blood of antibodies to HLA antigens. A new transplant is the best therapeutic option for these patients, and the results are quite close to those achieved for the first graft. Moreover, a new transplant improves patient outcome when compared with those remaining in the waiting list. The best results are obtained in diabetic patients and in those between 18 to 50 years old (Evidence C). However, the percentage of patients retransplanted has not varied in the last years, possibly due to the wider criteria adopted on candidate selection that increases the waiting lists (Evidence B). In the second transplant, mismatched HLA-A,B antigens could be repeated if the recipient has not developed specific antibodies to these antigens. Recent cross-match has to be negative. Immunosuppressive therapy is similar to that used with first transplants. Lymphoproliferative diseases, BK virus nephropathy and primary glomerulonephritis do not preclude a second transplant (Evidence C).","1828":"The early diagnosis of the graft intolerance syndrome or a subclinical state of chronic inflammation due to a failed kidney allograft, is one of the goals that the nephrologists must fulfill to take a series of measures directed to solve this situation. Fever, haematuria, local pain and\/or tenderness are the main clinical criteria to make a diagnosis. However, oftenly there are not any clinical symptoms and only the presence of parameters of chronic inflammation (elevated C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypoalbuminemia and anemia resistant to erythropoietin therapy) are signs of this entity. Maintenance of immunosuppressive treatment is not advisable due to the risk of infections as well as the increase in cardiovascular risk (level evidence A). Transplantectomy is the best treatment if there are some associated complications such as allograft infection, neoplasia or high risk of graft rupture. However, surgical treatment is not exempt from risks and it is associated to a considerable rate of complications, with the consequent prolongation of the hospitalization stay. Therefore it is desirable to use less invasive procedures, such as embolization. This could be the first step unless the conditions enumerated in point 3 come up (Level evidence B). It is desirable to use prophylactic antibiotic before the embolization to avoid infectious complications (Level evidence B).","1829":"There's no controlled and prospective studies which show the safest and most effective way to reduce or suspend immunosuppression drugs dosage, and only few groups have published their own protocols. There are reasons to discontinue the immunosuppression therapy; the high incidence of infections is the most important. However, a fast withdrawal is not free of problems, like are residual renal function decline and graft intolerance signs, which could take to nephrectomy, a high risk intervention. Most recommended guidelines for immunosuppression use are: - Antimetabolites immediately cancellation and corticoesteroids slow drop (level C recommendation). - Calcineurin inhibitors could be discontinued but if residual renal function is still significant, it is recommended to maintain a low dosage over three to six months; then, withdrawal may be done slowly (level C recommendation). We have not found information supporting the immunosuppression use beyond six months.","1830":"The choice of the most of dialysis modality after renal graft loss is an unanswered question. Most patients start hemodialysis (HD) in this situation, because of several reasons: 1. In most dialysis programs HD predominates clearly over Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). 2. The star of dialysis in emergency situations makes the physician use HD 3. The fear of infections in case of maintenance of immunosupression to avoid immune response and to keep residual renal function in case of PD. A lot of patients could undergo PD in order to maintain the previous style of life, as an alternative in case of absence of vascular access and to avoid vascular accesses in children. Mortality seems to be greater in patients with graft loss than in those who start dialysis for the first time, although the comparison between both groups is methodologically difficult. However, there is no difference in mortality between patients who start HD and those who start PD. Studies comparing the rate of peritonitis in PD patients in both groups find controversial results. The analysis of the few, retrospective and biased studies which look for differences in patient survival in HD and DP suggests that prognosis of both groups is similar. The choice of dialysis modality must be similar to those patients which begin dialysis for the first time.","1831":"EVALUATION OF THE RENAL FUNCTION: For the follow-up of the graft renal function it must be measured the glomerular filtration rate by means of formulae that use the serum creatinine. The most used equation is the brief formula MDRD. - All patients transplanted must be included in the group of Renal Chronic Disease though the glomerular filtration rate is normal and there is no evidence of renal damage. - The measures of intervention proposed in the classification of the Renal Chronic Disease for its progressive establishment in the stage 1 to 3, must be applied to all the transplanted THE BEGINNING OF DIALYSIS: In spite of receiving attention of Nephrologists along the whole evolution, the patients with chronic dysfunction of the graft that need treatment with dialysis start later and with more uremic complications that the patients who start dialysis for the first time. - To change this trend, it is necessary to consider the treatment with dialysis when the glomerular filtration rate is lower than 15 ml\/min\/1,73 m2. If there appears any complication related to the uremia that cannot be handled by conservative treatment, the beginning of the dialysis is necessary. THE BEGINNING OF THE DIALYSIS OF PROGRAMMED FORM: The beginning of the dialysis of not programmed form in transplanted patients is difficult to justify if we take into account that such patients, have received nephrological attention along all their evolution. - To get a new vascular access in these patients can be difficult depending on the previous trombosis of arteriovenous fistulas. Therefore, it must be realized a prompt evaluation for de department of vascular surgery to guarantee a suitable vascular access. - As general norm, one must follow the same criterion advised for the not transplanted patient: the vascular access must be considered when the glomerular filtration rate is lower than 20 m\/min\/1,73 m2. - The patient who is going to be treated by dialysis peritoneal precise a very narrow follow-up to be able to programme the placement of the catheter peritoneal with a minimum of 15 days before beginning the training.","1832":null,"1833":"The definition of anemia is established by the World Health Organization and was subsequently adopted by the American Society of Transplantation, which defines anemia as hemoglobin concentration &lt;12 g\/dl in women and &lt;13 g\/dl in men. PREVALENCE OF ANEMIA POSTTRANSPLANTATION: Varies throughout the posttransplantation period and is associated with the degree of renal graft function. The relationship between hemoglobin levels and glomerular filtration does not behave the same way as in the population with chronic kidney disease. The results of various studies show a high prevalence in the first months after transplantation (&lt;6 months), which decreases from the first year posttransplantation and then increases related to loss of graft function. European study on the management of anemia showed a prevalence of anemia in 38.6% and only 18% of patients with severe anemia were treated with erythropoietin (EPO). There is a decrease in the synthesis of erythropoietin (EPO) or an increase in resistance to EPO. There are many factors that can cause anemia post-transplantation. Some of these factors are specific to transplanted patients whilst others are common to all patients with chronic kidney disease. Among the common factors there are: the degree of renal function and iron deficiency and among the factors of transplantation there are acute rejection, post-transplantation medications, infections and malignancies. The available data evaluating the association of anemia with morbidity and mortality of the patient and graft survival are scarce. Most studies are retrospective and analyze experiences of individual centers. They showed a higher mortality and morbidity among patients with a hemoglobin &lt;11 g\/dl. (Evidence B). TREATMENT OF POST-TRANSPLANTATION ANEMIA: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) and replenishment of iron deposits (Evidence A). RESPONSE TO TREATMENT: In transplant patients there may be some resistance to treatment with erythropoiesis- stimulating agents (ESA) due to the use of myelosuppressive medications, chronic inflammation and other factors. - Adverse effects of treatment with ESA: There are few controlled studies failed to show respect to the ESA that are effective and unlikely to accelerate the deterioration of renal function but may aggravate hypertension. ","1834":"Non-immunological factors in the progression of kidney disease in transplant patients are the following: high blood pressure, proteinuria, dislypidemia, etc. 1. Arterial hypertension treatment: Blood pressure must be measured periodically in all transplant patients. Similarly to native kidneys, in renal transplant patients arterial hypertension is a risk factor in the progression of kidney disease. Arterial hypertension represent a clinical marker of chronic allograft nephropathy and contributes to graft loss and to the morbid- mortality of these patients (Evidence level C). Blood pressure control should be &lt; 130\/80 mm Hg for renal transplant patients without proteinuria and 125\/75 mm Hg for proteinuric patients (&gt; 1 g\/24 hours). Hypertension and proteinuria are frequently associated in the same patients, a global treatment of both seems more rational (Evidence level C). General measures should be instigated first with pharmacological therapy. All antihypertensive drugs are useful in renal transplant patients and the majority of patients will need two or more drugs. In proteinuric patients an angiotensin receptor antagonist or an ACE-inhibitor should be initiated. It is advisable to monitor the serum potassium and creatinine after the start of this drugs or during the treatment periodically, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV-V. 2. Proteinuria treatment: Proteinuria has been strongly correlated with reduced function and graft survival. Lowering proteinuria to values as near to normal as possible (&lt; 0.5 g\/24 hours). To reduce proteinuria, an angiotensin receptor antagonist, an ACE-inhibitor or a combination of both are required, with serum potassium or creatinine monitoring, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease stage IV-V. 3. Dyslipidemia treatment: For kidney transplant recipients the assessment of dyslipidemias should include a complete fasting lipid profile with total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. Evidence from the general population indicates that treatment of dyslipidemias reduces cardiovascular disease and evidence in kidney transplant patients suggests that judicious treatment can be safe and effective in improving dyslipidemia. Therapeutic goal must be LDL &lt; 100 mg\/dl. (Evidence level C). 4. Others: Cigarette smoking, glucose intolerance or diabetes control and obesity should be assessed.","1835":"In kidney transplantation patient and graft survival are excellent in short-term and mid-term, although they remain stable in the long-term.The incidence of acute rejection has decreased to 8%-15%.Despite marked progress in understanding immunologic mechanisms involved in transplantation, new tools are required to detect early changes that could affect allograft function allowing us to anticipate histological lesions and providing a more accurate use of immunosuppressive drugs.From an immunologic point of view, efforts should be directed to avoid interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF\/TA) and to prevent antibody-mediated rejection.The most frequent cause of late graft loss is IF\/TA.Improvement in kidney transplant results have been achieved with calcineurin inhibitors -CNI- (cyclosporin and tacrolimus), antiproliferative agents (mycophenolate mofetil and enteric-coated mycophenolic acid) and T-cell depleting antibodies. The combination of tacrolimus + mycophenolate mofetil + steroids has been the gold standard in kidney transplant immunosuppression. An adequate balance in order to maintain the appropriate immune response is essential to the patient to avoid infections or neoplasias as well to prevent rejection.In renal transplant recipients with chronic kidney disease stage 4T in which renal function remains stable,immuno-suppressive drugs can be continued at the usual maintenance doses. As GFR declines, CNI and antiproliferative drugs should be reduced.","1836":"Although long-term outcomes also improved, graft loss caused by chronic allograft nephropathy remains an important obstacle. This situation, together with the progressive increase in the number of renal transplant patients, means that the population of transplant patients readmitted to a dialysis program will be progressively greater. The mortality rate in patients starting dialysis after graft loss has been reported as variable, though higher than that observed in patients with a functioning graft and that observed in patients on dialysis treatment. However, it is not known how the management of chronic kidney disease patients in the transplant setting differs from that of patients with native kidney disease with a similar degree of renal dysfunction. Many patients in stages 4T-5T have chronic kidney disease related complications that fall below targets established for nontransplant chronic kidney disease patients. A limited number of studies have evaluated patients returning to dialysis after graft failure and the different guidelines in the setting of transplantation have not analyzed this crucial aspect so important. Parting from this premise, a working group of the Spanish Society of Nephrology in the field of kidney transplantation and dialysis has reviewed in-depth each of the clinical aspects of care of patients with kidney transplant failure coming back to dialysis and drawn up a consensus document in order to optimize the management of this condition.","1837":"","1838":"","1839":"","1840":"","1841":"","1842":"","1843":"","1844":"","1845":"","1846":"","1847":"","1848":"","1849":"","1850":"","1851":"","1852":"","1853":"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a debilitating disease occurring exclusively in patients with severe renal failure.

Many patients with CKD according to this classification (at least stage 3) are elderly with a low GFR and without any other typical manifestations of renal damage, which is generating a worry between nephrologists due to a significant increment in non justified referrals to their clinics. Our aim in this study is to follow-up during twenty-four months a group of elderly with a low eGFR. 80 clinically stable patients, with a mediane age of 83 years (range 69-97), recruited alleatory in a consultation of Geriatric and Nephrology General, within January and April 2006, were followed up during twenty-four months.

The specificity of the multiplex PCR system was 88,5% (95%CI= 75,9-95,2), and the sensitivity, 87,9 (95%CI= 76,1-94,6). This is a useful strategy that, together with automated computer-based allele detection, allows reliable, simple, faster, and cheaper genetic analysis than the previous singleplex method. ","1860":"Introduction In an attempt to reduce unnecessary central venous catheters (CVC) dependence in prevalent population, a \"CVC removal\" programme was initiated in our unit. The objective was to diminish the number of CVC and to analyze the causes of their insertion and maintenance. On 09\/01\/07, 38 out of 173 prevalent patients on hemodialysis. Methods were CVC dependant (21.9%): 16 incident patients (42,1%) and 22 (57,8%) prevalent patients. All of them were re-evaluated for permanent vascular access utilization, included those previously rejected for surgery. Physical, psychical and vascular aspects regarding each patient were taken into consideration. The following variables were age, Body mass index, time on hemodialysis, Charlson analyzed comorbidity index, DM or vascular comorbidities and number of vascular accesses created prior to CVC placement. In those patients in whom AVF creation was feasible, the following were registered after 18 months of 1.Primary failure rate. 2. Related complications. 3. up follow Percentage of usable AVF or AVG. 4. Percentage of removed CVC. 5. Mortality and hospitalization. The decision of no realization of a new vascular access and? Results maintenance of TVC was performed in 21 patients (55.2%). In 9 of them was decision of the nephrologists and the family. In 11 patients was decision of vascular surgeon due to vascular bed exhaustion. A permanent VA was achieved in 17 patients (44.7%), 50% of them was incident patients and 45% prevalent patients. The primary failure rate was 0%. The TVC was withdrawn in 11\/17 (64.7%). Only 4 patients remain without TVC after 18 months of follow-up: 5 patients died (4 with a AVF functioning and 1 VA closure due to steal syndrome) and in 8 patients was mandatory to reintroduce the TVC again. Immediate complications after the surgery were: 1 severe haematoma, 2 infections and 2 severe sequestrations. 3 patients required hospital admission following complications directly related to VA. Mean time of free of TVC was 5.2 months (range: 0.7- 14.3 months). The mortality was 29,4% (5\/17) in the group of patients with a new VA and 9,5% (2\/21) in the other group(RR 3,19; IC 95%: 0,68-13,98; p: 0,11). No significant differences were observed between patients who transitioned to a permanent vascular access and those who remained TVC dependant in regards to age, gender, BMI, time on dialysis, DM, comorbidity or number of previous VA, Transition from CVC use to hospitalizations or mortality. Conclusions permanent vascular access is possible in prevalent patients in dialysis. Improvement was achieved by a modest amount, and after a prolonged process with gravel complications, some of which proved severe. Need for CVC dependence is confirmed in a high percentage of prevalent patients on dialysis. Comorbidity might have influenced the results. The quality standard should be adequate to reality of current population on hemodialysis.","1861":"Cancer is one of the major causes of death with functioning allograft among renal transplant patients. The increasing age of patients in the waiting list has derived in a higher risk of cancer in this population. The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of cancer in the waiting list and kidney transplant patients. Between November\/1996 and November\/2007 we assisted 825 patients in the outpatient renal transplant clinic, 467 were transplanted, 120 remained in the waiting list and 238 have been removed from the waiting list or died. During this period, 97 malignancies were diagnosed, 33 of 32 kidney transplant candidates and 64 of 62 renal transplant patients. The comparative analysis between this two groups showed that candidates had higher frequency of solid organ tumours compared with a higher incidence of skin cancer in transplanted patients. Mean time between transplant and cancer diagnosis was 42.6 +\/- 32.7 months, 48% of malignancies were diagnosed within the first three years postransplant. When comparing kidney transplant patients with and without cancer diagnosis, the formers were older and had worse patient survival at five years. Allograft survival was similar for both groups. we want to emphasize the extreme importance of a detailed screening in the renal transplant candidates and transplanted patients due to a higher incidence of malignancies in this population. ","1862":"Low serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels have been reported in a high percentage of chronic renal failure (CRF) patients and have been considered as independent predictors of mortality in both hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). A reduction in thyroid function in dialysis patients could be a marker of malnutrition and\/or inflammation. Our aim has been to evaluate the incidence of low T3 syndrome in a group of dialysis patients and analyze its relationship with different parameters of malnutrition and inflammation. PATIENTS AND METHODS We included 32 stable dialysis patients (24 HD and 8 DP); mean age +\/- SD 71.2 +\/- 11.7 years; 46.9% males; 15.6% diabetics; mean time on dialysis 47 +\/- 43 months. The following parameters were measured in every patient: thyrothropin (TSH), Free T4 (FT4) and Free T3 (FT3); biochemical data related to nutritional status; anthropometric measurements, bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA), and dietary survey of three consecutive days. Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 11.0. Mean hormonal values of thyroid function were: TSH 2,2 +\/- 1.5 U\/ml (range: 0,4-5.0); FT4 14.7 +\/- 2.3 pmol\/l (range: 11.0-23.0) and FT3 4,0 +\/- 0.71 pmol\/l (range: 3.95-6.80). Only 2 patients (6.3%) showed low FT4 levels and another 2 patients increased TSH levels, whereas 17 patients (53.1%) presented with low FT3 levels. We did not found any correlation between serum FT3, FT4 and TSH levels. We found a correlation between FT3 and inflammation\/nutritional parameters: prealbumin (r = 0,36; p = 0,04); transferrin (r = 0,40; p = 0,025); PCR (r = -0.38; p = 0,039); and IGF-I (r = 0,38; p = 0,03); body mass index (BMI) (r = 0,51; p = 0,002); arm circumference (AC) (r = 0,65; p = 0,000), and arm muscle circumference (AMC) (r = 0,72; p = 0,000). FT3 levels were also correlated with BIVA parameters: phase angle (r = 0,54; p = 0,002); muscle mass percentage (r = 0,49; p = 0,005); and cell mass percentage (r = 0,53; p = 0,02), but not with any data of fat mass. AMC was the only variable that independently correlated with FT3 levels in the multivariate regression analysis (r = 0,69; r2: 0,48; p = 0,000) Half of our dialysis patients have decreased levels of serum FT3 without alteration on FT4 or TSH. Low FT3 levels are correlated bioquimical and anthropometric parameters indicators of malnutrition and inflammation. Periodical measurement of FT3 levels could be used by clinicians as an accesible and reproducible method to detect such states. ","1863":"Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare disease often causing obstructive uropathy because the fibrosis entraps the ureters. The retroperitoneal tissue is constituted by a fibrous component and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with the former characterized by miofibroblasts. The infiltrate displayed perivascular. Last years, the immunosuppressive therapy and the decompression of obstructive renal failure have improved the prognostic. We reported 9 patients with Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis in a Centre. We evaluate clinical symptoms at the presentation with the signs of renal and non-renal involvement. We evaluate the achieved therapy and the follow-up. All 9 patients had a radiological and\/or histological diagnosis in the absence of malignancy, previous radiotherapy or gadolinium's administration with severe renal failure. The patients were treated with 1 mg\/kg\/day of prednisone three months and possibly the insertion of ureteral catheters. 89% patients have a high rate of initial success without renal failure, despite frequent disease relapse. A patient developed progression of the fibrosis.","1864":"A change in paradigm occurred lately whereby not hypocalcemia but hypercalcemia and positive calcium balance were considered negative factors. Namely, the use of calcium- based binders in combination with vitamin D analogues, has been shown to lead to an over-suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and development of low-bone turnover adynamic bone disease (ABD). The changing prevalence of various types of bone diseases from a high to low-bone turnover goes in line with the presence of increased risk for vascular calcification (VC), morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. The attenuation of the previous great expectations in calcium-based phosphate binders and vitamin D-analogues entailed a new treatment strategy to preserve bone and vascular health. Hence, a new evidence for treatment of ABD with various types of non calcium based binders and low calcium dialysate is presented. Sevelamer treatment has reduced calcium concentration and increased PTH levels, resulting in the improvement of markers of bone turnover, increased bone formation and improved trabecular architecture, providing a slower progression of VC. Data on lanthanum beneficial effect on ABD histology have been demonstrated in long-term clinical studies. Although there is a slow release of lanthanum from its bone deposits after discontinuation of the treatment and no association with aluminium- like bone toxicity, there is still an ongoing scientific debate about its long-term toxic potential. Finally, reducing the number of calcium based binders and low calcium dialysate (1.25 mmol\/l) has been reported to have an impact on the evolution towards markers reflecting higher bone turnover. Then, adoption of the non calcium-based binders should be reserved to high risk patients with ABD and progression of vascular calcifications associated with increased morbidity and mortality.","1865":"The glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin is an essential viability and frowth factor for the erythrocytic progenitors. EPO signaling involves tyrosine phosphorylation of the homodimeric EPO receptor and subsequent activation on intracellular proteins, kinases and transcription factors. Treatment with recombinant human EPO(rHu EPO) is efficient and safe in improving the management of the anemia associated with chronic kidney disease, and allowing avoidance of transfusions with blood products. however, the unanticipated increase in mortality found in recent randomized studies is prompting a reassessment of this view. The present review will show what is known about the physiology of this plasma factor that, it is now clear, is more than just an erythrocyte production factor, and its pleitropic effects influencing the incidence of malignancy, thrombosis, hypertension and retinopathy.","1866":"","1867":"","1868":"","1869":"","1870":"","1871":"","1872":"","1873":"","1874":"","1875":"","1876":"","1877":"","1878":"","1879":"","1880":"","1881":"2 cases of proteinuria in obese non-diabetic young males, both corresponding to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis are presented.

Many modalities have been used to diagnosis pleuroperitoneal: pleural fluid analysis, chest X- ray, Tc-99m gammagraphy, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance image. Some of these procedures are invasive or have a high risk of induced-contrast nephrotoxicity. We present two case reports of pleuroperitoneal leak in two patients on peritoneal dialysis diagnosed with Tc-99m gammagraphy. We conclude that Tc- 99m gammagraphy is a simple, safe, non invasive, low radiation exposure and cost effective method in the assessment and evaluation of complications related to peritoneal dialysis such as pleuroperitoneal leak.","1883":"In last time it was tried to homogenize the clinical activity and to make the decisions easier. In the field of Nephrology, the Spanish Society of Nephrology has developed different guidelines that have managed an improvement in patient s monitoring. That is the reason why the Quality Working Group in Nephrology was created, whose basic working field was haemodialysis, although its collaboration with an expert group in peritoneal dialysis (PD) has allowed the developement of a Scientific Technical Quality Programme and Constant Quality Improvement in PD. We checked the clinical histories of all the patients in PD in the course of 2008 in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit at our institution and we evaluated all the quality indicators that were described in the Scientific Technical Quality Programme and of Constant Quality Improvement in PD. During 2008 a total of 41 patients were treated in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit at our institution, 43.9% women. Incidence was 14 (51.8%) and 21.4% were diabetics. No patients cames from transplant unit and 2 came from haemodilalysis unit (7.1%). Mean age in incident population was 60 +\/- 13 years and in prevalent population was 53.9 +\/- 14.4 years. Mean follow-up in PD was 25.9 +\/- 19.9 months. Modified Charlson comorbility index average in incident patients was 6 and in prevalent patients was 5. 70.7% were included in transplant programme and 3 were transplanted in the year s course (10.3%). There were 19 hospital admissions (rate: 0.46 admission per patient\/year in risk) with a mean stay of 7.3 days (rate: 3.4 days per patient\/year in risk). During 2008 6 patients leaved PD (2 transfers to haemodialysis, 3 transplants and 1 death). 16 infective peritonitis (overall rate: 1 episode every 24 months) and 23 exit side infections were reported (rate: 1 episode every 18 months). Mean Kt\/V was 2,4 +\/- 0.06 (92.7% of patients achieved the stablished standards). All non-anuric patients had measured residual renal function and only 1 patient did not achieve the goal of fluid output &gt; 1000 ml\/day. No patient used 3.86-4.25% bags. Stablished standards were achieve by analitic indicators with regard to epoetin resistence index, LDL- cholesterol, phosphate, calcium-phosphate product and PTH. The application of the Scientific Technical Quality Programme and of Constant Quality Improvement in PD has made possible to know the current situation of our unit and to raise some matters when it is necessary to insist to get a better quality in our assistance. ","1884":"The purpose of this paper is to communicate our experience in the salvage of thrombosed haemodialysis vascular accesses using interventional radiology techniques. In the last four years, we have treated, by radiological means, 101 thrombosed haemodialysis vascular accesses. There were 44 autologous arteriovenous fistulas (43.56%) and 57 PTFE grafts (56.44%). There were 69 men (68.3%) and 32 women (31.7%). The mean age was 67.73 years (range 33-84). The mean vascular access age was 23.79 months (range 1-132). Manual catheter-directed aspiration was used. Fragmented, triturated or pushed the thrombus against the pulmonary circulation was avoided in all cases. 78 accesses were salvaged (77.2%). Autologous fistulas average and PTFE grafts success rate were 84.44% and 71.42% respectively. Angioplasty in one or more lesions after thromboaspiration was performed in all accesses, except six (5.9%). Metallic endoprostheses were implanted in 14 accesses (13.9%). Mean follow-up was 9 months (range 0-44). Primary patency was 42.3% +\/- 5 at 6 months and 32% +\/- 4 at one year. Autologous fistulas patency was better than PTFE grafts patency (p &lt; or =0,05). Our results suggest thrombosed autologous arteriovenous fistulas salvage is better than PTFE grafts. This justifies interventional radiology techniques in these situations. ","1885":"Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause for starting renal repacement therapy in Spain with a steady incidence since 1997. Data on incidence of diabetic nephropathy previously to dialysis are scanty because they are not registries similar to those used for renal replacement therapy. It have been retrospectively studied the records of our hospital Nephrology outward from January, 1991 to December, 2006. Diagnosis was commonly made using clinical criteria (proteinuria plus diabetic retinopathy). There were 21 cases which did not meet theses criteria and so renal biopsy was performed. During this time 478 (49.7 pmp) patients were diagnosed of diabetic nephropathy (mean age 61.2 years, 50.4% women). Incidence increased from 33.3 pmp (1991) to 76.2 pmp (2006). There were not significant changes in the age of patients along the time. Other common diagnosis in diabetic patients were nefroangiosclerosis (129) and glomerulonefritis (n = 103). Survival until renal replacement therapy was 87.5% at one year and 48% at five years of follow up. Incidence of diabetic nephropathy seems to have increase last years specially in the patients aged 70 or older. In spite of therapeutic improvements the prognosis is still unfavourable. Less rectricted age criteria for submitting patients may have influenced these results. ","1886":"Pain in haemodialysis is very common, although frequently underdiagnosed. Chronic pain in dialysis has been scarcely evaluated, and intradialytic pain has not been specifically analyzed. Our aim was to compare intradialytic versus chronic pain characteristics in the same group of twenty-seven hemodialyzed patients, to investigate whether there were or not differences between them. Several validated scales were used: a) Analogical Visual Scale, defines pain intensity from 0, no pain, to 10, the worst pain; b) Pain Management Index, that results from subtracting pain level from analgesic use, ranging from - 3 (inadequate) to + 3 (adequate management); c) McGill Pain Questionnaire, which defines three items: pain related qualitative index, number of words chosen, and present pain intensity; and d) Brief Pain Inventory, which analyses influence of pain in patient's life, was only aplicable to evaluate chronic pain. Tests were administered firstly during the dialysis session for evaluating intradialytic pain, and another day out of the session to evaluate chronic pain. Ischemic pain was the most common during the session (37%), whereas muscle-skeletal was more frequent out of the session (77%). Prevalence of pain was higher during the session (92.5% vs 77.7%, p &lt; 0.05). Number of weekly sessions with pain was 1.78 +\/- 1.2. Analogical visual score was slightly higher during the session with respect to chronic pain (3.28 +\/- 2.22 vs 2.67 +\/- 2.13, p = NS). Pain Management Index scores were significantly different (intradialytic: -0.81 +\/- 0.76, chronic pain: -0.12 +\/- 0.94). McGill test scores were similar in both situations. Only in chronic pain, time on dialysis correlated significantly with analogical visual scores, pain related index and number of words chosen, and parathyroid hormone levels with analogical visual scores and interference to displacement score from Brief Pain Inventory. Farmacological treatment was prescribed in 11% of patients with intradialytic pain (63.1% of responders) compared to 74% for those with chronic pain (53.1% of responders). In conclusion, pain in hemodialysis is very frequent and becomes undertreated. Pain scales used have been shown to be useful in this setting. Several differences appear between intradialytic and chronic pain. Chronic pain is less frequent and intense, better treated, mainly derived from a muscle-skeletal source, and it is related to time on dialysis and to secondary hyperparathyroidism.","1887":"Cystatin C is a marker of renal function and a major cardiovascular risk factor. In the general population, cystatin C appears to be influenced by factors other than renal function alone. However, information for serum cystatin C levels in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is lacking. We studied 52 nondiabetic patients (38 men, mean age 49 years) with CKD stage 3 (22), 4 (25) or 5 (5) who had measurements of serum cystatin C levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD), inflammatory (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and fibrinogen), and oxidative markers (anti-oxidized LDL antibodies, serum paraoxonase-1 activity and concentration), left ventricular mass index by echocardiography and other cardiovascular risk factors. Mean cystatin C levels were 2.35 +\/- 0.9 mg\/l. Cystatin C was positively correlated with creatinine serum levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate, PTH levels and negatively with anti-oxidized LDL antibodies. On the other hand, cystatin C was not related to inflammatory markers, serum paraoxonase-1 activity and concentration, proteinuria, HDL or LDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, left ventricular mass index or demographic factors such as age, body mass index and blood pressure. After adjustment for PTH levels and anti- oxidized LDL antibodies, only estimated glomerular filtration rate was independently related serum cystatin C levels (beta = -0.500, p = 0.001). In nondiabetic patients with CKD, cystatin C is closely related to the degree of renal dysfunction. In contrast, inflammatory state, oxidative stress, left ventricular mass index and other cardiovascular risk factors are not related to cystatin C levels in this population. ","1888":null,"1889":"Vascular calcification is a common finding in patients (pts) with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the prevalence and functional effect of native arteriovenous fistula AVF (feeding artery and\/or arterialized vein) calcifications evaluated by spiral computed tomography (CT) in ESRD pts undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). Forty-five upper limb AVF (radial 44.4% or brachial 55.6%, mean duration 65.3 +\/- 80.9 months) without evidence of significant stenosis were evaluated by CT in 45 ESRD pts (mean age 63.8 +\/- 13.1 yr; sex M: 71.1%, F: 28.9%; mean time on HD 53.1 +\/- 51.9 months; diabetic nephropathy 15.6%). All AVF explorations were performed using the same multi-slice spiral CT scanner (HiSpeed Dual machine, GE Medical Systems). The severity of AVF calcifications was quantified by CT using the following criteria: grade I absence of calcifications, grade II isolated calcifications (&lt;10 groups of calcification), grade III moderate calcifications (10-20 groups of calcification) and grade IV diffuse calcifications (&gt;20 groups of calcification). Laboratory parameters analyzed: calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone; calcium x phosphorus product was calculated. The same week of CT scanning, we evaluated AVF function measuring the blood flow rate (QA). We determined QA (1559.3 +\/- 980.6 ml\/min) by the Delta-H method (ABF-mode, HemaMetrics, USA) using the Crit-Line III monitor (68.9%) or by Doppler ultrasound (31.1%) performed by the same radiologist using a 5-8 MHz linear transducer (Sequoia machine, Siemens-Acuson); mean arterial pressure MAP (94.7 +\/- 16.3 mmHg) was recorded simultaneous with QA. Most pts not showed AVF calcification by CT scan (grade I: 27\/45, 60%). Forty percent of pts (18\/45) demonstrated any degree of AVF calcification (grade II 13.3%, grade III 8.9%, grade IV 17.8%). Pts with brachial AVF showed higher mean QA compared to pts with radial AVF (1899.1 +\/- 1131.8 versus 1134.5 +\/- 516.4 ml\/min, p=0.005), but MAP (91.2 +\/- 15.8 versus 99.0 +\/- 16.2 mmHg) and the prevalence of AVF calcification (32% versus 50%) were not different between both groups (p=0.11 and p=0.24, respectively). Pts with evidence of any calcification on CT scanning (grade II, III or IV) had higher time on HD (84.6 +\/- 63.1 versus 24.6 +\/- 20.0 months), higher AVF duration (97.7 +\/- 89.3 versus 34.6 +\/- 61.2 months) and similar QA (1488.3 +\/- 678.9 versus 1606.6 +\/- 1148.9 ml\/min) compared with pts without AVF calcification (p=0.014, p=0.001 and p=0.69, respectively); no differences in MAP (95.4 +\/- 13.8 versus 94.2 +\/- 17.9 mmHg), prevalence of brachial AVF (44% versus 63%) or mineral metabolism parameters were found when comparing both groups (for all comparisons, p=NS). The same results were obtained when comparing pts with a high (grade III-IV: 26.7%) and a low (grade I-II: 73.3%) AVF calcification score, or when comparing pts with diffuse (grade IV) and without (grade I) AVF calcification. 1) The prevalence of AVF calcification by CT scan was 40%. 2) The AVF calcification was related with time on HD and AVF duration. 3) The function of fully developed AVF without stenosis and suitable for routine HD was not impaired by the presence of calcifications.

In the last 26 months we have detected thirteen patients with acute renal failure associated to fibrates in our outpatients' clinic. The aim of our study is to analyze our experience in deterioration in renal function associated to fibrates use. This is a retrospective charts review. From the thirteen patients (8 males\/5 females) with mean age of 65.5 +\/- 12.2 years, ten received Fenofibrate (FN), one Bezafibrate (BZ) and two Gemfibrozil (GF). Six cases had previously normal renal function and the seven remaining had mild chronic renal failure (CRF). The increase of serum Creatinine (Crs) value was higher than 74%. Acute renal failure was reversible in 9 patients (group 1), but the other 4 did not recover their previous renal function (group 2). The average of Crs before fibrate treatment was 1.33 +\/- 0.36 mg\/dl (Creatinine clearance 63.2 +\/- 26.6 ml\/min) and the highest average of Crs during the treatment was 2.22 +\/- 0.49 mg\/d (Creatinine clearance 37.3 +\/- 11.9 ml\/min). The average time until acute renal failure diagnosis was 6.7 +\/- 5.8 months and the recovery of renal function was delayed an average of 3.8 +\/- 3.5 months after fibrates withdrawn. Group 2 patients had a higuer Crs and longer time with fibrates than group 1 patients. CPK values were normal in all cases. In two patients renal biopsy was performed and no significant lesions were detected. The fibrate treatment can induce an acute renal failure. Four patients (30.8%) did not recover their basal renal function. When fibrate treatment begins a renal function should be monitored specially in patients with CRF.

This has produced a change in our understanding in mineral metabolism and specifically of phosphate regulation. FGF23 is a 251-amino acid factor that differs from other FGF family members by having a 71-amino acid extension on the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule that is specific for this factor. It is primarily produced by osteocytes in bone. It has a central role in phosphate homeostasis regulation, producing phosphaturia, and in vitamin D metabolism, inhibiting its production by suppression of renal 1 Alfa hydroxylase. It is believed to have an important place in the pathogenesis of early secondary hyperparathiroidism related to chronic renal insufficiency by inhibiting renal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D in response to its increment in blood produced to increase renal phosphate excretion and maintain phosphate balance. In CRF its serum levels seem to be independent predictors of progression to terminal renal failure. In dialysis patients the determination of its serum levels would allow to predict the results of therapy with calcitriol in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism; they also seem to be independent predictors of the risk of mortality during the first year of hemodialysis. Its serum levels have also been related to the development of vascular calcifications of hand arteries but not with aortic calcifications. The exposure to excessive levels of FGF23 in the early postransplant period seems to be strongly associated with postransplant hypophophatemia more than to PTH or other phosphatonins.","1893":"","1894":"","1895":"","1896":"","1897":"","1898":"","1899":"","1900":"","1901":"","1902":"","1903":"","1904":"","1905":"","1906":"","1907":"We report a patient in Automatic Peritoneal Dialysis (APD) with tuberculous peritonitis by possible peritoneal infection due to the proximity between fallopian tube and the left ovary, a peritoneal liquid culture was constantly negative.

Affectation in gammagraphic studies is considered the \"gold standard\" for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Several studies with biomarkers have been made with controverted results. The objective of this study is to set the utility of beta2-microglobuline, alfa1-microglobuline, Cistatine C, IgG and albumin in the location of the infection, through the analysis of the relation among their urinary excretion, clinical and laboratory parameters and the renal scintigraphy findings. Prospective observational study made in 40 patients, aged from 1 month to 11 years, after their Hospital admission with suspicion for acute pyelonephritis. Exclusion criteria were: decrease in the glomerular filtration rate, malnutrition, massive albuminuria and history or findings of nephrourologic disease. Clinical and laboratory variables were analyzed, and renal ultrasonography and scintigraphy were performed within the first seven days after admission. Once the fever dropped, the urinary creatinine-protein ratio was analyzed. After the acute process, a renal scintigraphy was performed in order to detect renal scars. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test has been used as the statistical hypothesis test, and Chi-square and Fisher s exact tests have been used to compare the qualitative variables. The glomerular filtration rate, as well as the ultrasonography scan, was normal in all patients. 45% of the children (24\/80 kidneys) had scintigraphic alterations that were compatible with acute pyelonephritis, and there were not differences in proteinuria between these and those with normal scintigraphy. To greater age greater probability of scintigraphic affectation. The sensitivity and specificity of leukocytes and CRP to predict pyelonephritis were 77-65% and 94-52%, r = 0.70 (CI 95% 0.54-0.87) y 0.75 (CI 95% 0.60-0.90) respectively. An apparent relation between the maximum temperature or duration of the symptoms and the renal affectation does not exist. In all the children, the normality of urinary markers of renal function was confirmed once the acute phase had passed, even in those 3 patients with renal scars (7.5%). Renal scintigraphy is still being the reference pattern for the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis in Pediatrics. The combined use of different urinary markers of renal function does not increase its sensitivity. It is necessary to do research in order to confirm the utility of new biomarkers. ","1909":"The small quantity of acetate present in the dialysis fluid exposes patient's blood to an acetate concentration 30-40 times the physiological levels. This amount is even greater in hemodiafiltration on-line. Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical-analytical effects using three different dialysis techniques in the same patient. 35 patients on hemodialysis were included. All patients were treated with conventional bicarbonate dialysate for 3 months, after randomization were switched to first be treated with PHF online with standard bicarbonate dialysate for 6 months and then switched to PHF on-line acetate-free dialysate for the other 6 months or to invert the two last periods. Blood samples were drawn monthly throughout the study and clinical data were obtained. Postdialysis blood acetate levels were higher in patients treated with conventional bicarbonate dialysate with respect to the period of PHF with free-acetate dialysate. Moreover, the percentage of patients with postdialysis blood acetate levels in the pathologic range was higher in patients treated with conventional bicarbonate dialysate respect to PHF on-line acetate-free dialysate period (61% vs. 30%). Serum concentrations of chloride postdialysis were higher and serum concentrations of bicarbonate pre and posthemodialysis were lower in the PHF free-acetate period. The incidence of hypotensive episodes was significantly lower in the PHF on-line with conventional dialysate. PHF on-line with free-acetate dialysate allows that most of patients finished hemodialysis with blood acetate levels in the physiologic ranges. PHF on-line is a predilutional hemodiafiltration treatment with better tolerance than hemodialysis with standard bicarbonate dialysate. ","1910":"Digoxin overdose is closely related to Chronic Kidney Disease and creatinine dosage adjustment is usually needed. Our goal was to assess the advantages of serum creatinine and the MDRD equation to detect hidden renal insufficiency to reduce the overdose Digital risk. We describe all digoxin samples processed and registered in our hospital laboratory database for a year. Patients under 18 years and samples below therapeutic ranges were excluded. Chi square (p&lt;0.05), ROC curves and logistic regression analysis were conducted. SPSS software was used. Between 1228 digoxin samples taken to 679 patients (273 men, 77 +\/- 10 years old , and 406 women 82 +\/- 8 years old), 14% were over therapeutic range (28 men and 67 women). Significant differences were observed in over dosage between high creatinine group regarding to normal creatinine group (31% vs. 10% in men, 44% vs. 15% in women). ROC curves showed that the most accurate levels to predict digoxin over dosage were MDRD&lt;56 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) in men and MDRD&lt;52 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) in women. 68% of over dosage men had declines of MDRD levels, compared to 61% with high creatinine levels, 81% of over dosage women had declines of MDRD compared to 51% with elevated creatinine levels. Even in patients with normal creatinine levels, chronic kidney disease enhances digoxin over dose risk. Using the decline of glomerular filtration rate estimated by the MDRD equation is better than elevated creatinine levels to detect digoxin overdose, thus constituting a very useful tool to reduce the risk of overdose, especially among women. ","1911":"Abnormalities in serum calcium, phosphate, and Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) concentrations are common in patients with chronic kidney disease and have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. One of the most common problems in the first weeks after renal transplantation is Delayed Graft Function (DGF). There are several well-known risk factors for DGF development, but the role of calcium phosphate-PTH homeostasis as a risk factor for early graft dysfunction is controversial. This issue was addressed in the current study. Pretransplant PTH, calcium and phosphate values were gathered in 449 patients that received a renal transplant in our center between 1994 and 2007. Other variables expected to influence the risk for delayed graft function were included from the clinical charts. The incidence of DGF was 27.3%. DGF development was significantly associated with recipient age, type and need of renal replacement therapy, peak panel reactive antibodies, transfusion number and donor age. There were no significant differences in the mean pretransplant values of calcium (9.4 +\/- 1.0 vs. 9.5 +\/- 0.9 mg\/dl, p = 0.667), phosphate (5.7 +\/- 1.8 vs. 5.5 +\/- 1.5 mg\/dl, p = 0.457), calcium-phosphate product (53.5 +\/- 17.2 vs. 51.8 +\/- 14.6 mg(2)\/dl(2), p = 0.413) and PTH (315 +\/- 312 vs. 340 +\/- 350 pg\/ml, p = 0.530) between patients with and without DGF. In our study population pretransplant serum PTH, calcium and phosphorus levels have no influence on the risk for DGF. ","1912":"Less frequent dosing regimens during anemia treatment could benefit Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) patients. We investigated the effectiveness of darbepoetin alfa dosed every-other-week (Q2W) for maintaining hemoglobin (Hb) levels (11-13 g\/dL). One hundred and nine PD patients from 14 centers participated in an 8-month observational, prospective study. Patients (Hb 11-13 g\/dL) receiving weekly (QW) darbepoetin alfa switched to Q2W dosing at the investigator's discretion. Doses were adjusted according to published guidelines. Sixty-nine percent (75 out of 109) of patients switched to Q2W dosing. Thirty-three percent maintained the g\/week, equivalent to twice the previous mean weekly dose (26.1-25.8 g\/week, QW dose). Forty-seven percent received a dose reduction (35.8-20.2 equivalent to the previous QW dose). More patients in the maintenance dose group 11 g\/dL than those receiving a reduced weekly dose (80% vs. had Hb levels 51.4%, respectively, p = 0.0236). During the Q2W phase, the mean Hb level ranged from 12.0-12.5 g\/dL for the maintenance dose group and 11.5-12.0 g\/dL for the reduced dose group. From the switch to the end of the study, the mean (SD) change in Hb was -0.7 g\/dL (0.98 g\/dL, p = 0.0557) and -0.6 g\/dL (1.6 g\/dL, p = 0.1296) for the maintenance and reduced dose groups, respectively. The Q2W darbepoetin alfa was well tolerated. Only a single treatment-related adverse event (polycythemia) occurred. The majority of PD patients receiving QW darbepoetin alfa can be effectively switched to Q2W and still maintain their Hb level. ","1913":"Peritoneal permeability differs between patients at the time of starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) and it can increase along with time on the technique. This fact is related to peritonitis, the biocompatibility of the dialysis fluids and the use of glucose as osmotic agent. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if the use of one exchange a day of icodextrine from the time of DP initiation affects the evolution of peritoneal permeability. 56 patients starting PD (mean age: 48.3 +\/- 14.0; 62.5% males; 17.9% diabetics) that used one exchange a day with icodextrine from the time of starting PD. We performed a peritoneal transport kinetic study at the time of starting PD and then every 6 months during two years. We calculated the peritoneal mass transfer area coefficient of creatinine (Cr-MTAC) and urea (U-MTAC) as well as the D\/P creatinine relationship (D\/P Cr). As a control group we used the results of Cr-MTC of 249 patients that had used glucose as the only osmotic agent from the time of starting PD. The peritoneal transport, calculated using Cr-MTC, U-MTC and D\/P Cr, diminished at 12 months (11.7+\/-5.7 vs. 8.1+\/-3.1; 23.5+\/-7.3 vs. 18.9+\/-3.8; 0.72+\/-0.09 vs. 0.67+\/-0.08; respectively), staying stable afterwards.We found that high transporters (HA) patients (higher quatril Cr-MTC ) showed a higher diminution of Cr-MTAC along the first year of treatment. The diminution of Cr-MTAC after 12 months using icodextrine was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) that the one observed in the control group that only used glucose as osmotic agent (10.5+\/-5.3 vs. 10.1+\/-4.6). We found that high transporters (HA) patients (higher quatril Cr-MTC) showed a higher decrease of Cr-MTAC along the first year of treatment. the use of icodextrine at the time of starting PD might help to correct the high transport status observed in some patients during the first months of treatment. The peritoneal transport kinetic studies performed at 6 and 12 months after starting PD are more representative of the long term peritoneal transport characteristics of the patients than those performed at the time of starting PD. ","1914":"Tunneled catheters in hemodialysis are associated with poor prognosis, however, few prospective studies have been designed to specifically evaluate this aspect. The objective has been evaluate the impact of tunneled catheter in patient mortality and costs attributable to this procedure. A seven years prospective cohort study was performed in all patients starting hemodialysis in our health care area adjusting for comorbidity and albumin. The study comprised 260 patients with Charlson index 7.05 +\/- 2.8 (age 65.5 years, 62.3% males, 25% with diabetes mellitus and 37.7% with a previous cardiovascular event. The first vascular access was a catheter in 47.3%, PTFE in 11.2% and native arteriovenous fistula in 41.5%. Minimum follow-up was one year, with an average of 2.31 years\/patient. The mortality risk adjusted for comorbidity was greater among the patients that started with catheterization, HR: 1.86 [1.11-3.05]. This negative effect was observed in 57.30% of those subjected to catheterization at any stage (HR: 1.68 [1.00-2.84] and proved to be time dependent, i.e., the longer catheterization, the greater the risk: HR: 7.66 [3.34-17.54] third versus first tertil. The cost directly attributable to catheter use was 563.31 euros\/month. All poor prognosis groups showed lower albumin and hemoglobin levels, without differences in efficacy. Tunneled catheter use at any time is associated with an increased risk of death. This effect increases with the duration of catheterization, both circumstances are independent of patient comorbidity at time start of hemodialysis and implies a higher net cost.

In this program, we defined objectives to improve the quality of these services in one year and we defined different quality indicators in order to maintain and monitor health quality. The indicators referred to technical quality and perceived quality and we periodically evaluated their evolution. The results of the last five years indicate that the majority of the indicators have improved, except those concerning infections surgery and the response to complaints.

Prevention, early recognition and treatment are essential to limiting its impact. The most important risk factors for developing NSF are chronic or significant acute kidney disease (especially dialysis dependent patients) and the administration of gadolinium (GD3) containing contrast agents, agents that cause NSF by releasing free gadolinium (GD3) into tissues based on their pharmacokinetics. International commissions in drug control and medicinal products recommend to avoid gadolinium based contrast agents in patients with GFR &lt; 30 ml\/minute\/1.73 m(2). Unfortunately there is lack of universally effective therapy at this time and the literature is based on case reports and small case series.

Calcium and calcitriol's mechanism of action takes place through its specific receptors, the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) and the Vitamin D Receptor (VDR). These two factors have an effect not only on its specific receptors, but also they can modify the other receptor in a positive manner, promoting its actions and demonstrating a cooperative effect between the two. Along with calcium and calcitriol, drugs used in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease Mineral Bone Disorders (CKD-MBD) also act directly or indirectly on CaR and VDR and therefore are also responsible for the regulation of the parathyroid gland.","1918":"","1919":"","1920":"","1921":"","1922":"","1923":"","1924":"","1925":"","1926":"","1927":"","1928":"","1929":"","1930":"","1931":"","1932":"","1933":"Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by injure of skeletal muscle with the release of intracellular constituents into the circulation.

Glomerular and interstitial parameters in O-FSGS and I-FSGS were compared morphometrically as well as immunomorphological study was done to evaluate immunohistochemical profile of TGFbeta- 1, monocytes\/macrophages, T lymphocytes and alpha-SMA in these groups. The total glomerular cells, mesangial areas, glomerular alpha-SMA staining, glomerular monocytes\/macrophages and glomerular T-cells were in IFSGS increased in comparison with O-FSGS, most of them significantly, whereas total glomerular area was significantly greater in O-FSGS patients. The tubular immunoexpression of TGF-beta-1, interstitial volume and interstitial alpha-SMA staining were significantly increased in I-FSGS cases in comparison with O-FSGS group, but interstitial CD68+ and CD3+ cells did not differ significantly. Moreover, we found in both O-FSGS and I-FSGS groups significant positive correlations between glomerular immunoexpression of alpha-SMA and glomerular CD 68+ cells, tubular immunoexpression of TGF-beta-1 and interstitial immunoexpression of alpha-SMA as well as tubular immunoexpression of TGF-beta-1 and interstitial volume. Negative correlation between tubular immunoexpression of TGF-beta-1 and interstitial CD3+ cells was significant only in IFSGS group.

","1941":"Living donor kidney transplantation (KT) is the treatment of choice for end-stage renal disease patients and exhaustive assessment of the potential live kidney donor leads to successful KT in most occasions. Diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension and obesity make up contraindications to donation because all of them are associated with postsurgical complications and future development of renal failure and cardiovascular (CV) disorders. However, it is unclear how much risk there is for individuals who donate a kidney and then develop some of these complications, which are grouped under the metabolic syndrome (MS.) Indeed, MS is a cluster of CV risk factors such as obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension where the insulin resistance is the pathogenic mainstay. MS is an entity very prevalent in the western countries (20-30%) and has been associated with the development of CV disorders, DM and renal disease. Thus, it is crucial to detect MS before living donation in order to avoid these complications in the long-term. Regardless of clinical criteria to diagnosis MS, both oral glucose tolerance test and HbA1c levels may be useful clinical tools for unmasking MS before donation. Moreover, determination of insulin resistance by HOMA could help to achieve this objective. This review will outline the next issues: 1) frequency of MS in the general population (potentially, living kidney donor); 2) the impact of MS on DM, renal function and other CV complications; 3) assessment of living donor to unmask MS before donation; and 4) interventions on risk factors for minimizing MS-related threatening complications in the long-term. In any case, if MS is detected prior to donation, prophylactic and therapeutic measurement should be performed to avoid its progression. By contrast, MS could be considered a contraindication to donation.","1942":"Diabetic nephropathy is the most common cause of endstage renal disease. Approaches targeting angiotensin II significantly delay its progression. However, many patients still need renal replacement therapy. High throughput techniques such as unbiased gene expression profiling and proteomics may identify new therapeutic targets. Cell death is thought to contribute to progressive renal cell depletion in chronic nephropathies. A European collaborative effort recently applied renal biopsy transcriptomics to identify novel mediators of renal cell death in diabetic nephropathy. Twenty-five percent of cell death regulatory genes were upor downregulated in diabetic kidneys. TNF-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL) and osteoprotegerin had the highest level of expression. In diabetic nephropathy, tubular cells and podocytes express TRAIL. Inflammatory cytokines, including MIF via CD74, upregulate TRAIL. A high glucose environment sensitized renal cells to the lethal effect of TRAIL, while osteoprotegerin is protective. These results suggest that, in addition to glucose levels, inflammation and TRAIL are therapeutic targets in diabetic nephropathy.","1943":"","1944":"","1945":"","1946":"","1947":"","1948":"","1949":"","1950":"","1951":"","1952":"","1953":"","1954":"","1955":"","1956":"","1957":"","1958":"","1959":"","1960":"","1961":"","1962":"","1963":"","1964":"","1965":"","1966":"","1967":"","1968":"","1969":"- Palliative care is not \"the absence of KRT\", but an alternative to it in very selected cases.

Since a practical and effective dialysis technique was introduced, the length and quality of survival of patients with end-stage renal failure has constantly increased. Contraindications for dialysis are almost never of a renal origin. The obstacles are the concomitant diseases of the patient. The age of the patient may be one of these obstacles. The average age at initiation of dialysis in our country is currently 67 years and over 50% of patients are 60 years old or older. Decision making: From an ethical viewpoint, there is a consensus in stating that anything that can technically be done, should be done. The principle of nonmaleficence and respect for the autonomy of the patients are \"prima facie\" principles when the physician has doubts as to whether dialysis provides a benefit to the patient. The principle of autonomy, which makes the patient a competent subject of treatment, allows a framework of shared decisions to be created in which the physician uses his knowledge and experiences in assessing the risk and benefits of dialysis including the alternative of no dialysis. The competent patient, duly informed, will chose the option that is best for him and take the decision. Principle of treatment proportionality: This principle states that there is a moral obligation to implement all therapeutic measures that show a relationship of due proportion between the resources used and the expected result. Dialysis is in principle a proportional treatment for end-stage renal failure. However, it may become a disproportional treatment because of the physical and mental conditions of the elderly patient. The good that is sought with institution of treatment can cause a harm to the patient that justifies noninclusion of the patient in dialysis treatment. Because of the impossibility of establishing universal rules of proportionality, it is necessary to make a personal judgment of conscience in each specific case. Recommendations for initiation or not of dialysis: Taking shared decisions between the patient (or relatives and\/or advisors) and the physician. These shared decisions will be documented with signing of the proposed informed consent or rejection of the treatment. The medical team should always be sure that the patients has fully understood the consequences of the decision taken. Explanation of the modalities should include: - Types of dialysis treatment available. - Not to initiate dialysis and continue with conservative treatment until death. This situation may cause many problems if we do not have the help of the palliative care service. - Try dialysis for a limited time. - Stop dialysis and receive medical care until death. - Evaluate the prognosis of renal disease and concomitant diseases, life expectancy and family support. Resolution of conflicts: Conflicts may occur: - Between nephrologist and patient\/family. - Between members of the nephrological team. - Between nephrologist and other physicians. When conflicts persist and the need for initiation of dialysis is urgent, it is necessary to initiate treatment and continue it until the resolution of these conflicts, making a record of this decision. In such cases, the Hospital Ethics Care Committee can help with appropriate advice to solve the discrepancies. Decisions taken in advance may be useful in this type of patients. Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease with criteria for Noninclusion or withdrawal of dialysis. - Severe or irreversible dementia. - conditions of permanent unconsciousness. - advanced tumors with metastasis. - terminal disease of another nontransplantable organ. - severe physical and\/or mental disabilities.

This regulation refers to patient autonomy, the right to information and essential clinical documentation. - This law establishes the minimum requirements for the information the patient should receive and the decision making in which the patient should take part. Diagnostic tests are performed and therapeutic decisions are taken in the ACKD unit in which patient information is an essential and mandatory requirement according to this law.","1973":"PATIENT EVALUATION AND PREPARATION PRIOR TO VASCULAR ACCESS (VA) PLACEMENT: 1. Early referral of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD: GFR &lt;or= 30 ml\/min: CKD stage 4) is necessary so that they are educated about the different modalities of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) and there is sufficient time to perform a permanent functioning VA before the initiation of HD (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Preservation of the venous network of the upper extremities (UE): - Venipuntures and catheterizations in the UE should be avoided to reduce the incidence of venous occlusions and stenosis (Strength of Recommendation B). - If venipuncture or catheterization of veins of the UE is necessary, the dorsum of the hand should be the site of choice used and puncture sites should be rotated (Strength of Recommendation C). 3. Preoperative evaluation: Patient evaluation prior to VA placement should include: - A patient history and physical examination directed to evaluation of the existence and quality of the arterial and venous vessels of the UE (Strength of Recommendation B). - When necessary, a complementary examination by Doppler ultrasound (Strength of Recommendation B) or phlebography may be performed. Recommended when there is a history or central venous catheters (CVC) or pacemakers. 4. Timing of VA placement: - A vascular access should be placed starting from a GFR &lt; 20 ml\/min (Strength of Recommendation B). - The VA should be placed at least 6 months before the start of HD in the case of native AV fistulae and 3-6 weeks before in the case of synthetic VA (Strength of Recommendation B). SELECTION OF TYPE OF PERMANENT VA AND ITS LOCATION: 1. Type of VA: - A native AV fistula is the VA of choice. When a native AV fistula cannot be established, a synthetic AV graft is the second option (Strength of Recommendation A). - A CVC is the last choice after the previous two options. 2. LOCATION of the VA: In general, the order of preference for the type and location of the VA is: - A wrist (radial-cephalic) primary AV fistula (Strength of Recommendation A). - An elbow (brachial-cephalic) primary AV fistula (Strength of Recommendation B). - A transposed brachial basilic vein fistula (Strength of Recommendation B). - Synthetic or biological grafts; in order of preference, antecubital straight or looped graft, in the arm, and lastly in the chest wall or lower extremity once all options in upper extremities have been discarded (Strength of Recommendation B). CARE OF VA IN PREDIALYSIS: 1. Maturation: - A native AV fistula should not be used in the first month and 6-8 weeks (minimum 4) should be waited before use (Strength of Recommendation C). - A synthetic AV fistula should not be used for puncture for at least 2 weeks after placement and up to 4 weeks may be desirable (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Prevention of thrombosis: Antiaggregation\/Anticoagulation: 1. Systematic use of platelet antiaggregants or anticoagulants in VA to prevent thrombosis or increase their survival has not been established by the evidence and also is associated with a greater risk of bleeding. Their use can be considered in certain situations after careful assessment of the risk-benefit balance (Strength of Recommendation C). CENTRAL VENOUS CATHETERS (CVC): 1. They should not be the first option for a permanent VA and should be considered for temporary use only whenever possible. Their main indications are: - Need for urgent HD in patients without permanent VA, patients with a maturing VA or that cannot be cannulated (Strength of Recommendation A). - Inability or difficulty to establish an adequate VA due to either a poor arterial bed or lack of venous development (Strength of Recommendation B). - Hemodialysis for short periods while waiting for a living donor kidney transplant (Strength of Recommendation C). - Patients with special circumstances: very severe comorbidities that imply a life expectancy of less than 1 year, cardiovascular status contraindicating placement of VA, PD patients temporarily on HD, etc. (Strength of Recommendation C). 2. Types of CVC: Selection of the type of catheter should be based on local experience, the patient's individual circumstances and the requirements for its use. - Nontunneled CVC should be reserved for stays &lt; 3 weeks due to their higher rate of complications (Strength of Recommendation B). - Intravascular lengths of 15 cm are recommended in the right jugular vein, 20 cm in the left jugular vein, and 20-25 cm in the femoral veins (Strength of Recommendation B). 3. - The first choice is the right internal jugular vein, followed by the left internal jugular vein, the external jugular vein and the femoral veins. The subclavian veins should only be used exceptionally (Strength of Recommendation A). - Placement of a CVC ipsilateral to a maturing AV fistula should be avoided (Strength of Recommendation B). The use of femoral catheters should be limited to hospitalized (bedridden) patients (Strength of Recommendation B) because they are associated with higher infection and dislodgement rates. - The tip of the CVC should be placed at the entry of the right atrium for nontunneled catheters and within the right atrium for tunneled catheters (Strength of Recommendation B). Placement of CVC in the jugular and subclavian vein should be confirmed radiologically (Strength of Recommendation A). TYPES OF CATHETER AND IMPLANTATION TECHNIQUES: - The implantation team (nephrologist, surgeon, nurse) is more important for results than the technique of implantation used (Strength of Recommendation A). - No catheter has been demonstrated to be superior to others (Strength of Recommendation A). - Surgical, laparoscopic or percutaneous technique show similar results (Strength of Recommendation A). TIMING OF CATHETER IMPLANTATION: - Between catheter insertion and the start of peritoneal dialysis (PD) at least two weeks should be allowed to avoid early leaks (Strength of Recommendation C). - Antibiotic prophylaxis should be performed prior to the implantation procedure (preferably a 1st generation cephalosporin) (Strength of Recommendation A). EARLY COMPLICATIONS AND THEIR TREATMENT: - Prevention of exit site infections: It is mandatory to identify Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers and treat them with mupirocin ointment either intranasal or pericatheter, or gentamycin pericatheter, to reduce the incidence of infections by this germ (Strength of Recommendation A). - Treatment of exit site infections: Treatment should conform to the PD guidelines published by the SEN. Withdrawal of the catheter due to exit site infection should be considered when there is concurrent peritonitis by the same germ (except coagulase-negative staphylococcus) or treatment-refractory or recurrent infections by the same germ (Strength of Recommendation C). - Mechanical complications: If leakage of peritoneal fluid occurs and dialysis is necessary, the patient should be temporarily transferred to HD or started on automatic peritoneal dialysis (APD) with low volumes and in a decubitus position. ","1974":"In view of the lack of scientific evidence to support the initiation of KRT from a specific filtration rate, certain conclusions can be drawn whose application in clinical practice may be useful. The recommendations we could make are: - Scheduled initiation of KRT is associated with a better patient prognosis (Strength of Recommendation B). - KRT should be planned in advance so that the patient can freely choose the technique for KRT (Strength of Recommendation B). - If the patient starts HD with a permanent vascular access, his\/her course will be better (Strength of Recommendation B). - When the patient has any clinical indication for initiating KRT, this should not be postponed (Strength of Recommendation A). - Glomerular filtration rate is the best way to assess kidney function (Strength of Recommendation B). - Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 15 ml\/min and any symptom associated with uremia not correctable by conventional treatment should be assessed for the initiation of KRT (Strength of Recommendation C). - Patients with a glomerular filtration rate less than 6-8 ml\/min should initiate KRT even if they are minimally symptomatic (Strength of Recommendation C). - Patients with more comorbidities or more extreme ages (children, elderly, diabetics, heart disease patients,...) could benefit from the initiation of KRT before other types of patients (Strength of Recommendation C). - Some patients with associated comorbid conditions could even benefit from the initiation of KRT with glomerular filtration rates above 15 ml\/min (Strength of Recommendation C).","1975":"1. VACCINATION AGAINST HEPATITIS B a) All patients with chronic advanced renal disease and negative serology for HBsAg and antiHBs are to be vaccinated against hepatitis B (Evidence level: B). b) For classic vaccines (Engerix B and HBVAxpro) the adult vaccine dose is 40 mcg (20 mcg in the paediatric population). There are two dose regimens based on the medicinal product used: 0, 1 and 6 months with HBVAxpro and 0, 1, 2 and 6 months with Engerix B. With the new vaccine Fendrix, the dose is 20 mcg and the schedule 0, 1, 2 and 6 months (Evidence level: C). c) The antiHBs titre is to be measured 1-2 months after administration of the last dose. In patients whose antibody titres are below 10 mIU\/mL, a booster may be administered, checking the response or administering a second full vaccination (Evidence level: B). d) In responders, antibody levels are to be tested at least once a year. If the antiHBs titre is below 10 mIU\/mL, a booster is to be administered (Evidence level: C). 2.

The kidneys are the key organs to maintain the balance of the different electrolytes in the body and the acid-base balance. Progressive loss of kidney function results in a number of adaptive and compensatory renal and extrarenal changes that allow homeostasis to be maintained with glomerular filtration rates in the range of 10-25 ml\/min. With glomerular filtration rates below 10 ml\/min, there are almost always abnormalites in the body's internal environment with clinical repercussions. 2. Water Balance Disorders: In advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the range of urine osmolality progressively approaches plasma osmolality and becomes isostenuric. This manifests clinically as symptoms of nocturia and polyuria, especially in tubulointerstitial kidney diseases. Water overload will result in hyponatremia and a decrease in water intake will lead to hypernatremia. Routine analyses of serum Na levels should be performed in all patients with advanced CKD (Strength of Recommendation C). Except in edematous states, a daily fluid intake of 1.5-2 liters should be recommended (Strength of Recommendation C). Hyponatremia does not usually occur with glomerular filtration rates above 10 ml\/min (Strength of Recommendation B). If it occurs, an excessive intake of free water should be considered or nonosmotic release of vasopressin by stimuli such as pain, anesthetics, hypoxemia or hypovolemia, or the use of diuretics. Hypernatremia is less frequent than hyponatremia in CKD. It can occur because of the provision of hypertonic parenteral solutions, or more frequently as a consequence of osmotic diuresis due to inadequate water intake during intercurrent disease, or in some circumstance that limits access to water (obtundation, immobility). 3. Sodium Balance Disorders: In CKD, fractional excretion of sodium increases so that absolute sodium excretion is not modified until glomerular filtration rates below 15 ml\/min (Strength of Recommendation B). Total body content of sodium is the main determinant of extracellular volume and therefore disturbances in sodium balance will lead to clinical situations of volume depletion or overload: Volume depletion due to renal sodium loss occurs in abrupt restrictions of salt intake in advanced CKD. It occurs more frequently in certain tubulointerstitial kidney diseases (salt losing nephropathies). Volume overload due to sodium retention can occur with glomerular filtration rates below 25 ml\/min and leads to edema, arterial hypertension and heart failure. The use of diuretics in volume overload in CKD is useful to force natriuresis (Strength of Recommendation B). Thiazides have little effect in advanced CKD. Loop diuretics are effective and should be used in higher than normal doses (Strength of Recommendation B). The combination of thiazides and loop diuretics can be useful in refractory cases (Strength of Recommendation B). Weight and volume should be monitored regularly in the hospitalized patient with CKD (Strength of Recommendation C). 4. Potassium Balance Disorders: In CKD, the ability of the kidneys to excrete potassium decreases proportionally to the loss of glomerular filtration. Stimulation of aldosterone and the increase in intestinal excretion of potassium are the main adaptive mechanisms to maintain potassium homeostasis until glomerular filtration rates of 10 ml\/min. The main causes of hyperkalemia in CKD are the following: Use of drugs that alter the ability of the kidneys to excrete potassium: ACEIs, ARBs, NSAIDs, aldosterone antagonists, nonselective beta-blockers, heparin, trimetoprim, calcineurin inhibitors. Determination of serum potassium two weeks after the initiation of treatment with ACEIs\/ARBs is recommended (Strength of Recommendation C). Routine use of aldosterone antagonists in advanced CKD is not recommended (Strength of Recommendation C). Abrupt reduction in glomerular filtration rate: Constipation. Prolonged fasting. Metabolic acidosis. A low-potassium diet is recommended with GFR less than 20 ml\/min, or GFR less than 50 ml\/min if drugs that raise serum potassium are taken (Strength of Recommendation C). In the absence of symptoms or electrocardiographic abnormalities, review of medications, restriction of dietary potassium and use of oral ion exchange resins are usually sufficient therapeutic measures (Strength of Recommendation C). If symptoms and\/or electrocardiographic abnormalities are present, the usual parenteral pharmacological measures should be used (10% calcium gluconate, insulin and glucose, salbutamol, resins, diuretics) (Strength of Recommendation A). Parenteral bicarbonate and ion exchange resins in enemas are not recommended as first-line treatment (Strength of Recommendation C). Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with glomerular filtration rates below 10 ml\/min (Strength of Recommendation C). 5. Acid-Base Disorders in CKD: Moderate metabolic acidosis (Bic 16-20) mEq\/L is common with glomerular filtration rates below 20 ml\/min, and favors bone demineralization due to the release of calcium and phosphate from the bone, chronic hyperventilation, and muscular weakness and atrophy. Its treatment consists of administration of sodium bicarbonate, usually orally (0.5-1 mEq\/kg\/day), with the goal of achieving a serum bicarbonate level of 22-24 mmol\/L (Strength of Recommendation C). Limitation of daily protein intake to less than 1 g\/kg\/day is also useful (Strength of Recommendation C). Use of sevelamer as a phosphate binder aggravates metabolic acidosis since it favors endogenous acid production and therefore acidosis should be monitored and corrected if it occurs (Strength of Recommendation C). Hypocalcemia should always be corrected before metabolic acidosis in CKD (Strength of Recommendation B). Metabolic acidosis is an infrequent disorder and requires exogenous alkali administration (bicarbonate, phosphate binders) or vomiting.","1977":"Prescription of protein intake in CKD is complicated by potential conflicts between goals to delay progression of CKD and preserve nutritional status. Providing a protein intake of about 0.75 g\/kg\/day appears reasonable in patients with GRF &gt; 30 mL (CKD stages 1-3). In CKD stage 4 and 5, it is recommended to provide a protein intake of about 0.6 g\/kg\/day to slow progression and minimize accumulation of uremic toxins. - Maintaining adequate energy intake is essential in all stages of CKD. - Assessment of nutritional status in CKD requires multiple markers to assess protein status, fat stores, body composition, and protein and energy intake. - PEM can be considered as an indication for the initiation of kidney replacement therapy. If PEM develops or persists despite attempts to optimize intake, and there is no apparent cause for malnutrition other than intake or anorexia, initiation of dialysis or kidney transplant is indicated in patients with GFR &gt; 15 mL\/min. - Nutritional treatment for patients with CKD should include nutritional assessment and education and nutritional planning and follow-up.","1978":"With progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), disorders of mineral metabolism appear. The classic sequence of events begins with a deficit of calcitriol synthesis and retention of phosphorus. As a result of this, serum calcium decreases and parathyroid hormone (PTH) is stimulated, producing in the bone the high turnover (HT) bone disease known as osteitis fibrosa while on the other extreme we find the forms of low turnover (LT) bone disease. Described later and initially associated with aluminum intoxication, these diseases are now seen primarily in older and\/or diabetic patients, who in a uremic setting have relatively low levels of PTH to maintain normal bone turnover. Osteomalacia is also included in this group, which after the disappearance of aluminum intoxication is rarely observed. LT forms of hyperparathyroidism facilitate the exit of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) from bone, whereas the adynamic bone limits the incorporation of Ca and P into bone tissue. Therefore, both forms facilitate the availability of Ca and P, which ends up being deposited in soft tissues such as arteries. The link between bone disease and vascular calcifications in CKD is now a well-established phenomenon. 2. Diagnostic strategies Calcium, Phosphorus They have little capacity to predict underlying bone disease, but their regular measurement is decisive for therapeutic management of the patient, especially in the dose titration stages of intestinal phosphorus binders, vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics. Ideally, Ca++ should be used, but total Ca is routinely used. It is recommended to adjust albumin levels in the event of hypoalbuminemia (for each g\/dL of decrease in albumin, total serum Ca decreases 0.9 mg\/dL). The following formula facilitates rapid calculation of corrected total calcium: Corrected total Ca (mg\/dL) = total Ca (mg\/dL) + 0.8 [4-albumina (g\/dL)]. Parathyroid hormone \"Intact\" PTH is the biochemical parameter that best correlates with bone histology (levels measured with the Allegro assay from Nichols Institute Diagnostics, no longer available). Various assays are currently available that use antibodies against different fragments of the molecule, but they have significant intermethod variability and have not been validated. A whole PT assay (1-84) is currently unavailable. A consensus to establish uniform criteria for PTH measurement remains to be established. During the dose titration stages of intestinal phosphorus binders, vitamin D analogs or calcimimetics, more frequent measurement may be required based on clinical judgment. Calcifediol (25(OH)D3) It is important to maintain adequate levels of 25(OH)D3 (&gt; 30 ng\/mL), since they will be the substrate for production of 1- 25(OH)2 D3, and their deficiency aggravates hyperthyroidism. Determining 25(OH)D3 levels every 6-12 months is a recommended guideline. Other markers of bone turnover (osteocalcin, total and bone alkaline phosphate, free pyridolines in serum, and C-terminal telopeptide of collagen) do not improve the predictive power of PTH and therefore their systematic use is not justified. Radiologic studies Radiologic studies are of little diagnostic utility, because biochemical changes precede radiologic changes. Systematic radiologic evaluation of the skeleton in asymptomatic patients is not justified at present. They are useful as the first step in the study to detect vascular calcifications and amyloidosis due to b2-microglobulin and in symptomatic and at risk patients to detect vertebral fractures. Bone densitometry: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the standard method to determine bone mineral density (usually in the femoral neck and vertebrae). It provides information on changes in bone mineral content, but not on the type of underlying bone disease. It is useful for follow-up of bone mass or for the study of bone mass changes in the same patient. Its value as a predictor of the risk of fracture has not been demonstrated in patients on kidney replacement therapy or with advanced chronic kidney disease. It is indicated in patients with fractures or risk factors for osteoporosis. Bone biopsy: The \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of bone disease. With improved knowledge of the value of noninvasive parameters, its use is infrequent. Pathological fractures in the presence or absence of minor trauma. Symptomatic patients in the presence of incongruent clinical parameters. A typical case is the presence of unexplained hypercalcemia from systemic disease, with inconclusive serum PTH values (between 120-450 pg\/mL as an estimated range). Evaluation and follow-up of cardiovascular calcifications There are no consensuated clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and follow-up of extraosseal calcifications in CKD. The clinical tools for evaluation and follow-up of cardiovascular disease are used based on clinical judgment. The periodicity of follow-up has not been established . 3. Recommended biochemical values The biochemical values recommended in clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation of bone mineral metabolism are summarized in Figure 3. The recommended PTH values do not fully coincide with the K\/DOQI guidelines. The wide variability in PTH values depending on the assays used has led us to expand the recommended PTH range in stage 3 and 4 CKD. 4. Treatment 4.1. Diet. The recommended diet for the patient with CKD is traditionally based on protein restriction and phosphorus restriction for control of mineral metabolism. A favorable circumstance is that there is a close relationship between protein and phosphorus intake. In CKD stages 3, 4 and 5, it is recommended to restrict phosphorus intake to between 0.8-1 g\/day when serum levels of phosphorus and PTH are above the recommended range. This is approximately equivalent to a diet of 50-60 g of protein. This reasonable antiproteinuric strategy that also restricts phosphorus intake is nutritionally safe. What should we tell them to eat? In a practical and oversimplified way, we recommend the following daily intake: Animal proteins: 1 serving (100-120 g), dairy products: 1 serving (equivalent to 200-240 mL of milk or 2 yoghourts), bread, cereals, pastas (1 cup of pasta, rice or legumes + some bread or cookies), vegetables and fruits relatively freely, but with moderation. 4.2. Medication Vitamin D supplements should be provided if serum levels are less than 30 ng\/mL. In Spain, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is marketed as Vitamin D3 Berenguer 2,000 IU\/mL of solution. Combinations of calcium with cholecalciferol are also available. Most of the dosage forms contain approximately 500 mg of Ca+ and 400 IU of cholecalciferol. Alternatively, calcifediol (25(OH)D3), as Hidroferol 100 mcg\/mL, has been used, although the dose range is very variable and has not been established. 4.3. Phosphorus binders. Use if hyperphosphatemia occurs. Start with calcium-containing phosphorus binders (calcium carbonate or calcium acetate), which also provide calcium if dietary intake is inadequate. Do not exceed 1.5 g of Ca++ per day. The most used are calcium carbonate and calcium acetate. Calcium acetate shows a similar binding potency to calcium carbonate but with a lesser calcium overload, and thus would have certain advantages as well as its greater effect at different pH ranges. However, gastric intolerance is more frequent with this dosage form. Aluminum hydroxide may sometimes be required to control phosphoremia or the occurrence of hypercalcemia. Serum aluminum values should be maintained below 30 mcg\/L. Avoid use for longer than 6 months and daily doses greater than 1.5 g. Sevelamer is associated with an increased risk of acidosis and has not been approved for use in predialysis stages. Lanthanum carbonate has been recently marketed in Spain, although its indication for use in the predialysis stage of CKD is still not approved. 4.4. Vitamin D derivatives. Indicated when PTH levels are elevated. A prerequisite for their use is that Ca and P serum levels are adequately controlled. Vitamin D derivates available in Spain are 1,25(OH)2D3 (Calcitriol)and 1a(OH)D3 (a-Calcidiol). Doses should be titrated until PTH levels are normalized. Phosphate binder doses often need to be increased because these vitamin D derivatives increase intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Low doses do not cause hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia and do not worsen the course of renal function. Recommended doses: Calcitriol 0.25 mcg every 48 hours and alpha-Calcidiol 0.50 mcg every 48 hours. Soon to be available on the Spanish market is the oral dosage form of paricalcitol (recommended initial dose of 1 mcg\/24 h), with a lesser hypercalcemic and hyperphosphoremic effect. Clinical use of calcimimetics in the predialysis state is not yet recommended and is currently under investigation. ","1979":"1. All patients with anemia secondary to CKD should be treated and evaluated for possible treatment, irrespective of underlying disease, associated comorbidity or possibility of kidney replacement therapy. 2. In patients treated with ESAs, Hb concentrations should be monitored at least monthly. 3.

The characteristics of these patients (Strength of Recommendation C) are: Patients with CKD have a deterioration in their HRQOL when compared with the general population. This deterioration is associated with various sociodemographic variables: age, gender, marital status, educational level and income. The deterioration is partly explained by the diseases that cause CKD (hypertension and diabetes), associated comorbid conditions (especially cardiovascular) and complications of CKD (anemia and malnutrition-inflammation). The progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is associated with a progressive deterioration of HRQOL, as well as an increase in the frequency and severity of certain symptoms and the impact (psychological distress) they cause. Physical dimensions are more affected than mental or social dimensions. Mental disturbances in patients with CKD can be summarized as follows: - There is an association between high levels of anxiety and low levels of sense of coherence with a reduction in wellbeing that in turn affects functional capacity for activities of daily living. - Psychological impairment from symptoms increases as GFR worsens. - This is a high level of correlation between perception of disease, depression and satisfaction with life. - Impairment of mental dimensions is greater in male, young, divorced, unemployed, smoker, and obese patients and in those who take more medication and have greater comorbidity. - Impairment of mental dimensions is negatively associated with albumin levels and hemoglobin. The recommended questionnaire for measurement of HRQOL in this type of patients is the SF-36. The SF-12 can be used as a shorter alternative and is suitable for evaluation of groups of patients.","1981":"ACKD units should be equipped with a nephrology nurse, who to carry out his\/her function adequately and contribute to the objectives of the ACKD unit should have the following: - Specific training as a nephrology nurse. - Own work area and appointments schedule. - Full-time commitment to nephrology. - A direct phone line to be able to contact patients and vice versa. - Well-established communication channels between nursing staff and nephrologists.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA - A complete evaluation of the lipid profile including total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides should be performed in any patient with CKD at baseline and at least annually (Strength of Recommendation B). - In patients with stage 4-5 CKD and LDL-C &gt;or= 100 mg\/dL, treatment to decrease levels to &lt; 100 mg\/dL should be considered because of their high CV risk. This reduction is recommended in secondary prevention and in primary prevention in diabetic patients. Lipid-lowering treatment is recommended in all other patients, although no evidence showing its benefits is available yet (Strength of Recommendation C). - In patients with stage 4-5 CKD and triglyceride levels &gt;or= 500 mg\/dL which are not corrected by treating the underlying cases, treatment with triglyceride-lowering drugs may be considered to reduce the risk of pancreatitis. However, treatment with fibrates should be used with caution, and these drugs should not be associated to statins due to the risk of rhabdomyolysis (Strength of Recommendation C). There is little experience on the efficacy and safety of omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in patients with grade 4-5 CRF, but they may be considered a possibly safer alternative to fibrates (Strength of Recommendation C). SMOKING - Smoking is a cardiovascular risk factor and a risk factor for progression of kidney disease in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation B). - Use of active measures to achieve smoking cessation is recommended in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation C). HOMOCYSTEINE - Hyperhomocysteinemia has been postulated as a cardiovascular risk factor in the general population and in kidney patients, but the available evidence is not consistent. - There is no evidence that vitamin therapy decreases cardiovascular risk in patients with CRF, and recommendation of routine vitamin measurement and start of vitamin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients is therefore questionable (Strength of Recommendation B). LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY - Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation B). - It is advisable to perform an echocardiogram at baseline and every 12-24 months and to consider treatments allowing for LVH regression (Strength of Recommendation C). The approach to LVH should be early and multifactorial because its reversibility is limited once established (Strength of Recommendation C). - RAAS blockade with ACEIs or ARBs partially reverts LVH in patients with CRF (Strength of Recommendation B). ANTI-PLATELET AGGREGATION - Because of the high cardiovascular risk in patients with CKD, anti-platelet aggregant therapy, especially low-dose aspirin, would be indicated in patients with type 2 diabetes as primary prevention, and in all patients with CKD as secondary prevention. There is however no evidence of the benefits of anti-platelet aggregant therapy in primary prevention in patients with CKD, particularly in stages 4-5; indication for treatment in this situation should therefore be individualised because of its greater risk of bleeding. - Adequate good blood pressure control should previously be achieved to minimise the risk of haemorrhagic stroke (Strength of Recommendation C).","1984":"Metabolic syndrome (MS) encompasses a series of diseases which, when combined, increase vascular risk more than the sum of their individual risks. Insulin resistance (IR) is one of the basic components of MS. - Abdominal fat distribution is an IR marker and is associated to factors increasing vascular risk such as dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and hyperglycemia, components of the so-called metabolic syndrome. - IR is related to glomerular sclerosis and renal failure through several mechanisms, Including genetic and environmental factors, and stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. - IR usually precedes development of DM, and therefore contributes to its early identification. MS increases the risk of chronic complications from DM and is associated to an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, particularly coronary heart disease, increasing mortality from this cause. - The presence of MS in DM2 is usually associated to a greater prevalence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria and peripheral polyneuropathy.","1985":"Nephrologists should promote the detection of CKD in heart disease patients. The evaluation should include estimation of GFR and detection of microalbuminuria in a recently voided urine sample by the albumin:creatinine ratio. Any patient with stage 3 or 4 CKD and rapid deterioration of GFR should be evaluated by the nephrologist. - Patients with CKD have a high risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications and heart disease patients have a high incidence of CKD and progression is also more rapid (Strength of Recommendation B). The most likely pathophysiological hypothesis is endothelial damage. - The CV risk profile should be established in each patient followed by adequate compliance with control goals for common CV risk factors: smoking, obesity, sedentarism, hypertension, dyslipidemia. Early treatment of anemia and bone mineral disease as CV risk factors requires special mention (Strength of Recommendation B). - Management of these patients will be based on individualization of treatment, close systematic follow-up, and integration between care levels: Specialized care (nephrologists and cardiologists) and primary care. - The cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is a condition in which both organs are simultaneously affected and their deleterious effects are reinforced in a feedback cycle, with accelerated progression of renal and myocardial damage. Because of its prognostic value, treatment of HF takes precedence over CKD. Most studies on cardiovascular risk and on HF exclude patients with stage 4-5 CKD. We thus do not have sufficient strong evidence and recommendations are based on the extrapolation of data from studies with normal GFR or milder grades of CKD, and on the empirical use of certain treatments. - ARBs and ACEIs are the mainstays of treatment of HF with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and have been shown to reduce mortality in studies in the general population (Strength of Recommendation A). The may also slow progression of CKD, especially in diabetics. Dual renin-angiotensin blockade with the combined use of lower doses of both drugs has shown promising results for control of CKD progression, but there are no data to recommend its use for control of HF in advanced stages of CKD (stage 4-5) (Strength of Recommendation C). - In these stages of CKD, only loop diuretics have sufficient potency. The therapeutic dose range should be achieved. Lowdose thiazides achieve diuretic synergy. The use of spironolactone and eplerenone has shown benefits in patients with AMI and HF with an ejection fraction &lt; 40% without advanced CKD. They should always be used with strict control of GFR and K+. No benefit has been shown for the use of &lt;&lt;dopamine in diuretic doses&gt;&gt; (may even be harmful) or continuous infusion of furosemide (Strength of Recommendation B). The use of beta-blockers should be increased in these patients. - Treatment-refractory heart failure in the context of stage 3 CKD could be amenable to ultrafiltration techniques. Continuous ambulatory PD could be an alternative treatment to maintain hemodynamic equilibrium while also allowing pharmacological treatments to be prescribed that would not be feasible without dialysis and could even improve myocardial and kidney function (Strength of Recommendation C).","1986":"Atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disease, develops prematurely in CKD (Strength of Recommendation B). The performance of tests for the diagnosis of subclinical atherosclerosis and systemic inflammation should therefore be considered in these patients. - Patients with CKD are at high risk of vascular disease, implying the need for goal-based treatment of the vascular risk factors. - In this context, imaging tests for the diagnosis of subclinical atherosclerosis can be considered with the goal of individualizing treatment decisions on the management of cardiovascular risk factors when the patient is no longer receiving treatment consistent with the maximum risk level (Strength of Recommendation C). - The presence of subclinical atherosclerosis would raise cardiovascular risk to the maximum level (Strength of Recommendation C). - Carotid artery ultrasound with determination of carotid intima- media thickness (CIMT) and the presence of atheromatous plaques would be the technique of choice for the assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in ACKD (Strength of Recommendation C). - C-reactive protein, measured by high-sensitivity assay (hs-CRP), is the only marker of inflammation used routinely in clinical practice. However, there is no evidence that routine determination of hs-CRP improves the outcomes of therapeutic decisions on cardiovascular protection in either the general population or ACKD population. Therefore, routine CRP determination cannot be recommended in patients with CKD to stratify their cardiovascular risk (Strength of Recommendation C).","1987":"The natural history of most chronic kidney diseases (CKD) indicates that glomerular filtration gradually declines over time, progressing to more advanced stages of kidney failure. Since the publication of the first studies by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study Group, numerous factors have been identified that can accelerate this progression. Some are dependent on the etiology, but other are common to all and may accelerate progression of kidney disease: Non-modifiable progression factors for CKD: - Etiology of kidney disease - Degree of initial kidney function - Gender - Age - Ethnicity\/Other genetic factors - Birth weight Modifiable progression factors for CKD: - Proteinuria - High blood pressure - Poor glycemic control in diabetes - Smoking - Obesity - Metabolic syndrome\/Insulin resistance - Dyslipidemia - Anemia - Metabolic factors (Ca\/P, uric acid) - Use of nephrotoxic drugs. Therapeutic intervention on these factors has shown that it reduce the rate of progression of CKD (Strength of Recommendation A).There is no clear evidence that correction of these factors slows CKD (Strength of Recommendation C), although it has been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk at other levels.","1988":"The prevalence of CKD in Spain is 11%, with a high rate of associated vascular risk factors and a progressive increase in the number of patients requiring kidney replacement therapy, estimated at 5-8% annually. This has made CKD one of the leading health, social and economic problems for the health care systems of all developed countries. Kidney replacement therapy, although adequate, is not optimal for solving this clinical problem. The key aspects of the problem are: The increase in the number of patients with CKD due to: Early vascular injury as a result of the inflammatory process associated with CKD. Aging of the population, although CKD may be more dependent on comorbidities than age \"per se\", and prevalence may therefore not have the expected increase. The epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. CKD is the major vascular risk factor both in the general and hypertensive population or patients with established vascular injury. The estimated cost of care of stage 1-4 CKD per year can be 1.6-2.4 times more than kidney replacement therapy. The approach to this serious social and health problem is based on: Early detection and diagnosis of CKD by estimation of glomerular filtration rate and assessment of associated risk factors. Establishment of treatment goals for control of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus,) and albuminuria to reduce the rate of progression of kidney disease. Joint approach to problem by primary care physicians and other specialists caring for patients at high cardiovascular risk. Establishment of criteria for referral to nephrology departments.","1989":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD), like other chronic diseases, is a serious public health problem because of both its high incidence and prevalence and its significant morbidity and mortality and socioeconomic cost. Advanced chronic kidney disease (ACKD) includes stages 4 and 5 of the CKD classification. It is defined as chronic kidney disease in which there is a severe reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR &lt; 30 ml\/min). The treatment goals are to reduce and treat the complications associated with chronic kidney failure and to prepare the patient adequately and sufficiently in advance for kidney replacement therapy. The prevalence of ACKD is 0.2-0.6% of the adult population. This prevalence increases with age and in Spain is 1.6% in persons older than 64 years. - CKD is easily detected in clinical practice with simple tests (GFR estimated by equations based on serum creatinine, albuminuria and urine sediment) (Strength of Recommendation B). - It is recommended to detect the presence of CKD in all persons older than 60 years or with hypertension, diabetes or cardiovascular disease (Strength of Recommendation B). - Early detection and appropriate referral to the nephrology of patients with ACKD improves long-term morbidity and reduces costs for both the patient and the health care system (Strength of Recommendation B). Adequate communication and coordination between the primary care and nephrology is essential for this early detection: - Referral to nephrology should be made based on the stage of CKD, age of the patient, rate of progression of kidney failure, degree of albuminuria and presence or appearance of early warning signs.All patients with CKD stages 4-5 should be referred to nephrology (Strength of Recommendation C). - A protocol should be established in each health area for joint follow-up between primary care and nephrology (Strength of Recommendation C). - The creation of multidisciplinary ACKD units including a nephrologist, nephrology nurse, dietitian and social worker allows an integrated approach to the different aspects of management of patients with ACKD and is cost-effective (Strength of Recommendation B).","1990":"","1991":"","1992":"","1993":"","1994":"","1995":"","1996":"","1997":"","1998":"","1999":"","2000":"","2001":"","2002":"","2003":"","2004":"","2005":"To compare tooth loss (TL) in ESRD (ESRD DM) and non-ESRD (DM) type 2 diabetic patients.

The aim of this study was to analyze the observance to these guidelines in patients with a glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml\/min\/1,73m2 not yet included in dialysis in a Spanish multicenter cohort. A questionnaire by investigator\/centre was completed by 32 different nephrologists participating in the OSERCE study and representing the overall Spanish public health net. We observed that biochemical parameters were measured less frequently than recommended, except in CKD stage 3. The therapeutic goals for intact PTH were not properly reported by 59 % of the consulted nephrologists for stages 3 and 4, whereas only 22% did not report them properly for stage 5. The goals for phosphorus were not adequately reported in 50 % of cases (stages 3 y 4) and 60 % (stage 5). For calcium, these values were 70 %, 73.3 % and 65.5 % for stages 3, 4 and 5, respectively. A corrected plasma calcium between 9.5 and 10.2 mg\/dl is still considered adequate for 31%. As much as 87% nephrologists stated that they did not sistematically measure calcidiol plasma levels. In general, these results demonstrate that there is a great degree of unawareness of K\/DOQITM predialysis guidelines. Thus, their poor implementation is probably not only due to the lower availability of approved therapeutic agents, the difficult achievement of goals or the disbelief on current recommendations. It would be desirable that forthcoming guidelines such as the KDIGO could also consider the need of educational efforts for CKD-Mineral and Bone Disorder.","2007":"The use of central catheters in hemodialysis patients as a permanent vascular access has increased during the last years, reaching numbers of around 7% of prevalent patients and between 25% of incident patients. Although the current catheters allow higher sanguineous flows with smaller incidence of infectious complications and dysfunction, the dose of dialysis that is reached is still inferior to that obtained with native arterio-venous fistula (AVF) and grafts. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible additional time supposed by dialysis using central venous catheters with respect to habitual vascular access as a consequence of the lesser blood flow (Qb) and the irregularity of its function (frequent lowering of the Qb and necessity of inverting the lines on many occasions). A total of 48 patients (31 men\/17 women) with an average age of 61,6 +\/- 14 years old (rank: 28-83), 20 with tunnelled catheter and the remaining with AVF, were included in the study. All the patients were dialyzed in the modality of high flux hemodialysis with a polisulphone of 1,9 m2 dialyzer, dialysis time of 240 minutes, dialysate flow 500 ml\/min and monitors equipped with ionic dialysance (ID) with the objective of obtaining a Kt of 45 litres with each one of the different vascular accesses. The patients with AVF received 3 sessions, with variations of Qb to 300, 350 and 400 ml\/min. The patients with tunnelled catheter received two sessions, to the maximum Qb, one with normal connection and other with inverted one. In the results obtained it is possible to emphasize that only the patients with AVF and 400 ml\/min reached the objective of 45 L of Kt. The patients with AVF needed to increase 12 minutes of hemodialysis with a Qb of 350 ml\/min and 28 minutes with a Qb of 300 ml\/min; the catheters on normal position needed to increase 24 minutes and finally in the inverted catheters an increase of 59 minutes was necessary to reach the same Kt objective. We concluded that the patients dialyzed with central catheters on average needed to increase by 30 minutes the time of dialysis if the catheter worked in a normal position but 60 minutes if the arterio-venous lines were inverted so as to reach the minimum dose of dialysis.","2008":null,"2009":"The aim of this study was to assess the rate of patients attended in cardiology outpatient clinics in whom microalbumine or glomerular filtration rate had been determined, at least once, in the previous 12 months.

Epidemiological, anthropometric, analytic and electrocardiographic data were recruited. Glomerular filtration rate was calculated thereafter by means of the simplified equation of the MDRD. Results. Microalbumine was determined in 34% of the patients, of those 49% had positive microalbumine. Microalbumine rates were higher in patients with diabetes, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral artery disease or serum creatinine levels &gt; 1.3 mg\/dl.

","2010":"Several studies show that cross-transmission of germs among patients under dialysis can occur as a consequence of processes in which the dialysis machine participates. The need of vascular access and lengthy periods of extracorporeal circulation increases the vulnerability to infection from nearby microorganisms. This study is intended to analyze the structural and dynamic features of the cross-transmission network generated by the propagation of germs which are capable of contaminating the hemodialyzers. The simulation was carried out in a Dialysis Unit equipped with 19 machines for 62 patients. One of these patients was randomly chosen and considered as a carrier of an infectious agent capable of being transmitted to other patients, by means of the shared use of the same dialysis machine. For 10 days, the patient-machine allocation couples were registered. Co-occurrence matrices were elaborated and processed with the program UCINET 6.1 for social network analysis. Graphs were designed to visualize the networks of contagion, the centrality measures were calculated and the dynamic performance of the network generated by the chaining of the successive exposures of machines and patients was studied. The simulation let us visualize a rapid expansion of the risk of contagion of patients and contamination of machines. In 10 days, 87,09% of patients could have been exposed to the infection, and 68,42% of the machines could have been contaminated. These figures supposes that 5,4 new patients and 1,3 new machines could be potentially exposed every day. Along the first 5 days, the daily rate of exposure for patients and machines remains relatively low (3 new exposed patients and 1,2 new exposed machines every day). But the speed with witch the risk of contagion spreads, increases drastically in the last 5 days (7,8 new exposed patients every day). The fact that each patient requires at least 3 weekly sessions of dialysis and that a different machine can be allocated to him in each session explains that the risk of exposure can spread in some few days to a lot of patients and machines. It can also explain the difficulties found by the researches in identifying the responsible source of the origin of the sero-conversion outbreaks studied by the moment. If a germ can be transmitted from patient to patient by means of the incidental contamination of a dialysis machine, the appearance of an infected patient in a dialysis unit generates a risk of exposition that spreads quickly among other patients. Few days after an infected patient gets a dialysis session, it cannot be ruled out that most of the patients have been exposed to contagion and most of the machines exposed to contamination. ","2011":"Vancomycin is widely used in haemodialysis (HD) patients for treating infections of vascular access due to St. Aureus. To avoid subtherapeutic levels it is important to know the adequate dosing in patients undergoing haemodialysis with high flux membranes. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HD patients treated with 1 g intravenous (IV) vancomycin reached optimum plasma levels. In a crossover design we studied 28 chronic HD patients, 3 times a week, treated with vancomycin between 15\/2\/2006 and 14\/2\/2007. Antibiotic was given at dose of 1 g during the last hour of dialysis session. Plasma levels of vancomycin were measured immediately before next HD (preHD1) and after (postHD1), and prior to the beginning of the second next session (preHD2). We evaluated age, sex, dry height, week Kt\/V and the type of membrane used. Of 28 patients, 5 were analysed 3 times, 2 were analysed twice and 9 were analysed once . There were 43 samples, 19 men (44,2%) and 24 women (55,8%), with a mean age of 70 +\/- 8,4 years. 1 g dose is equivalent to &gt; 15 mg\/kg in 31 patients (72,1%) and &lt; 15 mg\/kg in 12 (27,9%). The type of membrane used was high flux polyetersulfone (PES-AP) (44,2%), eval (7%), medium-low polyetersulfone (PES-BP) (32,5%) and polyacrylonitrile (16,3%). PreHD1 mean concentration results for the total population was 7,06 mg\/ml, being 16,3% bellow optimum levels. There were not difference between patients treated with dose &gt; 15 mg\/kg (7,5 mg\/ml) and &lt; 15 mg\/kg (6 m\/ml). When the dose administered was &gt; 15 mg\/kg, 6,45% results were subtherapeutic, whereas if the dose was &lt; 15 mg\/kg, 41,67% values were bellow optimum levels (p&lt;0,05). With regard to the dialyzers used, the lowest concentrations were observed with PES-AP (5,95 mg\/ml) and the highest values were observed with PES-BP (7,27 mg\/ml) (p no significance). No patient using PES-BP versus 31,58% patients using PES-AP showed suboptimum values (p&gt; or =0,07). All postHD1 and preHD2 results were in subtherapeutic range (mean values, dose &gt; and &lt; 15 mg\/kg and all types of membrane). Based on the above results, the vancomycin dosing schedule of 1 g IV every 5-7 days is not recommended for patients undergoing haemodialysis with high flux membranes. Since there are not guidelines for handling this antibiotic in these patients our findings suggest that it may be necessary to monitorize predialysis plasma levels to avoid subtherapeutic values. ","2012":"The Spanish Society of Nephrology \"Quality in Nephrology Working Group\" (QNWG) was created in 2002. The aims of this group are the identification, diffusion, implementation and consolidation of a systematic, objective and comprehensive set of quality performance measures (QPMs) to help along the improvement of patient care and outcomes on hemodialysis, by means of strategies of feedback and benchmarking, and the design of quality improvement projects. The objective of this study is to present the preliminary results of a set of quality performance measures obtained in a group of Spanish hemodialysis centers, as well as to evaluate the repercussion of the application of the aforementioned thecniques on the observed results. During 2007 a total of 28 hemodialysis units participated in the study; 2516 patients were evaluated. A specific software was designed and used to facilitate the calculation of CPMs in each unit. The clinical indicators used refered to dialysis adequacy; anemia; mineral metabolisme; nutrition; viral infections; vascular access; mortality, morbidity (number and days of hospital admissions); and renal transplant. Every three months each center received its own data and its comparison with the rest of the group. Except for hemoglobin levels we observed a global improvement.

Psychological disorders (depression, anxiety, and others) are associated to an increased morbidity, directly acting upon treatment course, subsequent treatment failure, and personal perception of one's own state of health. Individual factors (sex, lifestyles, health and dietary habits, spirituality, financial and family situation, personal skills for coping with disease, cultural level, and social status) condition morbidity in these patients, and the course and complications of peritoneal dialysis.

For the purposes of the study we designed a questionnaire comprising 50 closed-ended items and one open response item. The questionnaire was sent to 104 hospitals and was completed by 78.84% of them (n &gt; or = 82). The average of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the hospitals under study was 27.6: 15.8 of them receiving Chronic Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) and 11.8 Automatic Peritoneal Dialysis (APD). The questionnaire also served to investigate into the training methodology used in the different units, the involvement of the family in the programme, the basic knowledge patients received about Chronic Renal Insufficiency, the procedures associated with the therapy and the preparation they obtained to solve small-scale contingencies and emergency situations as well as the improvement of their quality of life. We also evaluated the training programme of autonomous patients on DPD and at the end of the questionnaire a blank space was left for facilities to add any comments or suggestions they considered relevant. From the results obtained we may conclude that most Spanish hospitals have devised a training planning for patients undergoing PD which helps them or caregivers to perform domiciliary treatment safely, provides them with basic knowledge about the disease and the routine procedures associated with the treatment, enables them to cope with contingencies and emergency situations and improves their quality of life during the dialysis period.","2021":"Glycopeptides have been the antimicrobials most commonly used for infections by Gram-positive organisms and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In recent years, however, glycopeptide resistance and tolerance have become a serious problem. Thus, enterococci highly resistant to vancomycin, vancomycin-intermediate\/ resistant S. aureus (VISA), and vancomycin tolerance in S. aureus are found, and increased therapeutic failure and mortality are clinically reported with vancomycin MIC for S. aureus &gt; or = 1.5-2 microg\/mL. When faced with these organisms, we therefore need potent bactericidal antimicrobials that may be empirically administered, effective against susceptible and resistant pathogens, easily dosed, with few adverse effects and no significant interaction with other drugs, and that can be administered in an outpatient setting. In bacteremia by methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, use of vancomycin is associated to a greater failure and mortality rate as compared to semisynthetic penicillins. New treatment options for MRSA infections include daptomycin, linezolid, tygecycline, and quinupristin\/dalfopristin. New anti-MRSA drugs are also under development, including glycopeptides (dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin), ceftobiprole, and iclaprim.

Cardiac Troponins (Tn) are today the most specific biomarkers for myocardial damage, although they may be elevated in situations other than the Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Its elevation is mandatory to diagnose AMI, although other simultaneous factors are necessary for the diagnosis. In any patient with a clinical presentation compatible with ACS any increase in Tn indicates AMI and high risk, thus conditioning more aggressive treatment. In CRF cardiac Tn are elevated at baseline in a variable magnitude and in a different percentage of patients according to the degree of renal failure and the number of risk factors which favour such elevation. The reasons for it are not clear. Nevertheless, the clinical interpretation and attitude when there is a suspicion of ACS must be the same in the general population and in patients with CRF. In case of doubt serial samples of Tn may be useful to suggest myocardial damage. On the other side, in asymptomatic patients with or without CRF its elevation at baseline seems to be an independent marker of risk for both global and cardiac mortality. Despite the probability of basal elevation of Tn in patients with CRF, its routine measurement is not recommended neither to compare it with the value obtained in a situation of suspicion of ACS, because the serial samples obtained during the event give more accurate information, nor for stratification of mortality risk, because there is no data to confirm that a therapeutic intervention or an aggressive diagnostic measure based on chronic elevations of Tn are useful. In the general population both TnI and TnT give similar information, but in patients with CRF TnT is clearly preferred.","2023":"Patients on peritoneal dialysis account for approximately 10% of individuals on dialysis and are very variably distributed throughout Spain, with a national mean of 47 procedures per million inhabitants. The high incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients on peritoneal dialysis is determined by the almost universal presence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) and other risk factors secondary to uremia and the inflammatory process associated to atherosclerotic disease. The concomitant presence in clinical practice of highly diverse heart diseases in these patients makes relevant a number of considerations from the cardiological viewpoint that may be of interest for specialists in nephrology. This review analyzes some aspects of four cardiological conditions that are very common in patients on peritoneal dialysis: heart failure, coronary heart disease, valve involvement, and atrial fibrillation.","2024":"Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is one of the most important complications in kidney transplant patients because it has a significant impact on graft and patient survival. Diagnosis of PTDM should be based on the American Diabetic Association criteria. Recent studies show the value of performing an oral glucose tolerance test in all patients. Multiple risk factors promote PTDM. PTDM incidence may be reduced by controlling modifiable factors (immunosuppression, obesity, infections...). According to RMRC data, patients on peritoneal dialysis are younger, but have a greater incidence rate of dyslipidemia and obesity. Recent data suggest that subclinical information, adiponectin, and ghrelin may be a significant pathogenetic factor in development of insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus. There is no clear evidence that the dialysis procedure influences the subclinical inflammatory state and adipocytokines. According to data from the Spanish group for the study of PTDM, a relationship exists between ghrelin levels and sex in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The most common metabolic complication in patients on peritoneal dialysis is hyperglycemia. Pre-transplant hyperglycemia promotes the occurrence of PTDM. There is no clear evidence in the literature showing that the dialysis procedure is a risk factor for the occurrence of PTDM. Additional multicenter studies are required to analyze the clinical and biological characteristics of renal patients and their relationship to PTDM.","2025":"It is well known that the existence of residual renal function (RRF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) is related, amongst others, to improved results in nutrition, cardiovascular morbidity, and technique and patient survival. It appears natural to think that this fact, obvious in the population who starts replacement therapy, should also occur in dialysis patients in whom RRF depends on a transplant, which could justify maintenance of immunosuppressive treatment (IST). However, there are currently no studies showing a correlation between RRF of the graft and survival on dialysis. At the same time, IST maintenance in an attempt to preserve glomerular filtration rate would involve risks (cardiovascular morbidity, infections, etc.) that could counteract the theoretical beneficial effect on RRF or even worsen prognosis. The available literature analyzing this controversy is scarce and is mostly based on small and retrospective series providing conflicting results. The decision about what to do with IST and how to do it in patients with chronic kidney transplant dysfunction arriving to dialysis should be based on opinions. When faced with this situation, and because of the significant negative effects of IST at cardiovascular and infectious level, the main causes of morbidity and mortality in uremic patients, we advocate discontinuation of IST when PD is started until future studies on the subject are available.","2026":"The growing number of kidney patients who have to restart dialysis after functional failure of a kidney transplant has brought to this context the general controversy on dialysis modality selection criteria. These should be applied from a longterm perspective, since each patient may benefit more from one treatment or another at different times in his clinical course. When the issue is analyzed from a general perspective, peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis seem to provide similar results in renal transplant patients, although the available information is still insufficient. The crucial prognostic nature of residual renal function in incident patients on peritoneal dialysis brings up the issue of wether it is appropriate to maintain some type of immunosuppression after restarting dialysis, at least until total failure of graft function. This decision is currently based on purely empirical considerations, since we do not have reliable information to answer the key questions. Thus, we do not know if residual renal function has the same importance in this context as in the overall renal population. Neither if withdrawal of maintenance of immunosuppression will presumably have the same effect in all cases. The side effects of maintaining partial immunosuppression and the overall clinical yield for the patient are also not well defined. Finally, it is unclear what immunosuppression should be maintained, although there is agreement that it should be lowgrade; steroids and to lesser extent calcineurin inhibitors are the preferred agents, but always on empirical grounds. Because of the growing importance of this subpopulation of renal patients, these questions should be answered in a systematic manager in coming years.","2027":"The derivation of the first human embryonic stem cell lines as well as the notion of the unexpected plasticity and potential of the adult stem cells has significantly impacted the biomedical research. Many of the tissues long believe to lack any regenerative capacity has demonstrated otherwise. Patients alike physicians expectations for treatment of incurable diseases have also fuelled this field and in occasions have led to unrealistic expectations. In the next pages I review some of the tissue specific stem cells that have been used either in preclinical models or even in clinical research. Despite the effort of numerous investigators, more questions that answers remain in the field of cell therapy and only careful and independent -not biased- research will allow us to translate some of this findings into clinical application.","2028":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are the most used therapies for endstage renal disease (ESRD). Peritoneal dialysis offers the advantages of long, slow, continuous ultrafiltration and preserve residual renal function (RRF) one of the most important factors affecting outcomes in PD. In contrast, HD offers superior solute removal but with undesirable cardiovascular tolerance of high rates of sodium and water removal. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents an effective way to maintain residual renal function and should be the first choice dialysis technique. However, with the loss of RRF, some limitations of PD alone in controlling the uremic state appear. Combination of the two techniques therapies, PD + HD (also called bimodal dialysis BMD), is the simplest way to deal with these limitations. The general prescription for BMD should be 5-6 days of PD and 1 or 2 HD sessions weekly. One of the most important controversy is how to evaluate the adequacy of the combined treatment: some Authors adopted the equivalent renal clearance (EKR), first transforming the weekly PD adequacy index (Kt\/V), and then evaluating total clearance from both modalities. However, the EKR may overestimate the dialysis dose. Thus to accurately track dialysis dose some use the total effluent (PD, RRF, and HD) sampling method to yield Kt\/Vef and creatinine clearance (CCref).","2029":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment has been related to functional and structural changes in peritoneum. The biocompatibility of the PD fluids is one of the most important factors related to this complication. New solutions for PD have been developed in an effort to reduce the bioincompatibility of conventional glucose containing, lactate-buffered solutions, and thereby to improve the clinical outcomes of PD. The use of new manufacturing techniques, buffer presentation, and new osmotic alternatives to glucose (amino acids, icodextrin) have allowed potentially improved peritoneal survival (in terms of structure and function) and improved subjective patient experience. Additional benefits have also included enhanced management of salt and water removal, supported nutritional status and improvement in the systemic metabolic derangements associated with conventional PD treatment, based on glucose-containing lactate-buffered solutions. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown the biocompatibility of these new solutions to be superior to that of standard solutions. This review summarized the characteristics of the next generation of PD fluids currently available and analyzed the potential benefits related to the combination of the different elements.","2030":"Multiple investigations performed on peritoneal pathophysiology during peritoneal dialysis (PD) suggest that intraperitoneal heparin might modify most of the causes of membrane deterioration. The actions described favouring this idea are: 1) Peritoneal Chronic inflammation alters peritoneal function and hepraine has anti-inflammatory properties. 2) Peritoneal fibrosis related to peritoneal dialysis or traumatic injury may be avoided or limited with heparin. 3) Heparine induces tPA synthesis by mesothelial cells, which represents a potentiation of fibrinolytic action. 4) Heparine, specifically low-molecular weight heparin, inhibits angiogenesis. 5) Intraperitoneal heparin favors the removal of advanced glycosilation end products in PD. 6) Animal models and clinical studies with small series of patients have demonstrated an improvement of peritoneal function with intraperitoneal heparine use. 7) Until now, no adverse effects of the intraperitoneal heparin use have been found. In consequence, it is a plausible hypothesis to consider that intraperitoneal heparin may favourably modify peritoneal function in patients under peritoneal dialysis.","2031":"Preservation of residual renal function (RRF) after the start of peritoneal dialysis (PD) is essential for both patient and technique survival. Nephroprotection methods of proven efficacy in chronic renal failure may maintain their efficacy after the start of dialysis. This study shows that candesartan, at doses ranging from 16 and 32 mg\/day, is well tolerated in normotensive patients on PD and reduces progression of renal failure from 8 mL\/min\/year in the pre-dialysis period to 2 mL\/min\/year after PD start. Proteinuria is also decreased to a half at the end of the first year, with no harmful effects seen on anemia control. It is concluded that angiotensin receptor blockade should be maintained after the start of PD, irrespective of blood pressure control, in order to reduce RRF impairment in these patients.","2032":"Residual renal function (RRF) contributes to the quality of life of patients on dialysis through the better solutes clearances, fluid removal, less degree of anemia, better calcium-phosphorus control, better nutrition and removal of other uremic toxins. The preservation of RRF is associated with higher patient survival in peritoneal dialysis (PD), and is now accepted that RRF and peritoneal clearance are not of equal value in patient survival. This review studies the factors that contribute to the reduction or loss of RRF in PD patients and the medical measures to avoid it. The decline of RRF has been associated with age, inflammation\/nutrition status, peritonitis rate, renal function and transport type at PD initiation, ESRD aetiology, and associated comorbidity. Cardiovascular disease before and during PD has been related with loss of RRF. Volume overload and high blood pressure on one side, and dehydration and some drugs on the other side, can facilitate the decline of RRF. Use of antihypertensive agents as angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers could preserve RRF. Still is on debate the influence of PD modality (manual or automated), with some more arguments for better preservation with continuous ambulatory PD. The employ of more biocompatible solutions seems to have a positive effect on RRF, but more evidence is still needed. Avoiding the mentioned factors and applying preventive measures we can preserve RRF and increase the well-being of PD patients.","2033":"Over the last years, a large amount of experimental and clinical evidence has been accumulated that supports the existence of interactions between the decline in residual renal function, hydration status, inflammatory states and functional and structural deterioration of the peritoneal membrane in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis. These interactions are complex and remain far from being fully understood, but each one of these alterations appears to be capable of aggravating the harmful effects of the others, clearly affecting the probabilities of survival of these patients. Preservation of residual renal function and functional capacity of the peritoneal membrane, together with other measures to prevent overhydration and reduce the intensity of inflammatory phenomena, are essential mechanisms for risk prevention in these patients, and should be addressed from a joint perspective. New peritoneal dialysis solutions, apparently more biocompatible, could play an essential role in the achievement of these objectives.","2034":"Salt intake in XXI century in an average person exceeds 10-15 grams per day. The key organ responsible for sodium regulation is kidney and renal failure patients present with positive sodium balance. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients rising hypertension is often connected with volume overload and sodium retention. The reasons for inadequate sodium removal in PD patients are: too small gradient between standard 134 mmol\/l sodium PD solutions, sodium seiving effect and lack of residual renal function. APD patients are at higher risk of sodium overload in comparison to CAPD ones. As it has been shown that a degree of sodium removal correlates with survival, sodium management appears to be crucial in these patients. The concept of low sodium solutions has been developed over the years with single-dwell ultra-low solutions and recently with low sodium balance solution given as a continuous treatment in CAPD patients. Preliminary results show that low sodium solutions may be a safe and viable option of treatment of PD patients with sodium and fluid overload.","2035":"A high glucose concentration is shared by peritoneal dialysis (PD) and diabetes mellitus (DM). High glucose leads to tissue injury in diabetes. Peritoneal dialysis research has emphasized the role of glucose degradation products in tissue injury. Apoptosis induction is one of the mechanisms of tissue injury induced both by glucose and glucose degradation products. We now review the role of apoptosis and its regulation by glucose degradation products in antibacterial defense and loss of renal function in diabetes mellitus and peritoneal dialysis. The pathogenic role of the recently identified glucose degradation product 3,4-di-deoxyglucosone- 3-ene (3,4-DGE) is detailed. Available therapeutic strategies include the use of peritoneal dialysis solutions containing a low concentration of glucose degradation products. Based on preclinical results, specific targeting of apoptosis regulatory factor should be explored in the clinical setting.","2036":"The studies performed with human peritoneal biopsies of peritoneal dialysis -patients have demonstrated that exposure to peritoneal dialysis fluid induce peritoneal deterioration. The main alterations of peritoneal membrane are fibrosis and angiogenesis that ends with the failure of the ultrafiltration capacity of the peritoneal membrane. These studies are descriptivist and scarcely help to investigate the mechanisms and stages involved on the process. Therefore, it is necessary to supply the deficiencies presented by the studies with patients. The experimental models have strongly contributed to the knowledge of the pathologic process that is induced by the continuous exposition of the peritoneal membrane to the dialysis fluids. Most of the peritoneal dialysis studies use the rat as the experimental animal. Due to the difficulty of working with small animals, few studies have been done in mice. However, models in mice offers great advantages, as long as they allow us to employ different strains and genetically modified animals. We have recently developed an experimental model in mouse of exposure of the peritoneal membrane to dialysis fluids, which resembles the process of peritoneal damage that take place during peritoneal dialysis treatment in human patients.","2037":"Ultrafiltration failure is the most frequent alteration of peritoneal transport in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and is a frequent cause of technical withdrawal. At the beginning of the therapy, there is a great functional diversity, but alter the third or fourth years the 20% of patients develop progressive ultrafiltration failure and an increase of the small solute transport. In parallel to this functional alteration, the peritoneum of PD patients shows morphological alterations, such as loss or transformation of mesothelial cells, basal membrane reduplication, submesothelial fibrosis, hyalinazing vasculopathy and neoangiogenesis. There are scant comparative studies of morphofunctional correlation. Most of them have been reported on long-term PD patients and showed a progressive increase of fibrosis and vasculopathy with time on PD, specially in patients with ultrafiltration failure and in those with sclerosing peritonitis. The peritoneal vessel number do not always increase with time on PD, and it is associated with advanced ultrafiltration failure. Some short-term studies have demonstrated that the initial lesion related to the high small solute peritoneal transport is the epithelial to mesenchimal transition of the mesothelial cell (the transformation of mesothelial cell into fibroblastic cell). The higher secretion of extracellular matrix and vascular endothelial growth factor by the transformed mesothelial cells should participated on later development of fibrosis and high peritoneal permeability, not always in relation with higher number of peritoneal vessels.","2038":"During last years, the number of patients who have been continuously treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) for over 5 or 10 years has markedly increased. Sclerosing syndromes and membrane failure are the most common complications that are now currently observed in long-term PD patients. Exposure to conventional PD fluids (PDFs) with poor biocompatibility induces a kind of &lt;&lt;chemical peritonitis&gt;&gt; in response of bad &lt;&lt;biotolerance&gt;&gt;. Theperitoneal fibroblasts, mesothelial cells and especially endothelial cells function as a filtration barrier, but also control intraperitoneal inflammation as well as leukocytes and macrophages.Peritoneal exposure to conventional poorly biocompatible PDFs which combine non-physiological pH, high glucose concentrations,and high levels of glucose degradation products (GDPs), is associated with an accelerated peritoneal aging. Heat sterilization of PDFs induces the formation of GDPs which are involved in the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).Glucose, GDPs and AGEs participate to the peritoneal membrane failure and aging. AGEs via RAGE (receptor for AGEs) are involved in human peritoneal mesothelial cell (HPMC) activation.In the present work, we summarize our previous in vitro works regarding mesothelial RAGE implication in the peritoneal membrane aging. Two periods of aging are distinguished: i) early peritoneal changes related to mesothelial cell activation and loss, ii)late membrane alteration correlated to submesothelial fibrosis and neovascularization.","2039":"","2040":"","2041":"The European Society of Hypertension and European Society of Cardiology guidelines published in 2007 include recommendations for the treatment of arterial hypertension (HT) in special situations. Such special situations include elderly patients, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, HT in women, metabolic syndrome, refractory HT, hypertensive emergencies, and malignant HT. The aim of these guidelines is primarily educational rather than prescriptive. Each section of the guidelines includes a series of recommendations that attempt to offer guidance on the best approach in this type of patients. We summarize the recommendations made in each section of these guidelines.","2042":"Arterial hypertension is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases such as heart failure, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease and cerebrovascular events. Adequate blood pressure control is vital for the management of patients with vascular disease. New therapeutic alternatives are appearing on the horizon to improve the degree of blood pressure control in these patients, such as direct renin inhibitors, beta-blockers with additional properties, carotid receptor- stimulating devices and vaccination against arterial hypertension. Direct renin inhibitors are a new family of antihypertensive drugs that have so far shown a good antihypertensive effect and an additive effect on reduction of proteinuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. Recent meta-analyses suggest that betablockers used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated arterial hypertension could have a less beneficial effect on the development of cardiovascular disease than other antihypertensive drugs. However, the emergence of new subtypes of beta-blockers with other hemodynamic and metabolic properties could change this conception. Carotid receptor-stimulating devices and vaccination against arterial hypertension, although not totally new therapies, are being revitalized, with preliminary results that suggest that they could be used for the treatment of arterial hypertension in patients with a specific profile. Although scientifically stimulating, the long-term beneficial effects of these new therapeutic alternatives on target-organ protection still need to be confirmed.","2043":"The 2007 European Guidelines on Hypertension are jointly sponsored by the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension. Changes with respect to the previous 2003 Guidelines are few but some are significant. Perhaps the most significant change is inclusion of metabolic syndrome as a cardiovascular risk factor similar in importance to diabetes mellitus or target-organ damage. Also striking is the recognition of chronic kidney disease as a very high risk condition in hypertensive patients. Masked arterial hypertension (AHT) is included for the first time as a new entity that is present in 10-15% of cases and associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The eye fundus examination is no longer considered necessary in the diagnostic evaluation. The decision to start treatment should be based on systolic and diastolic BP values and on assessment of total cardiovascular risk. Drug therapy should be started early. The delay to check the response to nonpharmacological measures should be only some weeks and not months as was previously established. Any of the five large groups (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II blockers) is valid for the first stage of treatment, although the choice should be individualized based on the possible risk factors and associated cardiovascular and renal disease. The guidelines place strong emphasis on drug combinations because most patients will require more than one drug for their control.","2044":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health problem worldwide, not only because of the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) but also because of the high risk of morbidity and mortality, especially from cardiovascular disease. In recent years, the epidemiological relevance of CKD has not only raised the interest of nephrologists, but of other areas of medicine and in particular of primary care. The primary objectives of this presentation are to assess the impact that CKD has had in recent years as an epidemiological problem in the primary care setting and to describe the strategies that will be used to try to address this problem. Knowledge of the most relevant factors affecting kidney function with age, and specifically glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is essential for defining the patient group at most risk of mortality, cardiovascular complications and progression to ESKD, thereby facilitating overall and individualized management of these patients. Fortunately, we already have clarifying consensus guidelines on a national scale to address this problem jointly. CKD in a mortality amplifying factor, not only in patients with cardiovascular disease but also in patients with chronic infections and in cancer patients. In this regard, the new KDIGO guidelines place particular emphasis on the need to assess renal function in these patients and to perform vigorous cardioprotection from the initial stages of CKD.","2045":"The fight against chronic kidney disease is one of the most relevant aspects of nephrological practice, from both the perspective of clinical activity and research within the field of nephrology. In this brief article, we present in very summarized form some of the aspects in this field in the last year that the authors found of interest. Because the content of the next few pages was necessarily chosen on the basis of the authors' preferences, we assume that many other topics of great interest have been left out of this summary. In any case, we hope that this article will be interesting and useful and also serve as an subject of debate in nephrology forums.","2046":"In this article some of the novelties published in 2007 on epidemiological aspects of chronic kidney disease are reviewed. Specifically, some studies on the suitability of current methods for measurement of glomerular filtration rate, the estimated current prevalence of chronic kidney disease and the influence of age and NSAIDs on progression of this disease are discussed. Finally, various recent publications on the role of chronic kidney disease as a cardiovascular risk factor are summarized.","2047":"We reviewed the literature in 2007 on 3 groups of systemic diseases affecting the kidney: lupic nephropathy (LN), small vessel vasculitis (SVV) and renal amyloidosis. A systematic review of 268 patients with LN pooled from 4 studies found that mycophenolic acid (MPA) in the induction phase caused more remissions and achieved greater renal survival than cyclophosphamide (CP), confirming it as a valid alternative to CP. Using a protocol including rituximab and MPA in the induction phase (14 days), MPA alone without corticoids is effective and safe in the maintenance phase. Rituximab has also been successfully used in CP-resistant forms of LN, where it reduces clinical activity and mesangial proliferation. Plasma exchanges achieve better results than bolus corticoids in SVS with severe renal failure. Complications are severe. Anti- TNF-alpha agents provide no benefit in this indication. Prolonged administration of low-dose corticoids reduces the incidence of relapses. MPA is an alternative to CP if this drug cannot be administered. Good results are achieved with rituximab in CP-resistant forms. According to a controlled trial, treatment of AL amyloidosis with dexamethasone and melphalan has equivalent results to highdose melphalan and rescue with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. In AA amyloidosis, eprosidate slows the rate of progression of renal failure.","2048":"The most relevant articles published in the field of glomerular disease in 2008 are reviewed in this study. They mostly deal with membranous nephropathy and IgA nephropathy. Regarding treatment of membranous nephropathy presenting with nephrotic syndrome and normal renal function, the good remission rates and excellent long-term renal survival of cyclophosphamide and prednisone are confirmed. Cyclosporine A and tacrolimus are less aggressive options. Cyclosporine A was shown to be an effective alterative compared to alkylating agent and prednisone, whereas tacrolimus emerged as a solid alternative. Both share few side effects and high relapse rates. In cases of membranous nephropathy presenting with nephrotic syndrome and incipient renal failure, mycophenolate mofetil has a response rate comparable to cyclophosphamide and prednisone, but with a higher relapse rate. With regard to IgA nephropathy, the prognostic importance of histology and proteinuria was confirmed. Thus, the risk of progression can be well stratified by subdivision of Lee's classification from 5 to 3 classes. Proteinuria is another very important risk factor for progression and its reduction (partial remission) improves the prognosis. Over this last year, advances have been published in the field of noninvasive diagnosis of this entity and in this regard sub-galactosidate IgA levels are important. Regarding treatment, ACEIs (benazepril) have been shown to improve the prognosis in IgA nephropathy with proteinuria between 1-3 g\/day.","2049":"1. Epidemiological aspects: There is evidence that the pandemic of DM is entering a stabilization phase, with a slight downturn in the rates of ESRD attributed to DM in the United States. 2. New pathogenic and progression mechanisms of renal disease are proposed: 1) Intraglomerular hyperpressure with phenotypical cell changes, inducing TGF-beta activation; 2) Genetic polymorphisms, with candidate genes in chromosomes 18q, 3q, 7p and others; 3) Endothelial dysfunction as an injury initiating mechanism, demonstrated in the eNOS knockout rat; 4) Isoforms of PKC molecules that favor progression of nephropathy. 3. Importance of metabolic syndrome as a progression factor of chronic renal disease. 4. Increased CV risk in patients treated with thiazolidinediones (glitazones) -Hydrosaline retention and heart failure. 5. Recent studies: ADVANCE study: Combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor (perindropil) and a diuretic (indapamide) in fixed doses helps to reduce CV risk and overall mortality.DREAM study: Ramipril does not reduce the occurrence of DM2, but does improve reversion to normoglycemia. AVOID study: Direct renin inhibitors add greater antihypertensive and antiproteinuric efficacy. 6. New therapeutic targets: Antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antiproteinuric effects of sulodexide, isosorbide mononitrate, PKC inhibitors and others. 7. The most effective strategy continues to be intensive, multifactorial and multidisciplinary management of the type 2 diabetic patient, as shown by long-term follow-up in the Steno-2 study.","2050":"One of the topics of most concern for nephrologists today is how to reduce the mortality of our patients and we try to have markers to help us know which patients are at greatest risk. Cardiovascular disease is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease. Oxidative stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction have been recognized as nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors, but they are achieving growing importance. On the other hand, quality management systems are being applied on an increasing basis in routine clinical practice, demonstrating that the way of working in the center may be a key factor in the results obtained.","2051":"SUMMARY In most current hemodialysis (HD) units, two of the most significant problems are vascular access and the steady increase in incident elderly patients. Both are risk factors for morbidity and mortality that require frequent hospitalizations and have a very considerable health cost. The aim of this review is to show the most interesting studies published in 2007 on these two aspects. Regarding vascular access for hemodialysis, a very worrying fact is the progressive increase in incident and prevalent patients dialyzed with a permanent catheter, even though the catheter is a known risk factor of great morbidity and mortality. The dialysis units should have as their goals to reduce the percentage of catheters and to detect early arteriovenous fistulas at risk of thrombosis. In recent years, the incidence of patients of very advanced age is experiencing a notable increase. This type of patients has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The great challenge for nephrologists is know which patients can really benefit from dialysis treatment. Furthermore, this type of patients have different characteristics than the rest of the general dialysis population, which makes it necessary to adopt different clinical criteria.","2052":"New peritoneal dialysis solutions have attracted interest in recent years, as shown by the number of publications. Overall, the most salient aspects refer to the potential clinical benefits achieved using such solutions. Reports on such benefits are sometimes conflicting. The improved preservation of kidney function seen with a biocompatible bicarbonate solution is not seen with biocompatible lactate or bicarbonate\/lactate solutions. Lower CRP levels are seen with biocompatible solutions; however, other studies report similar levels. Peritoneal local inflammation parameters suggest that less inflammation occurs with new solutions as compared to the standard solutions. The decreased incidence of peritonitis achieved with a solution in the long term is not achieved with other solutions in the short term. There is no agreement as to whether UF is lower with biocompatible solutions, a well designed study did report a lower ultrafiltration (UF) with the new solutions. The higher the concentration of glucose degradation products in dialysis solutions, the higher will also be in peritoneal fluid and blood, as has brilliantly been reported. Also, the higher the concentration of glucose degradation products, the greater the generation of advanced glycosilation products. All authors conclude that further controlled studies are required to obtain more convincing evidence about the clinical benefits of the new solutions.","2053":"Sevelamer use has a high prevalence, and half of patients are treated with this noncalcium binder. Two randomized studies appeared in 2007 that compared the efficacy of sevelamer over calcium salts. In the more statistically potent of the two studies, no differences were found in mortality between the sevelamer and calcium groups, except for a benefit in favor of sevelamer in patients older than 65 years. In the other less statistically potent study, lower mortality was observed in the sevelamer group. Both studies have various deficiencies and a timely meta-analysis of the two studies appearing that same year concluded that there was no significant evidence demonstrating a superior efficacy of sevelamer over calcium salts. Therefore, generalized extension of its use as a first-line binder is not recommended. However, its use can be assessed in specific clinical situations. With regard to the cost-benefit ratio, as there is no evidence that greater clinical benefits are obtained with sevelamer than with calcium salts, prudence and moderation in its use are needed because of the high cost\/benefit ratio demonstrated. Otherwise, we will contribute to increasing the already very high treatment cost in these patients, with one of the highest costs per life year gained in medicine. The cost\/benefit ratio of sevelamer remains unattractive from an economic point of view, even if dialysis and transplant are excluded in these patients.","2054":"One of the most important problems faced by nephrologists is the high degree of cardiovascular mortality in patients on dialysis. This increase in cardiovascular disease has been associated with various factors, but, among them, hyperphosphatemia stands out particularly. The serum phosphate levels considered normal in these patients have gradually decreased in recent years. Therefore, phosphate control in the chronic kidney disease patient has become a challenge that has stimulated basic research in recent years. The aim of the following review is to bring together the most novel results presented in the last year, with emphasis on the methods for control of phosphate absorption, its elimination by the kidneys and vascular calcifications, which are one of the most serious direct consequences of hyperphosphatemia.","2055":"Hyperphosphatemia is a complication that appears in the early stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and that has been shown to have serious consequences in kidney disease patients. New phosphate regulators are currently being studied such as FGF- 23, a counter-regulatory phosphaturic hormone for vitamin D, and klotho, a cofactor necessary for activation of FGF-23. The main consequences of hyperphosphatemia described in CKD patients not on dialysis are ectopic calcification, increased mortality and more rapid progression of CKD. All this indicates the need for strict control of Pi. The two most currently used drugs for this purpose are lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer. Although there are no studies specifically designed for this predialysis population, these drugs appear to be effective and safe. Another complication of CKD is vitamin D deficiency which, according to recently published studies, is more prevalent and appears in earlier stages of the disease than was initially thought. There is wide debate on the need to administer vitamin D supplements systematically due to the pleiotropic effects of this hormone and which are unrelated to development of renal bone disease. Because of these doubts, there is no agreement on routine administration, although there is consensus on the need to measure 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D values and to wait for the result of numerous studies that are being carried out on the impact of vitamin D on progression of cardiovascular risk factors in CKD and the possible consequences of its indiscriminate administration.","2056":"The articles providing answers to the questions on vascular calcification of most interest from a clinical point of view were selected. 1. How is it measured?: Studies showing the clinical utility of different tools to quantify it were analyzed. 2. What does it measure?: Both in dialysis patients and the general population, vascular calcification and arterial stiffness are prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality. Other markers such as fetuin-A are associated with mortality in patients on hemodialysis but not in patients in early stages of chronic kidney disease. 3. What causes it?: In two selected studies, it was demonstrated again that low bone turnover and diabetes cause cardiovascular disease and vascular calcification, respectively. 4. How is it treated?: There is still no clinical evidence of regression of vascular calcification. However, a prospective study in new hemodialysis patients showed that sevelamer compared to calcium compounds slows the progression of vascular calcification and confers greater survival. A study comparing both compounds in chronic hemodialysis patients showed that sevelamer only had a benefit on survival in patients older than 65 years. It remains to be demonstrated whether the good experimental results of paricalcitol and cinacalcet are confirmed in prospective clinical studies.","2057":"The most relevant novelties in the area of cardiovascular disease in kidney transplant can be divided into various aspects. The most noteworthy findings with regard to pretransplant cardiovascular evaluation were that patients who had a cardiovascular event before transplant are at greater risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality posttransplant, the echocardiogram can predict kidney transplant patient survival better than coronary angiography, and the result of coronary angiography is not prognostic in diabetic patients. On the other hand, many of the published studies focused on obesity as a cardiovascular risk factor. Although some results are contradictory, it seems that obesity adversely affects graft and patient survival, especially in more extreme situations. Various studies have also been published that stress the high prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in first year after transplant, with the consequent need to perform the oral glucose tolerance test in nondiabetic patients. With regard to intermediate markers of target-organ damage, the progressive importance of measuring carotid intima-media thickness and coronary calcifications in the follow-up of kidney transplant patients with high cardiovascular risk should be stressed. The most relevant novelties in the area of therapeutic interventions are those related to the effect of different immunosuppressants on cardiovascular risk factors and the effect of hypolidemic agents (statins, ezetimibe, fish oil) on the course of the kidney graft and kidney transplant patient.","2058":"In the past two decades, new immunosuppressive drugs have emerged that have achieved a significantly reduction in acute rejection and short-term graft survival. This improvement, however, has not had the expected impact on long-term survival of the transplant. Paradoxically, the most used and effective drugs to prevent acute rejection are calcineurin inhibitors, but they contribute to delayed graft loss and patient death because they are nephrotoxic and also cause other adverse effects on blood pressure, lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. It was therefore necessary to develop new molecules free from these side effects that allow the use of low-dose or calcineurin inhibitor-free regimens without causing other adverse effects on patient and graft survival. Thus, the great development in the field of immunology has led to the discovery of important new pathways in the alloimmune response and subsequent development of molecules that act selectively against different points in the activation of the immune cascade. In this article we will review the most relevant clinical data published on immunosuppression and presented at different congresses over the year 2007, selecting those that we considered most relevant and that may have impact on the treatment of our patients in the future.","2059":"In 2007 there were important scientific contributions in the field of kidney transplant and specifically in chronic transplant nephropathy (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy). A new nomenclature and classification of chronic kidney disease was probably the most important contribution in this entity. Use of the C4d stain has allowed the concepts of glomerulopathy to be updated and to reveal the frequency of this entity and its impact in kidney transplant. Finally, two experimental studies provide new perspectives on the treatment of chronic kidney disease such as the use of statins or the use of pyridoxamine to block glycation end products.","2060":"Lanthanum is an element belonging to the group called rare earths. Due to its low solubility, lanthanum carbonate has been widely studied as an intestinal phosphate binder. The results of different clinical trials show that it is an effective and well-tolerated phosphate binder used in monotherapy. Serum phosphate levels are controlled in approximately 70% of patients at 5 years without causing hypercalcemia. The only significant adverse effects observed are a low percentage of gastrointestinal disturbances (6%). Lanthanum carbonate does not alter serum values of liposoluble vitamins or affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, furosemide, phenytoin, ACE inhibitors or beta-blockers. However, it does alter the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin (quinolones in general), tetracyclines and doxycycline. Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) is available in Spain as 500 mg, 750 mg, and 1,000 mg chewable tablets, which should not be swallowed without chewing to avoid loss of efficacy. The initial dose recommended by the WHO is 2,250 mg\/day, which is equivalent to one 750 mg at each meal. Lanthanum carbonate or lanthanum phosphate can be clearly visualized on a plain x-ray of the abdomen in patients who have recently ingested it. In summary, lanthanum carbonate is a widely studied potent phosphate binder, which offers the possibility of improving control of serum phosphate in patients with chronic kidney disease, without significant side effects. The fact that it is available as chewable tablets and that the number of daily tablets required has been significantly reduced will probably facilitate better patient compliance.","2061":"The present report describes different aspects of Fosrenol (lantahnum carbonate) which can be summarized as follows: Lanthanum shows a great binding affinity for phosphate. It is minimally absorbed by intestine and is eliminated by biliary route thus renal failure does not favour body accumulation of lanthanum. The effectiveness and safety of Fosrenol has been proven in clinical trials which have include more of 5,500 patients. Fosrenol has shown to be effective in controlling serum phosphate in short and long term studies (6 years). Lanthanum does not accumulate in the bone mineralization front and does not produce low bone turnover. Lanthanum is not found in the central nervous system. The presence of lanthanum in liver is explained by the fact that the minimal amount of lanthanum absorbed has to be disposed through liver.","2062":"Mineral metabolism abnormalities in chronic kidney disease (CRK) have adverse effects, particularly on the skeleton and cardiovascular system. Among the classic biochemical abnormalities, hyperphosphoremia plays a significant role. It stimulates parathyroid hormone production by the parathyroid gland both directly (it increases PTH synthesis and secretion and induces cell proliferation) and indirectly (it suppresses calcitriol synthesis by the kidneys and reduces vitamin D receptor and calcium sensor expression). It induces phenotypical activation of vascular smooth muscle cells, causing them to acquire an osteoblastic profile and produce procalcifying factors. As a result of both effects, numerous studies (retrospective) have shown an increase in mortality associated with hyperphosphoremia (usually P &gt; 5.5 mg\/dL). Finally, recent observations suggest a direct association between phosphoremia and CKD.Undoubtedly, all these are powerful arguments in favor of increasingly strict control of P in CKD.","2063":"","2064":"","2065":"","2066":"","2067":"","2068":"","2069":"","2070":"","2071":"","2072":"","2073":"","2074":"","2075":"","2076":"","2077":"The picking and consumption of wild mushrooms is a frequent practice in our region and may lead to accidental poisoning when confused with edible mushrooms. We describe the case of a 9-year-old boy who, following the ingestion of a poisonous mushroom, presented with uncontrollable vomiting and subsequent hepatic, haematological and renal failure some hours later. The patient required haemodialysis. The clinical course, laboratory findings and renal histology, which showed tubular necrosis with basal membrane preserved and lymphocytic interstitial infiltrate, confirmed the diagnosis of a severe mixed syndrome. The patient evolved favourably after the poisoning, recovering renal and liver function. In any case of acute renal failure of unknown cause in children, it would be necessary to rule out ingestion of mushrooms, since the patient could benefit from early treatment with haemoperfusion and thus prevent the deterioration of the renal function and other organs. In our patient, haemoperfusion was not carried out due to the lengthy period of latency since the ingestion of the toxic substance until diagnosis.","2078":"","2079":"","2080":"The creation of vascular accesses for hemodialysis in patients affected with terminal kidney failure affections, is presented periodically as a problem. Because of it, the availability of alternatives to the arteriovein fistula is something necessary; different types of tunnelled dialysis catheters are being developed, among which the Tesio catheter is the most well known and most widely utilized. Often it is implanted by vascular surgeons or radiologists; this creates dependence for the nephrology services that can delay obtaining the new vascular access and initiating or reinitiating the treatment. A descriptive study with the objective of analyzing the immediate complications during the insertion of tunnelled central catheters for hemodialysis and to evaluate the possibility of its attainment was carried out by nephrologists and personnel specialized in dialysis. Between January of 2003 and December of 2005, 175 Tesio tunnelled central catheters were implanted in our hemodialysis unit. Age and sex of the patient was registered, time in dialysis, diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus or prior heart disease, previous anticoagulant or platelet antiaggregate treatment, difficulty perceived by the nephrologist for the development of the technique, bleeding, systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, cardiac frequency, oxygen saturation and changes in the monitoring of electrocardiogram, at the beginning of the intervention, during the channelling of the vein, insertion of the dilatators and catheter, and at the end of it. The patients were 88 men and 82 women, with an average of age of 64. 21% of the patients habitually followed a treatment with platelet antiaggregate or anticoagulant, which had been withdrawn in the prior days. The ultrasound size of the vein was greater than one cm in 79% of the cases. Of 175 insertions only three patients (2%) presented signs of hemodynamic instability, two of them due to a descent of arterial tension and one by oxygen saturation descent; none of them required assisted backup, neither hemorrhage nor other complications appeared. The implant of tunnelled catheters, under local anesthesia, presents minimal complications and incidents during its insertion. It can be carried out by a nephrologist and specialized personnel, in hospitals with backup units that can undertake any possible complications. ","2081":"The Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is a strange entity characterised by the deposition of only one type of light chain in the renal tubular basement membranes. It can be associated to a plasma cell dyscrasia, however, it can occur in the absence of any detectable hematological disorder and it is called idiopathic LCDD. The clinical manifestation is renal insufficiency and nephrotic proteinuria, it does not have a clearly fixed treatment and has a severe prognosis. The aim of this work is to analyse the characteristics of the LCDD cases diagnosed within our environment. Six cases were identified, all of them between 1999 and 2005, from a total amount of 640 renal biopsies performed during this period, 4 women and 2 men, average age of 57. Multiple myeloma in 3 patients were detected (50%). The acute renal failure or rapidly progressive renal insufficiency was the most frequent clinical presentation (66%) together with nephrotic proteinuria (66%). All the biopsies showed tubular basement membranes thickening and kappa chains with a linear distribution within the same. The most frequent glomerular pathological finding was the nodular sclerosing glomerulopathy (83%). In one of the cases the affectation was exclusively tubular interstitial with tubular casts. 3 patients were treated, 2 with multiple myeloma. 5 patients needed dialysis: 3 with idiopathic LCDD within an average time of 7 days from the diagnosis to its reception and 2 with myeloma, who started needing dialysis in an average of 46 days. 4 patients died, 2 of them with myeloma. The monitoring time until the death was 13 weeks for the patients with myeloma and 110 weeks for the rest. The LCDD seems to be more frequent than what has been published and it is associated to the myeloma in half of the cases. It appears together with severe renal insufficiency and the patient's and renal prognosis is poor. ","2082":"Evidence on the reasons for the general and discouraging overutilization of catheters in DOPPS countries is lacking. We analysed the changes in distribution of the different types of vascular access in all 398 patients ongoing hemodialysis at our unit, from January 2000 until December 2005, as well as patients' characteristics. Secondly, risk factors associated with the use of permanent catheters were evaluated in all 95 patients who used that kind of vascular access from January 1997 until April 2006. The percentage of fistulas in prevalent patients diminished from year 2000 until year 2005 (from 95% to 77.9%); concurrently there was an increase in the use of permanent catheters (from 4.2% to 21.5%). The percentage of incident patients having a usable fistula or graft at the beginning of hemodialysis diminished progressively (83.4% in 2000; 69.3% in 2005), and there was a significant increase in the percentage of incident patients using a permanent catheter (from 0 to 23%). Coincidentally, there was a change in patients characteristics: increasing age (71.3 vs. 60.5 years); greater diabetes percentage (7.1% vs. 18.5%) and less time on dialysis (93.2 vs 37 months; p &lt; 0.03). Causes of permanent catheter insertion varied, exhaustion of all other arteriovenous options being the most frequent in the first period of the study and the presence of an unsuitable vascular anatomy in the second. Despite our policy favoring arteriovenous angioaccess, our results with regards to vascular access worsened in both prevalent and incident patients, coinciding with a change in patients' characteristics. We believe that reversing this trend may become more complicated as the population on dialysis grows older and becomes more prone to diabetes. ","2083":"Renal involvement is observed frequently in association with malignant gammopathies, mainly those related to light chain deposition, although has also been described in non-malignant monoclonal gammopathy. This study reports the clinicopathological findings and outcome in 9 patients with nephropaty secondary to monoclonal immunoglobulin deposit in absence of malignancy. They were three men and six women and they were 59.2+\/-12 years old. All patients presented proteinuria and different levels of renal insufficiency (mean creatinin = 315+\/-187 micromol\/L) at the moment of diagnostic. Two patients required dialysis at the time of renal biopsy. The pathology studies revealed a nodular sclerosing glomerulopathy in four cases, mesangiocapilary glomerulonephritis in three cases, only tubular lesions in one and mesangial lesions in the other one. The treatment applied was: Prednisone alone (two cases), with chemotherapy associated (melfalan in two, clorambucil in one and ciclophosphamide in another one). One patient received plasmapheresis and mycophenolate and another patient undergone a bone marrow authotransplant associated to mycophenolate and prednisone. One of the two patients who required dialysis at the moment of presentation was not treated. After a follow-up of more than 4 years (4.89 +\/-DE: 3.69) renal function improved or remained stable in three patients and proteinuria was disappeared in more than 50% of patients. Four patients had a worsening of renal function and they required dialysis during the time of follow-up (in 2,4 years +\/- DE: 4,3). In any case malignitation was observed. Chemotherapy stabilized or improved renal function in 3 of nine patients (33%) with non-malignant monoclonal gammopathy. Non-malignant monoclonal gammopathy could go unnoticed. Appearance of abnormalities in renal routine tests deserves more in-depth diagnostic procedures, including renal biopsy. Evolution to end stage renal disease could probably be avoided or reduced in severity with early detection and treatment of this entity.","2084":"Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) allows evaluation not only of casual daytime elevations of blood pressure (BP) but also alterations in the 24-hour circadian patterns of BP. The aim of the present study was to assess 24-hour BP patterns in a population of obese children who were referred to our outpatient clinic, in relation to the degree of obesity, body fat distribution and insulin resistance, and considering other cardiovascular risk factors. Office and ambulatory BP measurements, and fasting serum glucose, insulin and HOMA determinations were obtained in 119 obese children (7-15 years old). Urinary albumin excretion was measured in the first morning urine. The extend of obesity was quantified using body mass index z score adjusted by age and gender. The prevalence of office hypertension in only one set of blood pressure measurements was 47%. This value was not confirmed on further separate occasions. The prevalence of global ambulatory hypertension was 36%. Diurnal systolic hypertension was found in 14%, while 39 patients (33%) had nocturnal systolic hypertension. Twenty five of them (64%) were only hypertensive at nightime and the rest (n = 14), were also hypertensive during the day. Only 4 patients were exclusively systolic hypertensive at daytime (table III). None of the patients were exclusively diastolic at day or nighttime. Of the total 119 subjects 47% non systolic dippers. This abnormal BP pattern was associated with the degree of obesity (p &lt; 0.001) and insulinresistance (HOMA values; p &lt; 0.001). The anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of the population studied are shown in table I and II respectively. The correlations coefficients and regression analysis between anthropometric and metabolic parameters are shown in table IV and V. Reduced nocturnal systolic blood pressure dip and nightime systolic hypertension were the most frequent forms of hypertension in our cohort of severe obese children. These alterations in the 24-hour circadian patterns of BP were related to the degree of obesity and insulin resistance. ","2085":"A previous study using cinacalcet, as compared to vitamin D alone, showed a better reduction response of PTH levels and a significant diminution of secondary effects. The objective of present study was to evaluate the additional cost of adding cinacalcet to the standard treatment of patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) taking into account the treatment goals achieved. 12 month prospective study of 23 patients with severe SHPT. Two treatment regimens were considered: standard treatment (m 0) and standard treatment plus cinacalcet (m 12). Four consequences of inadequate control of SHPT were registered: parathiroid hormone (PTH), Calcium (Ca), Phosphorus (P) and the Ca x P product serum levels. Treatment effectiveness was measured as percentage of patients who achieved treatment goal according to each indicator: PTH &lt; 800 pg\/mL, PTH between 150 and 300 pg\/mL, Calcium &lt; 9.5 mg\/dL, Phosphorus &lt; 5.5 mg\/dL, and Ca x P product &lt; 55. Annual and monthly costs were calculated for both treatment regimens using Spanish 2007 tariffs, and taking into account the dose reduction in some other treatments. Results are presented as incremental costs and cost per patient who achieved treatment goal. At 12 month it was observed a higher percentage of patients who achieved simultaneously the 4 therapeutic goals with respect to basal moment, from 0% to 52.1%. Cinacalcet allowed to save costs in concomitant drugs, achieving a total saving of 149 euros per patient and month. At 12 month, Cinacalcet achieved a reduction of percentage of patients with PTH &gt; 800 pgr\/mL with half of costs than standard treatment (651.35 euros vs 1363.68 euros). It was not possible to calculate the cost for PTH indicator since at the study onset, there was no patient who achieved a level between 150 and 300 pg\/mL. Cinacalcet allowed reaching treatment goals in Calcium, Phosphorus and Ca x P product in a more cost-effective way (2164.2 euros vs 2684.8 euros). Although Cinacalcet is expensive,p atients treated with Cinacalcet showed a minor cost per patient who achieved treatment goal than patients without Cinacalcet. The ability of cinacalcet to reduce PTH secretion, along with the reductions in the serum Ca, P, and Ca x P product, provides an alternative to the traditional treatment paradigm, and should be a welcomed addition in the management of SHPT. ","2086":"Overall survival of HIV-infected has increased over the last ten years. In parallel a higher need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) in this population has been more observed. RRT associated complications and outcomes greatly varied since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and scarce data is available regarding the outcome of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in HIV-infected patients under HAART. We described 8 HIV-infected patients who were admitted at the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit at our institution from November-95 to November-07. Mean age was 40.7 +\/- 5.3. Causes of end-stage renal disease were diabetes mellitus type 1 (2), focal and segmental glomerular sclerosis (2), IgA nephropathy (1) and unknown origin (3). High blood pressure was detected in 62,5% of the patients. Mean follow-up was 41.2 +\/- 32.1 months (range 12-103). One, two and three year survival was 100, 62.5 and 50% respectively. Overall mortality was 62.5% and cardio-vascular events were the main cause of death (2 patients, 25%). Infective peritonitis rate was 0.36 IP\/year, and Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common pathogen identified. Hospital admission rate was 0.69 admission\/year and the main cause of admission was respiratory tract infection. All patients received HAART. Lamivudine, stavudine and nelfinavir were the most frequent treatment prescribed. During the first year in PD undetectable viral load and CD4 % were not modified. A significant weight gain was observed during the first year of the study (60.6 kg. vs 64.9 kg. p &gt; or = 0.016). Our results suggest that PD is a suitable choice for RRT in HIV-infected. Compared to previous studies, an increase in overall survival and a decrease in PD-associated complications were seen. The significance of cardio-vascular risk factors in the outcome of PD in HIV-infected patients is not completely determined. A multidisciplinary approach and a management of patients in individual basis remains mandatory.","2087":"On line-treated water has been designed to obtain ultrapure water. This quality of water is obviously necessary to obtain ultrapure dialysate, although this is not the only condition. To keep the quality of the process, is necessary the continuous monitoring of the water treatment, dialysate and haemodialysis machines. After the installation of a water treatment with these characteristics, we developed a protocol to follow up its quality. The measures included in the protocol were: a) Microbiologic, endotoxin and chemical controls of the water on different stage: before and at the end of the treatment, pre-treatment and network of distribution. The chemical analysis included analytical and colorimetric measures. b) Control of specific mechanical functions of the facilities. c) Microbiologic and endotoxin analysis of the dialysate produced by haemodialysis machines. d) Control and maintenance of haemodialysis machines, according to the technical indications. We analyse the initial five years of water treatment with the aim to evaluate quality parameters and efficiency. We explain the reasons of the modifications introduced in the system. During this period we have not any episodes of global or partial contamination. We refer here some incidents related with the quality of raw water supply before the treatment, but in any case it was necessary neither to stop the water supply or to reduce the water quality. We observed a persistent contamination of one haemodialysis monitor due to the port used to get the samples. On line-treated water is at present the most appropriate system to obtain high quality water for haemodialysis.

Vancomycin is a glycopeptidic antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Staph. coagulasa positive (S. aureus) and Staph. coagulasa negative. Nowadays its extensive use is a consequence of bacterial resistance to classical antibiotics such as beta-lactams. In Nephrology Units, vancomycin is the antibiotic of first choice to treat staphylococcal infections related to central venous catheters for hemodialysis, as well as for the treatment of peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis.

The aims of this study were to measure QA by TDT and to compare the functional results with Delta-H method. We measured Q(A) non invasively in 38 VA (mean VA duration: 48.7 +\/- 69.8 months) during HD in 38 stable ESRD (mean age 63.8 +\/- 15.1 yr, mean time on HD 47.6 +\/- 53.9 months, diabetic nephropathy 18.4%) pts by the TDT. Fourteen pts (36.8%) had history of previous VA that were ipsilateral to the VA under study in most cases (11\/14, 78.6%). Thirteen pts (34.2%) had history of any comorbidity (coronary artery or cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular diseases). Q(A) was calculated from the recirculation values obtained by means of the blood temperature monitor (BTM), integrated into the Fresenius Medical Care 4008-S machine, at normal and reverse configurations of the HD blood lines. Q(A) was measured within the first hour of two consecutive HD sessions (the values were averaged). Mean arterial pressure MAP and distance between needles (DBN) were measured simultaneous with Q(A). In addition, the VA blood flow was also determined by Delta-H method using Crit-Line III Monitor (ABF-) between 1000 and 1500 ml\/min. The mean DBN and MAP were 6.2 +\/- 2.9 cm, 91.9 +\/- 12.4 mmHg, respectively. Mean Q(A) was similar for pts with mean MAP&lt;100 mmHg (n=26) and for pts with mean MAP&gt;or=100 mmHg (n=12) (p=0.85). Pts with diabetic nephropathy showed lower mean Q(A) (836.1 +\/- 395.8 ml\/min) compared to the remaining pts (1,245.9 +\/- 449.9 ml\/min) (p=0.033). No differences in mean Q(A) was found when pts with any comorbidity and without comorbidities were compared (p=0.62). Brachial AVF tended to have higher mean Q(A) (1,323.6 +\/- 465.3 ml\/min) compared to radial AVF (1,017.4 +\/- 447.3 ml\/min) (p=0.052).

No correlation was found between mean Q(A) and: mean age, DBN, MAP, Kt\/V index, time on HD and VA duration. Mean Q(A) obtained by TDT was not different when compared with mean ABF determined by Delta-H method (1,151.3 +\/- 479.0 ml\/min) (p=0.89). The calculated values of VA blood flow obtained by TDT were highly correlated with those determined by the Delta-H method (intraclass correlation coefficient =0.95, p&lt;0.001). The TDT is an indicator of QA during HD. The functional profile of VA was worse in pts with diabetic nephropathy or without history of previous VA.

Because of its prevalence and high probability to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), we searched for factors with prognostic value for renal survival and proteinuria remission. Historical cohort of 44 patients. We studied clinical and histological characteristics at the time of renal biopsy and clinical condition and renal function at the end of follow-up. PRINCIPAL OUTCOMES: renal impairment (increase &gt;or=50% of basal creatinine levels and\/or ESRD), proteinuria remission (partial 0.3-3.49 g\/day and complete &lt; 0.3g\/day). Kaplan-Meier's curves and Cox's Multivariate Regression were used. The 59% of patients were men. The 54.5% had renal failure, 53.5% nephrotic syndrome and 43.2% hypertension or high blood pressure (HBP) at renal biopsy. The frequency of histological variants was: not otherwise specified (NOS) 75%, cellular 13.6%, tip 6.8% and perihilar 4.5%. The 56.8% received steroids for 4.3 +\/- 4.5 months and 32% of these patients were corticodependent. After a mean follow-up of 21.6 +\/- 27.8 months, the renal function decreased in 18.2% of patients. The 37.8% and 32.4% of patients reached partial and complete proteinuria remission respectively. Treatment with steroids, antihypertensive therapy and IgM and C3 glomerular deposits were associated with a high renal survival. The treatment with steroids was the only factor that forecasted a high renal survival (hazard ratio or HR: 0.07, 0.01-0.9) and proteinuria remission (HR: 0.2, 0.04-0.9). In general, high blood pressure (HR: 6.2, 1.1-35.2), renal failure (HR: 2.9, 1.1-7.6), cellular variant and interstitial fibrosis (HR: 5.2, 1.02-26.7) were prognostic factors for not achieving proteinuria remission. In primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, treatment with steroids forecasted a high renal survival and proteinuria remission. Renal failure and interstitial fibrosis were prognostic factors for not achieving proteinuria remission. ","2126":"on line haemodiafiltration provides the greatest clearance for low and high-molecular weight uremic toxins, which is associated with a lower risk of mortality in our patients. Nowadays, there's increasing evidence about the need of achieving at least 20 litters ultrafiltration in postdilution mode and 70% reduction of beta-2-Microglobulin (B2M), however it requires a vascular access's high blood flow. Unfortunately, we do not succeed in these objectives because of our patients being older, diabetic and with poor vascular access; in this situation high blood flows are more difficult to get at the expense of lower post-dilution exchange volumes. The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of OL-S-HDF to obtain an equivalent ultrafiltration volume as 20 L in OL-postdilution-HDF (OL-P-HDF). OL-S-HDF initially begins in postdilution mode changing to predilution once the transmembrane pressure (TMP) reached 250 mmHg. we performed one high-flux HD session (HF-HD), one OL-P-HDF session and one OL-S-HDF session in each of the 16 adult patients who participated during 3 consecutive weeks. We compared the clearance rates of low and middle molecules such as urea, creatinine, B2M, myoglobulin and levels of albumin and haematocrit between the 3 different techniques. We measured the pre-filter pressure (PFP) by a manometer set before the dialyzer. The main characteristics of the sessions are described in table N1. There wasn't significant difference in Kt\/V, urea and creatinine removal between the three techniques. B2M and myoglobulin's clearance rates were significantly higher in both hemodiafiltration modes than in HF-HD (p=0.000), however we didn't find differences between OL-P-HDF and OL-S-HDF. There was a direct correlation between PFP and TMP along the sessions in every technique (p&lt;0.05). We found that PFP was better than TMP to correlate with pre-dialysis levels of albumin and haematocrit and also with the haemoconcentration percentage at the end of the sessions. This study confirms that OL-S-HDF is as good as OL-P-HDF and it could be a useful technique to treat patients with suboptimal access's blood flow to get to achieve ultrafiltration volumes within the objectives. PFP could offer extra information than TMP.

This later group of patients is characterized by an older age (69 vs 67 years, p&lt;0.01) and more frequent obesity (62% vs 43%, p&lt;0.001), diabetes (55% vs 11%, p&lt;0.001), hyperlipidemia (68% vs 59%, p&lt;0.05), and metabolic syndrome (68% vs 22%, p&lt;0.001). At least half of them present some kind of end-organ damage. No pharmacologycal treatment is prescribed to 3% of these patients and 37% of them are on monotherapy. There is a higher prescription of angiotensin receptor, calcium channel, beta and alfa-blockers in the group of patients with R-HT. There is an independent and direct relationship between R-HT and age, male gender, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and an inverse relationship with ischemic cardiopathy. The prevalence of R-HT at Primary Care Units is of 13% and is related with age, male gender and metabolic risk factors. ","2128":"Cinacalcet has improved the management of hyperparathiroidism (HPTH) in hemodialysis. To our knowledge there are no specific studies on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Cinacalcet on the achievement of optimal and suboptimal targets on treatment of hyperparathiroidism (HPTH) in PD patients. As secondary objectives we have studied the safety of treatment and estimate the mean time to reach these targets, and evaluate economic cost. Eighteen patients undergoing more than 4 months on PD with a severe HPTH (PTH &gt; 500 pg\/ml) resistant to conventional treatment with diet, chelants and vitamin D were included in this prospective open-label study. We have used the targets of K\/DOQITM-clinical guidelines as optimal target. We have selected as suboptimal targets: PTH &lt; 350 pg\/ml, phosphorus &lt; 6 mg\/dl and calcium &lt; 10.4 mg\/dl (only when simultaneous CaxP was under 55 mg2\/dl2). Oral Cinacalcet was given with main meal in a single daily start dose of 30 mg and titrated thereafter monthly. We considered the first value on target as an event and used a Kaplan-Meyer survival analysis to estimate mean time to reach target. On inclusion all patients have at least two previous PTH values over 500 pg\/ml, PTH mean 695,3 (SD 96) and they were on PD with an appropriate efficacy during a mean of 15.56 months (SD 0.78). Mean follow-up time under Cinacalcet treatment was 12 months. The percentage of patients with a PTH under 350 pg\/ml was 66,7% on month 3, 60% on month 6 and 100% after 1 year. The percentage of patients that reach an aggregate of all suboptimal targets (PTH&lt; 350 pg\/ml and calcium &lt; 10.4 mg\/dl and phosphorus&lt; 6 mg\/dl and CaxP &lt; 55 mg2\/dl2) was 33.3% on month 6 and 66.7% after 1 year. The mean time to reach PTH target was 2.33 months with a 95% confident interval [1.35-3.32] and to reach the aggregate of all target was 16.94 months [11.38-22.5]. Cinacalcet has been well tolerated, we reduced the dose in a single patient due to secondary effects, but treatment was not discontinued in any case. In summary the addition of Cinacalcet to conventional treatment in PD patients with resistant HPTH has improved the achievement of targets, and has been reasonably safe in our patients. ","2129":"Alcohol intoxication (methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol) may result in metabolic acidosis with increased anion gap, increased serum osmolal gap, and neurologic abnormalities ranging from drunkenness to coma, and death. The mortality and morbidity rates remain very high despite intensive care therapy. The toxicity of methanol and ethylene glycol is clearly correlated to the degree of metabolic acidosis. The established treatment of severe methanol and ethylene glycol intoxication is ethanol administration and hemodialysis (HD). By inhibiting the main metabolic pathway of methanol and ethylene glycol (alcohol dehydrogenase), ethanol prevents the formation of major toxic metabolites (formic acid, glycolic acid and oxalic acid). Conventional HD can reduce serum methanol, ethanol and ethylene glycol and its metabolites rapidly, but high-flux membranes should be capable of removing more toxic per hour of HD. In this report, we describe 14 cases of life-threatening alcohol intoxication (11 methanol, 1 ethanol, and 2 ethylene glycol) who were treated successfully with supportive care, ethanol infusion (methanol and ethylene glycol), and early HD with a high-flux dialyser. The median pH was 7.04 +\/- 0.06 (range 6.60-7.33), median bicarbonate 9.9 +\/- 1.9 mmol\/l (range 1.4-25), and median base deficit 18.4 +\/- 2.6 mmol\/l (range 2-33). The median anion gap was 29.1 +\/- 2.3 mmol\/l (range 16-45) and the median osmolal gap was 119 +\/- 47 mOsm\/l (range 16-402). On admission there was an excellent linear correlation between the serum toxic alcohol concentrations and the osmolal gaps (R2 = 0.98, p = 0.0006). In all cases early HD corrected metabolic acidosis and osmolal abnormalities. The mortality was 7 % (1 from 14). We conclude that pre-emptive HD should be performed in severe intoxications to remove both the parent compound and its metabolites. The HD prescription should include a large surface area dialyser with high-flux membrane, a blood flow rate in excess of 250 ml\/min, a modified bicarbonate bath enriched with phosphorus and potassium, and a long time session. The phosphorus and potassium-enriched bicarbonate-based dialysis solution used in patients with normal phosphorus and potassium serum levels avoided HD-induced hypophosphatemia and hypopotassemia. HD as implemented in these cases is a safe and very effective approach to the management of alcohol poisoning.","2130":null,"2131":"To diminish inter centres variability in applied medical treatments, as well as in the results obtained with them, is one of the main challenges that Nephrology faces now a days. The systematic and planned use of Clinical Performance Measures (CPMs), Feedback and Benchmarking are tools that can help clinicians to reach such an objective. In this study we evaluate the consequences of applying those techniques in the results obtained in three haemodialysis units. we analyzed the results obtained in 311 patients dialyzed in the three units during the period 2006-2007. Established and evaluated objectives were as follows: 1.- To increase the percentage of patients with a serum calcium below 9,5 mg\/dl over 70%; 2.- To increase the percentage of patients with a serum phosphorus under 5,5 mg\/dl over 80%; 3.- To increase the percentage of patients with a serum PTH in between 150-300 pg\/ml over 40%; 4.- To diminish the percentage of patients with a serum ferritine below 100 ng\/ml under 10%, in one of the units that at the beginning of the study was not accomplishing that objective. Every three months each unit received their own results as well as the results of the two other units. the percentage of patients with serum calcium below 9,5 mg\/dl increased significantly in the three units (54,6%, 56,1% and 55,6% at the beginning; 87,7%, 82.9% and 75,1% at the end of the study, respectively; p&lt;0,001).

The percentage of patients with a serum ferritin below 100 ng\/ml in unit B diminished from 30% to 5,3% (p&lt;0,001), reaching results similar the the two other units. Mean erythropoietin (EPO) consumption during the year 2005 was 145,5+\/-13,2 U\/kg\/week in unit A; 226,2+\/-39,8 U\/kg\/week in unit B, and 175,5+\/-13,9 U\/kg\/week in unit C. At the end of year 2007, mean EPO consumption was significantly lower in unit B (144,2+\/-15 U\/kg\/week), and similar to the other two units (140+\/-14,2 in unit A and 135,1+\/-13,8 in unit C). The results of this study permit to conclude that the use of QPM's and quality targets, combined with feedback and benchmarking, allows for the improvement of clinical results. Each centre should establish their own objectives, independently of the defined quality standards, so as to reach such standards or even to improve them. In this study, the three units showed a general improvement in their results, tending towards similar outcomes for the same clinical processes.

Recently, there is a great interest in the detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in the general population. A classification of CKD, based on several stages of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), has been established. In this study we followed up, clinically and biochemically, during one year eighty patients older than 65 years so as to ascertain the applicability and utility of such classification to those patients. 80 clinically stable patients, with a median age of 83 years, recruited within January and April 2006, were followed up during one year.

Cardiac problems were the kind of morbidity more frequently found. Only a small proportion (23%) of group 2 patients were receiving erythropoietin (EPO) treatment. Estimated GFR and proteinuria remained stable at the end of one year independently of basal GFR; we found no significant differences between groups in the rest of analytical parameters. in old patients with no significant proteinuria, the similarity of their clinical evolution and the stability of their eGFR (independently of its basal value), as well as the lack of differences in other analytical parameters, appears not to confer any advantages to the use of mathematical formulae to classified them according to their eGFR. ","2153":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its related complications have become an important health and social problem. Very expensive resources are required in end-stage renal disease, and both complications of CKD as well as the important associated cardiovascular risk demand for interventions long before renal substitution therapies are needed. Thus, early diagnosis of CKD is currently considered of paramount importance, and it is based essentially upon the estimation of the glomerular filtration rate by formulae such as the abbreviated equation of the MDRD study. Nevertheless, in spite of international published recommendations, an automatic calculation to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from serum creatinine is not reported by most laboratories yet and the need for creatinine assay standardisation is far from being implemented. Thus, we have designed some tables to show the creatinine value corresponding to different GFR for ages between 20 and 90 y\/o, at 5 years intervals and in both sexes with both the MDRD-4 and MDRD-IDMS equations (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease-Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry). Moreover, we have created a global table including an estimation of GFR from plasma creatinine, age and sex by the MDRD-IDMS formula, the recommended for those laboratories which measure serum creatinine with assays aligned to the reference method. These tables aim to increase the awareness of the different assays for serum creatinine and to facilitate the diagnosis of CKD converting serum creatinine into GFR. This action should allow not only the early detection but also the possibility to establish the appropriate medical actions recommended after CKD detection.","2154":"Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common disease among patients undergoing hemodialysis leading to increase morbidity and mortality with a high risk of inflammation and sepsis. The aim of the present study was to determinate PVD prevalence in our hemodialysis population and association with inflammation. The study sample consisted of 220 patients prevalents in hemodialysis. A basal study was made in 2001 and a follow up for 47 months. Data were collected retrospectively. PVD diagnosis was made attending to limb pulses and doppler in revisions. Diagnosis was classified as rest pain, ischemic ulceration and gangrene. Among a total of 220 patients, 89 had prevalent PVD. Thirty per cent had rest pain, 6,5% had ischemic ulceration and 3% had gangrene. Ninety five per cent underwent medical treatment, 0,5% were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), 2% were treated with surgical revascularization and 2,5% were treated with amputation. Patients with PVD were older, with higher Charlson index, diabetes, they hay higher CRP and fibrinogen serum levels; and lower albumin and prealbumine serum levels. Survival PVD was decreased in Kaplan-Meier (log rank =12,4; p&lt;0,000).

Patients from 66 healthcare units(HU) were studied using a validated questionnaire and considering the positive values of anti-HCV(Elisa III) tests performed in these units between january and december 2003. the majority of patients were male (56.2%), between 41 and 60 years old. The mean seroprevalence of HCV in the 66 healthcare units was 13+\/-9.5%; the three-monthly seroprevalence was below 20%, 15% and 10% in 75%, 50% and 40% of healthcare units, respectively. When the HU were grouped according to HCV seroprevalence into low(&lt;5%), medium(5-15%) and high seroprevalence(&gt;15%), 20% of the units have low, 42% medium and 37.5% were found to have high seroprevalence. No correlation was found between HDI and HCV seroprevalence (r=0.42; p=0.174) but in the regions in which the HDI was higher, HCV seroprevalence was also higher. There was a positive correlation between HCV seroprevalence and time on HD in 884 patients in the 4 HU (p&lt;0.001). The seroprevalence of HCV was investigated in 387 healthcare professionals(29%) working in 14 HU. They were divided into two groups according to their time of professional activity: &lt;10 y (G1) and &gt;10 y (G2). In G1, there were no cases of anti-HCV seropositivity. In G2, 3 members of the staff were anti-HCV seropositive. The mean time of work of the seropositive staff in the HU was 15.6 years. The seroprevalence of HCV was 0.8% when all the healthcare professionals were taken into consideration. There was no statistically significant difference with respect to HCV seroprevalence between G1 and G2 with respect to the time of occupational exposure (p=0.27). the seroprevalence of HCV in patients on HD in MG is 13+\/-9.5% and was &lt;10% in 40% of the HU; there was no statistically significant correlation between HDI and seroprevalence of HCV in the healthcare units evaluated; there was a statistically significant correlation between HCV seroprevalence and time of treatment on HD; HCV seroprevalence in the health professionals studied was 0.8% and similar to the literature.

The purpose of this study is to analyze pregnancy after kidney transplantation and their consequences on mother, graft and child. We review ten pregnant women with kidney transplantation, average of 29 years old and 44 months post-kidney transplantation. The mean glomerular filtration rate was 64 ml\/min and the immunosuppression was with prednisone and tacrolimus. We analyze outcomes of different variables before and during pregnancy, and after labour. Pregnancy finished in nine of ten patients. Three patients needed cesarean section and only one patient had a miscarriage on the first term. Blood arterial pressure increased at the end of pregnancy and the creatinine level was stable with a few increase of proteinuria at the third term. We increased the tacrolimus dose to obtain the correct blood levels and any rejection was detected. We had only one patient with preeclampsia that we solved with a cesarean section. Labours were a mean of 37.2 weeks and the mean birth weight of infant was 2,809 grams. Two newborns had prematurity without structural malformations. Pregnancy after kidney transplantation is safe with prednisone and tacrolimus when the renal function is good, proteinuria doesn't exist and blood pressure is controlled.","2189":"Aluminium binder has been ill-advised, but his use remain applicable in the clinique practice in very seleccionated and particular patients. The repercussion of prolonged treatment with low doses of aluminium phosphate-binders in haemodialysis was studied. The haemodialysis unit had a double osmosis inverse and the aluminium levels in haemodialysis liquid was less than 2 micrograms\/liter. 41 patients of the 295 on haemodialysis received aluminium phosphate-binders since the 2005 January to the 2007 November. The mean time of treatment was 17.8 months, and the doses was 3.9 tablets day (mean of 463 grams in the studied period). The association of low doses of aluminium phosphate-binders permitted a better control of phosphorus (6.8 to 4.8 mg\/dl; p&lt;0.0001), with a reduction of the others phosphate-binders: sevelamer (10.4 a 8 tablets\/day; p&lt;0.0001) and calcium phosphate-binders (4.6 to 3.1 tablets\/day; p&lt;0.0001).

Five patients (12.1%) reached aluminium serum levels higher 20 mcg\/l, and none reached the 40 mcg\/l. The aluminium phosphate-binders were effective, economical and, now, with an apparent better security profile than in a previous time, but it is very important to be careful with this use and to follow a vigilance strict on patients and haemodialysis liquid.

Renal transplants (RT) done in Catalonia during the 1990-2004 period, performed in patients over 17 years (135 LRT and 3.831 CRT), have been analyzed (retransplants were not included). The data come from the Renal Patients Transplant Registry (RMRC). Student's t-test and chi2 test have been used for mean and for proportions comparisons, respectively. To analyze univariate and multivariate survival, actuarial method and Cox regression have been used, respectively. Estimated creatinine clearance has been studied and its data have been showed through Selwood modified Analysis. As it happens with other great RT patients series, the RMRC analysis, globally and without any adjustment, shows that patient and graft survival in LRT is better than that obtained with CRT. When we studied which variables explain these results, we found that main factors were smaller recipient age and the short time on dialysis. The great influence of both factors has been published in a large number of papers, explaining the differences obtained on the transplanted renal patient survival. Once adjusted the analysis by the different factors that influence the survival of the patient and the graft, there are no differences in the obtained results, since the best outcomes of the TRV are due to factors like the smaller recipient age and the advanced TR.

The incidence rate seems to keep stable in the last years although there were some differences among communities (from 104 pmp in Castile and Leon to 186 pmp in Canary Islands). Diabetes Mellitus is the most diagnosed cause of renal failure in 2005, more than 20% of patients, followed by vascular diseases. The estimated prevalence of renal replacement therapy in Spain at the end of 2005 was 903 pmp, with important variations among communities (from 806 pmp in Cantabria to 1056 pmp in Valencia Region). The 47% of prevalent RRT patients had a functioning transplant. Mortality on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis was 13.7% and 10.8% respectively. Mortality on transplant was 1.3%, one of the lowest values registered so far.

We describe a case of a young woman that 10 days postpartum developed thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure with nephrotic range proteinuria. With the suspicion of HUS she was started on plasmapheresis initially stopped due to an anaphylactic reaction to plasma and finally due to hyperhidratation with acute pulmonary edema needing mechanical ventilation. Renal biopsy confirmed the diagnosis. Clinical course was complicated with refractory hypertension and infectious complications In conclusion postpartum HUS is a rare clinical entity , that forces a differential diagnosis with hypertensive complications of pregnancy.

Pathogenesis is unclear and three possible mechanisms it has been proposed to explain the decrease of glomerular filtration rate: a severe reduction of glomerular permeability, the presence of acute tubular necrosis or an increased intrarenal pressure related with interstitial oedema. Here we present a 36 years-old-male with a nephrotic syndrome caused by focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis who developed an anuric acute renal failure. Renal function did not change despite oedema removal with haemodialysis and only after corticosteroid and cyclophosphamide therapy introduction we observed a rapid recovery of urinary output and resolution of acute renal failure. Renal biopsy did not show signs of tubular damage or obstruction with proteins nor significant interstitial oedema. Therefore, in this case we think acute renal failure was caused by a severe reduction in glomerular ultrafiltration rate and steroids were the effective treatment that allowed recovery of renal function.","2211":"The overall incidence of nephrolithiasis-related acute and chronic renal failure is poorly known and surely underestimated. However, obstructive nephropathy represents a potentially curable form of kidney disease that often requires for managing an instrumentation of urinary tract. Rasburicase is an enzyme that transforms uric acid to allantoin, a compound more water soluble that will be excreted by the kidney more easily. Rasburicase has been proven to be an effective therapy for prevention of tumour lysis syndrome. But it also represents an interesting new option in managing hyperuricemia in patients with severe tophaceous gout. We administered rasburicase intravenously (0.20 mg\/kg\/day, for 2 days) in 2 adults with acute obstructive nephropathy from renal calculi, which was receiving temporary haemodialysis. Rasburicase produced a sharp polyuria 12-18 hours after its administration accompanied with a fast reduction of serum creatinine levels, that returned to normal range without further dialysis. If we suppose that rasburicase can pass through glomerular filter by its relatively low molecular weight, it could dissolve tubular uric acid crystals in acute renal failure associated to tumour lysis syndrome, providing the restoration of renal function. But we also could postulate that rasburicase can act in urinary tract, fragmentating renal calculi, promoting relief of obstructive uropathy and the resolution of renal failure. We suggest rasburicase should be tried in this new indication to prove its potential efficacy.","2212":"Hypertension is a very frequent complication in patients in hemodialysis.

The change to a short daily hemodialysis was successful to hypertension control and allowed a gradual suspension of drugs.","2213":"Amyloidosis is a systemic disorder characterized by the extracellular tissue deposition of insoluble, toxic aggregates in bundles of beta-sheet fibrillar proteins. These deposits are typically identified on the bases of their apple-green birrefringence under a polarized light microscope after staining with Congo red, and by the presence of rigid, nonbranching fibrils 8 to 10 nm in diameter on electron microscopy. The type of amyloid fibril unit can be further defined by immunohistology or by immunoelectron microscopy. It has been described at least 25 different human protein precursors of amyloid fibrils, which will describe its corresponding amyloid disease. The most common types of amyloidosis are AL (primary) and AA (secondary) types; the former, is the most frequent and is due to deposition of proteins derived from immunoglobulin light chain fragments, occurring alone or in association with multiple myeloma. The later (AA), is caused by deposition of fibrils composed of fragments of the acute phase reactant serum amyloid A (SAA) and complicates chronic diseases with ongoing or recurring inflammation, namely; rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile chronic polyarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, familial periodic fever syndromes (Familial Mediterranean Fever), chronic infections and furthermore, some neoplasms (mainly renal cell carcinoma and Hodgkin's disease). Despite its less frequent association, some benign neoplasms can subsequently complicate to AA amyloidosis, therefore, an early diagnose and successful treatment may lead indeed, to regression of the amyloid disease. Herein, we present two cases of AA amyloidosis, both of them caused by 2 different benign neoplasms: 1. A 34 year-old woman, after chronic oral contraceptive use, developed an hepatic adenoma (fig. 1) which finally lead to AA amyloidosis with primary kidney presentation (pure nephrotic syndrome) (table 1). Post-surgical complications yield to acute renal failure from which unfortunately could not be recovered. After being on hemodialysis therapy during 10 months she received a first renal allograft without any complication. 2. A 20 year old woman, was diagnosed of AA amyloidosis after a renal biopsy (fig. 2) because of nephrotic syndrome (table 1). Further investigation lead to the finding of a hialyne-vascular type Castleman's disease located in the retroperitoneum (fig. 2). Despite surgical resection and medical treatment (colchicine) she developed progressive renal failure requiring initialization of hemodialysis therapy. After 6 years being on hemodialysis, she received a first renal allograft which is currently functioning after one year of follow- up. Although other chronic inflammatory diseases complicate more frequently to AA amyloidosis, benign tumors have to be taken into account as a potential ethiological cause for secondary amyloidosis.","2214":"","2215":"To establish if the implantation of catheters for hemodialysis in axillary veins is an acceptable alternative in patients with Acute or Chronic Renal Failure (ARF o CRF) with limitations for other type of central catheter.

All the patients with ARF or CRF, who required hemodialysis therapy, but that their pathology of base or the depletion of their classical access routes, required the implantation of catheters bilumenes by non conventional routes, during a period of 10 years that was extended from may 1997 to may 2007. Those patients with ARF or CRF that required tracheostomy as support for ventilation due to their base illness; and those with ARF or CRF in whom the ambulatory or intra-hospital implantation of a central catheter for hemodialysis was not possible were carefully identified. The implantation of a double lumen central catheter for hemodialysis in axillary vein by palpation or anatomical guide was offered as an alternative to both the patients and their families. The procedure was practiced to those that accepted and gave their written consent; radiologically confirming its location; establishing their functionability at the time, as well as the complications associated to the procedure and it permanency. 27 procedures were practiced in 26 patients. Average age: 54.6 years; 9 women and 17 men. 7 of them had ARF and 19 CRF. In two patients the axillary vein puncture was not possible. Of the 25 axillary catheters that were implanted, 1 was permanent and 24 transitory. The technique was used by anatomical references in 16 patients and by palpation in 8. In the patients 15 left axillary veins were canalized unlike the remaining 10 that were right axillary veins. 18 patients presented impossibility of obtaining an alternative central venous access (different to femoral) and 7 patients required tracheostomy. The radiological location was satisfactorily confirmed in 24 procedures (96%). The amount of time the catheters were used was an average of 68.6 days; 6 patients died with the catheter in use. The main cause for the catheter's removal was the transference to peritoneal dialysis. The axillary artery was accidentally punctured in 3 patients, one of whom presented a soft tissue hematoma without a major hemodynamics repercussion; this had a spontaneous resolution in a few weeks. The venous canalization was not possible in 3 patients. The implantation of bilumenes catheters for hemodialysis in patients with ARF or CRF is a relatively safe alternative to consider when other classical routes have totally spent or the patients present tracheostomy.

Due to the absence of severe hemoperitoneum in our peritoneal dialysis program, we retrospectively reviewed hemoperitoneum non-related with abdominal surgery or catheter placing. We analyzed its incidence, etiology, prognostic and clinical outcome, as well as the possible effect of recurrent hemoperitoneum on peritoneal function. A total of 132 patients were treated in our centre during a period of 173 months. Mean age at the beginning of peritoneal dialysis was 59+\/-17.1 years, 43.2% were females, and 22.8% of them were menstruating women. Twenty-two patients had at least one hemoperitoneum episode during follow-up, with an incidence of 17%. The mean time interval between the start of peritoneal dialysis and the first hemoperitoneum episode was 0.66+\/-0.94 years (range: 0.01-3.20 years). 73% were women. Most cases (59%) were due to menstruation. Remarkably, all the menstruating women presented hemoperitoneum at least once with a high incidence of recurrent episodes. The other hemoperitoneum episodes were mainly of unknown etiology (32% of patients), being this one the main cause in males. We only observed two more cases: a male who presented hemoperitoneum related to dicumarinic overdose and a female who presented hemoperitoneum due to mesenteric ischemia. All the 22 patients had a favourable outcome, except for the woman with mesenteric ischemia, what represented an incidence of 4.5% of severe hemoperitoneum. No significant association was found between episodes of hemoperitoneum and aspirin treatment, dicumarinic treatment or the presence of coagulopathy. There was no association either between recurrent hemoperitoneum and the number of peritonitis episodes, peritoneal function or technique survival. In conclusion, hemoperitoneum is a common and usually benign problem in peritoneal dialysis patients, frequently due to retrograde menstruation, and no deleterious long-term effects were found in patients with recurrent hemoperitoneum.","2217":"During the last decades, aerobic exercise programs have shown beneficial effects on quality of life of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) patients, but there is still little evidence on the benefits of resistance training programmes.

The mean value of the relation saline\/water is 2:1. Hypotonic fluids input is not clearly related to more intense hyponatremia; the latter appears to depend more on a reduced capacity of the kidney to generate sufficient free water output.

Disorders of calcium metabolism and vascular calcifications are common in dialysis patients but calciphylaxis prevalence is low in patients with end stage renal disease. So we proposed other emergent factors implicated in calciphylaxis development. We studied retrospective 8 patients who developed calciphylaxis in our service from january 2001 to december 2006. All patients were female with mean age at diagnosis 68.5+\/-6.7 years. All patients were receiving hemodialysis therapy and 6 patients had been receiving hemodialysis less than four months. Six patients had diabetes mellitus type II and all patients were obese (BMI &gt;25 kg\/m2). All patients had metabolic syndrome (APTIII) with bad control hypertension and 6 (75%) were receiving anticoagulation therapy with warfarin. Patients didn t have severe alterations of calcium metabolism, all had product calcium-phosphorus &lt;55. All patients developed low blood pressure at the beginning of dialysis treatment (98.3+\/-22.7\/60+\/-18,29 mmHg). 7 patients present proximal lesions in fatty regions like abdomen and thighs. Histopathologic examination reveals calcium deposits in arteriole-sized and small vessels with vascular thrombosis. Prognosis was poor, seven patients died secondary to a sepsis originated in infected cutaneous ulcers. calciphylaxis is a disease with poor prognosis and high mortality, without specific treatment actually. Female gender, obesity associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiometabolic syndrome, anticoagulant therapy with warfarin and low blood pressure associated with hemodialysis therapy, are risk factors to develop calciphylaxis, in absence of severe disorders of calcium metabolism. In these patients is important to avoid hypotension episodes during dialysis, dialysis hypotension appears to be an important risk factor who promotes ischemia of subcutaneous adipose tissue.

Both,congenital or acquired fistulas, are unusual causes of renal or heart failure. Congenital AV fistulas usually present with hematuria, while acquired ones are more likely to present with hemodynamic changes, such as hypertension, cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure. Here we present a 61 year-old woman studied before by probable pulmonary arteriovenous fistula and referred to nephrologist with a six-month history of dyspnea and peripheral edema. Physical examination was remarkable for an apical systolic ejective murmur as well as another bruit over the right pulmonary base. Blood tests showed a sCr of 1.7 mg\/dl with normal urinalysis. On imaging, renal duplex ultrasound showed a pulsatile hiliar mass on the right kidney with an arterial flow of 300 cm\/sec that was identified as a giant AV fistula on MRA. An echocardiogram revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with a cardiopulmonary output of 12,9 l\/min that doubled the systemic one (6,49 l\/min).

Blood samples were drawn at the third session of first and fourth week of each type of dialysis. Pre-dialysis blood acetate levels were similar in both groups, whereas post-dialysis blood acetate levels were higher in patients treated with conventional bicarbonate dialysate (0.48+\/- 0.64 vs. 0.18+\/-0.23 mmol\/L, p=0.024). Moreover, both periods had similar percentage of patients with pre-dialysis blood acetate levels in the pathologic range, whereas this percentage was higher in post-dialysis samples from patients treated with conventional bicarbonate dialysate respect to acetate-free dialysate (67% vs. 21%, p=0.001).

We didn't found significant differences in the other parameters studied except for the changes in serum concentrations of sodium, chloride and bicarbonate. Acetate-free bicarbonate dialysate does not expose patients to a big amount of acetate and allows that the majority of patients finished hemodialysis with blood acetate levels in the physiologic ranges. Acetate-free dialysate was safe and well tolerated by our hemodialysis patients, although clinical advantages derived from its use should be evaluated in long-term prospective studies. ","2246":"Symptomatic hypotension is the most frequent acute complication affecting patients during chronic hemodialysis treatment sessions. Many reports have demonstrated that the use of cool dialysate has a protective effect on blood pressure during hemodialysis treatments. In the present study, we investigated whether preventing the hyperthermic response had favourable effects on hemodynamic stability during the hemodialysis procedure while affording good tolerance to patients. We investigated the effect of thermal control of dialysate on hemodynamic stability in hypotension-prone patients in our center. Patients were eligible for the study if they had symptomatic hypotensive episodes (&gt; 3\/12session\/ month) during the screening phase. The study was designed with two phases for the same selected patients and two treatment arms, each phase lasting 4 weeks. In the first phase, we adjusted dialysate temperature on 36 masculineC for 12 sessions (cold dialysis) and in the second phase we used a device allowing the regulation of thermal balance (Blood Temperature Monitor; Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homberg, Germany), that keep body temperature unchanged (isothermic dialysis). Nine HD patients were enrolled and completed the study. During the screening phase the mean ultrafiltration was 4 1% of dry weight, and blood pressure decreased from 9916 to 8016 mm Hg (p&lt;0.001).

Eight patients (4.2%) developed SEP. Average age 45+\/-14 years (range 29-64 years), four was male. Time in CAPD was 72+\/-29 months (range 24-120 months). All patients have peritonitis previously (mean 3+\/-1).

The treatment was medical in six cases associated with surgery in four of them. The medical treatment was tamoxifen and\/or corticosteroids, associated with total parenteral nutrition in two patients and enteral nutrition in one. Surgery in six patients: three as urgent surgery (all died) and three as programme surgery (two live still). Etiology of died was: three for sepsis, one for peritonitis after bowel perforation, one for severe problems of nutrition. The average survival of three patients alive was 38+\/-17 months, two of them had programme surgery, and one with functioning transplant we opt for conservative treatment. The actuarial survival at 24 months was 51%. The SEP is a serious entity with high mortality.

Coronary artery calcification is more frequent, more extensive and progresses more rapidly in CKD than in general population. They are also considered a marker of coronary heart disease, with high prevalence and functional significance. It suggests that detection and surveillance may be worthwhile in general clinical practice. New non-invasive image techniques, like Multi-detector row CT, a type of spiral scanner, assess density and volume of calcification at multiple sites and allow quantitative scoring of vascular calcification using calcium scores analogous to those from electron-beam CT. We have assessed and quantified coronary artery calcification with 16 multidetector row CT in 44 patients on hemodialysis and their relationship with several cardiovascular risk factors. Coronary artery calcification prevalence was of 84 % with mean calcium score of 1580 +\/- 2010 ( r 0-9844) with calcium score &gt; 400 in 66% of patients. It was usually multiple, affecting more than two vessels in more than 50%. In all but one patient, left anterior descending artery was involved with higher calcium score level at right coronary artery. Advanced age, male, diabetes, smoking, more morbidity, cerebrovascular disease previous, and calcium-binders phosphate and analogous vitamin D treatment would seem to be associated with coronary artery calcification. Coronary artery calcification is very frequent and extensive, usually multiple and associated to modifiable risk factors in hemodialysis patients. Multi-detector-row CT seems an effective, suitable, readily applicable method to assess and quantify coronary artery calcification.","2249":"Chronic renal failure is becoming a public health problem.

Recently, proteins expressed by the podocyte were found to be important for the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier. Podocytes are injured in many forms of glomerulopathies, including minimal change disease (MCD) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The study was undertaken to determinate if synaptopodin immunoexpression in renal tissue specimens differs between patients with steroid-responsive MCD, steroid-resistant MCD, and FSGS. Synaptopodin immunoexpression was evaluated by immunoperioxidase staining with a mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody in 12 renal biopsy specimens in patients with steroid-responsive MCD, 10 renal tissues in steroid-resistant MCD, and in 14 renal biopsy specimens in patients with FSGS. As a control 10 tissue specimens of the kidneys removed because of trauma were used. Synaptopodin expression was quantified as a percentage of glomerular tuft by computerized image analysis system. In normal controls synaptopodin immunoexpression was seen in podocytes along the glomerular basement membrane in a finely linear pattern. No changes were found in synaptopodin immunoexpression in steroid-responsive MCD versus controls. In patients with steroid-resistant MCD and FSGS a granular pattern of synaptopodin immunoexpression was seen. Areas of sclerosis in patients with FSGS did not demonstrate synaptopodin expression. Statistical analysis showed significantly diminished synaptopodin immunoexpresion in glomeruli in patients with steroid-resistant MCD and FSGS as compared with steroid-responsive MCD group and controls. Moreover, in renal tissues in patients with FSGS the immunoexpression of synaptopodin was decreased in comparison with renal biopsies in patients with steroid-resistant MCD. our results suggest that abnormal distribution and reduced expression of synaptopodin may be associated with poor response to steroid therapy in MCD and FSGS.

Twenty-four of them had no hypercalciuria, 16 had absortive hypercalciuria and 11 had renal hypercalciuria. Group II: controls, composed by 21 people, without either urolithiasis or hypercalciuria. We performed a complete study including biochemical markers of bone mineral remodelling, bone mineral density (BMD) was estimated both in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and femoral neck, and also VDR polymorphism for the loci b, a and t. Patients with urolithiasis had lower values of BMD both in the lumbar spine and femoral neck, compared to controls. Z-score were lower in the lumbar spine and femoral neck (p =0,045 y 0,031, respectively). Those patients with absorptive hypercalciuria had higher BMD in the femoral neck than those with renal hypercalciuria and non-hypercalciuria. Because they had more weight and height all the statistical study was performed alter adjusting by these two variables and statistical significance was then only stated between patients with hypercalciuria and without it. Patients with urolithiasis had higher values of 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D (p=0,002), and lower of PTH (p=0,049), without any relationship to hypercalciuria and its subtypes. Seventy six percent of the patients had a daily calcium intake lower than 800 mg\/day.

Calcium kidney stone disease by itself produces a decrease in BMD, more intense in femoral neck, independently the presence or absence of hypercalciuria. Patients suffering from urolitihiasis have higher values of 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D than non-hypercalciuric patients and lower values of PTH probably due to a low dietary calcium intake.

Start dialysis (period A versus period B): 116 patients, age 59.9+15.5 years vs. 229 patients, age 64.0+15.8 years (p&lt;0.05). Non-dialysis (period A versus period B): 38 patients, age 77.5+9.3 years vs. 37 patients, age 81.7+6.2 years (p&lt;0.01). Renal function: serum creatinina 7.4+2.4 mg\/dl vs. 5.3+1.2 mg\/dl (p&lt;0.001), MDRD estimate glomerular filtration 6.9+2.4 mg\/dl ml\/min\/1.73 m2 vs. 10.0+2.3 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 (p&lt;0.001). Primary renal disease: unknown etiology 31.5 % vs. 24.3 %, nephroangiosclerosis 23.6 % vs. 32.4 %, diabetes 28.9 % vs. 21.6 %. Functional status: dependent patients 34.2 % vs 83.8 % (p&lt;0.001). The principal reason for non-dialysis were: personal decision: 26.3 % vs. 35.1 %, dementia 15.8 % vs. 29.7 %, brief life expectancy because of serious co-existing diseases 13.1 % vs. 21.7 % and serious chronic illness with inability for themselves care 44.7 % vs. 13.1 %. Comorbid conditions: 2.3+1.0 vs. 3.0+1.5 (p&lt;0.05). Survival: 55+168 days vs. 168+236 days (p&lt;0.001). Most of the patients that don't begin dialysis are elderly together with a poor functional capacity and with more autonomy in their decisions. The identification of patients with renal failure (stage V) was detected early in the last period than in the following one. The conservative management of non-dialyzed uremic patients is a significative nephrology clinical practice due to more survival of those persons. ","2287":"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in cyclosporin A (CsA) nephrotoxicity. As mitochondria are one of the main sources of ROS in cells, we evaluated the role of CsA in mitochondrial structure and function in LLC-PK1 cells. We incubated cells with CsA 1 microM for 24 hours and studies were performed with flow citometry and confocal microscopy. We studied mitochondrial NAD(P)H content, superoxide anion (O2.-) production (MitoSOX Red), oxidation of cardiolipin of inner mitochondrial membrane (NAO) and mitochondrial membrane potential (DIOC2(3)). Also we analyzed the intracellular ROS synthesis (H2DCF-DA) and reduced glutation (GSH) of cells. Our results showed that CsA decreased NAD(P)H and membrane potential, and increased O2.- in mitochondria. CsA also provoked oxidation of cardiolipin. Furthermore, CsA increased intracellular ROS production and decreased GSH content. These results suggest that CsA has crucial effects in mitochondria. CsA modified mitochondrial physiology through the decrease of antioxidant mitochondrial compounds as NAD(P)H and the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential and increase of oxidants as O2.-. Also, CsA alters lipidic structure of inner mitochondrial membrane through the oxidation of cardiolipin. These effects trigger a chain of events that favour intracellular synthesis of ROS and depletion of GSH that can compromise cellular viability. Nephrotoxic cellular effects of CsA can be explained, at least in part, through its influence on mitochondrial functionalism.","2288":"","2289":"","2290":"","2291":"The questions are if old recipients from old donor have more incidence of delayed graft function and if antagonists of Il-2 receptors use decreased the incidence of NTA post-transplant. To answer the first question we have come to information from registry and uni or multicenter studies. We have used the Irish normograme that included 16 clinical questions from donors, recipients and kidney transplant. We concluded that age of donors increases likelihood of delayed graft function. The second question is answered in the literature with information of a meta-analysis with 38 clinical studies. Of them 9 (1.380 patients) studied delayed graft function and are against placebo. The odds ratio for delayed graft function was 0.87(IC 95% 0,72 a 1,06). Therefore, at the moment, we can conclude that the utilization of antagonists of Il-2 receptors does not have protective effect to NTA.","2292":"","2293":"","2294":"","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"","2299":"","2300":"","2301":"We present the case of a 53 years old man with a cadaveric kidney transplant under cyclosporin A and prednisolone therapy.

Using a prevalent cross-sectional sample of Spanish HD patients (n = 613) from the second stage of the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study to determine the percentage with low dialysis dose, hyperphosphatemia, hypercalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, anemia, and catheter use and based on the mortality hazard ratios and the total HD population in Spain, according to the Spanish Society of Nephrology Report, we estimated the number of patient life years that could potentially be gained in our country. These characteristics of HD practice were selected because each is modifiable through changes in practice, each is associated with mortality, and each has a large number of patients outside the target guidelines. The targets that define \"within guidelines\" are as follows: dialysis dose (single pool Kt\/V &gt;1.2), anemia (hemoglobin &gt;110 g\/L), albumin after standardization (&gt;40 g\/L), serum phosphorus (1.1-1.5 mmol\/L), serum calcium (2.1-2.4 mmol\/L), and facility catheter use (&lt;10%). Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate the relative risk of mortality for all patients outside each guideline. In all models, calcium values were adjusted for low serum albumin. A separate Cox survival model adjusted for all six HD practices simultaneously to account for correlation that may exist between some facility practices. All models were adjusted for age, sex, race, time on ESRD, and 14 summary comorbid conditions. Patient years attributable to each of the six practice patterns were estimated and are reported here as the potential patient years gained. Comparison of the estimates by individual guideline shows that, in Spain, increasing patient albumin above 40 g\/L in all patients would lead to an estimated gain of 9,269 patient years (a 7.9% increase). Additionally, if all facilities could decrease catheter use to less than 10%, 2,842 patient years could be gained (a 2.4% increase). Though it may be an unrealistic goal, if all Spanish patients currently outside the guidelines achieved all six target levels, an estimated 17,300 life years could be gained over the next five years (a 15% increase). A more achievable goal of bringing 50% of patients who are currently outside targets within targets would result in 9,266 life years gained. In conclusion, this analysis suggests large opportunities to improve HD patient care in Spain.","2305":"The CDU is a noninvasive vascular access (VA) monitoring technique that provides both structural and hemodynamic information from vessels. The aim of this prospective study was to analyze some parameters of forearm vessels by CDU before and after RCF creation at the wrist. We explored by CDU the vessels of forearm in 34 CRF patients (pts) (mean age 63.915.1 yr, sex M:76.5%;F:23.5%, 26.5% diabetes, 73.5% already on HD at the time of RCF placement). Forearm CDU evaluation was planned twice: before RCF creation (first exploration FE) and after two months of successful RCF cannulation for HD by 2 needles at Qb&gt;250 ml\/min (second exploration SE). All CDU examinations were performed by the same radiologist with 5-10 MHz linear transducer (Doppler angle &lt; or = 60 degrees) at two proximal and distal points of the forearm (the values were averaged) using the Aspen machine (Siemens-Acuson, Mountain View, CA). We measured by CDU parameters from radial artery RA (diameter RAd, peak systolic velocity PSV, resistive index RI, blood flow rate RAflow), cephalic vein CV (diameter CVd) and arterialized vein AV (diameter AVd, blood flow rate AVflow). RAflow or AVflow calculation by CDU: time average velocity (mean of three cardiac cycles) (m\/s) x cross-sectional area (mm2) x 60. RCF outcome: functioning RCF (FRCF) suitable for routine HD 61.8% (mean age 61.214.5 yr, 23.8% diabetes), or non-functioning RCF 38.2% (mean age 68.215.5 yr, 30.8% diabetes) due to: early thrombosis (within 24 hours after operation, ETRCF) 14.7%, lack of RCF maturation (LMRCF) 5.9%, last thrombosis (between 24 hours after operation and SE by CDU, LTRCF) 17.6%. Between FE and SE by CDU at RA, overall mean RAd (3.2 +\/- 0.3 vs 5.5 +\/- 1.0 mm), mean PSV (59.9 +\/- 12.4 vs 166.6 +\/- 58.2 cm\/s) and mean RAflow (67.9 +\/- 27.4 vs 1297.1 +\/- 683.1 ml\/min) increased significantly (for all comparisons, p&lt;0.001), and mean RI (0.9 +\/- 0.2 vs 0.40. +\/- 0.1) decreased significantly (p&lt;0.001); we also found a significant difference when overall mean CVd (2.9 +\/- 0.6 mm) and mean AVd (5.7 +\/- 1.1 mm) were compared (p&lt;0.001). Overall and distal mean RAflow at FE by CDU were lower in pts with ETRCF (33.6 +\/- 19.6 and 26.0 +\/- 16.7 ml\/min, respectively) compared to pts with FRCF (67.9 +\/- 27.4 and 48.0 +\/- 21.3 ml\/min, respectively) (p=0.015 and p=0.029, respectively). Pts with ETRCF and LMRCF considered together (20.6%), had lower overall mean RAd (2.80.4 mm) and distal mean RAflow (28.1 +\/ 15.2 ml\/min) at FE by CDU compared to pts with FRCF (3.2 +\/ 0.3 mm and 48.0 +\/- 21.3 ml\/min, respectively) (p=0.015 and p=0.031, respectively). No significant differences between pts with LTRCF and FRCF were found when overall and distal mean RAd, PSV, RI, RAflow and CVd obtained at FE by CDU were compared (for all comparisons, p=NS), but all pts with LTRCF underwent HD at the time of RCF creation compared to 57.1% of pts with FRCF (p=0.049). Pts with FRCF who had overall mean AVflow = 800 ml\/min (38.1%, mean AVflow: 602.5167.3 ml\/min) showed lower overall mean RAflow at SE by CDU compared to pts with FRCF who had overall mean AVflow&gt;800 ml\/min (61.9%, mean AVflow: 1113.9 +\/- 160.1 ml\/min): 820.1 +\/- 188.7 vs 1590.7 +\/- 715.4 ml\/min (p=0.002). We found a positive correlation between overall mean AVflow and mean RAflow obtained at SE by CDU (r = 0.52, p = 0.016). 1) All parameters of forearm vessels measured by CDU changed after RCF placement. 2) Preoperative mean RAflow is predictive of RCF outcome. 3) Mean AVflow is related to mean RAflow obtained at SE by CDU. ","2306":"Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is the main expression of uremic cardiomyopathy. Alteration of the diastolic function is frequently associated with LVH, indicating future cardiovascular events. Recent studies suggest that the Tissue Doppler (TID) of the mitral annulus obtains parameters of diastolic function that are not influenced by other factors, unlike what occurs with the pulsed Doppler (PD), and that the relationship between the velocity of the proto-diastolic waves of both techniques (E\/E') would be the most important datum to diagnose a diastolic malfunction. The objective of this study is to verify LVH prevalence in a population of End Stage Renal Disease patients (ESRD) in peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and to study diastolic function, comparing the results of both techniques (PD\/TID), as well as the possible causes that determine the appearance of diastolic malfunction in these patients. We carried out a cross-section study with 42 patients in peritoneal dialysis. All patients had an ejection fraction of over 50% and had no clinical signs of heart failure, valvular heart disease or arrhytmia. A basic biochemistry, residual renal function, C-reactive protein and an ultrasonic study with M-mode doppler, pulsed doppler and tissue doppler of the mitral annulus, were performed in all patients. 26.2% of the patients had a concentric LVH, 14.3% an asymmetric LVH and 23.8% a concentric growth. The PD showed an E\/A ratio under 0.75 in 20 cases (which would indicate an alteration of ventricular relaxation), an E\/A between 0.75 and 1.5 in 22 (normal or pseudonormal pattern) and none with an E\/A over 1.5. On the other hand, the TID showed: 24 patients with an E\/A &lt; 0.75, 16 between 0.75 and 1.5, and 2 with an E\/A &gt; 1.5. The E\/E' proportion was normal in 13 cases(&lt; 8), intermediate in 12 (8-10), and greater than 10 in 17, expressing a clear diastolic malfunction. Twelve of the 17 with diastolic malfunction had a pseudo-normal pattern with the PD. A relationship was observed between the E\/A and age and hs-CRP. A relationship was also found between RRF, ejection fraction and diastolic pressure (p = 0.03, r = 0.32 and p = 0.006, r = 0.29), while, in the multivariant study, the presence of LVH was the only variable with enough significance to influence the diastolic malfunction (odds ratio of 7.6). Patients in CAPD have a high incidence of diastolic malfunction. LVH, present in a high percentage of patients, is one of the factors that favours its appearance. The non-invasive TID technique and the E\/E' ratio have shown to be more sensitive than the PD in diagnosing a diastolic malfunction. ","2307":"The discrepancies among data reported by using olive oil (OO) in humans appear to be due to the great differences between the different OO used. Based on structure\/function relationships we have chemically optimized an OO through the rational mixture (\"coupage\") of several Spanish extra virgin olive oils (methodology \"oHo\"). Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop a progressive picture of malnutrition and inflammation that lead them to an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. In a pilot, randomised trial the nutritional efficacy and safety of \"oHo\" were evaluated in 32 patients (mean age 60,8 +\/- 13,2 years old; 16 women) with CKD (KDIGO stages 4-5) at predialysis. After a 7 days wash out for statins and ACE inhibitors 19 patients had \"oHo\" at doses of 60 mL\/day (20 mL t.i.d) for 30 consecutive days, whilst 13 patients remain as a control group without \"oHo\". At the end of the study only patients having \"oHo\" showed significant increases of serum albumin (p&lt;0.05) and not significant increases of total proteins, weight, and BMI. Total cholesterol (p&lt;0.05) and HDL-cholesterol (p&lt;0.01) increased with \"oHo\". The number of cases with pathologic HOMA-IR in the control group increased from 1 to 2 patients whilst in the \"oHo\" group decreased from 2 to none. No significant changes of minerals, arterial pressure, hemoglobin, and other parameters related to CKD were seen. After a 30 days follow-up in the \"oHo\" group all parameters came back to basal ones, excepting for blood pressure that significantly decreased (p&lt;0,05). Tolerance was excellent and constipation significantly diminished (p&lt;0,001) in the \"oHo\" group. Of importance, none of these biological changes were seen in regular consumers of other conventional olive oils (control group). These intriguing results, seen by the first time, appear to partially satisfy the recent claims (\"reverse epidemiology\") about the need of a more correct nutrition in CKD patients. However, these data need to be proved in more larger trials as well as in CKD patients under dialysis with harder inflammatory\/malnutrition conditions.","2308":"The rate of oxalate absorbed from intestine is highly influenced by calcium intake in healthy subjects. It is unknown whether commonly used phosphate binders modify intestinal absorption and renal excretion of oxalate in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. This study aims to determine if calcium carbonate or sevelamer influences on urinary oxalate excretion. Twenty patients with CKD (stage 4 and 5 pre-dialysis) were included. Two treatment (1500 mg of calcium carbonate or 2400 mg of sevelamer), two-period (21 days each), crossover study with balanced assignment of the order of administration, and two washout periods were the main characteristics of this study design. Laboratory analyses in each phase included: serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, bicarbonate, total cholesterol, and 24 h urinary excretion of oxalate, creatinine, and urea. Creatinine clearance, protein catabolic rate (PNNA), total urinary oxalate excretion, and urinary oxalate \/ creatinine ratio were determined. Seventeen patients completed both treatment sequences. Total urinary oxalate excretion and urinary oxalate \/ creatinine ratios decreased significantly with respect to washout periods either after sevelamer or calcium carbonate treatment. The decrease in urinary oxalate excretion was greater after calcium carbonate (41.2+\/-17.4%) than after sevelamer treatment (30.4+\/-23.8%). There were not significant changes in renal function or PNNA values throughout the study periods. In conclusion, either calcium carbonate or sevelamer significantly reduces urinary oxalate excretion in CKD patients. Further studies will be needed to ascertain whether the type of phosphate binder influences on the accumulation of oxalate in CKD patients.","2309":"Intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCP) in combination with oral steroids (ST) is the most widely accepted therapy for severe lupus nephritis (LN); however, its side effects, lack of response and relapses, have led to other treatment alternatives. being sought. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to be effective in these cases. We studied the course over 12 months of 28 patients with LN WHO class III(n=3), IV(n=22) or V(n=3), with 38,1 +\/- 11,4 tears of age, proteinuria 4,2 +\/- 2,6 g \/24 hours and serum creatinine 1,4 +\/- 0,8 mg\/dL, who, after being initially treated with ST and IVCP, showed no response(n=21), frequent relapses(n=6), or adverse side effects(n=1). All patients were treated with MMF in doses of 1000 to 2000 mg\/day combined with ST or cyclosporine for one year. Four patients withdrew from treatment before the end of the follow-up. None of the patients who completed the study showed changes in hematologic parameters. Creatinine and creatinine clearance remained stable. Resulted in a significant improvement; serum albumine (3 +\/- 0,8 vs 3,9 +\/- 0,5 g\/dL) p&lt;0.01, and decreased of proteinuria (4,2 +\/- 2,6 vs 1,8 +\/- 2,2 g\/ 24 hours) p&lt;0.05, complement fractions improvement significantly, C3 and CH50 p&lt;0.05, C4 p&lt;0.01. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-DNA antibodies decreased significantly (p&lt;0.05). During follow-up, a reduction in the ST dose was achieved: 18.3 +\/- 10,5 vs 10,1 +\/- 4,1 mg\/24h (p&lt;0.01). Three mild side effects related to MMF were observed and only 1 case required discontinuation of treatment. We concluded that MMF is a useful drug in the treatment and control of lupus nephritis, which also allows for a significant reduction in the dose of ST, with minimal side effects.","2310":"Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is a purine synthesis inhibitor commonly used as immunosupresive agent in transplantation. Kidney grafts undergo more or less prolonged cold ischemia after harvesting which results in variable degrees of ischemia reperfusion injury. To determine whether the inhibition of early events of cellular infiltration may influence the severity of damage induced by ischemic acute renal failure, 45 Sprague Dawley rats were given MMF at a dose of 20mg\/kg\/day (MMF-rats) by gavage 2 days before (pre-MMF group, n=15) or after (post-MMF group, n=15) clamping the left renal artery for 40 minutes followed by rigt-sided nephrectomy. (control group, n=15) received vehicle. Serum Creatinine (Screat) was measured daily in all groups. On the 2nd post-ischemic day Screat was significantly lower (p=0.001) in pre-MMF group compared with post-MMF group and control group (4 +\/- 2mg\/dl post-MMF group vs 1.7 +\/- 1.2 mg\/dl pre-MMF group, control group 5+\/-2, p&lt; 0.05). Kidney biopsies shown that the histologic damage was 54 +\/- 28% in post-MMF group vs 34+\/- 22% in pre-MMF group and 61 +\/- 25% in control group (pre-MMF vs post-MMF, p NS). On the 5th day post-ischemic, MMF-rats showed more severe tubulointerstitial necrosis (pre-MMF group: 17 +\/- 20 %, post-MMF group: 33 +\/- 27%) than controls (4 +\/- 5%). The severity of ATN was significantly higher in post-MMF group compared with controls (p=0.01). Tubulointersticial T-lymphocyte (T CD 5) and monocyte (ED 1) infiltration evaluated on the 2nd post-ischemic day was less intense in group I (T CD5: 3 +\/- 3, ED 1: 10 +\/- 9, cel\/mm2) compared to post-MMF group (T CD 5: 10 +\/- 4, ED 1: 55 +\/- 40) and to control group (T CD 5: 10+\/- 4, ED 1: 64 +\/- 46). However, on the 5th post-ischemia day, ED 1 infiltration was significantly higher in post-MMF group (24 +\/- 18%) compared to pre-MMF group (5 +\/- 5, p NS) and also in pre-MMF group vs control group (31 +\/- 33, p&lt; 0.05). Our results suggest that MMF given before a renal ischemic insult may reduce the severity of histologic damage resulting from ischemia reperfusion injury.","2311":"HIV nephropathy (HIVAN) is the most frequent cause of chronic renal failure in HIV-infected black patients. However, the prevalence of other glomerulopathies mediated by immunocomplexes has increased in the last years. We report on the glomerular diseases observed in HIV patients in our Hospital. A retrospective study of all patients with HIV infection and glomerular diseases diagnosed by renal biopsy. We found 27 patients with the following glomerular diseases: membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) in 8 patients, non-collapsing focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in 7, IgA nephropaty (IgA N) in 6, collapsing glomerulosclerosis in 4 (HIVAN, and membranous nephropaty (MN) in 2. Most of patients were young white men. A high prevalence of coinfection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) (77.8%) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) (37%) was found. At diagnosis, most of patients (90%) had proteinuria, with nephrotic syndrome in 52% of them; 59% presented with acute renal failure. Nine patients (33%) showed malignant hypertension at diagnosis: this complication was particularly common among IgA N patients (4\/6, 66%).

A manual search was done by reviewing the references in the corresponding topic of UpToDate. Data were extracted by two author and their methodological quality was assessed according to the Cochrane Renal Group recommendations that include the procedure for assigning, blinding, intention to treat analysis, and follow-up. OUTCOMES VARIABLES: All data relating to mortality were extracted, specifying the time of collection, time and circumstances (mortality in the ICU or hospitalization). Values gathered are expressed as mortality rates in both the experimental group (CVVHDF) and the control group (IHD), indicating the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and its 95% confidence interval. OUTCOMES AGGREGATION: Studies meeting clinical and methodological homogeneity criteria were combined with the fix effect model by using the Review Manager tool from Cochrane Collaboration. Methodological heterogeneity was analyzed by using the chi-squared test for n-1 freedom degrees, with an alpha value of 0.05. A sensitivity analysis was done adjusting for methodological quality to confirm the results obtained. Seven clinical trials directly comparing the survival of severe ARF patients in a prospective, randomized, and controlled way were identifiec. Almost all published estudies have quality problems because of being too small to study survival rates, treatment allocation problems and high numbers of loss to follow-up, differences in initial severity levels, or to premature study closure. When combining the results, it was observed that mortality was 64% for IHD and 65% for CVVHDF, with a relative risk of 0.98 (95% CI 0.89-1.07), p = 0.65, with no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies included. When excluding from the analysis the most questionable study due to selection bias, high loss to follow-up (21%), and baseline differences in co-variables influencing the study outcomes, the results are not changed, the observed mortality was 67% for extra-renal intermittent depurative techniques versus 65% for continous ones, with a relative risk of 1.03 (95% CI 0.94-1.14), p = 0.54, again with no statistically significant heterogeneity between studies included. CVVHDF does not offer any benefit as compared to IHD in terms of survival and according to available data from the literature. However, continuous techniques bring other potential benefits such as hemodynamic stability, better tolerability of ultrafiltration, and depuration of solutes, which merit a systematic review to estimate and quantify their magnitude, and which would allow for better defining their place in the therapeutic armamentarium available for this high-mortality condition.

Valproic acid intoxication with suicide attempt is a relatively common clinical problem that can result in coma, respiratory depression, pancytopenia, hemodynamic instability and death. The drug's relatively low molecular weight, small volume of distribution and saturable protein-binding render it potentially amenable to exracorporeal removal (hemodialysis, hemoperfusion or hemofiltration ), but published experience is scarce. We describe a case report involving valproic acid intoxication with ingestion of ethanol, who was successfully treated with charcoal hemoperfusion. With this treatment the half-life of valproic acid was reduced with rapid lowering of valproic acid levels and clinical improvement. Based on our experience in this patient and a review of previously reported cases, charcoal hemoperfusion should be considered for serious valproic acid intoxication because free as well as bound drug fractions are eliminated via this technique.","2348":"Studies analyzing the economic cost of dialysis therapy have raised a considerable interest in the nephrologic community, both inside and outside our country. The objective of the present study was to approach this question from a different point of view, by applying the cost-per-procedure method, according to clinical protocol, to all the routine clinical procedures in our dialysis unit (both Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis). We analyzed 68 routine protocols (42 for Hemodialysis and 26 for peritoneal Dialysis), carrying out a pormenorized study of all the components of the economic cost of each procedure (personnel, laboratory, surgical and sanitary material, drugs and other concepts). We calculated the final cost of all these procedures after individualizing the different components of the economic spends, with the informatic support of the management department of our center, and in coordination with the data bases of the Pharmacy and General Supplies units. Although the initial implementation of this method is tedious, it subsequently allows to analyze the global cost of therapy in the Unit, as also the cost of certain subsets, or even particular patients, in a simple and flexible way. Moreover, the system is easy to update, as clinical protocols undergo changes or the economic cost of individual components vary. Finally, this method is a useful tool at the time of comparing the cost of clinical procedures in different centres, according to their varying clinical protocols, economic spends and clinical results.","2349":"A prospective cohort study was undertaken to compare the rates of the infecting microorganisms of the peritoneal catheter exit-site in three periods of the prophylactic protocol of a peritoneal dialysis program. All patients treated for more than one month on Peritoneal Dialysis were included: Fourty-eight in Period 1 (P1), 48 in Period 2 (P2), and 54 in Period 3 (P3). Each period was of 3 years. Infection prophylaxis protocol: P1: hydrogen peroxide or povidone iodine and non-occlusive dressing; P2: sterile water (boiled water) instead of antiseptic agents, semi-permeable dressing for taking showers, and nasal mupirocine prophylaxis for Staphylococcus aureus carriers; P3: equal to P2, plus local application of antibiotics in equivocal exit-site for infection and argentic nitrate in granulation tissue. The rates of catheter infection and microorganisms causing infection were analysed by means of the Poisson regression method. Chi-square and ANOVA when appropriate. The proportion of catheters implanted by nephrologist or surgeon (p&lt;0.01) and modality treatment by CAPD or CCPD (p&lt;0.0001) were significantly different in the three periods, while the Staph. Aureus carrieres was in the limit of significance (p=0.048). Throughout the three periods, a significantly decreasing rate of total (P=0.0035) and acute infections (P&lt;0.001), Staph. aureus (P=0.003) and peritonitis (P=0.0025) were found. The Pseudomonas aer. (P=0.006) and Gram negative Bacteria (P=0.023) decreased significantly in P2. The multiple factor analysis included eight factors: sex, age group, ESRD, DM, catheter implantation (nephrologist, surgeon), modality treatment (CAPD, CCPD), manufacturer and prophylaxis period as possible predictors of the catheter infections, the specific microorganisms and the peritonitis. That analysis revealed the prophylaxis period as the main predictive factor of the improvements found (p&lt;0.02,- p&lt;0.001). In contrast, the Corynebacteria spp. increased significantly (P=0.008) throughout the three periods. One half of the Corynebacteria in each period could be considered colonisers. The other half caused true infections, but not one of those episodes required catheter intervention. The non-diphtheria Corynebacteria increase was found related with the continuous cycling Peritoneal Dialysis treatment in multiple factor analysis (p=0.0023) and in the proportion analysis (P=0.039, c2). The progressive protocol applied obtained good results, without the continued use of local antiseptics or antibiotics at the exit-site. However, the non-diphtheria Corynebacteria sp. infection increment favours the consideration of an antiseptic agent for the exit-site care. ","2350":"The effectiveness of the erythropoietic response can be evaluated using the resistance index (RI) to erythropoietic agents (EA) that measures the relationship between the dose administered and the hemoglobin levels attained. In a hemodialysis population, the RI is associated with several clinical and biochemical parameters, such as albumin levels, C-reactive protein (CRP), body mass index (BMI) and Kt\/V. This index therefore reflects an important group of parameters that indicate comorbidities and measures the effectiveness of the treatment received. A substantial proportion of chronic hemodialysis patients show a relative resistance to human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and require high doses to reach hemoglobin levels above 11 g\/dl. Darbepoetin alpha is a new erythropoietic agent with a longer half-life than rHuEPO and greater biological activity in vivo. Furthermore, it remains at clinically effective plasma levels for much longer than rHuEPO. This study evaluated the effect on RI of switching from epoetin alpha to darbepoetin alpha in hemodialysis patients requiring i.v. rHuEPO at either high ( &gt;10,000 UI\/w) or low ( &lt;4,000 UI\/w) doses, compared to a control group receiving epoetin alpha. Unlike the control group, both groups of patients who switched to darbepoetin alpha showed a reduction in RI and a progressive reduction in the dose required of darbepoetin alpha with respect to the equivalent dose at treatment conversion. In the group requiring high doses, darbepoetin alpha RI (DRI) at week 24 was a significant 23.9% lower than epoetin alpha RI (ERI) at conversion (week 0) (p &lt;0.01). In the group requiring low doses, DRI at week 24 was 13.4% lower than the ERI at conversion (p = NS). In both control groups, ERI at week 24 was higher than ERI at week 0. All groups showed stable hemoglobin levels across the study, with mean levels between 11.5 and 13.3 g\/dl. CRP at week 24 was significantly related to albumin levels (p &lt;0.001). In conclusion, switching hemodialysis patients from epoetin alpha to darbepoetin alpha was associated with a significant improvement in RI in the group of patients with high doses of EA, which we consider to be an important indicator of the effectiveness and quality of the treatment administered.","2351":"Delay in perform the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to begin haemodialysis is a major problem in the renal units in our country. Two nephrologists initiated, to solve this problem in its own hospital, to perform AVF from December 2001 to December 31st, 2004. Results were compared to surgical service which performed AVF until December 2001. Reduction in surgical waiting time to perform AVF and percent of patients without AVF at time of initiate haemodialysis treatment are the main results in nephrologists group. No technical differences are found between both groups. These differences come from integral management of AVF, with own and programmed surgical theatre, managed in the office, individualized the patients requirements, and a major surgical flux managed by nephrologists. We conclude that hospitals with a program similar to us with integral approach of AVF and vascular access coordinator, the vascular access could be managed in an efficacy way.","2352":"The gestational hypertension -HG- and preeclampsia -P- are hypertensive diseases whose pathogenic mechanism has not been determined yet. The aim of this work is to define some patterns of vasoactive factors release that allow to explain the origin of the differences between both entities. Prospective case-control study. Two groups of target patients were consecutively selected, GH (n=21) and P patients (n=21). Every patient was matched with a pregnant of similar age and week of pregnancy. Two control groups were obtained, one respect to the GH and another one respect to the P group. A biochemistry, blood cell count, coagulation and quantification of vasoactive factors endothelin, nitrites and GMPc were performed in every woman. Results of GH and P groups were compared with their respective control group with the paired Student's t Test. Both systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were higher in hypertensive pregnants (GH and P) than in their respective controls. Moreover, blood endothelin and GMPc were higher in GH and P. GH pregnants showed decreased norepinephrine and increased epinephrine urinary excretion , as well as an increased plasma nitrites concentration than control group. P patients did not show statistically significant differences in catecholamines urinary excretion nor in plasma nitrites concentration respect their control group. There are relevant differences in the synthesis patterns of vasoactive factors between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. These differences could account for a decreased tissue perfusion in preeclampsia and could also contribute to the genesis of the renal dysfunction of this entity.

The study was made in 84 nondialyzed patients with chronic renal disease in stage 4 or 5. The glomerular filtration rate was measured on a 24-hour urine collection as the arithmetic mean of the urea and creatinine clearances (CUrCr). In each patient, the difference between each estimating equation and the measured glomerular filtration rate was calculated. The absolute difference expressed as a percentage of the measured glomerular filtration rate indicates the intermethod variability. In the total group the glomerular filtration rate measured as the CUrCr was de 13,5+\/-5,1 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2); and the results of the estimating equations were: classic CG 14,2+\/-5 (p&lt;0,05); corrected CG 12+\/-4,2 (p&lt;0,01) and MDRD : 12,1+\/-4,8 ml\/min\/1.73 m(2) (p&lt;0,01). The variability of the estimating equations was 15,2+\/-12,2%, 17,1+\/-13,4 % and 19,3+\/-13,3% (p&lt;0,05), for classic CG, corrected CG and MDRD respectively. The percent of estimates falling within 30% above o below the measured glomerular filtration rate was 90% for CG classic, 87% for corrected CG and 79% for MDRD. The intraclass correlation coefficients respect to CUrCr were 0,86 for classic CG, 0,81 for corrected CG and 0,77 for MDRD. The MDRD variability, but not classic CG variability or corrected CG variability, showed a positive correlation with the glomerular filtration rate (r=0,25, p&lt;0,05). In patients with chronic renal disease in stage 5, the variability of the different estimating equations was similar. We conclude that in our population with advanced chronic renal failure the classic CG equation is more accurate than the MDRD equation. Corrected CG equation has not any advantage respect to classic CG equation.","2355":"This cross-sectional, multicenter study investigated the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and associated disorders, in an adult population sample (&gt; 18 years old) attending Primary Care services in Spain. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (Modification Diet in Renal Disease equation) was used for analysis of kidney disease prevalence according to NFK-KDOQI (The National Kidney Foundation-Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) stages. Data were collected on serum creatinine, other laboratory parameters blood pressure, and medical history of cardiovascular risk factors or disease (hypertension, dislypidemia, diabetes, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral arteriopathy) in 7,202 patients attending Primary Care Centers. 47.3% were males, mean age 60,6 +\/- 14,3 years, BMI 28.2 +\/- 5.3, with 27,6% overweight (27-30 kg\/m2) and 32,1% obese (BMI&gt;or=30 kg\/m2), The prevalence of cardiovascular risks factors were: absence in 17.3%, one factor 26.9% two 31.2%, and 23.6% presented three or more The frequency of CV risk factors was: hypertension (66.7%), dyslipidemia (48%) and diabetes (31.5%). Congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral vascular disease frequency was lower than 10% The prevalence of eGFR &lt; 60 ml\/min x 1.73 m2 was: stage 3 (30-59 ml\/min\/1.73 m2) 19.7%; stage 4 (15-29 ml\/min\/1.73 m2) 1.2%; stage 5 no dialysis (GFR &lt; 15 ml\/min) 0.4%.

Of the total patients with eGFR &lt; 60 ml\/min 37.3% had normal serum creatinine levels. This study documents the substantial prevalence of significantly abnormal renal function among patients at Primary Care level. Early identification and appropriate nephrological management of these patients with renal disease is an important opportunity for an adequate prescription of drugs that interfere with renal function, to delay the progression of renal disease and modify CV risk factors.","2356":"","2357":"","2358":"","2359":"","2360":"","2361":"","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"","2365":"","2366":"","2367":"","2368":"","2369":"","2370":"","2371":"Failed renal allografts often are left in situ in patients who revert to chronic dialysis therapy or who undergo retransplantation. These organs may be the site of massive calcification despite their lack of physiological function. Calcification of an endstage renal allograft is sometimes found incidentally. We report here two patients who developed extensive calcification of the renal graft, one was on chronic hemodialysis and the other had a second renal transplantation with normal renal function. The precise pathogenesis of calcification and the factors which determine its tissue localization are unclear. Factors postulated to promote the development of metastatic calcification include an elevated calcium phosphate product, severe secondary hyperparathyroidism, aluminium toxicity and duration of dialytic therapy. In some cases local factors related with the chronic inflammatory rejection process are probably involved as well. However, the exact relative contribution of these factors remains unresolved. Unless specific clinical indications are present, transplant nephrectomy is not necessary for calcified end-stage renal allografts.","2372":"Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has immunoregulatory functions. In renal transplant, IVIG has been used as an immunosupressor agent only during short period of time and frequently associated to others immunosupressor drugs. In renal transplant IVIG has been used to treat refractory rejection but not as maintenance immunosupressor treatment. We report a case in which IVIG was used as principal immunosupressor agent close to low doses of iv methylprednisolone. The patient could not receive anything by oral way during three months, so she only could be treated by intravenous way. It is the first time that IVIG is used as maintenance immunosupressortreatment for a long time (three months) without secondary effects.","2373":"Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is an infrequent disease with a subtle initial presentation and a variable course, necessitating a high index of suspicion to make the correct diagnosis. In chronic failure patients on haemodialysis it becomes even more difficult to suspect this entity since the high prevalence of secondary hyperparathyroidism(SHP). Two patients with PC out of a series of 160 patients with moderate-to-severe SHP submitted for parathyroidectomy are reported. Their clinical features are compared with those of the twenty-two cases previously reported in the literature with a discussion of this pathology. Patients with PC showed higher blood levels of iPTH, total calcium, phosphate and total alkaline phosphatase than the SHP population. The final diagnosis of PC was made after histological study revealing capsular or blood vessel invasion.","2374":null,"2375":"Chronic inflammatory diseases and infections are a major cause of hyporesponse to erythropoiesis-stimulating factors. We conducted this prospective study in 107 patients in haemodialysis with dialysis liquid that was potentially contaminated from a bacteriological perspective in order to test the hypothesis that ultrapure dialysis liquid can improve the response to treatment with darbepoetin and reduce inflammatory markers. These patients had to have been stable in the last 8 weeks in relation to haemoglobin level and the administered dose of darbepoetin. Two filters (one of hydrophilic nylon and another of polysulfone) were added to the water treatment process, the first one prior to distribution ring output and the second before the dialyser. The patients were evaluated for 12 months. The dosage of darbepoetin was varied to maintain haemoglobin levels ranging from 11 to 14 g\/dl. We measured resistance to the erythropoiesis-stimulating factor, defined as the quotient between weekly dose of darbepoetin and haemoglobin levels, baseline and every two months, the baseline and monthly endotoxin count and reactive protein C at baseline and every 6 months. 94 patients completed the study. The resistance index fell significantly during follow-up (p&lt;0.001) and was measurable from the second month on. Haemoglobin levels remained within the established margins with a 34% reduction in the weekly dose of darbepoetin at the end of the follow-up period. Both reactive protein C and the endotoxin count were significantly reduced (p&lt;0.001) compared to baseline after 6 and 12 months. To conclude, the bacteriological purity of the dialysis liquid reduces inflammatory markers in patients receiving haemodialysis, improving the response to treatment with darbepoetin in renal anaemia.","2376":"There is a serious lack of data in literature on the quality of dialysate used in haemodialysis units throughout Spain and there also exist discrepancies between clinical guides on criteria related to dialysate bacteriological quality.

The manifestations of this Syndrome are fever, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, hypotension, liver dysfunction and renal failure. We studied to the 29 patients diagnosed in (January of 2002 - December of 2004) of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), which were treated with ATRA, all received the 45 dose of mg\/m(2)\/d . The diagnosis of the leukemia was made by citomorphologist analysis. The criterion of renal insufficiency, it was an increase of the creatinina superior to 20% of the basal level. The definition of the transretinoico acid Syndrome was based on the clinical criteria of Frankel. Fourteen patients presented the Transretinoico Syndrome (48.3%), 11 of which (37.9%) died. The fundamental differences between the patients with or without ATRA were: fever (14 vs. 9, p=0,017), gain of weight (14 vs 0, p=0,000), pleural effusion (14 vs 2, p=0.000), pulmonary infiltrates (13 vs 1, p=0,000), cardiac failure (12 versus 2, p=0,000), respiratory distress (12 versus 4, p=0,003), presence of renal failure (10 vs 4, p=0,02), necessity of substitute renal treatment (6 vs 0, p=0,006) and arterial hypotension (12 vs. 3, p=0,001).

Six (60%) needed substitute renal treatment and 5 (50%) died. Of the patients who survived, only a patient continues in dialysis. In both patient in that renal biopsy was made, the study showed signs of cortical necrosis. The appearance of acute renal failure in the course of the SAR is frequent, being observed deterioration of the renal function that needs substitute renal treatment in more than half the cases.

One hundred surveys were distributed and 91% were answered, corresponding to 6599 patients (M 4015\/F 2584). Fifteen % were younger of 50 years and 45.2% older of 70 years. Seventy seven % had arteriovenous fistulas, 8.1% had polytetrafluoroethylene grafts and 14.8% had catheters. The mean number of patients per center was 72.3 (11-212). Seventy eight % were divided in 3 shifts, with a mean relationship of 38.9 patients\/physician, 4.7 patients\/nurse and 9 patients\/auxiliary personnel.

The correlation of 1\/Cist with the Clcr, C-G and MDRD was respectively: 0,836, 0.8142 and 0.832, (p&lt;0,0001). By Bland-Altman graphs the average of the difference between CLcr with CG and MDRD was 2,8 mL\/min and -1,5 mL\/min respectively. Comparing CG with MDRD was 1,7 mL\/min. The average of the observed absolute differences between CLcr with CG and MDRD was 13.5 mL\/min and 17.1 mL\/min respectively. Between this formulas the average was 12.5 mL\/min. Statistically significant differences between the different methods from renal evaluation do not exist (p&gt;0,05). In conclusion, most of the urine collections could be avoided with the use of the formulas. Cystatin-c is far beyond the creatinine, mainly to detect slight renal alteration (sensitivity 80,4% U.S. 44,7% in men) becoming a promising alternative, that could reduce considerably hidden renal insufficiency (non detected by creatinine), although more studies are needed to confirm.","2380":"During the last years there has been an important advance in the knowledge of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

An ANOVA test for comparison of the means, and a time series analysis were performed. During the five year study the consecutive number of thrombosis were 43, 57, 55, 59 and 36. When the different seasons were analysed, the cumulative number of events in summer during the study period were 91, a significant increase compared to spring, autumn, and winter (54, 54, and 51, respectively; p&lt;0.001). Time series analysis confirmed that thrombolic events during summer showed an increased incidence over the mean (p&lt;0.001), and it occurred every year. The same results were obtained when the PTFE grafts were analyzed separetely (july RR 2.62, p=0.002; august, RR 2.37, p=0.04), but not with the arteriovenous fistulae. In conclusion, this study showed a seasonal periodicity of vascular access thrombosis, with a PTFE graft. Although the causes were unknown, these data alert us on the convenience of an increased attention to the vascular access during the summer months in order to prevent its thrombosis.","2418":"The hemodialysis (HD) population continues growing and aging, reason why they are required to adapt the human, economic and materials resources to be taken care of. To analyze the distribution of the consultations and the times of admissions in the different Hospital services of which an peripheral arranged HD Center depends. We analyzed all the consultations to the Hospital Urgencies Departments and Hospitable admissions of all the patients who received HD in the arranged Center Ponfedial, (sanitary area Ponferrada of 150,000 inhabitants) in period 01\/12\/02 to the 31\/05\/05. We prospectively examined a population of 87 HD patients (71.0+\/-12.5 years, 77.9 % male, 31.4% diabetics) time in HD 21.0+\/-22.7 months. They were a total of 286 (9.5\/month) consultations in the Service of Urgencies (2.31 consult\/patient\/year), 37.4% of them did not motivate admissions. The most frequent consultation (28,9%) was the complications of vascular access (70,9% of them required positioning a transitory catheter; 1.1 complication of catheter\/months, 1 permanent catheter is placed\/1.2 months and 1 fistulography\/1.2 months), cardiac causes 10.3%, acute pulmonar edema: 9.3%, infectious: 8.4% and traumatologic: 8.4%. There were 179 admissions (5.9\/month; 1.44 hospitalizations\/patient\/year; 4.0+\/-14.2 days of admissions): cardiovascular cause: 37.4%, by vascular access: 18.4%, infectious disease: 17.0%, digestive: 6.7%, traumatologic: 3.9% and by other causes: 11.0%. The cardiovascular group takes 46.5% (60.8% of them by vascular peripheral disease) of the total of days of hospitalizations, infectious 16.7%, neoplasic 8.4% and vascular access 7.6%. The neoplasic causes were the greater average with 36.0+\/-21.6 days of hospitalization, by amputations 23.0+\/-38.1 days, by stroke 14.5+\/-10.6 days, infected ulcers of lower extremities members 10.0+\/-19.0, other vascular treatments 10.0+\/-4.7, ischemic heart disease 8.5+\/-20.3 and heart failure 7.5+\/-5.2 days. Our prevalent population of 49.5 patients needed 3 to 7 hospitable beds, 0.33 temporal catheter, 1 tunneled permanent catheter and 1 fistulography per month. The cardiovascular causes, the accesses and the infectious ones are the main causes of consultations, hospital admissions and time of hospitalizations. ","2419":"The sustained elevation of phosphorous among patients with end-stage renal failure is associated with elevated mortality rates. Phosphate binding agents are usually necessary to control serum phosphate levels. Phosphate removal during dialysis is limited largely due to the intracellular location of most inorganic phosphorous. The membrane surface, the frequency and the duration of therapy have proved to be very important factors in the serum phosphate control. THE AIM of our work is to investigate the influence on phosphate removal of factors that normally participate in the haemodialysis session: Plasma phosphate level (Php), treatment duration, membrane surface, high or low-flux membranes, the vascular access, dialysate flux , the volume of blood passing through the dialyzer (L) in each dialysis session and the blood flow during the first hour of dialysis. On 16 patients, we also had the possibility of comparing phosphate removal with 1.8 m(2) high-flux haemodialysis, 1.8 m(2) on-line hemodiafiltration and the on-line technique with the new Helixone dialyzer Fresenius Fx100. 108 haemodialysis patients, 62% men, 38% women aged 21-82 years (61+\/-14;mean+\/-sem),) were selected for the study. Mean treatment time 4.14+\/-0.41 hours (range 3.5-5 hours). The vascular access was an arterio-venous fistula in eighty five (78%) and a double lumen tunnelled catheter 23 (22%). Patients were studied under their normal every day conditions. High-flux membrane was used by 31 (30%) patients and low-flux membrane by 77 (70%). Membrane surface was: 1.7 m2:17 (16%); 1.8 m2:77 (71%); 2,1 m2:14 (13%). Dialysate flux was: 500 ml\/min. 55 patients; 700 ml\/min: 53 patients. In 16 out of 108 patients we had the possibility of using on-line hemodiafiltration with ultrapure bicarbonate-buffered dialysate. Phosphate mass removal (MPO4) was calculated using the formula:MPO4=0.1 t-17+50 Cds 60+11Cb 60 (1), where t is treatment time in minutes, Cds60 and Cb60 are phosphate concentrations in dialysate and plasma measured at 60 min from the beginning of hemodialysis in mg\/dl, and MPO4 is the estimated phosphate removed in mg\/treatment. We found a good correlation between phosphate removal and serum phosphate levels (p=0.01), but not with the membrane surface or treatment duration. Phosphate removal was 640+\/-180 mg\/session with low-flux membrane and 700+\/-170 mg\/session with high-flux membrane (p=0.280). The MPO4 was 720+\/-190 mg\/treatment in patients with a AV fistula and 620+\/-180 in patients with a tunnelled catheter (p=0.023). We found a good correlation between phosphate removal and the volume of blood (L) that passed the dialyzer in each session (r=0.001) but we did not find a correlation between phosphate removal and KT\/Vurea, the dialysate flux or the ultra filtration. On-line technique did not increased the MPO4(733+\/-280 mg, p=0.383). The on-line technique with the new dialyzer (Fresenius Fx100), increased the phosphate removal to 759+\/-199 mg\/session (p=0.057). Phosphate removal during dialysis is influenced by Plasma phosphate levels, the volume of blood that passed the dialyzer and the vascular access. Uniformity on time and membrane surface could explain the abs cense of influence in our case. The ultra filtration, dialysate flux, membrane permeability or on-line hemodiafiltration does not influence the phosphate removal. The new membrane helixone with 2,1 m2 (Fresenius Fx100) increases phosphate removal probably because the membrane surface is higher. ","2420":"Inadequate nutrient intake seems to be one of the most important cause of malnutrition in hemodialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to analyse their nutrient intake and eating habits, comparing food groups' intake with standard Mediterranean diet values (Healthy Diet Guide 2004, Nutrition Community Spanish Society). There were 28 stable hemodialysis (HD) patients, 15 males and 13 females, mean age 62,9 +\/- 16 years. Dietary evaluation was based on 7-day dietary recalls conducted by a single observer. We compare nutrients intake with recommended hemodialysis intake and we contrast food groups consumption with the theoretical ideal based on Mediterranean diet. The protein intake was 1,33 +\/- 0,2 g\/kg\/day and the energy intake 29,5 +\/- 2,1 kcal\/kg\/day. Carbohydrates accounted 43,1% of energy intake, proteins 19% and lipids 37,9% (55,5% monounsaturated fatty acids, 16,4% polyunsaturated fatty acids and 28,1% saturated fatty acids). Complex carbohydrates (potatoes, cereals, vegetables, fruits) and olive oil consumption was lower than that recommended to the Spanish healthy population and to the chronic hemodialysis patients. The animal protein intake (meat, fish, eggs) was correct, although excessive in red and processed meats. Results: Potatoes and cereals recommended frequency (RF) 4-6 portions\/day, HD patients frequency (HDF) 4,1 portions\/day; vegetables RF &gt; 2 portions\/day, HDF 1,2; fruits RF &gt; 3 portions\/day, HDF 1,3; olive oil RF 3-6 portions\/day, HDF 1,5; Fish RF 3-4 portions\/week, HDF 4,2; White meat RF 3-4 portions\/week, HDF 1,5; Poultry RF 3-4 portions\/week, HDF 2,3; Eggs RF 3-4 portions\/week, HDF 3,6; Pulses RF 3-4 portions\/week, HDF 1,7; Nuts RF 3-7 portions\/week, HDF 0; Red meat RF occasionally, HDF 4,8 portions\/week; Processed meats RF occasionally, HDF 4,6 portions\/week; Sweets, snacks, soft drinks RF occasionally, HDF 1,7 portions\/week; Butter, margarine, processed bakery products, biscuits RF occasionally , HDF 0,5 portions\/week. Nutritional abnormalities are frequently found even in apparently stable patients on chronic hemodialysis. Caloric rather than protein undernutrition is the major abnormality. Inadequate caloric intake (&lt; 35 kcal\/kg\/day) can lead to a negative nitrogen balance. Their eating habits are healthy and natural, but there is a deficit in slowly absorbed carbohydrates and olive oil intake (with caloric intake reduction), and an excessive consumption of red and processed meats (with saturated fats increase). The individual correction of these dietary patterns could reduce the saturated fats and increase the energy intake, obtaining a balanced diet integrated into our geographic region and culture. ","2421":"A pathological Oral Glucose Tolerance test (OGTT) is early marker of peripheral insulin resistance. Nevertheless, its utility in nondiabetic patients with CRF stage IV-V is undetermined. We wanted to detect, in a population of non diabetic patients with CRF, the presence of carbohydrates metabolism anomalies, by means of the OGTT and to relate it with metabolic, anthropometric, cardiovascular parameters and renal function. We studied 45 non diabetic patients with advanced CRF (stage IV-V), 26 men, mean age 66.5 years, with average Cockroft-Gault of 23.6 ml\/min. We measured weight, height, waist and BMI. BIOCHEMICAL: glucose, insulin, OGTT, C peptide, lipid profile, HbA1C and Hto. Cardiovascular comorbidity, mean proteinuria and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (6 months pre and post analytical measure) were measured. Pulse pressure was also calculated. 47% of the patients presented normal fasting glucose, whereas 53% had isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG). After the OGTT, 36% of the patients presented impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 14% diabetes (&gt;200 mg\/dl). Of the patients with normal fasting glucose, 38% had IGT after OGTT and 5% diabetes. Patients with abnormal OGTT were older (71+\/-13.6 versus 60+\/- 18.8 years, p=0.03), had greater HbA1C (5.6+\/-0.5 versus 5.2+\/-0.3%, p=0.02), total cholesterol (193+\/-37.7 versus 169.8+\/-44.9 mg\/dl, p=0.03), pulse pressure (63.4+\/- 14.5 versus 52.3+\/-9.7 mmHg, p=0.0001) and greater prevalence of ischemic heart disease (28% versus 5%, p=0.05). Creatinine Clerance negatively correlated with the OGTT (r=-0.39, p=0.01) and plasma creatinine positively with fasting insulin (r=0.33, p=0.02) and C-peptide (r=0.42, p=0.006). Urinary Proteins were correlated with fasting glucose (r=0.30, p=0.04), C-peptide (r=0.52, p=0.001), triglycerides (r=0.36, p=0.01) and with the HOMA-IR index (r=0.30, p=0.05). Fasting Glucose did not predict OGTT results in patients with CRF. For this reason, we think that the OGTT can be very usefull tool to identify states of \"prediabetes\" and diabetes in patients with CRF, specially in those whose present an elevated Pulse Pressure, age greater than 65 years, hyperlipidaemia and HbA1C above 5.2%. The early detection of these metabolic anomalies, may lead to intensify dietetic and pharmacological measures directed to delay or to attenuate the appearance of diabetes and its serious complications in a population in which the cardiovascular risks factors are very elevated. ","2422":"Glutamine is an amino acid (AA) whose mission is carrying nitrogen. Abnormalities in protein and AA metabolism has been observed in patients with acute renal failure. Several clinical trials had showed abnormalities in plasma AA and its elimination in uremic environment. Moreover, renal failure disturbs hepato-splachnic circulation of glutamin, tyrosine and proline. Cisplatin is a key drug in the chemotherapy pharmacology, and the nephrotoxicity due to tubular injury, is one of its most important side effects, which sometimes is irreversible and leads to substitutive renal treatment. The goal of this work is to find predictive factors of renal failure secondary to cisplatin. Fifty four patients treated with cisplatin were studied. The plasma AA concentration and another plasmatic and urine parameters were measured in three different days after each pulse of chemotherapy. Plasma AA modifications through the pulses and reabsortion percentages of everyone were analysed too. Significant differences were observed in 13 AA reabsortion percentages and 16 plasmatic concentration. Glutamin concentration through the pulses was higher in 13 patients, (24%) who presented renal failure (Plasmatic glutamin concentration higher than 1000 mM\/L at the third day after cisplatin administration was highly predictive value about getting renal failure, with significant difference from patients with o normal renal function. Others parameters analysed did not rise significant predictive values, so as it was not found relation between hyperaminoaciduria and renal function. It is concluded that cisplatin leads to renal failure in a 24% of this patients. Glutamin, concentrations higher than 1000 mM\/L at the third day after cisplatin administration have a high predictive value about getting renal failure; so, it is suggested this could be a early marker of cisplatin nephrotoxicity before the serum creatinine is elevated, in order to get an early and suitable treatment of it.","2423":"The prognosis for patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus has dramatically improved over recent decades. We review our experience with intermittent pulse therapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide (IC) in 97 patients (75 female) aged over 20 years. The series was divided into three groups. Group A (n=39) received monthly IC pulses (begin 1 g) for up to 24 months between 1985-1991. Group B (n=47) received monthly IC pulses (1 g) for six months with additional quarterly doses for a maximum of 18 months, depending on the therapeutic response (from 1991). From 1999, Group C (n=11) patients were treated with low-dose IC (3 g in three months) followed by azathioprine (2 mg\/kg) or mycophenolate mofetil (1.5-2.0 g\/day) for 12-18 months. The total IC doses (g) administered were: Group A, 15.1+\/-9.0; Group B, 8.5+\/-3.5; and Group C, 3.0+\/-0.0. These figures show the trend progressive reduction in exposure to IC. Overall, treatment with the different IC regimens achieved satisfactory control of lupus nephritis in 76% of the patients. Comparison of the values at baseline and after 24 months showed that the serum creatinine (mg\/dl) fell in Group A from 1.77+\/-1.06 to 1.09+\/-0.63, in Group B from 1.22+\/- 0.85 to 0.95+\/- 0.45, and in Group C from 0.90+\/-0.23 to 1.17+\/-0.54 (p&lt;0.05). In the same period, proteinuria (g\/day) fell in Group A from 6.19+\/-4.31 to 0.79+\/-1.76, in Group B from 4.43+\/- 3.17 to 2.08+\/-3.65, and in Group C from 5.43+\/- 3.37 to 3.22+\/-4.00 (p=0.05). There was not differences between the three groups in both variables. The adverse effects were mainly viral and bacterial infections, with no intergroup differences. Avascular osteonecrosis requiring hip replacement and early menopause were more frequent in Group A. Nine patients died, seven due to cardiovascular causes and two with infection. No differences were detected between the three groups when analyzing the overall patient survival at 5, 10 and 15 years (95%, 92%, and 84%, respectively). The likelihood of maintaining serum creatinine within normal ranges or less than twice the baseline range was similar in the three groups at 5, 10 and 15 years (92%, 72% and 66%, respectively). There were 47 episodes of relapse, with no differences between the three groups. In Summary, treatment with different regimens of intermittent IC is relatively safe and efficient to control the disease and lupus nephritis in SLE patients even with progressively smaller doses. The price paid concerned infectious complications, and bone and ovarian toxicity. New alternatives should at least maintain the same efficacy, but with fewer adverse effects and relapses.","2424":"","2425":"","2426":"","2427":"","2428":"","2429":"","2430":"","2431":"","2432":"","2433":"We report a case of visceral leishmaniasis and acute renal failure in a white male patient, 28 years of age, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The clinical presentation of the patient was diarrheic syndrome of long evolution, fever, hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia, accompanied by nephrotic syndrome and irreversible acute renal failure. Renal biopsy showed glomerular AA amyloid deposits. This is the first case described in humans of secondary amyloidosis caused by visceral leishmaniasis.","2434":"Although drug induced interstitial nephritis is a relatively common cause of renal failure,granulomatous forms remain a rare condition. The development of a chronic granulomatous interstitial nephritis due to allopurinol is exceptional, only three cases have been described previously. We report on a patient who presented a granulomatous interstitial nephritis after 10 years of allopurinol administration (300 mg\/day). At diagnosis, he had end stage renal disease and dialysis treatment was needed. Two months after drug withdrawal and on corticoid treatment a slow recovery of renal function was observed, allowing the interruption of dialysis. Two years after, the creatinine clearance is 23 ml\/min,being dialysis free. We discuss the differential diagnosis of granulomatous interstitial nephritis and its rare association with allopurinol treatment.","2435":"Ethylene glycol intoxication involves acute renal failure and severe metabolic acidosis. Prolonged renal insufficiency can occur but terminal chronic renal failure has been reported in very few cases. We describe a patient who after ingestion of 920 ml of ethylene glycol developed prolonged acute renal failure needing hemodialysis for 37 days and then he partly recovered renal function. The patient developed a severe sensitive-motor and autonomic polyradiculopathy.","2436":"Thrombocytopenia is a potential complication of heparin therapy. There are two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Type-I HIT is characterized by a mild decrease in platelet count that occurs within the first 2-4 days after heparin initiation. The platelet count often returns to normal without stop heparin treatment. The mechanism of thrombocytopenia appears to be due to a direct effect of heparin on platelet activation. The second form (type-II) is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, which may include both arterial and venous thrombosis. We present a case of type-II HIT occurred in a hemodialysis patient resulting in acute pulmonary embolism and peripheral venous thrombosis, and review the literature.","2437":"","2438":"Review a large experience in the placement of tunnelled catheters to assess the outcomes with twin catheter system as hemodialysis access. We retrospectively reviewed clinical and hemodialysis data regarding of ESRD patients who were referred from 2 dialysis facilities for placement of tunnelled catheters hemodialysis access between 1996 March and 2005 July. For catheter insertion a real-time sonography technique was used (Site Rite II Dymax corporation) in performing vascular access procedure. The twin catheter system available during the study period consisted of 2 x 10-F12. Patients suspected to present bacteraemia related to catheter were followed with established protocols. Catheter suspected malfunction or thrombosis was treated with low dose Urokinase. To evaluated dialysis dose and adequacy, blood flow rates were recorded and Kt\/v calculated by Daugirdas 2nd generation formula. Overall study period of 112 months, 210 catheters were inserted in 148 patients(93 males and 55 females, mean age 68,6 +\/- 4,95 years). 101 catheters were inserted in internal jugular vein, 84 in femoral and 25 in subclavian. The successful insertion rate with only single needle pass was 87.8%, immediate procedural complications rate was 4.7%. The catheters were in place a total of 18,324 days during the study period (mean 87.2 days; range 4-1,280 days). The mean flow blood rate was 252,4 DS +\/- 42.4 mL\/min, Mean Kt\/v was 1,21 DS +\/- 0,07. Seventy-seven catheters malfunctioned during study period, in 55 cases urokinase was effective in recovering blood flow rate over 250 mL\/min and 25 necessitated removal for ineffective urokinase. Infection incidence was 11.9% with bacteraemia related catheter rate of 2.8 episodes per 1,000 catheter-days, Gram positive bacteria was found in (84%), Gram negative in (12%) and others(4%). Placement of tunnelled twin catheters system using real-time sonography technique can be performed with excellent technical success, safety and acceptable catheter performance and outcomes for effective hemodialysis. ","2439":"We report a retrospective study on the results of 132 native fistulas, 12 grafts and 27 tunneled catheters followed during 30 months in 144 patients on hemodialysis. The results were compared according to patient age: 75 years or over (n = 58, 80.3 +\/- 3.5) vs below 75 years (n = 86, 59.5 +\/- 13.3). Gender, presence of diabetes and type of fistula were also included in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between both groups in the use of tunneled catheters or grafts (8.6% vs 5.8% y 5.2% vs 10.5% respectively), primary failure of native fistulas (7.1% in those aged 75 years or over vs 25.5% in patients below 75 years), rate of thrombosis (0.03 vs 0.09\/patient year at risk respectively) or number of percutaneous or surgical procedures in order to maintain the fistula patency (0.11 vs 0.16\/patient year at risk respectively). At the same time no differences were seen in the primary, primary assisted and secondary patency of the native fistulas. The mean age of the patients when the first access fistula was created was different according to the area of surgery (74.9 +\/- 9.3 for the elbow vs 64.9 +\/- 16.2 years for the forearm, p &lt; 0.005).

The vascular access for hemodialysis in elderly patients presents a similar evolution to that seen in younger populations if the access creation is based on an exhaustive study, including ecodoppler of the vascular map and the use of more proximal fistulas if necessary. Therefore the more frequent use of grafts or catheters in elderly patients is not justified. ","2440":"Nowadays, expert guidelines recommend the monitoring programs of the vascular access (VA) by a multidisciplinary team. We present the experience over the last five years, of a prospective VA surveillance by a multidisciplinary team. The quality indicators reached are described as the associated factors for survival of the new VA. Three hundred seventeen VA have been studied, 73% were arteriovenous fistulas(AVF) and the rest were polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts at 282 patients. The main causes of dysfunctions were elevated dynamic venous pressure (42.5%) and the decreased blood flow (36.4%) with a 88% of positive predictive value. Over the 5 years there was 88 thrombosis (24 AVF and 64 PTFE grafts), that means a hazard thrombosis global rate of 0.15 access\/year, which were distributed in 0.06 for AVF and 0.38 in PTFE grafts. Two hundred and one repairs of VA were done: 66.6% were elective repair after a proper review by the multidisciplinary team and the rest of them were done after the AV thrombosis happened. Urgent rescue surgeries were done in 76% of the thrombosis. 62.5% of the patients did not need a catheter after vascular access thrombosis. The complication relation with AVF and PTFE were 11.4% of the total patients hemodialysis hospitalizations. 65.2% of the VA were new access. 57% of patients were properly reviewed in the pre-dialysis unit at least once and 80% of them start haemodialysis with a mature access. The average survival (Kaplan Meier) of the new AVF was 1,575+\/-55 days vs 1,087+\/-102 of the PTFE grafts (p &lt; 0.008). The survival after 1, 2 and 3 years for the AVF was 89%, 85% and 83% and for the PTFE graft 3% 67% and 51% respectively. The Cox regression has proved that the type of vascular access is the strongest factor associated to VA survival. The survival added of VA repaired due to dysfunction was 1,062 +\/- 97 days vs 707 +\/- 132 due to thrombosis, log rank 5.17 (p &lt; 0,02). The increasing risk of those repaired after a thrombosis vs dysfunction is 4.2 p &lt; 0,01. The monitoring of the vascular access by a multidisciplinary team has reached:low rate of thrombosis, high elective number of repairs of the VA, high urgent rescue surgery after a thrombosis and a few number catheter needed and hospitalizations. AVF are associated with greater survival than PTFE. The VA repair due to dysfunction vs thrombosis had a greater survival as well. ","2441":"An increase in the frequency of hemodialysis sessions improves control of extracellular volume and blood hypertension and consequently reduces the mortality related to cardiovascular aetiology in hemodialysis patients.We report the evolution of the blood hypertension depending on the need for antihypertensive drugs in a group of 38 prevalent patients that were included in a every-other-day dialysis schedule (EODD), and compare it with the results in two other groups of prevalent patients that were dialyzed in conventional, previously employed schedules without week-end sessions 4 hours x 3 x week and 5 hours x 3 x week. All three groups received hemodialysis treatment for more than 6 months.A 68% (26\/38) of the patients received antihypertensive treatment at the beginning the EODD schedule and, after 16 months, only 7.9% (3\/38) of them required antihypertensive treatment (p &lt; 0.001) with reduction in two of the three remanent patients; hypertension control in those 25 patients took an average of 100 +\/- 15 days. The final frequency of hypertension in EODD was lower (p &lt; 0.002) than the frequency registered in the 84 prevalent patients in 4h x 3 x week schedule, and also lower (p = 0.065) than the frequency of the 56 prevalent patients in 5h x 3 x week schedule. There is a significant difference (p &lt; 0,05) between EODD and 4h x 3 x week schedule as regards average figures of: increase in weight, decrease in dry-weight, blood pressure levels and hypotension incidence. EODD also produced better results than 5h x 3 x week schedule in this regard although statistics did not reflect it. The results using the every-other-day hemodialysis schedule support previous experiences(Lecce, Columbia) which achieved a good control of the dry-weight by means of suppressing the volume overload gained during the weekend and consequently obtaining adequate ultrafiltration rates and high reduction both of the hypertension and of the symptoms of intolerance to hemodialysis, which are so frequent in conventional schedules with 72 hours without hemodialysis sessions.","2442":"In medicine a considerable amount of resources are used in research, but very little attention is paid to ensuring that the findings of research are implemented in routine clinical practice.

We collected consensus data related to haemodialysis results every 6-8 months and informed each centre about its own results (feedback) and how these related to the others(benchmarking). We designed improving plans for any bad result detected. By the end of two years of follow up, 294 patients had been included in the study. The results obtained at the end of the study had improved in comparison with those obtained at the beginning (statistically significant) for the following indicators: % of patients with Hb&lt; 11 g\/dl, % patients with Kt\/v &lt; 1.2, mean Kt\/v, mean albumin, % patients with albumin&lt; 3.5 g\/dl y % patients with C reactive protein (CRP) &gt; 5 mg\/dl. No statistical changes were found in: mean erythropoietin (EPO) doses, blood pressure (BP), phosphorus plasmatic,calcium-phosphorus product, parathormone (PTHi) and vascular access distribution. We explained the absence of any improvement because of adequate start indicators in some areas (BP and vascular access), therapy with limited efficiency (calcitriol, calcium carbonate and others), lack of support resources (dietetic unit) or inadequate design\/implementation of improving plans.In conclusion, our intervention illustrates that combined clinical management strategies(feedback, benchmarking and improving plans) are efficiency in improving some areas of haemodialysis treatment (anaemia, dialysis dose, nutrition and inflammation), although it does not improve calcium phosphate metabolism related indicators.","2443":"To evaluate the level of compliance with the 2002 consensus document (Spanish Society of Nephrology) on guidelines for the detection, prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy in Catalonia.

Serum creatinine 1.9 +\/- 1.3 mg\/dl and simplified MDRD equation 45.3 +\/- 25.0 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 [65.8%with CKD stages 3 and 4]. 80% of patients had ophthalmologic examination and 52.8% antiplatelet treatment. Hb A1c was 7.3 +\/- 1.3%, but the percentage of patients with glycated hemoglobin &gt; 7% and 8% was 54.9 and 28.6% [only 50.2% had been seen by an endocrinologist in the last 6 months]. 52.8% of patients were treated with insulin and 44.1% with anti-diabetic drugs, although only 19.6% used the new anti-diabetic drugs. 61% of patients had an LDLc &gt; 100 mg\/dl (61% treated) and 44% had triglycerides (TG) &gt; 150 mg\/dl (72% treated). 95% of patients presented with hypertension (BP &gt; or = 130\/80 mmHg),91% were undergoing antihypertensive treatment (79.7% with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and \/ or angiotensin receptor blockers). 81% with microalbuminuria and 78%with established proteinuria were receiving anti-proteinuric treatment. Of the patients considered to be refractory to BP (&gt;3 drugs), only 28.9% underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. Significant differences were observed between stages of diabetic nephropathy and glycated hemoglobin (HBA1c; p = 0.048), systolic blood pressure (SBP; p = 0.024), lipidic control (HDLc; p = 0.015 and TG; p = 0.034), anemia (Hb; p = 0.010) and CKD (creatinine and sMDRD; p = 0.000).

","2444":"Many studies in the general population have shown a link between Helicobacter pylori infection and iron-deficiency, often resulting in iron-deficient anaemia. Despite the high prevalence of iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients, no studies have been performed in this population. To evaluate the role of Helicobacter pylori infection in the appearance of anemia and the iron requirements in our hemodialysis population. After excluding patients with severe pathology and short life expectancy and those with blood losses secondary to other causes, 79 patients were included.Iron requirements and anaemia were determined by iron serum, ferritin, and hematocrit values; and by transfusion, eritropoietin and iron requirements. The diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori status was established by the concordance of at least two of the three non invasive diagnostic methods performed (breath test, serology and fecal antigen of Helicobacter pylori). Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection was 43%. No significant differences between patients infected or not by Helicobacter pylori were found in any of the variables analysed: hematocrit (33.5% versus 34.1%), serum iron (58.9 versus 63.7 pg\/dl), ferritin(340.3 versus 264.2 ng\/ml), transferrin saturation index (22.5% versus 25.2%), dose of eritropoietin administered (96.6 versus 93.5 U\/kg\/weekly), and parenteral iron (1,389 versus 1,538 mg\/year). A noteworthy finding was that patients with Helicobacter pylori infection had been on hemodialysis for a shorter period than those without (37.4 versus 63.7 months,p = 0.04). Helicobacter pylori infection has no effect on anaemia (hematocrit, Eritropoietin dose or iron needs) in our hemodialysis patients. Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori is lower in patients with longer time on dialysis. We consider that the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori infection must be reserved for clinical peptic ulcer suspicion or patients on transplant waiting list. ","2445":"Adult dominant polycystic kidney disease is an hereditary condition responsible for 6% of end-stage renal failure in Spain. Two genes were located in chromosomes 16 and 4 as related to this age-dependent disease in the 90s (PKD1 and PKD2). The diagnosis can be easily achieved by sonographic study, but molecular analysis by means of linkage analysis has the advantage of an early diagnosis in asymptomatic genetic carriers, with a view to the preventive follow-up of these subjects and genetic counselling. In this paper we present the results of molecular analysis of 30 families with Adult Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (from the province of Las Palmas Spain), carried out linkage analysis with two series of microsatellite markers located within or in the vicinity ofPKD1 (D16S521, KG8, AC2.5, CW2, SM7) and PKD2 (D4S1538, D4S1534, D4S423,D4S414) genes. The objectives of the study were: first, to verify the informativeness, and therefore, the usefulness of these markers for family studies in our population; and second,to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the genetic analysis in our population. Most of the markers showed a high heterozygosity, comparable to data in other studies. Considering the alleles of the different markers together in a chromosome as an haplotype increased the informativeness of the markers, and allowed the unequivocal identification of genetic data in 97.7% of patients and 88.7% of healthy subjects. The sensitivity and specificity of the genetic analysis were 90.7% (CI 95%: 85.7-95.7) and 86.8% (CI 95%: 80.6-93.0), respectively.","2446":"","2447":"","2448":"","2449":"","2450":"","2451":"","2452":"","2453":"","2454":"","2455":"","2456":"","2457":"","2458":"","2459":"Tenofovir, a new nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that has good antiviral activity against drug-resistant strains of HIV, is structurally similar to cidofovir and adefovir and seems to be less nephrotoxic.

This older hemodialysis population are more functionally and medically dependent increasing the time taken to perform nursing work. The objective of this study was to evaluate the degree of functional dependency on hemodialysis patients and the need of care by nursing workload. A transversal descriptive study was done during 1 month (april 2005) on 586 patients from 10 HD Units in Spain. No exclusion criteria were used. The Delta Test, who was used to evaluate the patients dependency needs, is a workload measure instrument base on three subscales: dependency, Physical Deficiency and mental deficiency. The indicators are measure on a scale of one to three with each level representing an increasing demand on nursing time. The results obtained from the Delta Test were analyzed taking into account the following variables: age, average time in dialysis, Charlson comorbidity Index, geographic location and HD unit. 46% of the patients show some degree of dependency, of these 12.8% were moderated and 8.1% severe; the subscale analysis showed that 19.6% and 6.7% had, respectively, a moderate to severe physical and mental health deficiency. The dependency degree varied significantly between HD Units and geographic location with a range of 0% to 59.8%. The degree of dependency were statistically associated with age and CCI. The higher CCI (r: 0,21; p &lt; 0.001) and age (r: 0,26; p &lt; 0.001) the higher was the Delta Test Score for dependency level. Patients times of initiation on dialysis were not associated with an increase in the degree of dependency. The aspects evaluated by the Delta Test that showed a higher score were those related to patients mobility. The patients assistance requirements during the HD session are basically related to a lack of mobility due to musculoskeletal disease and to a lesser extent to behavior alterations. HD units are attending patients with an important degree of dependency which impose and added workload to the healthcare personnel. In occasions, it is very difficult to attend and give proper care with the current legally established nurse to patient ratio which. This suggests the need to implement a better staffing policy. The Delta Test provides an objective, adaptable and standardized instrument for measuring degree of dependency of HD patients. ","2465":"As is universally accepted the best form of permanent vascular access for haemodialysis is the native arteriovenous fistula. A second and third options are the politetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) AV grafts and the cuffed, tunneled, internal catheters. The overall performance and complications of catheters is clearly inferior to AV fistula. There are not many studies that compare permanent catheters to grafts in terms of functionality, survival and complications. We analyzed 81 vascular accesses carried out from october 99 to december 03 in 59 patients and during a follow-up period of 35 months. Two groups were considered. Group 1, catheters (n 42) and group 2, grafts (n 39). Clinical aspects, comorbidity index (Wright and Kanh), dialysis dose and complications and survival of the access were registered. Both groups were similar in age, sex, time on haemodialysis, number of previous accesses and hospitalization days. Cardiovascular morbidity and comorbidity index were significantly higher in patients with catheter. While blood flow during dialysis was higher in grafts both groups showed no significant differences in parameters of efficacy of dialysis (Kt\/V, TAC BUN and PCRn). Serum albumin was lower in patients with catheter. The number of accesses that failed was higher in the graft group being thrombosis the main complication followed by infection. Kaplan-Meier curves showed better accumulated survival of permanent catheters versus grafts (61,4% vs 9,8% at 35 months). The most frequent complication of catheter was infection while in the case of grafts it was thrombosis followed by infection. Although they were placed in patients with higher comorbidity, cuffed, tunneled catheters showed less number of complications and better survival than PTFE grafts in our patients in haemodialysis. The main cause of failure of both vascular access was thrombosis followed by infection. The dose of dialysis obtained was no different in both groups. Cuffed, tunneled permanent catheters are a very interesting option in a number of patients in haemodialysis and they can be an option to consider in those patients with vascular difficulties and higher comorbidities.

Several factors have been related to de development of intimal hyperplasia and graft failure. Among them are the differences in the biomechanical properties between the prosthesis and the native vessels. In the searching for vascular prosthesis that overcomes the limitations of the currently used, the cryopreserved vessels (cryografts) appear as an alternative of growing interest. However, it is unknown if the mechanical differences or mismatch between prosthesis and native vessels are lesser when using cryografts. To characterize and compare the biomechanical behaviour of native vessels used in vascular access and cryografts. Additionally, segments of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) were also evaluated, so as to evaluate the potential biomechanical advantages of the cryografts respect to synthetic prosthesis used in vascular access. Segments from human humeral (n = 12), carotid (n = 12) and femoral (n = 12) arteries, and saphenous vein (n = 12), were obtained from 6 multiorgan donors. The humeral arteries were studied in fresh state. The other segments were divided into two groups, and 6 segments from each vessel were studied in fresh state, while the remaining 6 segments were evaluated after 30 days of criopreservation. For the mechanical evaluation the vascular segments and 6 segments of ePTFE were mounted in a circulation mock and submitted to haemodynamic conditions similar to those of the in vivo. Instantaneous pressure (Konigsberg) and diameter (Sonomicrometry) were measured and used to calculate the viscous and elastic indexes, the compliance, distensibility and characteristic impedance. For each mechanical parameter studied, the mismatch between the prosthesis and the native vessel was evaluated. The ePTFE was the prosthesis with the higher mechanical mismatch (p &lt; 0.05). The venous and arterial cryografts showed the least mismatch with native veins and arteries, respectively. The prosthesis with the least mechanical mismatch was different, depending on the native vessel evaluated, and for a native vessel, on the parameter considered. The mechanical mismatch between the native vessel and the vascular prosthesis used in a vascular access could be reduced using cryografts.

Pre and postdialysis concentrations of urea, creatinine, (beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m), myoglobin, prolactin and alpha1 microglobulin (alpha1-m) were measured. There was no difference in urea and creatinine small molecules removal. beta2m removal was 68% on HD and 81% on OL-HDF. Myoglobin and prolactin present a similar removal pattern, a higher removal with new filters (60% with Arylane and 59% with APS) in comparison with clasical polisulfone (22% with HF80). The mean alpha1-m reduction rate on HD was 6% and on OL-HDF 22%. OL-HDF with APS 900 filter was the most remove technique (35.4%), significatively higher than the other modes and filters.

The sexually active patients presented a better physical fitness (p &lt; 0.001) and overall health (p &lt; 0.05), and a smaller difficulty to carry out the daily activities (p &lt; 0.05) and pain (p &lt; 0.05). A 40% of the patients with some kind of sexual function had a good erectile function, the 34.5% suffered a slight erectile dysfunction, the 16.4% a moderate one and the 9.1% a severe one. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the main determinant of the sexual activity was the age, followed by the physical fitness and the time on HD (32.7% of the variance explained). We found statistically significative correlation between the total score of IIEF and felings (r = -0.34; p &lt; 0.05), daily activities (r = -0.27; p &lt; 0.05), social activities (r = -0.30; p &lt; 0.05), social support (r = -0.45; p &lt; 0.01) and quality of life (r = -0.29; p &lt; 0.05). The patients without sexual activity didn't perceive their deficiency as a problem and considered this situation inherent to the ageing process. The sexual dysfunction is a highly prevalent problem in the uremic male, but it doesn't have to be necessarily associated to a serious deterioration of the HRQOL. In this way, the presence or not of sexual activity doesn't present significant effect on the things that one has or wants to do. With everything, the patient without sexual activity frequently has advanced age, refers worse state of health and presents more problems of physical functioning and at the moment of taking to daily activities.

The aim of our study was to analyse patient clinical and analytic characteristics at the time of initiating dialysis and to evaluate if morbimortality was affected by planned start. We performed a retrospective study of all patients commencing RRT in a Spanish Hospital of The National Health System over two years (2003-2004). A total of 117 patients (47 female and 70 male) were included. We carried out a retrospective analysis of the demographic characteristics, patients' clinical and analytic conditions at the time of starting dialysis and hospitalization days and mortality in six months after starting dialysis. Patients were classified as planned (P) or unplanned (NP), depending on whether the first dialysis was planned or an emergency. Sixty five patients (56.4%) started dialysis in a planned group while 52 (43.6%) were unplanned. In the former group, 83.1% of the patients had a vascular or peritoneal access available when starting RRT, whereas in the later group only the 3.8% had it. Planned dialysis initiation was associated with a high level of serum haemoglobin, haematocrit, calcium and albumin (p &lt; 0.001), and a low level of serum urea, creatinine (p &lt; 0.001) and phosphate (p &lt; 0.05). More patients of the unplanned group were admitted at hospital at the initiation of dialysis (90.4% vs. 6.1%) and during the first 6 months (48% vs. 15.3%). The period of hospitalization was longer for the unplanned group (23.6 days vs 3 days) (p &lt; 0.001). The 6-month-mortality was lower in the planned group (4.6% vs. 11.5%), whitout statistical difference. Planned dialysis initiation is associated with better clinical and metabolical conditions, greater probability of a vascular or peritoneal access availability and lower rate of hospitalization and mortality within 6 months after starting RRT ","2492":null,"2493":"Serum cystatin C (CysC) has been shown to be more accurate than serum creatinine (Cr) in estimating renal function, especially in patients with mildmoderate chronic renal failure. However, it is unknown whether CysC provides or not any advantage over Cr in severe chronic renal failure. The aim of this study was to establish the accuracy of CysC in estimating the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in advanced chronic renal failure patients. The study group consisted of 94 patients (57 females, mean age 61 +\/- 16 years) with advanced chronic renal failure. None of them had thyroid dysfunction or was on corticoid treatment. CFR was measured by TC99mDTPA, and simultaneously, serum CysC (particle enhanced immunonephelometry) and Cr (modified Jaffe's kinetic reaction) were also determined. Serum Cr and CysC levels were correlated with GFR, and the influences of age, sex and diabetes on these correlations were analyzed. The predictive value of CysC and Cr to estimate a GFR less than 15 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 was analyzed by measuring the crea-under-the-curve (AUC) with Receiver-Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. The mean CFR was 16.49 +\/- 4.65 ml\/min\/1.73 m2. The mean concentrations of Cr and CysC were 4.19 +\/- 1.19 mg\/L and 3.44 +\/- 0.73 mg\/L, respectively. Both Cr and CysC correlated significantly with GFR (R = 0.49, p &lt; 0.0001 and R = 0.52, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Age and sex influenced on the correlation between Cr and GFR, but these demographic characteristics did not influence on the correlation between CysC and GFR. The AUC for the prediction of a GFR less than 15 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 with serum Cr was 0.675 (p = 0.004), while with CysC was 0.633 (p = 0.030). In conclusion, both serum Cr and CysC are highly inaccurate markers of renal function in advanced chronic renal failure patients.","2494":"Albuminuria is a marker of higher cardiovascular and renal risk in hypertension; it also indicates the need of a tighter control of blood pressure with drugs blocking the renin-angiotensin system.

The Spanish Society of Nephrology has promoted a project of creation of performance guides in the field of peritoneal dialysis, entrusting a work group composed of members of the Spanish Society of Nephrology a with the development of these guides. The information offered is based on levels of evidence, opinion and clinical experience of the most relevant publications of the topic. In these guides, after defining the concept of &lt;&lt; peritoneal dialysis&gt;&gt;, the obligations and responsibilities of the sanitation team of the peritoneal dialysis unit are determined, and protocols and performance procedures that try to include all the aspects that concern the patient with chronic renal disease in substitute treatment with this technique are developed. They propose prescription objectives based on available clinical evidence and, lacking this, on the consensus of the experts' opinions. The final aim is to improve the care and quality of the of the patient in peritoneal dialysis, optimizing in this way the survival of the patient and of the technique. In Spain, as in other neighbouring countries, peritoneal dialysis has an incidence and prevalence that is much lower than that of hemodialysis, ranging in the last evaluation by the Spanish Society of Nephrology between 5 and 24% in the different autonomous communities.

However, because of its narrow therapeutic index an excessive elevation of serum lithium concentration, either during chronic maintenance therapy or after an acute overdose, can result in serious toxicity. In addition to supportive care, the established treatment of severe lithium toxicity is haemodialysis. Conventional haemodialysis can reduce serum lithium rapidly, but post-dialysis rebound elevations with recurrent toxicity have been documented in old publications. High-flux membranes should be capable of removing more lithium per hour of haemodialysis, but published values are not available. We report here three patients with acute lithium intoxication who were treated successfully with bicarbonate and high-flux haemodialysis membranes. Our patients presented with a severe degree of intoxication, based on the amount of drug ingested, the initial serum lithium level, the severity of neurologic symptoms and systemic manifestations. Two patients developed acute renal failure probably as a result of volume depletion since it was rapidly reversible by haemodialysis and infusion therapy. In addition, consecutive haemodialysis sessions and improvement of renal function allowed a rapid decrease in serum lithium levels without haemodynamic instability or rebound elevations in lithium concentration. The effectiveness of the procedure in these cases can be attributed to the use of bicarbonate dialysate and high-efficiency dialysers. This is the first report describing the effect of high-efficiency dialysers on lithium pharmacokinetic. Using this technique the elimination rate of lithium was found to be greater than previously reported with haemodialysis.","2509":"Mean-term experience in the use of Telemedicine in Peritoneal Dialisis (PD) patients is limited as well as its cost-benefit.

The study group consisted of 99 unselected patients (62 +\/- 15 years, 59 females) with advanced CRF. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by Tc(99m) DTPA. Simultaneously, estimates of GFR by CG corrected for 1.73 m2 and MDRD (formula 7) were calculated. Agreement was evaluated graphically, bias was assessed by mean and median difference, and precision by median absolute differences and Bland-Altman plots. Mean GFR by DTPA, CG and MDRD were: 16.24 +\/- 4.38 and 16.77 +\/- 4.65 and 13.58 +\/- 4.27 ml\/min\/1.73 m2, respectively. MDRD equation significantly underestimated GFR-DTPA (p = 0.0001).

The aim of this study was to compare the reliability and agreement of these two methods with the formulas proposed by the urea kinetic modelling for measuring the dialysis dose and others haemodialysis parameters. We studied 20 stable patients (16 men\/4 women) dialyzed with a monitor equipped with the modules Diascan (DC) and Quantiscan (QC) (Integra. Hospal). The urea distribution volume (VD) was determined using anthropometric data (Watson equation) and QC data. Kt\/V value was calculated according to Daurgidas 2nd generation formula corrected for the rebound (eKt\/V), and using DC (Kt\/VDC) and QC (Kt\/VQC) data. The total mass of urea removed was calculated as 37,93 +\/- 16 g\/session. The VD calculated using Watson equation was 35.7 +\/- 6.6 and the VDQC was 35.06 +\/- 9.9. And they showed an significative correlation (r:0,82 p &lt; 0.001). The (VDQC-VDWatson) difference was -0.64 +\/- 5.8L (ns). Kt\/VDC was equivalent to those of eKt\/V (1.64 +\/- 0.33 and 1.61 +\/- 0.26, mean difference -0.02 +\/- 0.29). However, Kt\/VQC value was higher than eKt\/V (1.67 +\/- 0.22 and 1.61 +\/- 0.26 mean difference 0.06 +\/- 0.07 p &lt; 0.01). Both values correlated highly (R2: 0.92 p &lt; 0.001). Urea generation (C) calculated using UCM was 8.75 +\/- 3.4 g\/24 h and those calculated using QC was 8.64 +\/- 3.21 g\/24 h. Mean difference 0.10 +\/- 1.14 (ns). G calculated by UCM correlated highly with that derived from QC (R2: 0.88 p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, Kt\/VDC and Kt\/VQC should be considered as valid measures for dialysis efficiency. However, the limits of agreement between Kt\/VQC and eKt\/V were closer than Kt\/VDC.","2531":"The aim of this study was to evaluate and analyze the implementation of a Quality Management Systems (QMS) and the use of Clinical Performance measures by the Nephrology Services and Hemodialysis Units in Spain. The Quality Management Work Group of the Spanish Society of Nephrology (SEN) realized a survey that was directed to all the Spanish Nephrology Services and Hemodialysis Units. No exclusion criteria were defined for the study. The survey was based on a multichotomous self completing \"Ad Hoc\" questionnaire. The survey was answered by 46.7% of the polled centers (44.5% were public hospitals and 55.5% private centers). Of those replying the survey 70 % had a QMS, with a higher implementation in the area of Hemodialysis (HD). The ISO 9001-2000 was the prefer QMS model chosen by 76.4% of the centers. 68.6% of the centers with a QMS were certified by an external Auditing Group. 91.7% of the Nephrology Services and Hemodialysis units were using some clinical practice guideline. A high percentage of the centers had medical protocols and nursing plans (&gt; 90%). A significantly higher implementation of QMS was observed in Private Hospitals and Hemodialysis Units (88.8 %) when compared to public Hospitals (46.1%) (X2: 31.5; p &lt; 0.001). The ISO 9000 Standard certification was selected by 78,3% of the private centers and by 21,7% of the public centers (X2: 37.3; p &lt; 0.001). The certification or accreditation were done by an external auditing group in 68. 1% of the private centers compared to 31.9% for the public Hospitals (X2: 24.8; p &lt; 0.001). Although the rate of answers prevents from extracting definitive conclusions, the result seems to indicate that in the Spanish Nephrology Community a clear trend exists towards the use QMS. This tendency suggests, that in the near future, there will be a progressive implementation and routine use of QMS in the Nephrology Community in Spain. ","2532":"Calcitriol has traditionally been the most widely used treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in uremic patients. There are currently no crossover equivalence studies of alphacalcidol versus calcitriol establishing which of the two derivatives is more active and better tolerated. The objective of this study was to compare the long term effect on control of PTH of similar doses of alphacalcidol versus calcitriol in the treatment of SHPT in these patients. We conducted a retrospective study on 21 hemodialysis patients with stable SHPT of varying severity treated with intravenous calcitriol. In July 2002, the pharmacy of the reference hospital decided to substitute calcitriol for alphacalcidol based on the similarity of the two drugs. The conversion was made substituting a similar amount of drug. Mean absolute serum levels and percentage change in PTH, calcium and phosphorus were compared between the two periods and at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months after starting treatment with alphacalcidol. Student's t-test for paired means was used to compare the values between the two periods. In the calcitriol period, mean PTH levels were 275.2 +\/- 111.7 pg\/ml. The mean dose of drug used was 1.7 +\/- 0.8 mcg postdialysis, and serum calcium and phosphorus levels were 10.1 +\/- 0,5 mg\/dl and 5,2 +\/- 0,9 mg\/dl, respectively (p &lt; 0.01). Mean dialysate calcium content was 2,9 +\/- 0,3 mEq\/l. In the alphacalcidol period, PTH increased (441.6 +\/- 178.3 pg\/ml) (p &lt; 0.001) and the percentage of patients with PTH &lt; 300 pg\/ml decreased (24% at the end of the period), in spite of significantly increasing the mean drug dose (2,3 +\/- 0,9 mcg postdialysis) (p &lt; 0.05). Serum calcium levels did not show significant differences (10.2 +\/- 0.7 mg\/dl) (p = NS), but phosphorus control was improved (4,7 +\/- 0,5 mg\/dl) (p &lt; 0.01). The percentage of patients with PTH &lt; 300 pg\/ml decreased progressively from the start of treatment with alphacalcidol from 75% to 24% at the end of follow-up. Our results seem to suggest that the dose of alphacalcidol and calcitriol are not equivalent and we need to increase the dose of alphacalcidol to obtain a similar result to calcitriol on suppression of PTH in uremic patients with SPTH. ","2533":"Cardiovascular disease remains the single most common cause of excess morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and the traditional risk factors can't explain the high incidence of these events. New \"non-traditional\" risk factors are analysed in uremic patients and the increased oxidative stress is postulated to be an important contributor to uremic cardiovascular risk. In order to evaluate the effects of the hemodialysis treatment, a complete oxidative stress study was performed in fifteen uremic patients. Representative antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), together with oxidized\/reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG\/GSH) and other oxidation indicators including malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), were analysed to assess oxidative stress status in normal control volunteers and in uremic patients treated with hemodialysis (HD). In the latter group blood samples were taken prior and after HD to evaluate the effect of the session of HD over the oxidative markers. Low levels of antioxidant enzyme activities were observed in the uremic patients as compared with normal control subjects. HD treatment results in a significant recovery of these enzyme activities but remain lower as compared with control values. Levels of GSSG and GSH concentrations were increased and reduced respectively in uremic patients. These differences were even higher before the HD and were reduced upon treatment to levels closer to those observed in controls. MDA levels and 8-oxo-dG levels were also increased in uremic patients with the highest values observed in the pre-treated HD group. Even though HD treatment decreases the levels of oxidation products in mononuclear cells of uremic patients the values of the control group are not reached. Our results suggest that hemodialysis by itself could correct the oxidative status in these patients. The possible mechanisms involved in the oxidative stress changes with the hemodialysis treatment will be discussed below. ","2534":"Systemic amyloidosis is a disease resulting from extracellular deposition of fibrillar protein in various organs. Main systemic amyloidosis are: primary (AL) and Secondary (AA). The kidney is usually involved, conferring and adverse prognosis. In the last decade there has been a change in the aetiology of AA amyloidosis. To analyse the incidence of AL and AA amyloidosis in our current population as well as the aetiology of AA amyloidosis. To describe clinical outcomes, renal involvement and survival. We performed a descriptive analysis of all cases of amyloidosis diagnosed from 1992 to 2004 in our hospital. Diagnosis was assessed on histological criteria: positivity Congo Red stain. Clinical data, renal involvement, dialysis treatment and survival were analysed. 76 cases, 44 women, mean age 70.7 +\/- 12. Types: 55 AA (72%), 21 AL (28%) systemic amyloidosis. AA aetiology was: 66% rheumatic disorders, 28% infectious disease, 6% others. Incidence for AL was 4.6 and for AA 12.2 cases\/million. Renal involvement was present in 75% at diagnosis (69% Creatinine clearance &lt; 60 ml\/min, 37% urinary protein &gt; 3 g\/24 hours). 21 cases (28%) progressed to renal disease stage V in the 8.1 +\/- 9.8 months follow up period, and 14 cases started dialysis treatment (10 HD, 4 CAPD). In 7 cases (33%) dialysis was not indicated due to their poor clinical condition, short life expectancy and bad quality of life. Mean global survival at diagnosis was 55% and 40% at 12 and 24 months (AL 58% and 19%; AA 55% and 44%). Mean survival from the start of dialysis was 30% and 5% at 12 and 24 months. Although amyloidosis has a low incidence in our population, the kidney is usually involved. Rheumatological disorders are the principal aetiology of AA amyloidosis. Long term survival is poor, specially for AL. ","2535":"As osteoporosis and renal insufficiency are two prevalent pathologies in the aging population we decided to evaluate retrospectively the renal function (estimated by formula) in postmenopausal women who came to our Institute for bone mass determination to establish the relationship between them. Thus, we studied 300 postmenopausal women with a mean age of 66.9 +\/- 6.8 years who had a bone densitometry performed; we chose total femur bone mineral density (TFBMD) for defining osteopenia and osteoporosis as this measurement included substantial amounts of both trabecular and cortical bone; osteopenia\/osteoporosis was diagnosed using T score criteria recommended by the WHO. We also measured BMD at the femoral neck. Renal function was estimated by the Cockcroft-Gault formula using serum creatinine determination. We found osteoporosis in 61 patients (20.3%). Of them, el 81.9% have renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance-ECrC &lt; or = 60 ml\/min), compared to 54% of 239 women who had normal BMD\/osteopenia (p &lt; 0.001). Six of 61 (9.8%) women with osteoporosis had severe renal insufficiency (ECrC &lt; or = 36 ml\/min) versus 4\/239 (1.6%) women with normal BMD\/osteopenia (p = 0.001). Women with osteoporosis were older, and had a significantly lower weight and ECrC compared to patients without osteoporosis (ECrC 52 +\/- 11 ml\/min vs 59 +\/- 12 ml\/min; p &lt; 0.0001). We found a significant positive correlation between TFBMD and ECrC (r = 0.389) as well as with weight (r = 0.422) and a negative correlation between age and ECrCE (r = -0.51) and with TFBMD (r = -0.22). In the multiple regression analysis only weight continued to correlate significantly with TFBMD (Beta = 0.344). When FNBMD was considered as the dependent variable, we found a significantly negative correlation with age (r = -0.30) and significantly positive correlations with height (r = 0. 16), weight (r = 0.33) and ECcr (r = 0.39). In the multiple regression analysis only age (Beta = -0.20) and weight (Beta = 0.20) continued having an independent correlation FNBMD. We conclude that our data confirm that there exists a substantial prevalence of renal insufficiency, even severe, among patients with densitometric osteoporosis that should be kept in mind when one is considering the prescription of medications as bisphosphonates that have renal clearance, so as not to jeopardize the efficacy and the security of these drugs.","2536":"","2537":"","2538":"","2539":"","2540":"","2541":"","2542":"","2543":"","2544":"","2545":"","2546":"","2547":"","2548":"Peritonitis is a well-known complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment.

We present a patient with retroperitoneal hemorrhage due to spontaneous rupture of a myelolipoma, hypertension, and renal failure secondary to nephroangiosclerosis.","2550":"Hypersensitivity reactions are a feared complication of hemodialysis considering their potential for a serious and eventually fatal course. This association could reflect a number of different exposures, including concomitant medications. Like this, systemic steroid-induced hypersensitivity reactions do occur, althought their incidence is extremely rare.

The diagnosis could be confirmed by the patient history and performing skin testing, oral or parenteral challenge or by the evidence of specific IgE. We report on a 39-year-old woman undergoing dialysis therapy in whom severe bronchospasm was induced by corticosteroids. She has a positive systemic reaction on the oral steroid challenge test. A successful desensitization regimen for safe administration was achieved. The recognition of high-risk subjects and alternative therapeutic approach are critical, mainly in the management of patients while receiving corticosteroids or a renal allograft.","2551":"Direct dialysis quantification is considered the gold standard for determining urea distribution volume, but it is impractical for routine use. So, urea distribution volume in hemodialysis patients is usually estimated from anthropometric equations. Ionic dialysance allows to calculate the urea distribution volume dividing the Kt obtained by ionic dialysance by the Kt\/V obtained by a simplified formula. The aim of the present work was to analyse the concordance between the ionic dialysance and the direct dialysis quantification methods to estimate de urea distribution volume. In 15 hemodialysis patients (10 males and 5 females), we have estimated the urea distribution volume by the direct dialysis quantification (Vurea), by the anthropometrics equations of Watson (VWatson) and Chertow (VChertow) and by the ionic dialysance method (VDI). To obtain VDI we have used two simplified Kt\/V formulas: the monocompartimental and the equilibrated Daugirdas equations (VDIm and VDIe respectively). The intermethod variability was assessed by the relative difference (absolute difference between VUrea and the other methods, divided by the mean). VUrea (26,2 L) was statistically different from theVDIe (30,6 L, p &lt; 0.01), VWatson 35.2 L (p &lt; 0.001) and VChertow (38 L, p &lt; 0.001). VDIm was 26.3 L (p = ns). VUrea represents the 42% of the body weight for the males (range 36 to 49%) and the 33% of the body weight for the female (range 28 to 38%). The intermethod variability was high for the VDIe (21.6%), VWatson (37.4%) and VChertow (48. 1%), but it was low for the VDIm (9.9%). Urea distribution volume calculated by the ionic dialysance method using the monocompartimental Daugirdas Kt\/V equation has an acceptable agreement with the urea distribution volume calculated by the direct dialysis quantification. Anthropometry-based equations overestimate the urea distribution volume in hemodialysis patients.

This prompted a reevaluation of organ-solid transplantation as a treatment option for HIV-infected patients. Some trials in the United States have shown that one- and 2-year graft and patient survival is comparable to HIV-negative transplant population. In Europe the experience is still scarce. The aim of this study is to analyse the outcome and the clinical characteristics of HIV-infected patients who received kidney transplantation in Spain in the HAART era. Ten patients were transplanted in our country since 2001. Only one patient was black. The main cause of end-stage renal disease reported was glomerulonephritis. Six of the recipients were coinfected by hepatitis C virus. Inclusion criteria included undetectable HIV viral load and CD4 counts greater than 200\/pL. Immunosuppression consisted of steroids, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, with antibody induction in 4 cases. The median and mean follow-up was 11 and 16.3+\/-15.6 (3-46) months, respectively. One recipient lost his graft because of early renal venous thrombosis. The remaining patients are functioning graft with mean serum creatinina level of 1.5 +\/- 0.5 mg\/dl. Biopsy-proven acute rejection was diagnosed in 4 recipients and was reversed in all cases with antirejection treatment. The plasma HIV RNA levels have remained controlled and CD4 counts have been stable in excess of 200 cell\/microL. None of patients have developed AIDS complications. Recipients receiving protease inhibitor-based HAART regimens required significant dosing modification to maintain appropriate tacrolimus levels.

","2554":"There are currently many hemodialysis modalities that are believed to be superior to conventional hemodialysis. In order to compare the effectiveness and security of the different hemodialysis techniques a systematic review was carried out. Faced with the fact that the scales available mainly focus on study design and tend to ignore external validity, a quality scale was specifically developed to assess the quality of the studies included in the review. The objective of this article is to introduce the quality assessment scale developed and present the results of its usability and applicability. The following databases were searched in order to identify the studies: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, HTA, CRD and others. The articles obtained were selected based on previously established inclusion\/exclusion criteria. The scale covers three issues: general aspects of the studies, specific aspects of the studies and patient characteristics. This scale allowed for a more accurate classification of the global quality of the studies and was reproducible. In general, those studies classified as high quality studies received the highest score and those studies classified as low quality studies received the lowest scores. The median value was 5,35 (53,5%). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0,96. As a conclusion of this work it can be stated that currently available scales have serious limitations for the use in studies that compare different hemodialysis modalities and that the use of a scale specifically constructed for this purpose provides more accurate information on the quality of the evidence which is fundamental to interpret results and generate inferences.","2555":"To evaluate the influence of late referral to nephrology of the patients with chronic renal failure in the morbimortality of the patients who start hemodialysis. SUBJETS AND METHODS: There were included in the study the patients who started hemodialysis (HD) as first form of treatment, and that survived at least three months in both hospitals of reference of the province of Huesca from january 1990 to december 2001. Patients who started HD after acute renal failure were excluded. Clinical and analytical data were determined for each patient at the start of HD and during the follow-up. Early (ER) and late referral (LR) were defined by the time of first nephrology encounter greather than or less than 4 months respectively, before HD initiation. Morbidity analysis (using multiple linear regression with rate of days of hospitalization as dependent variable) and global and anual during the first three years of follow-up survival analysis (using Cox proportional hazards regression) were carried out. A total of 139 patients (78%) started HD in the ER group and 39 (22%) in LR group. Mean follow-up was similar in both (ER = 34.43 +\/- 25.5 months; LR = 34.42 +\/- 28.37 months). At the start of dialysis LR was associated to higher proportion of temporary catheters, lower level of hematocrit and albumin, higher comorbidity and higher levels of urea and creatinine. Risk factors selected by the model in the morbidity analysis were index of comorbidity (CI), late referral, serum albumin, urea reduction ratio (URR) and hematocrit (R2 = 0.334, F = 16.97, p &lt; 0.005). The final equation of regression was: Rate of hospitalization's days = 101.12 + (2.45 x CI) - (12. 11 x LR) - (11.57 x Alb.) - (0.43 x PRU) - (0.83 x Hto). Variables selected by Cox's regression model that were associated with survival throughout complete follow-up were hematocrit (RR = -0,207, CI 95% 0.726-0.910, p &lt; 0.0005), index of comorbidity (RR = 0,265, CI 95% 1.066-1.594, p = 0.007), PRU (RR = - 0,059, CI 95% 0.893-0.996, p = 0.038) and type of dialysis membrane (RR = 0,771, Cl 95% 0.260-0.822, p = 0.007). Nevertheless, in successive models fitting after 12, 24 and 36 months of follow-up the variable LR influenced in an independent way survival first two years, losing his significance later. In our study patients of the group LR presented a worse clinical and metabolic situation at the beginning of the HD. Later there was demonstrated in this group a higher long-term morbidity and a lower survival the first two years. ","2556":"Despite the interest generated by the increasing number of studies that measure Quality of Life among patients and caregivers, few of these studies measure the caregivers burden in Peritoneal Dialysis (PD). The main target of this study was to create a burden measure questionnaire applicable amongst caregivers of PD patients.  1) Patients had to be in PD treatment for more than 3 months; 2) Patients had to receive help with the PD treatment from a caregiver. The study was divided into 3 phases: 1st) design and use of the initial questionnaire; 2nd) a test-retest on a modified scale; and 3rd) to provide the questionnaire-3 to two collaborative centres with similar PD programs. Four groups of caregivers were established: A1:23, A2:17, B:7 and C:16 caregivers. We applied 5 scales (5): 1--Patient Dependence on caregiver, from caregivers' view (D); 2--Complete caregiver burden (CB), including 12 items which measure the caregivers' subjective burden, 3--Reduced caregiver burden (RB), as the one before but with only 8 items, 4--Repercussions on the caregiver (R), which measures objective burden; 5--Specific PD tasks (ST), a scale that measures the effort the tasks implied in the PD treatment represent for the caregiver. We studied 63 caregivers (table I): mean age: 53.43 (SD = 12.3); Sex: Females: 86.4%, Males: 13.6%, corresponding to 63 patients: mean age: 59.79 (SD = 15.9); Sex: Males: 80.3%, Females: 19.7%. Valuable results for reliability, unidimensionality, and discrimination were obtained in the 1st and 2nd phases, except for burden scale which was compound of two factors; then one of those factors was suppressed. In the 3rd phase, ANOVA did not show any differences between centres (table II). Consequently, all caregivers could be analysed together. Reliability results for each one of the third phase scales (table III) were: D: Cronbach alpha = 0,886; CB: alpha = 0,894; RB: alpha = 0,857; R: alpha = 0,892; ST: alpha = 0,62. Although the ST scale obtained an acceptable reliability, it was suppressed in the 3rd phase due to the low correlation with other scales and the fact that it was not applicable to all caregivers. Finally, a direct correlation was found between third phase scales (table IV): D-RB: r = 0.502, p &lt; or = 0.001; D-R: r = 0.599, p &lt; or = 0.001; RB-R: r = 0.775, p &lt; or = 0.001. We must headlight that both Burden scales, and the Repercussion scale, obtained a direct correlation with the Dependency scale. A questionnaire has been created to measure burden and repercussions on caregivers of peritoneal dialysis patients. It can already be applied, as requirements of both reliability and validity are fulfilled. This questionnaire can be a useful tool to prevent caregivers' burnout. ","2557":"The shortcoming of serum creatinine (SCr) as an index of renal function is well known, patients can have significantly decreased glomerular filtration rates (GFR) with normal range SCr values, making the recognition of renal dysfunction more difficult. This study was designed to estimate renal function and the prevalence of renal dysfunction in essential hypertensive patients, comparing SCr and 4 formulas used to measure the creatinine clearance (CrCl) (the urinary CrCl formula, Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD and body surface formula) The study included 721 essential hypertensive patients, 319 men (44.2%), 402 women (55.8%), mean age 56.3 +\/- 13.9 (53.7 +\/- 14.4 vs 58.3 +\/- 13.3). In all subjects SCr was measured and 24-h urine sample was collected to evaluate CrCl. Creatinine clereance was calculated by 4 formulas. Patients were grouped according to age (&lt; 40, 41-65, 65-75 and &gt; 76) and renal function was classified as normal when SCr &lt; 1.4 in women and 1.5 mg\/dl in men and CrCl (&gt; 60 ml\/m, respectively) within the above written formulas. SCr increases with age (1.01 +\/- 0.36 vs 1.3 +\/- 1.15) and CrCl decreases according to the 4 formulas (107.6; 92.8; 74.7 and 57.3 for the urinary SCr formula); (117.7; 87.7; 65.9 and 49.5 for the CC formula); (87.4, 74.9, 66.5 and 61 for the MDRD formula) and (97, 85.3, 71.9 and 57.3 for the body suface formula). The 4 formulas are comparable markers of renal function in the overall population. With any formula the percentage of patients with impaired renal function was much higher than indicated by the plasma creatinine alone (4% for SCr) vs 18.3-25.3% (CrCl &lt; 60 ml\/m) according to the 4 formulas. This study documents the substantial prevalence of abnormal renal function in essential hypertension.

A prospective study was performed in a fifteen years period between 1988 and 2003 in paediatric patients with a solitary kidney, in a Children's Hospital. All the following parameters were evaluated every year: age, sex, ethiology, elapsed time since the concept of solitary kidney was assessed (ET), blood pressure, renal function measured by GFR, urinary excretion of solutes, concentration ability and microalbuminuria (MA). DMSA was made at the beginning and every five years and renal ultrasonography was carried out every two years. Two groups were made depending of nephrourologic malformations in the remanent kidney and\/or antecedents of pyelonephritis: Group I with antecedents of pyelonephritis and\/or malformations; Group II, nor antecedents of pyelonephritis neither malformations. Ninety five patients were evaluated, 69% (n = 66) were males and 31% (n = 29) were females, with an age at diagnosis of 3.5 yr (ranged 0.1-17 yrs). ET was 9.2 yrs (range 1-20 yrs). The ethiology was: Nephrectomy of the contralateral kidney 39 patients (pts) (41%), renal agenesis (RA) 47 pts (49%) and nonfunctioning multicystic displastic kidney (MCDK) 9 pts (9.4%). Functional alterations were found in 18 pts (19%), such as MA in 12 pts (12.6%), decreased GRF in 5 pts (5.5%) and hypertension in 3 pts (3.2%). It was observed more significant functional alterations in the patients of the Group I (58%) versus Group II (9%) (p &lt; 0.001). There was in Group II a significant correlation between kidney size and GFR (p &lt; 0.01, r = 0.3), and between kidney size and ET (P &lt; 0.05; r = 0.3). Any alteration in the renal function was observed in the 12.6% of the children. The most frequent affected parameter of renal damage was MA, followed by GFR reduction.

On the other hand, the delta-H (AH) method is another noninvasive technique that measures the VA blood flow rate during hemodialysis (HD). 1) To analyze some anatomic and functional parameters of VA by CDU. 2) To compare AH and CDU methods in measuring VA blood flow rate. We explored the VA (radial arteriovenous fistula AVF 60.6%, brachial AVF 24.2%, femoral graft 15.2%; mean VA duration 33.5 +\/- 31.5 months) of 33 stable ESRD (mean age 61.7 +\/- 13.3 yr, sex M: 48.5%; F: 51.5%; mean time on hemodialysis HD 39.3 +\/- 33.3 months; 9.1% diabetes) patients (pts) by CDU over 3 months period. All CDU examinations were performed off HD by the same radiologist using a 5-10 MHz linear transducer. The arterial and venous blood flow rates were calculated by CDU using the equation: flow (ml\/min) = time average velocity (mean of three cardiac cycles) (m\/s) x cross-sectional area (mm2) x 60. No VA explored had any sign of dysfunction prior to CDU evaluation. All pts with significant VA stenosis by CDU (&gt; or = 50% reduction in the luminal diameter) were referred for angiography (AG). All functional parameters were measured in duplicate and the values were averaged. In addition, QA was also calculated in the same week by the deltaH method during HD using the Crit Line III Monitor.

Vascular calcification (PVC) was evaluated by radiologic series (55.7%). We analyzed the presence of clinical and analytical cardiovascular factors. All patients underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, Doppler echocardiography. Patients were followed for two years. Clinical information collected: incidence of ischemic heart disease (IHD), CHF, and mortality due to cardiovascular events. Most frequent finding was Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH) (93%), followed by DD (63.5% had anormal LV relaxation) (ALVR). Incidence of CHF was 38.3%; and was significantly associated with higher: time on HD (130\/72 months), Ca x P (74\/65), PTH (677\/376), bone alkaline phosphatase (27\/16), and systolic BP (145 vs 130 mmHg); IHD, PVC, valvular calcification (VC), LVH and ALVR (p &lt; 0.01). Systolic function was normal in both groups (with\/without CHF). Logistic regression identified as risk factors for CHF: ALVR (OR: 9.5), IHD (OR: 15) and systolic BP (OR: 2.2). ALVR was associated with greater age (55\/37), longer time on HD (76\/60), PVC and VC (p &lt; 0.001). Predictor factors identified were age (OR: 2.13) and PVC (OR: 3.9).

A statistic significant decrease in Hb and hematocrit (Hto) was observed over the third month, although all patients maintain Hb levels higher than 11 g\/dl. At the same time it was appreciated a statistic significant increased on creatinine (Cr) and parathyroid hormone levels (PTH). At the end of one year evaluation period no differences were observed in any of variables.

","2579":"Chronic kidney disease is a major public health problem in developed countries. The incidence of patients on dialysis is increasing progressively in the last years. The ageing population and increasing incidence of diabetes and hypertension are the main causes. Moreover, the level of kidney function is now recognised as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, even in mild cases. There is a great unaware about the prevalence of mild to moderate chronic kidney disease in the general population. The aim of the present study was to know the kidney function level in our general population over 64 years old, and the associated cardiovascular risk. This is an epidemiological descriptive cross-sectional study, obtained by a representative random sampling of the population over 64 years living in the reference area of our Hospital. The glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the Cockroft-Gault formula and the MDRD equations. Kidney function has been classified by the K\/DOQI stages. We examined the univariate and multivariate association between the estimated glomerular filtration rate and the presence of cardiovascular events. We analysed 253 subjects aged 65 to 93 years (mean 72 +\/- 5.4). Present comorbidities were: HTA 64%, dislipemia 29%, diabetes 14%, active smokers: 10% of men, 1,5% of women. A previous cardiovascular event was present in 11% of patients (15% of men; 6,8% of women). A serum creatinin level over 1,3 and 1,5 mg\/dl was present in 3,8% of women and 8% of men respectively. Nevertheless, chronic kidney insufficiency (estimated clreatinie clearance less than 60 mix') was present in 31-49% relying on the utilised formula. In addition to age, sex, and diabetes, an independent graded association was observed between reduced glomerular filtration rate and the existence of cardiovascular events. We have confirmed a high prevalence of renal insufficiency among elderly people, usually not detected by the isolated plasma creatinin concentration This aspect is important for cardiovascular stratification risk and medical decisions (diagnostic and\/or therapeutic). The level of glomerular filtration rate is independently associated with cardiovascular events. ","2580":"Either inflammation or hyperuricemia has been related with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality. A hypothetical relationship between serum uric acid levels (SUA) and inflammatory markers has never been tested in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in CKD patients, and to test the hypothesis of a relationship between SUA and CRP levels. The study group consisted of 337 patients (174 males, mean age 63 +\/- 16 years) with advanced chronic renal failure not yet on dialysis. None of them had overt inflammatory or infectious diseases. High sensitivity CRP levels were analyzed as a binary (above or below median value), or continuous variable (log-transformed CRP), by multiple logistic or linear regression analysis, respectively. Demographics, clinical, and biochemical characteristics, including SUA levels, were the variables tested in these analysis. In a subset of 169 patients without diabetes, the same analysis were carried out, with the inclusion of fasting insulin levels and HOMA-IR as independent variables. Median CRP level was 3.25 mg\/L, and mean SUA level was 7.59 +\/- 1.94 mg\/dl. Patients with CRP levels above the median had significantly higher mean SUA level than that of the rest of study patients (7.93 +\/- 1.79 vs 7.24 +\/- 2.03 mg\/dl, p = 0.001). SUA levels correlated significantly with log-transformed CRP levels (r = 0. 16, p = 0.0022). The relationship between SUA and CRP levels remained statistically significant after adjustment for age, sex, comorbid index, obesity, residual renal function, diuretic and allopurinol treatment, in the multivariate logistic and linear regression models (OR: 1.296, p = 0.0003; and beta: 0.204, p = 0.0002). The significant association between SUA and CRP levels did not change when HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels were included as independent variables in the subset of 169 patients without diabetes. In conclusion, SUA levels are related with CRP levels in CKD patients.","2581":"Atheroembolic disease is recognized as an iatrogenic complication from an invasive vascular procedure, such as manipulation of the aorta during angiography or vascular surgery, and after anticoagulant and fibrinolytic therapy. Cholesterol crystal embolism is caused by showers of cholesterol crystals from an atherosclerotic aorta that occlude small arteries. The kidney is a frequent target organ for cholesterol emboli because of proximity of the renal arteries to abdominal aorta and it receive an enormous amount of blood flows. We describe the epidemiologic agents of 19 cases that were diagnosed by histologic sections of the affected tissues; the eosinophilia and the renal failure are the clinical features that guide to the diagnosis, in patients with ischemic nephropathy and general atherosclerosis. 53% among patients had a previous invasive procedure and 26% occurred spontaneously. We remark the importance of the kidney's biopsy in diagnosis of the atheroembolic disease and their bad prognosis with 63% of death rate in 18 months of average follow-up. We report patients with the multiple cholesterol emboli syndrome mimicking systemic vasculitis: they died by multivisceral acute failure. The subacute presentation of atheroembolic disease with progressive renal failure treated with hemodialysis is a sign of bad prognosis. The knowledge of the disease and their prevention are the better treatment.","2582":"Numerous association studies have been performed to evaluate the relationship between the angiotensinogen gene and the essential hypertension, but their results are conflicting. The conflicting results may be explained by methodological reasons, particularly genetic differences in the population samples, phenotypic differences in the hypertensive populations analyzed, lack of appropriate control for other hypertension risk factors in some studies, or limited statistical power among many studies. Furthermore, hypertension is a public health issue of great relevance in Baleric Islands (Spain). For these reasons we performed an association study about the relationship between the M235T, T174M and G-6A diallelic polymorphisms of the angiotensinogen gene and hypertension in a population from Majorca (Balearic Islands), in which a considerable homogeneity with respect to ethnicity and environmental factors could be documented. This population was composed of 109 patients and 107 controls. Alleles of the angiotensinogen gene were determined by PCR and restriction site polymorphism analysis. The different genotypes were tested for association with dependent variables by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the univariate analysis we found no evidence of association between the angiotensinogen gene genotypes and hypertension. This lack of association was independent of obesity, familial history of hypertension and diabetes for the genotypes of the polymorphisms M235T and G-6A; however, in the multivariate analysis the T174T174 genotype showed an almost significant positive association with hypertension [OR = 2.76 (95% confidence interval: 1.00-7.65, p = 0.05)]. The T174T174 genotype also showed a significant negative association with obesity [OR = 0.41 (95% confidence interval: 0.18-0.90, p = 0.03)] that remained after adjustment by sex, hypertension and diabetes [OR = 0.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.10-0.65, p = 0.004)]. Our results: a) are in contrast with the results from most previous studies that found a relationship of the T174M polymorphism with hypertension, as in those studies the M174 allele was responsible for the association; b) emphasize the need for rigorous control for obsesity in the studies of association between the angiotensinogen gene and hypertension; c) underscore the importance and the utility of using concrete populations to carry out studies on the genetic dissection of hypertension.","2583":"","2584":"","2585":"","2586":"","2587":"","2588":"","2589":"","2590":"","2591":"","2592":"","2593":"","2594":"","2595":"","2596":"","2597":"","2598":"","2599":"","2600":"","2601":"","2602":"","2603":"","2604":"","2605":"","2606":"","2607":"","2608":"","2609":"","2610":"","2611":"","2612":"The use of jugular temporary catheters as vascular access for hemodialysis, entails a risk of various complications.

After the placement of a polyurethane double-lumen catheter with ultrasound guidance at the level of the internal jugular vein, arterial blood streaming was observed through the lumen of the catheter. The angiographic study showed the tipo of the catheter placed at the level of the aortic arch. Ultrasound exam clearly despicted the track between the internal jugular vein and the internal carotid artery. An effective closing of the fistula was achieved with the placement of a covered stent-graft with the simultaneous withdrawal of the catheter.

We want to underline the great properties of sterile maggots to selectively dissolve necrotic tissue, to disinfect the wound and to stimulate healing. Thus, sterile-maggot debridement may constitute a very good adjuvant treatment even in proximal ulcers of calciphylaxis, preventing systemic infection.","2615":"Demographic changes along with an increase in the demand of organs and an increase in the expertise of transplantation teams, lead to a constant modification of donors' characteristics and, accordingly, of the supply of the organs used and refused. Analyze the use and refusal of kidneys generated in Galicia. Subjects and method. A follow-up of kidney donors was carried out between 1996 and 2000, studying the reasons for non extraction and refusal of kidneys and analyzing the influence that donors' characteristics have on them. In order to evaluate the risk factors of not using grafts, multiple logistic regression patterns were made, assessing odds ratios with confidence intervals at 95%. 836 kidneys were recovered from 433 donors, and 697 were implanted out of them. 17% of the organs extracted, a percentage approaching 25% in the two latest years, were discarded, due to the biopsy findings (27%), donor's previous conditions (22%), anatomical disorders (16%), prolonged cold ischemia (12%) or recipient not located or unsuitable (14%). The average age of refused grafts was significantly higher than that of implanted ones, in such a way that having more than 45 years old was an independent risk for refusing kidneys (OR = 1.76 and p = 0.05, for 45-59 years old; OR = 6.1 and p = 0.000, for older than 60 years old). The same happened with history of hypertension (OR = 1.59 and p = 0.044), high serum creatinine level (OR = 1.83 and p = 0.005) and positive serology for HCV (OR = 5.65 and p = 0.001) and anti-HBc (OR = 2.91 and p = 0.017). Elderly donors and donors with concomitant diseases enable us to increase the number of grafts, although they also lead to an increase in refusals, which nearly amounts to 20% of the ones generated. However, more than the half were refused due to pontentially avoidable reasons and therefore these could have been valued for transplantation to limit recipients.

Variables that affect rHuEPO dose requirements can be broadly divided into modificable and immutable characteristics. Most of the scientific research on rHuEPO hyporesponsiveness has focused on modificable variables (iron status, dialysis adequacy), while immutable variables such as gender, etiology of chronic renal failure (CRF) and age have been insufficiently explored. A cross sectional study was performed in order to evaluate if immutable patient characteristics determine rHuEPO dose requirements among 215 patients (52% males; mean age 66 +\/- 14 years) on hemodialysis (HD) for more than twelve months. Data were collected at 10 hemodialysis units in Aragon. Patients were divided into three groups according to their gender, their cause of CRF (diabetic nephropathy, vascular nephropathy, tubulointerstitial nephropathy and primary glomerulonephritis) and their age (younger than 60 years, from 60 to 75 years, older than 75 years). Despite a similar dose of rHuEPO, women had lower mean hemoglobin (11.1 +\/- 1.5 versus 11.6 +\/- 1.7 g\/dl; p = 0.0258) than men. The greater hemoglobin in men than women may be attributed to greater serum albumin in men (3.5 +\/- 0.3 versus 3.7 +\/- 0.3 mg\/dl; p = 0.0001). Requirements of rHuEPO were higher in the patients with etiology of primary glomerulonephritis compared with those with the other etiologies, even those with diabetic nephropathy (p = 0.0374). The rHuE-PO doses required to obtain similar hemoglobin levels were higher in patients younger than 60 years (p = 0.0249). We conclude that women, patients with primary glomerulonephritis as cause of CRF, and patients younger than 60 years showed the highest requirements of rHuEPO doses.","2618":"When using high convection dialysis techniques it arouses the necessity of considering the suitability of the regular protocols when administrating drugs, such as vancomycin. To confirm if the usual guideline of vancomycin is efficient in patients undergoing treatments with acetate free biofiltration (AFB) and haemodiafiltration on-line (on-line). To propose an alternative guideline of administration. 13 patients treated with AFB or On-line. 10 of them used filters of polysulfone and 3 of them of AN69. First part: 6 patients were administered 1 g iv during the last hour of dialysis. Second part: 7 patients were given a loading dose of 30 mg\/kg iv with a reinforcement of 500 mg post-dialysis. The blood levels of the antibiotic were monitorized during the week following the administration. During the first phase it was noticed a decrease of 41% in the serum level of vancomycin during dialysis, conditioning subtherapeutic levels in the 83% of the patients until the end of the study. As for the second phase, therapeutic non-toxic levels were maintained during the whole study. The existence of a post-dialysis rebound of the 21 % was confirmed. A bigger clearance of vancomycin was obtained with the On-line technique rather than with AFB (176 vs 135 ml\/min). We find a strong correlation between the decrease of the antibiotic and the volume ultrafiltrated with the On-line technique. The usual guideline of vancomycin may not be enough with the new convective dialysis techniques. A guideline based on a loading dose of 30 mg\/kg and a reinforcement of 500 mg at the end of each dialysis could be adequate. The antibiotic clearance with the On-line technique is probably made by convective transport.

We have analysed 192 hemodialysis sessions performed in 24 patients, 15 male and 9 female, mean age of 70.2 +\/- 12 years, included in on-line HDF. All treatments were done using 4008H (Fresenius) monitor equipped with on-line clearance monitoring (OCM), that measure, with non invasive monitoring, the effective ionic dialysance equivalent to urea clearance. Every patient received eight dialysis sessions: one with dialysate flow (Qd) 500 ml\/min, two with HD and Qd 800 ml\/min and five with on-line HDF. Other habitual haemodialysis parameters were no changed, dialysis time 200 +\/- 63 min (135-300) and blood flow 421 +\/- 29 ml\/min (350-450). Initial and final ionic dialysance values (K), final Kt, Kt\/V measured with OCM using V of Watson, and Kt\/V determined in blood pre and postdialysis concentrations of urea (Daugirdas second generation), were measured. The mean of initial K was 251 +\/- 21 ml\/min and the final K was 234 +\/- 24 ml\/min. The Kt measured with OCM was 50.6 +\/- 17 L, 51.2 +\/- 17 in men and 49.7 +\/- 16 in women. The V (Watson) was 34.5 +\/- 6 L. The Kt\/V measured with the Kt of OCM and V was 1,499 +\/- 0.54 and Kt\/V measured in blood samples was 1,742 +\/- 0.58. The correlation between both values was 0.956. The Kt was different according to dialysis modality used: in HD and Qd 500 was 44.7 +\/- 15 L, in HD and Qd 800 was 50.7 +\/- 17 and in on-line HDF (22.1 +\/- 7 L of reposition volume), was 51.8 +\/- 17 L. The Kt\/V from blood samples also shows variation: in HD and QD 500 was 1.60 +\/- 0.55, in HD and Qd 800 was 1,726 +\/- 0.56 and in on-line HDF was 1,776 +\/- 0.59. In this study has been observed a close correlation between the new biosensor OCM with the measures obtained from the blood samples. For this reason this sensor it is useful in all modalities of dialysis treatment, included on-line HDF. The sensor was able to discriminate the efficacy of different dialysis modalities used in this study.","2620":"To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the alfa-blocker doxazosin GITS in CRF patients.

A significant decrease in proteinuria (p &lt; 0.001) was seen in both groups (49.2% in group, 1, and 44.8% in group 2) since the third month, and confirmed at 12 and 24 months of follow-up (58.1% and 62.7% in group 1, and 56.8% and 55.4% in group 2, respectively), with no significant differences being seen between the two groups. No differences were found in blood pressure control. No significant decrease was found in any of the groups in the glomerular filtration rate, but this showed higher values in the group treated with ACEIs (2.98 +\/- 7.77 vs 1.64 +\/- 6.84 ml\/min\/year), though the difference with irbersartan was not statistically significant. No side effects occurred among patients treated with irbesartan, whereas three patients initially treated with ACEIs showed intolerance (cough). In conclusion, irbesartan showed in our study an antiproteinuric and nephroprotective effect similar to ACEIs in patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, and its administration was also shown to be safe.","2622":"Arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus give rise to a situation of high cardiovascular risk. The potential renoprotection from inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system is a valid option in this type of patient. Evaluate the effect of valsartan on blood pressure (BP) and renal function in albuminuric patients with type 2 diabetes and arterial hypertension. This was a prospective, observational study. Seventy-four diabetic patients with a blood pressure of &gt; or = 140\/90 mmHg, with micro or macroalbuminuria and a) blood creatinine levels lower 1.5 mg\/dl (group 1) or b) blood creatinine levels between 1.5 and 2 mg\/dl (group 2), were studied and followed up for a 12-week period. Treatment was started with valsartan 80 mg\/d, increasing to 160 mg\/d, adding torasemide at a dose of 5 mg\/d if the target blood pressure of 130\/85 mmHg has not been achieved. The degree of BP reduction was analyzed comparatively using a mercury sphygmomanometer and a semi-automatic monitor, the Omron HEM 705 CP. All patients showed a significant reduction of the systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressures (p&lt; 0.001) over the study period, decreasing from 150.7 +\/- 12.8 to 130.8 +\/- 9.6 and from 94.7 +\/- 7.7 to 76.8 +\/- 6.3 mmHg, respectively. A significant reduction was observed only for diastolic blood pressure (101.4 +\/- 8.8 to 79.4 +\/- 5.6; p &lt; 0.001) in the group 2 of patients. Lowest BP values were always obtained with the semiautomatic device. At the end of the study, 9.5% maintained valsartan 80 mg\/d and 36.5% reqcuired the addition of a second or third drug to valsartan 160 mg in order to achieve the therapeutic target BP A significant reduction was observed in the microalbuminuria (75.5 +\/- 9.5 to 54.7 +\/- 7.3 microg\/min; p &lt; 0.001) and macroalbuminuria (n = 20; 0.93 +\/- 0.4 to 0.68 +\/- 0.4 g\/day; p &lt; 0.001). Valsartan significantly reduced SBP and DBP Valsartan at 160 mg\/d had a significantly greater effect in reducing micro and macroalbuminuria. No changes were observed in renal function, HbA1c or serum potassium. The rate of adverse events was very low.

We present the case of an adult patient with end-stage renal disease and recurrent vascular access thrombosis associated with the prothrombin mutation G20210A and renal graft intolerance. The clinical expression of this heterozygous gene mutation may have been favoured by inflammatory state, frequent in dialysis patients. In this patient, the inflammatory response associated with the renal graft intolerance would have favored the development of recurrent vascular access thrombosis in a adult heterozygous for prothrombin mutation G20210A. In the case of early dysfunction of haemodialysis vascular access and after ruling out technical problems, it is convenient to carry out a screening for thrombophilia.","2637":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic disorder that primary involves joints, although renal disease has also been associated it is not common that rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) appears.

In selected clinical scenarios, successful revascularization procedures may preserve or restore renal function. We present a 66-year-old man with secundary hypertension and deteriorating renal function caused by bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery disease (complete obstruction of the left renal artery and subocclusive stenosis of the right) in which blood pressure was successfully controlled and renal function improved and maintained steady after bilateral percutaneus transluminal angioplasty and renal artery stenting.","2639":"","2640":"The graft intolerance syndrome (fever, pain, haematuria) may lead to a chronic inflammatory disease, with cardiovascular repercussion. Nephrectomy is considered the classical treatment of these cases but nowadays renal vascular embolization has been suggested as a possible alternative treatment. The present study concerns seven cases trated with renal vascular embolization in our hospital summarizing data of graft intolerance syndrome and the chronic inflammatory disease. Between january 2000 and december 2003 seven renal vascular embolization were performed in nonfunctioning renal allograft. The procedure was made with calibrated particles of 300-500micron. Data about complications related to the technique the same as analitic inflammatory parameters before and after treatment (CRP, ferritin, serum albumin, hemoglobin, erythropoietin) were registered. The patients were two men and five women, with median age of 39,7 +\/- 8,8 years. The period beween the dialysis and the embolization was of 10,0 +\/-8,2 months. Comparing the perion of admission in the hospital due to nephrectomy which was of 17,86+\/-4,41 days, the period because of embolization was shorter, being 8,14 +\/- 4,53 days. All analitic parameters studied, clearly improved after embolization with decrease of ferritin and CRP, increase of albumin and better hemoglobin level with lower erythropoietin dose. In five of the seven patients there was no renal captation with CT or gammagraphy. Four patients presented a postembolization syndrome, but no other important complication was registered. Neither reembolization nor renal nephrectomy was neccesary in any of the seven cases. Percutaneous renal embolization is a simple, easy, safety and effective technique that must be considered as an alternative treatment to nephrectomy, resolving the chronic inflammatory disease secondary to the graft intolerance syndrome. ","2641":"Parathyroidectomy, in any of its forms, is considered an effective short-term treatment of renal hyperparathyroidism in patients who are not being controlled with drugs. Nevertheless, the outcome in the medium and long term of the various surgical procedures is still unclear and seems a controversial issue. We conducted a prospective study of 15 patients undergoing subtotal parathyroidectomy who were followed up for a period of 48 months after surgery. All patients were included in hemodialysis programmes. Elevated levels of parathyroid hormone which did not decrease with drug therapy recommended parathyroidectomy. The aim of our study is to determine whether subtotal parathyroidectomy is an effective technique in the medium and long term. As regards the results obtained, the levels of parathyroid hormone and calcemia remarkably decreased during the follow-up period, if compared to pre-surgery levels. The level of alkaline phosphatase also showed a reduction and the \"hungry bone effect\" was observed. The phosphorus and Ca-P product levels only showed a significant reduction immediately after surgery but showed an increment from the first year after surgery onwards. Hemoglobin levels did not show any alteration after parathyroidectomy. In two patients we observed a relapse of hyperparathyroidism. The anatomopathological examination revealed nodular hyperplasia in most of the cases, including the two relapses. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is an effective surgical procedure in the medium-term treatment of renal hyperparathyroidism. ","2642":"Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia is a very common cause of digestive hemorrhage among elderly patients with chronic renal insufficiency. Therapeutic possibilities are scarce, as well as information available. Here we present our experience with 8 cases of dialysis patients that were treated with conjugated estrogens because of digestive hemorrhage due to angiodysplasia. Dissapearance of bleeding was observed after the onset of estrogen therapy, with a significant decrease of blood transfusions. This type of non-invasive treatment can avoid aggressive therapeutic interventions in patients with a high prevalence of co-morbid conditions (old patients undergoing chronic dialysis).","2643":"Good vascular access remains the cornerstone of effective hemodialysis treatment. The Tesio catheters has been proposed to be a reliable source of vascular access for the dialysis patients. We examined all Tesio catheters inserted over a 3-year period in our hospital. We obtained age, sex, dialysis duration, original nephropaty, vascular access history, complications, dialysis parameters, catheter function duration, confort level for patients and nurses, and death in all our cases. 33 catheters were inserted in 30 patients, 14 male and 16 female. Age 73,92 +\/- 9,22 years. Dialysis duration, 25,64 +\/- 53,45 months. Diabetic nephropaty 26,66%, NAE 40%, others 33,33%. First vascular access in 13 patients (43,33%), one previously fistula, 5 patients (16,66%), and more of one FAV, 12 patients (40%). We observed two bleeding cases, eight parcial trombosis, one total trombosis (non-function), six tunneled infection and two systemic infection. Only 3 catheters were removal. We obteined good dialysis parameters. Confort state for patients and nurses were satisfactory. Death 12 patients. Catheter function at the moment of study 16,76 +\/-12,99 months. We concluded that Tesio catheters can provide excellent long-term vascular access for hemodialysis patients, especially in the older people and with some previous failure fistulas, with low complication rates and acceptable dialysis parameters and tolerance. However, the arteriovenous fistula remains the gold standard for long-term hemodialysis access. ","2644":"The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and risk factors for non-traumatic lower extremity amputation (LEA) in patients on haemodialysis (HD). We investigated our HD population attending our clinic between Jan 1988 and Dec 2002, who had had LEA. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to determine association of LEA with demographic characteristics such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, myocardial infarction, stroke, dyslipidaemia, haematocrit, urea, creatinine, calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and albumin levels. Of 516 patients, 20 (3.9%) underwent 32 amputations; 21 major and 11 minor. The incidence was 1. I amputees\/100 p-years. There were 11 (10.8%) diabetics and 9 (2.2%) non-diabetics; incidence of 4.2 and 0.6 amputees\/100 p-years, respectively. Non-diabetic amputees were older than non-amputees: 68.9 vs 58.2 years (p = 0.013) and had been on HD longer: 71.4 +\/- 44 vs 42 +\/- 37 months (p = 0.019). There were 60% deaths within the first year of amputation and the causes were 60% cardiovascular. Univariate analysis indicated significant association of LEA with ageing, diabetes, smoking, myocardial infarction, stroke, high cholesterol, and low PTH levels. Multivariate Cox regression identified independent associations of amputation with diabetes, previous myocardial infarction and stroke and\/or transient ischaemic attack. The incidence of LEA in HD patients is very high and is associated with diabetes and previous cardiovascular events. Advanced age and longer time on HD are factors related to LEA in non-diabetics. With increasing numbers of diabetics and older people on HD, new strategies are needed for peripheral arterial disease management so as to avoid its progression to critical ischaemia. ","2645":"Fungal peritonitis is a rare cause of peritonitis, but it is associated to poorer prognosis and higher mortality than bacterial peritonitis. Until now, predisposing factors and treatment have not been well established. We retrospectively reviewed all the cases of fungal peritonitis diagnosed for ten years in 218 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. In all we detected 11 episodes of fungal peritonitis in 11 patients, that means the 4% of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis peritonitis. All the cases of fungal peritonitis were caused by Candida species. As a result of fungal peritonitis 36% of the patients died, 55% had to change to long-term hemodialysis because of failure in peritoneal dialysis technique. Only one case (9%) managed to continue peritoneal dialysis. The factors associated with the development of fungal peritonitis were: the presence of antibiotic use within 1 month before fungal peritonitis, patient older than 70 years old, low levels in albumine plasmatic and long permanence in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The treatment consisted in intraperitoneal fluconazol combined with oral 5-flucytosine for 4 to 6 weeks. In the two last cases we associated intravenous caspofungine too. Given that no improvement was seen within 72 hours of treatment, the catheter must be removed in all the cases.","2646":"Mesangial IgA glomerulonephritis (MIgAGn) is the most common biopsied primary glomerulonephritis worldwide, with a poor long-term prognosis for renal function in over a third of all patients. No proven therapy currently exists for MIgAGn. Recent studies have suggested some benefit with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), especially in hypertensive patients with kidney failure and proteinuria, though other studies have failed to corroborate these findings. We report eight adult patients with biopsy proven MIgAGn followed in a single hospital. They all received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Compassionate use of MMF was based on the presence of clinical and analytical data suggesting a high risk of short- to medium-term progression to chronic renal failure. MMF treatment was stopped after two and three months in two patients who had advanced renal failure at the start of therapy because of disease progression and greater fluid retention. Several months later they both required dialysis and kidney transplantation. The mean duration of MMF therapy in the other six patients was 15 (range: 10-18) months. The mean serum creatinine concentration fell from 1.82 +\/- 0.47 to 1.55 +\/- 0.41 mg\/dl (p = 0.04). Protein loss in 24-hour urine collection fell from 1.95 +\/- 1.35 to 0.77 +\/- 0.58 g\/day (p = 0.02). These results in this low number of patients showed that treatment with MMF in high-riks patients with MIgAGn and early stage kidney failure generally stabilized the disease and reduced proteinuria. MMF was well tolerated and may be of some benefit in a subgroup of patients with MIgAGn and a poor prognosis.","2647":"Genetic variability could contribute to the response to pharmacological treatment in patients with nephropathy. In albuminuric diabetic patients the renoprotective effect of angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition should be lower among homozygotes for the deletion allele (DD) compared to II-homozygotes. A total of 71 non-diabetic chronic nephropathy patients were treated with losartan (n = 37) or amlodipine (n = 34). Blood pressure and proteinuria were determined before and after the treatment, and changes in the mean values were statistically compared. Patients were genotyped for the ACE-I\/D, angiotensin I receptor type 1 (AGTR1)-1166 A\/C, and angiotensinogen (AGT)-M235T polymorphims, and the reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria between the different genotypes were compared. The reduction in systolic or diastolic blood pressure was not found to be different between the ACE-I\/D or AGT-M\/T genotypes in patients treated with losartan or amlodipine. In patients treated with losartan, we found a significantly higher reduction of diastolic blood pressure in AGTR1-AA patients compared to AC patients (p = 0,0024). We did not find differences in proteinuria-reduction between the different genotypes in patients treated with losartan or amlodipine. Our data show that the effects of losartan and amlodipine on the absolute mean reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria in non-diabetic nephropathy patients are similar between the different ACE or AGT genotypes. Although based on a small number of patients, the AGTR1-AA genotype was associated with a significantly higher reduction in diastolic blood pressure among losartan-treated patients. Additional studies are necessary to refute or confirm this association.

We present three patients with chronic renal failure (two with diabetic nephropaty and the third with mesangiocapilar glomerulonephritis and hepatic cirrosis), seric creatinine 3-4,5 mg\/dl, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding due to diffuse angiodysplasia and vascular ecstasies, diagnosed by oral endoscopy, colonoscopy and video capsule. They all were treated with octreotide, administered subcutanesly 0.1 mg twice a day for six months, with significantly decreased blood requirements in all of them, as well as the occurrence of bleeding episodes. It was well tolerated and none side-effects occurred in any subject. In our experience, octreotide is an effective and safe drug in bleeding angiodysplasia and ecstasies vascular of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with chronic renal failure, and it may be a good option especially in patients who are not candidates for surgery or endoscopic treatment due to inaccessible sites, spread of the lesion, old age and\/or concomitant disorders.","2659":"The most frequent causes of glomerular diseases whose main clinical syndrome are nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure may have several causes: acute tubular necrosis, thrombosis of renal veins, acute tubulointerstitial nephritis.

We describe a young woman without systemic disease with nephrotic syndrome and acute renal failure secondary to membranous nephropathy and superimposed crescentic glomerulonephritis. She received steroids and cyclophosphamide with stabilization of renal function after two months of follow-up.","2660":"We report a 56-year-old man with history of chronic renal failure, who was diagnosed to have Fabry's disease after performing a percutaneous kidney biopsy. The diagnosis was confirmed by the deficient level of activity of alpha-galactosidase A and by the identification of the mutation. A enzime replacement therapy with alpha-galactosidase A was administered. After 18 months of treatment, a second kidney biopsy was performed showing renal deposits of globotriaosylceramide (we did not evaluate the percentage of histologic clearance of the deposits). Six months after the end of the therapy, a reduction in the impairment of renal function is observed, and the classic manifestations of the disease are absent.","2661":"The prognosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) improves after simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. In order to evaluate the changes in cardio-vascular risk (CVR) factors after SKP, we studied nine recipients before and 6 months after SPK. There were five females and four males, with a mean age of 37 +\/- 8 years, duration of diabetes of 24 +\/- 5 years, three of them before starting dialysis, and six on dialysis (hemodialysis = 5; peritoneal dialysis = 1). Before SPK, all patients received anti-hypertensive therapy (1-4 drugs; mean 2.2 +\/- 0.9) and eight received statins. At 6 months after SPK, all patients were under triple immunosuppressive therapy (steroids + tacrolimus + MMF) without statins. They had normal renal function (Plasma Creatinine = 1.2 +\/- 0.3 mg\/dl) and pancreatic endocrine function (glycemia = 80 +\/- 8 mg\/dl). HbA1c decreased significantly (8.4 +\/- 1.2 vs 4.7 +\/- 0.6%; p &lt; 0.007) with a value &gt; 7% in seven patients before SPK and in none 6 months after SKP transplantation (p &lt; 0.001).

It is not always possible. Surgeon availability and demographic characteristics of patients (age, diabetes, vascular disease...) are factors that determine primary vascular access. To analyse outcome and vascular access complications in elderly who start hemodialysis without vascular access. All patients older than 75 years who initiated hemodialysis without vascular access between January 2000 and June 2002 were included, They were divided en two groups depending on primary vascular access. GI: arterio-venous fistulae. GIIl: Tunnelled cuffed catheter. Epidemiological and analytical data, vascular access complications related, as well as patient and first permanent vascular access survival from their inclusion in dialysis up to December 2002 were analysed and compared in both groups. 32 patients were studied. GI: n = 17 (4 men) and GIIl: n =1 5 (8 men), age: 79.9 +\/- 3.8 and 81.7 +\/- 4 years respectively (ns). There were no differences in sex and comorbidity (diabetes, ischemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and hypertension). It took GI 3 months to get a permanent vascular access suitable for using, while it took GIIl 1.3 months (p &lt; 0.005) The number of temporary untunnelled catheters was higher in GI (3.35 vs 1.87 p &lt; 0.05). Vascular access complications: 70.6% of infections occur in GI (incidence (I) = 48 infections\/100 patients-year) while only 29.4% were detected in GII (I = 25 infections\/100 patients-year). 70% of central venous thrombosis happen in GI (I: 25 CVT\/100 patients-year) vs 30% in GIIl (I = 14.4\/100 patients-year) (ns). No significant differences neither in bleeding (66.7% vs 33.3%) nor ischemia (75% vs 25%) were found. Dialysis dose (Kt\/V) as well as anaemia degree were similar in both groups. Permanent vascular access survival after 2 years was 45.8% in GI and 24% in GII (ns). Patient survival was similar in GI and GII (72% vs 51% ns). Elderly who start hemodialysis without vascular access took longer to get a suitable permanent vascular access when arterio-venous fistulae is placed than with a tunnelled cuffed hemodialysis catheter. As a consequence, vascular access complications are larger, infection ones are the most common. In these patients a tunnelled catheter should be inserted at the time a peripheral arterio-venous access is created, in order to avoid temporary untunnelled catheters. ","2663":"Cardiovacular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. However, there are no reliable data neither on the prevalence of cardiovacular disease nor its risk factors in Spain. The Morbidity and mortality Anemia Renal study (MAR) is a two-year multicenter, open-label, prospective cohorts study. Its main objective is to assess the general morbidity and mortality, particularly of a cardiovascular cause, and its relationship with the degree of anemia. Secondary objectives are: a\/ the description of current clinical practices in anemia, dialysis, vascular access, and CV risk factor management; and b\/ the description of hospitalization and mortality causes. This paper describes the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors of the HD population in Spain. A total of 1.710 patients were included (60% male, aged 64.4 years, 16.2 months on HD). The mean co-morbidity Charlson index was 6.5 +\/- 2.3. Cardiovascular disease was the most prevalent comorbidity, 16.7% had a coronary disease, and 13.9% had different degrees of heart failure, while 11.6% had arrhythmia, 1.7% stroke and 5.5% peripheral artery disease. The prevalence of hypertension was 75.8%, 74.4% of patients received antihypertensive drugs, and still 40% of patients had an inadequate blood pressure control. The investigators considered as dyslipidemic 34.1% of patients, and prescribed treatment to 69.5% of them, while the remaining 30.5% (10.4% of the total) had hyperlipidemia with no drug therapy. Eleven percent was active smoker, and 26.6% former smoker. There was 47.4% of patients with a corporal mass index above 25. Secondary hyperparathyroidism with PTH above of 300 pg\/ml was present in 22.2% of patients. Despite the EBPG and K-DOQI recommendations, only 68.8% of prevalent hemodialysis patients attained a hemoglobin (Hb) above 11 g\/dl, 89.4% ferritin levels above 100 ng\/ml, 66.5 degrees\/a a transferrin saturation index (TSI) above 20%, and 61.1% met all three objectives. In summary, this first cross-sectional analysis has allowed us to know in detail the standard practice in multiple aspects of management of HD population in Spain. It has also established clear differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease and risk factors from the US registries. Last but not least we have identified therapeutic opportunities to improve the course and prognosis of our patients.","2664":"High levels of homocysteine (tHcy) are frecuent in MHD patients, and recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Vitamin supplements have been shown to lower serum Hcys, although optimal dose and efficacy is not well defined. Moreover, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism can modulate its prevalence and response to treatment. To evaluate efficacy and safety of two vitamin supplement regimens on Hcys serum levels over a 12 month period. We conducted a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial in 60 stable MHD patients (68 +\/- 13 years, 48% male, 50% diabetics). Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment regimens: 1) daily renal multivitamin containing folate (FA), vitamin B6 and B12 (5 mg, 10 mg and 0.4 mg respectively) (N = 27); and 2) supraphysiological daily doses (15 mg, 100 mg and 1 mg) (N = 33). These regimens were continued throughout the study period. Hcys levels were compared with a control group from the general population (N = 276) matched for age and gender. demographic and clinical data, serum levels of Hcys, FA, B6, B12 at baseline and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of treatment; MTHFR gene polymorphism (PCRRT). At baseline, global prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia (tHcy &gt; or = 15 micromol\/L) was 100% in patients and 22% en controls. Hcys levels were significantly higher in patients versus controls (32.4 +\/- 8.9 vs 12.9 +\/- 6.8; P &lt; 0.0001). Both regimens were equally effective in reducing Hcys levels. As a whole, Hcys levels were reduced by 23.6% (P &lt; 0.001) after one month of treatment. The highest reduction was observed at the sixth month (28.3%, 32.4 +\/- 8.9 vs 22.7 +\/- 6.4, P &lt; 0.001) and remained stable thereafter. However, only 12% of patients normalised their plasma levels after 12 months of therapy. The effect of treatment was not influenced by age, gender, diabetes, body weight or time on MHD. Reduction rate of tHcy levels was related to baseline tHcy level (r = 0.500, P &lt; 0.001) and baseline FA levels (r = -0.332, P = 0.009). The MTHFR polimorfism did not significantly modified the effect of the treatment. No side effects were associated with either regimen. Hyperhomocysteinemia is common in patients with conventional HD schedules and this is not related to vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin supplements significantly reduce Hcys levels in a sustained but suboptimal way. Supraphysiological doses did not improve the results. Further studies are requiered to demonstrate that this effect is associated with an improval in morbidity and mortality. ","2665":null,"2666":"Patients in chronic dialysis show a decrease in total bone mass. The factors that determine this decrease are not well known. In normal populations weight and its compartments are important determinants of bone mass. We studied total bone mineral content (TBMC), a measure of bone mass, and body composition using DEXA densitometry in 65 patients (45 females and 20 males) who had been in peritoneal dialysis for a mean of 40.3 +\/- 23.2 months. Forty-eight patients (73.8%) had been previously in hemodialysis. The mean total time in dialysis for these patients was 76.8 months. As a group patients showed a very significant positive correlation between TBMC and weight, height, and lean body mass. A negative correlation was found between TBMC with the time in dialysis and iPTH. In men we found significant simple positive correlations between TBMC and weight, height and lean body mass. In women we found simple positive correlations of TBMC with weight, height and lean body mass and a negative correlation with iPTH. In the multiple regression analysis, lean body mass was the only body composition parameter that had a significantly positive correlation with TBMC in men; in women only height correlated positively with TBMC and iPTH continued to correlate negatively with bone mass. When we considered pre and postmenopausal women separately, bone mass was correlated positively with height and lean body mass and negatively with iPTH in postmenopausal women and only with height in pre-menopausal females. We conclude that the lean body mass compartment. is the most important component of weight that determines TBMC in peritoneal dialysis patients particularly in males and postmenopausal women. In postmenopausal women, secondary hyperparathyroidism seems to be particularly detrimental on bone mass.","2667":"Ischemic nephropathy is recognized as a distinct cause of renal insufficiency and it is defined as a significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate in patients with hemodynamically significant renovascular occlusive disease. We argue the epidemiologic and clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic renovascular disease, and we evaluate the pronostic agents. Published studies of the outcome of revascularization for renal-artery stenosis have been excellent, offering a durable patency and functional improvement but they have had numerous limitations. The atherosclerosis is a systemic disease and it provides the general prognosis of patients. We conclude that ischemic renal disease is a nephropathy of smoker men, with proteinuria excretion similar to nephropathy with unilateral stenosis. The age of patients is the clinical feature that decide the treatment: surgery, angioplasty\/stent or medical management. Comparative analysis of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and operation for renal revascularization and medically treated patients have proved that the advanced chronic renal insufficiency is associated with an unfavourable response of treatment of the ischemic nephropathy. But, in this nephropathy the revascularization can be the better therapy for selected patients. The revascularization with angioplasty\/stent for patients with unilateral renal stenosis and chronic renal insufficiency has a doubtful effectiveness, as the chronic renal failure is result of nephroangiosclerosis.","2668":"Nowadays, glomerulonephritis is one of the most common causes of End-stage Renal Disease and starting point of dialysis in Spain. Several factors may influence negatively in this prognosis; among them, we may show up the systemic arterial hypertension. Though its prevalence in the glomerulonephritis is considered higher than in other nephropathies, with variations among series, probably due to difference in ages, in geographical areas, in histological types, in time on evolution of the nephritis ... and because it is difficult to distinguish if the hypertension is a consequence of the nephritis or a consequence of the renal failure that can be present in several cases. In the same way, its negative influence in the renal prognosis may be influenced more by this renal failure, which can be its cause when it is quite severe, than by the hypertension itself. Our aims were to analyse, on the one hand the prevalence of hypertension in the 394 patients diagnosed of primary glomerulonephritis by means of a renal biopsy during two decades in the Bay of Cadiz, as well as its influence in the renal prognosis since the moment of the diagnosis, even with the absence of severe renal failure. We gathered demographic, clinical, analytical and histological data, as well as the situation of the renal function and the survival period of it at the end of each patient study. For the analysis prognosis and renal survival, Kaplan-Meier curves and the long-rank test were used. Of the 394 patients, 247 are men and 147 are women, with an average age of 36.7 +\/- 17.7 years old. The global prevalence of hypertension was 39%, with a higher frequency in older patients. The gathered rate of renal survival for hypertensive patients was 54%, 28%, 20% and 4% at 5, 10, 15 and 20 years respectively; while for non-hypertensive patients, it was 83%, 75%, 66% and 62% for the same periods of time (p &lt; 0.001). This worse tendency for hypertensive patients is observed too in each particular histological type, especially in the IgA nephropathy and membranous nephropathy. These results were the same for the patients who did not have severe renal failure in the moment of the biopsy. Hypertension is a common fact in the primary glomerulonephritis, which also conditions, in an important way, the renal prognosis itself in a long term, from the moment of diagnosis and even before the existence of a significant renal failure. ","2669":"","2670":"","2671":"","2672":"","2673":"","2674":"Cardiovascular disease, including atherothrombosis, is the most frequent cause of mortality in the Western World. In the last years, major advances have been made in the pathogenesis of this disease. Currently, the drugs most widely used are the inhibitors of the HMG-CoA reductase (statins) and the antihypertensive drugs, mainly angiotensin II blockers. The first group has been shown to be effective on cardiovascular disease due to atherothrombosis, and the second group on hypertensive disease. Nevertheless, recent data suggest that these two situations can improve with the concomitant use of both drugs.","2675":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is a frequent complication of dialysis patients. In this second article we will analyze the new vitamin D analogs, capable of decreasing parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels with a lower effect on intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption. Among other advantages described in the experimental setting, paricalcitol shows a survival benefit in dialysis patients as compared to calcitriol, at least in retrospective studies, and thus it became our first-line vitamin D derivative. Calcimimetics are unique since they decrease PTH levels without increasing serum calcium and phosphorus. Actually, calcium and phosphorus decrease in a significant number of patients. These drugs will soon be authorized in Spain, and we describe the better achievement of K\/DOQI guidelines as well as other beneficial effects observed in the experimental animal with them. Finally, we mention the potential benefit of mild metabolic acidosis, the use of bisphosphonates, the role of bone morphogenetic protein BMP-7, and the use of teriparatide. The future treatment of SHP will probably require the independent management of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin D and PTH. Thus, low-dose combined treatments with selective drugs may prove more effective than sequential therapies.","2676":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHP) is still an early and frequent complication of chronic renal disease (CRD). Currently, CRD is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, and calcium-phosphorus metabolism is one of the modifiable related factors. In this first article, we summarize the recent SHP treatment paradigm shift in dialysis patients, derived from the better knowledge and understanding of vascular calcification. We analyze the most recent guidelines (K\/DOQI), and describe the general implications of hyperphosphatemia, as well as our therapeutic approach with phosphorus-binders. Since sevelamer additionally presents some pleiotropic effects and it attenuates the progression of vascular calcification, we consider it in the first-line of treatment despite it is not yet demonstrated a survival benefit. We also minimize the use of elemental calcium to a maximum of 1000 to 1500 mg\/day. Lanthanum carbonate may well be an important therapeutic agent in the near future, especially if security concerns related to metal accumulation are overcome. Ferric citrate, colestilan and nicotinamide may soon play a role. All these drugs, isolated or in combination, are important in the treatment of SHP since a great deal of its success and the avoidance of some dialysis-related complications depend on an efficient phosphorus control.","2677":"The nephrology community has progressively recognized that vascular calcification in patients with chronic renal failure is a major problem in terms of morbidity and mortality. This type of soft tissue calcification is not only passive, as thought previously, but implies active processes as well. It results from disturbances of the normal balance between calcification inhibitors and promoters, acting both at the systemic and the local level, and from the phenotypic change of smooth muscle cells towards osteoblast-like calcifying cells in the vessel wall. The recognition of the main factors involved will allow in the future a more appropriate prophylactic and therapeutic approach of this clinically important complication of chronic renal failure.","2678":"Epidemiological and clinical studies have shown that cardiovascular disease in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is frequently related to damage of large conduit arteries. Arterial disease is responsible for the high incidence of ischemic heart disease, peripheral artery diseases, left ventricular hypertrophy and congestive heart failure. The vascular complications in ESRD are due to two different but associated mechanisms, namely atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis. Whereas the former principally affects the conduit function with ischemic lesions being the most characteristic consequence, the latter primarily disturbs the cushioning function of large arteries. Arteriosclerosis in ESRD patients is characterized by diffuse dilation and hypertrophy of large conduit arteries and stiffening of arterial walls, and represents a clinical form of an accelerated aging process. The main clinical characteristics of arterial stiffening are changes in blood pressure with isolated increase in systolic pressure and normal or lower diastolic pressure. The consequences of these alterations are: (i) an increased LV afterload with development of LV hypertrophy and increased myocardial oxygen demand, and (ii) altered coronary perfusion and subendocardial blood flow distribution. Epidemiological studies have identified arterial remodeling and stiffening as independent predictors of overall and cardiac mortality in ESRD patients.","2679":"The Spanish nephrology is one of the medical specialties that have experienced a greater development in the last years. Defined initially as an activity in the hospital and consolidated in this sense, at the present time the \"Libro Blanco of the Spanish Nephrology\" makes a call of attention on the necessity of a change of welfare direction. The attention was called on the little development of the prevention activities and the delay in the arrival of the patient to the Service of Nephrology, which causes a worsening of his pathology. In order to approach us this reality it is necessary to give priority to the attendance of the patient out of the hospital and to guarantee a logical continuity between welfare levels. The welfare initiatives that have been carried out in the Spanish territory are scarce and still insufficient. The progressive increase in the incidence and prevalence of the ERD associated with a bad evolution and elevated costs is converting ERD in an important problem of public health, that requires specific plans of detection and prevention. The improvement of the coordination between general practioners and nephrologists is necessary. Multiple papers show a delayed reference of the patients with renal disease to the nephrologists. The initiatives of coordination between both levels should be centered in studies epidemiologists that clarify the real meaning of the renal pathology and in educating the GP on the early reference to the nephrologist of the patients with renal failure.","2680":"IgA nephropathy (N) or Berger's disease is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and one of the first cause of end-stage renal failure. The disease is characterized by the accumulation in mesangial areas of complexes containing polymeric IgA1. The mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN is only now emerging. We discussed here three essential points: (i) the generation of abnormal IgA1 and formation of IgA1 complexes; (ii) the generation of mesangial injury mediated by interaction of IgA1 complexes with mesangial IgA1 receptors, and (iii) the progression of IgA-mediated mesangial injury towards renal failure. In summary, our data reveal that quantitative and structural changes of IgA1 play a key role on the onset of the disease due to functional abnormalities of two IgA receptors: the Fc alphaRI (CD89) expressed by blood myeloid cells and the transferrin receptor (CD71) on mesangial cells. Abnormal IgA induces release of soluble CD89 soluble leading to the formation of circulating IgA complexes, which in turn may be trapped by CD71 that is overexpressed on mesangial cells in IgAN patients allowing formation of IgA1 deposits. The elucidation of IgA-receptor interactions may open new avenues for drug design and treatment of IgAN.","2681":"The importance of the renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the development and progression of the diabetic nephropathy is confirmed with the recent demonstration that the development of nephropathy in the diabetic patients can be avoided by blockers of the RAS. For that reason, the promotion of preventive programs for the detection of microalbuminuria, from the early phases of the diabetes is needed. Control of blood pressure, of glucose and lipids are needed. If microalbuminuria is present, the administration of a blocker of RAS, even in the presence of normal blood pressure can prevent the progression to diabetic nephropathy. The main objective to prevent the development and progression of nephropathy in the diabetic patients, as well as the cardiovascular risk, is a strict control of the PA.","2682":"Living donors represent 30% of our kidneys for renal transplantation. Laparoscopic nephrectomy is the best surgical procedure to obtain them due to its clear advantages such as low morbidity, less blood supply and donor time in hospital. From March 2002 to August 2004 we performed 50 laparoscopic nephrectomies for renal transplantation. Kidneys were transplanted to recipients receiving tacrolimus 0.1 mg\/kg\/bid, mycophenolate mofetil 1 g\/bid and prednisone 0.5-1 mg\/kg\/day p.o 48 hours before transplantation. Mean time for surgery was 170 minutes (120-260), warm ischaemia time 3.1 minutes (1.5-10) and cold ischaemia time 1.27 hours (0.85-4). Mean bleeding was 270 cc (100-900) and donor time in hospital 5.5 days (3-9). Four cases required conversion of the laparoscopic procedure to open surgery because of bleeding. 72 hours post-transplant mean plasmatic creatinine was 170 micromol\/l. None of the patients suffered delayed graft function. 18% presented acute rejection. Survival of donor and recipient was 100% at 1 year and graft survival was 94% at 1 year (kidney losses were due to acute rejection, severe acute pancreatitis and surgical problem).","2683":"Living renal donors are an important source of transplanted kidneys due to the number of patients on waiting list is progressively increasing. On the other side, they allow the pre-emptive kidney transplantation. With the aim of reducing donor obstacles such as pain, hospital stay or cosmetic results and in creasing the number of living donors, in 1995 Ratner performed the first laparoscopic nephrectomy (LLDN). By now, LLDN is a routine procedure in more than 200 centres worldwide. Literature databases are searched. We have reviewed the data from our experience after performing 50 laparoscopic nephrectomies. Preoperative living donor assessment and contraindications to LLDN do not differ from the open approach. Results are very influenced by the surgeon's situation in the learnig curve. Operating times use to be longer in laparoscopic procedures. The overall complication rate and mortality of LLDN are the same for both of the approaches. Conversion to open-donor nephrectomy has been reported in 0-13% of cases (8% in our data). Postoperative pain and donor estimated blood loss are lower for LLDN, as well as the convalescence period. To avoid the possible negative effects of the laparoscopic technique on kidney graft function a lot of method's variations have been proposed for gaining access and harvesting the kidney, including the hand-assistance techniques, with the aim of minimizing operative time, pneumoperitoneus negative effect on graft function and warm ischemia time (WIT). The higher WIT is not related to delayed graft function or acute rejections when it is less than ten minutes. Delayed graft function does not differ in both approaches and creatinine values from the first month until the third year after transplantation show no differences in randomized studies. The laparoscopic approach to harvest the allograft from the living donor is a save and effective technique and has the advantage of being less invasive and allowing the donor a shorter convalescence. It has no negative effects on allograft function in the short term follow-up. Further studies are required to evaluate long term donor complications and allograft function and survival. ","2684":"Spain is the leader country in cadaver kidney transplantation. However the percentage of those transplants coming from living donors represents only a 2% of the total activity. To analyze the cause of this situation the Spanish Society of Nephrology and the National Transplant Organization carried out an opinion pole between patients and health professionals including nephrologists, surgeons\/urologists and nurses implicated in kidney transplantation. 60% out the patients consider that the time into the waiting list is to long and 59% don't have any information about living donor kidney transplantation. All the health professionals believe that living donor share better results than get cadaver donors and that the number of the procedure are not enough. Considering that scarcely motivation of professionals and the family of the patients are the main cause. Parents, brothers and sister were considered the best match between donor and recipients and non genetically\/emotionally-related donors were accepted by only 2.5%. A 55.7% out of the health professionals considered that the nephrologists are the people that must inform the patients and family about living kidney donation.","2685":"The goal of the donor evaluation is to ensure the suitability, safety and well being of the donor. In order to avoid important omissions, the evaluation of potential living kidney donors should be carried according to a protocol that includes a logical sequence of complementary explorations. Old age alone is not an absolute contraindication to donation but the evaluation should be more rigorous, because increased age may be associated with more post-operative complications after nephrectomy and renal function and long term graft survival could be shorter than the ones obtained from younger living donors. A body mass index of more than 35 kg\/m2 should be an absolute contraindication to renal donation. Between 30 and 35 kg\/m2 the donor evaluation should be more rigorous and it should be recommended to lose weight before nephrectomy. Hypertension is one of the most common reasons to declare a potential kidney donor unsuitable. Evidence of organ damage is an absolute contraindication to kidney donation. The donation is only reasonable when hypertension is well controlled with less than two drugs. To excluded diabetes mellitus all donors should have a fasting plasma glucose measurement. Diabetes mellitus is an absolute contraindication to living donation such as an impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Another contraindication to living donation is malignant disease, and the same standards should be adopted for cadaveric donors. The exceptions are low-grade non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix. The presence of active infection usually precludes donation. It is very important to perform a routine test for viral infections. HIV, hepatitis B and C infection of the donor are usually a contraindication to living donor. CMV donor and recipient status should be taken into account before transplantation, and the recipients at risk for CMV disease should recieve prophylactic treatment according to the transplant unit policy.","2686":"Frequently underestimated, the deterioration of the renal function characteristic of the aging has very prominent clinical consequences. In the present article some aspects of the cellular and molecular biology of this process are analysed. The critical role of the oxidative stress and of TGFbeta are underlined. Determinant genetic factors are also mentioned. Such a knowledge can contribute to develop therapeutical strategies to prevent the decline of the.renal function that happens with the aging.","2687":"Living donor kidney transplantation is uncommon in our country, mostly due to the high rate of cadaveric donation. However, such a rate has been held back in recent years and it is thought that there will be great problems in organ shortage in the next years, especially for young patients. Thus, living donation seems to be an alternative. Such a practice is particularly useful in hypersensitized patients with positive crossmatch and in ABO incompatibility. In these two cases, the waiting time for kidney transplantation goes on for many years. With the development of desensitizing protocols that employ high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins and\/or plasmapheresis, together with the use of more sensitive and objective assays for immunological monitoring, patients that were not candidates for kidney transplantation in the past are now being transplanted. In the present work, immunological factors that participate in living kidney transplantation are revised, with special focus on hypersensitized patients. Available data show that living donation is a feasible alternative for future, once all the ethical problems have been solved.","2688":"Adequate dialysis is defined as the quantity and the quality of the dialysis that is necessary for the patient to remain in good state, with no uremic symptoms, obtaining a longer survival with the best possible corrections of his uremia-related metabolic and systemic changes, and with the minimum possible morbidity in addition to a good quality of life. The good operation of a peritoneal dialysis schedule calls for a set of criteria and standards, as well as management clinical protocols according to which the healthcare team manages the dialysis technique and its complications, and uniforms the steps to be taken. Such protocols should be agreed to by the whole of team that enforces them, and should be submitted to a continuous update process based on the team's own experiences and also on the scientific literature. The results are periodically evaluated. Useful quality standards of clinical management, based on scientific evidence and on the opinions of expert nephrologists are needed with the aim to go in depth into specific aspects of the daily clinical action, by means of a rigorous and regular systematic review process that reflects all new advancements and technologies. The U.S. National Kidney Foundation (NKF) published in 1997 the Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) which were the first action guidelines, with the aim to improve dialysis' quality and results. The objective of the clinical guidelines is to act as an updating method and to unify criteria by contributing scientific evidence.","2689":"Recent evidence has shown that the COL4A3, COL4A4 and COL4A5 genes are involved in different renal manifestations. Mutations in these collagen type IV genes affect the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) giving rise to a nephropathy whose symptoms range from isolated hematuria to severe renal failure. This disorder has been traditionally considered to be different entities: Autosomal Dominant Alport syndrome, Familial Benign Hematuria, Autosomal Recessive Alport Syndrome carriers. But the increased knowledge of the molecular basis of this clinical diversity prompted us to agglutinate these entities under the name of \"collagen type IV nephropathy\". This fact has relevant implications in diagnosis, prognosis and management.","2690":"The identification of the underlying gene defect in some cases of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) has recently led to a critical breakthrough in the understanding of the pathogenesis of nephrotic syndromes. The more severe form of hereditary nephrotic syndromes is the congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). The causative gene, NPHS1, encodes a novel protein, nephrin which is a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily specifically expressed in the podocyte at the slit diaphragm. Using a positional cloning approach, our group identified a gene, NPHS2, involved in a specific entity of familial SRNS characterized by early onset, complete steroid-resistance, rapid progression to ESRD and no recurrence after renal transplantation. NPHS2 encodes a novel membrane protein named podocin localized at the cytoplasmic part of the slit diaphragm. Familial autosomal dominant cases of primary FSGS have been described in adulthood. Two corresponding genes have been mapped to date, one to 19q13 and the second to 11q21-22. The former has been identified as ACTN4, the gene encoding the actin-binding protein, a-actinin 4. Other genes involved in the slit-diaphragm or the nephrotic syndrome are CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), FAT1, WT1, LMX1B, SMARCAL1. Altogether, these data demonstrate the pivotal role of the podocyte in the development and the maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier and the crucial role of the genetic factors in the development of SRNS.","2691":"Long dialysis (3 x 8 hours\/week) has been used in Tassin for three decades now, without method modifications. Results have been excellent considering both morbidity and mortality. Best survival compared to short dialysis is mainly due to low cardiovascular mortality. It is probably due to a good control of arterial hypertension, without antihypertensive medication, and the low rate of intradialytic hypotension. Slow ultrafiltration, allowed by the extended dialysis session, associated with a low-salt diet and a moderate interdialysis weight gain, tend to normalize extracellular volume and ensure normotension. Long hemodialysis assure a good dialysis dose in terms of small and even middle molecules, with good nutrition, anemia correction, phosphate and potassium control with few drugs. Optimal dialysis needs several conditions, each of them necessary. Time seems a central factor, providing a high treatment safety margin. While it is quite difficult to achieve excellent dialysis results with short sessions, long-dialysis is easy to perform with high reliability.","2692":"An accumulation of uremic toxins occurs in renal failure, interfering with different biological functions. Low-flux hemodialysis only clears solutes with a molecular weight lower than 5000 Da. High-flux hemodialysis improves this clearance, being limited from 15,000 Da up. Hemodiafiltration techniques, mid-dilutional, post-dilutional or both, with high reinfusion volumes, are the most efficacious cleaning either large, middle or small uremic toxins. Protein-bound small-size mole cules are not properly removed by any technique. Research in technology and new therapeutic schemes are still needed in order to achieve more physiological depuration methods with better future results.","2693":"Conventional hemodialysis, three sessions per week through a low-flux membrane, is the dialysis method most widely used. However, its efficacy is limited. The concept of dialysis adequacy exclusively based on the concept of Kt\/V is too restrictive. Other solutes such as middle molecules should also be considered. Parameters such as phosphate and hypertension are very difficult to control with the conventional schedules. Observational studies demonstrate both a high morbidity and mortality. It is necessary a qualitative leap forward from the current concept of \"adequate dialysis\" to a more modern of \"optimal dialysis\". Different strategies than those shown in recent prospective studies are needed to achieve that goal.","2694":"Acute renal failure (ARF) is an abrupt decline of renal function, and acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is its more frequent expression. Recent contributions in physiopathological knowledge, specially in post-ischemic ARF, are scarcelly reflected in therapy. Morbidity and mortality due to ARF are very high, mainly in critically ill patients. Prevention and treatment of ATN are based in avoiding nephrotoxicity and renal ischemia. An adequate evaluation of renal risk factors in hospitalized patients is important. Maintaining euvolemia, effective cardiac output and adequate renal perfussion pressure are three paramount factors in ischemia prevention. The best dialytic schedule is not universally accepted. ARF replacement therapy must be flexible, tailoring techniques (IHD, SLED, CRRT) to the clinical situation of patients. There is not a consensus in dialysis dose in ARF. Nevertheless, despite a robust scientific evidence is lacking, some data suggest that a delivered minimum dose of sKtV &gt;1 in IHD or &gt;35 ml\/kg\/h in CRRT would be beneficial for patient survival.","2695":"","2696":"","2697":"","2698":"","2699":"","2700":"Symptomatic cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection usually affects immunocompromised patients, such as transplant recipients. From that point of view, the patient with endstage renal disease under maintenance dialysis is considered as immunocompetent. Thus, opportunistic infections, such as CMV infection, is not systematicaly searched in these patients, despite that an impaired cellular immunity has been reported in dialysis patients. We report a case of CMV esophagitis, clinically symptomatic, in a patient endstage renal disease under peritoneal dialysis, without other known immunosuppressive factors and with a good clinical response to gancyclovir treatment.","2701":"We present a patient from Germany with Hantavirus infection, admitted in the Emergency room of our hospital, with fever, thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, oliguria, mild proteinuria and hematuria. Percutaneous renal biopsy revealed an acute interstitial nephritis without medulla haemorrhages. The virus infection confirmation was made by detection of IgM against Hantavirus Puumala. This infection should be considered in patients with thrombocytopenia, fever and acute renal failure, over all if they are from North and Central Europe.","2702":"Acute and chronic renal failure secondary to bilateral severe hydroureteronephrosis is a rare sequela of uterine prolapse. We report a case of neglected complete uterine prolapse in a 72-year-old patient resulting in bilateral hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and chronic renal failure. In an attempt to diminish the ureteral obstruction a vaginal pessary was used to reduce the uterine prolapse. Finally, surgical repair of prolapse by means of a vaginal hysterectomy was performed. In conclusion, all patients presenting with complete uterine prolapse should be screened to exclude urinary tract obstruction. If present, obstructive uropathy should be relieved by the reduction or repair of the prolapse before irreversible renal damage occurs.","2703":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is associated with the development of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD). However, the clinical relevance and criteria for EBV serological reactivation in EBV-seropositive transplant recipients is unclear. EBV-specific antibodies: viral capsid immunoglobulm G [IgG (VCA)], nuclear antigen (EBNA) IgG, immunoglobulin M [IgM (VCA)] and early antigen IgG (EA) were prospectively analyzed in 71 adult kidney transplant recipients, before starting immunosuppression, when they were uraemic, and after transplantation. A total of 351 serum samples were tested. Relevance of different EBV reactivation-related variables were analyzed using the chi-square test. In 37 of 71 (52.1%) patients IgM (VCA) or IgG (EA) were detected when they were uraemic. EBV reactivation occurred in 25 of 71 (35.2%) patients, with clinical symptoms (fever, leukopenia, kidney function impairment, and increase in transaminases) in nine cases. One of 71 patients developed a PTLD, without detection of serologically EBV reactivation, but with an increase in EBV viral load. Absence of mycophenolate mofetil, that inhibits lymphocyte proliferation and antibody production, in immunosuppression was statistically significantly associated with EBV reactivation (p = 0.015). Serological diagnosis of EBV reactivation should be based on strict criteria (IgM (VCA) seroconversion, four-fold increase in IgM (VCA) or IgG (EA), or four-fold decrease in IgG (EBNA) titers and on analysis of serial samples. Some EBV-seropositive patients at high risk of developing PTLD could benefit from this diagnostic methodology.","2704":"The aim of the study was to analyze the lipid and lipoprotein oxidation profile in patients with end stage renal disease who started haemodialysis and also to evaluate the possible effect of haemodialysis and vitamin C supplementation on lipoprotein oxidation one year after the initiation of the therapy. Forty-one end stage renal disease patients who started haemodialysis between January 1999 and January 2000 were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomised to receive 1,000 mg\/day of vitamin C or placebo and then hemodialysis was initiated. We measured the lipid profile and the susceptibility of LDL and HDL to oxidation using cooper ions, at the moment of inclusion and one-year after the treatment. No significant differences were observed among the vitamin-C treated patients and those who received placebo. Our results show that haemodialysis by itself did not induce deletereous effects on the lipid profile, which was slightly improved. A small decrease in total cholesterol--183 to 164 mg\/dl (group A), 170 to 144 mg\/dl (group B); in LDL cholesterol (100 mg\/dl to 79 mg\/dl (group A), 88 mg\/dl to 73 mg\/dl (Group B); and in phospholipids [198 to 188 mg\/dl, group A (Group A), 195 mg\/dl to 178 mg\/dl (Group B)], was observed in all the patients one year after starting haemodialysis. When considering oxidation-derivative products, the lag phase of LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol was enlarged but without statistical significance. A tendency to increase the vitamin E generation in HDL and LDL lipoproteins was observed in vitamin-C treated patients, but the difference still remained not significant. Haemodialysis by itself could improve lipid profile in patients with a previous pro-oxidative state such as uraemia. Although our results have failed to demonstrate significant differences between vitamin C-treated and not treated patients, the tendency to decrease oxidation products by supplementation of vitamin C could mean a beneficial effect on oxidation parameters. In order to improve oxidative stress, the use of lipophylic more than hydrophilic vitamins could be evaluated in randomized studies with a more important number of patients. ","2705":"In 2002, it was contraindicated the use of epoetin alfa by a subcutaneous way to avoid the risk of the pure red cell aplasia in chronic renal failure patients. This forced to change the prescription in the way it was supplied, which was especially problematic in predialysis and peritoneal dialysis, as treating out-patients, that is why it was necessary to change to epoetina beta o darbepoetin, where this contraindication was not established, in order to continue using this way. The darbepoetin has an average lifetime longer than the epoetin. Its efficacy and security have been well studied, especially in pre-dialysis and haemodialysis, but little less in peritoneal dialysis. To evaluate our experience about the efficacy and security of darbepoetin alfa, by a subcutaneous way, in our programme of peritoneal dialysis, after the conversion of the patients previously treated with epoetin alfa. 35 patients. 7 analytical and clinical controls are evaluated, 2 before and 5 after the conversion, with an interval of 6 weeks. Statistics methods: means +\/- typical deviation, medians, distribution of frequencies, Wilcoxon test and Friedman test. The change into darbepoetin alfa has been successful in maintaining stable haemoglobin levels in patients in peritoneal dialysis, without meaningful changes in the mean levels of haemoglobin before and after the conversion. The percentage of patients with haemoglobin in the rank 11-13 g\/dl (85%) has been higher with the darbepoetin, probably due to the dose increment in the patients with previous levels of haemoglobin less than 11 g\/dl. The dosages might have been widely separated (7.5 +\/- 3 vs 9.2 +\/- 3.2 days). The darbepoetin has been well tolerated, without any important adverse effects. The conversion of epoetin alfa into darbepoetin alfa in peritoneal dialysis was simple, effective, secure and well tolerated. ","2706":"A cross sectional study was performed in order to evaluate the treatment conditions and medical outcomes among 131 prevalent hemodialysis patients (57% males; mean age 66 +\/- 12 years) in Huesca and Teruel. Data were collected at 5 hemodialysis units in Huesca and Teruel. Diabetes mellitus, at 30 percent, was the most common cause of renal insufficiency. The mean (+\/- SD) urea-reduction ratio (URR) was 66.0 +\/- 8.8%. We observed that 56.5% of the population reached an URR higher than 65%. The duration of dialysis session was 220 +\/- 24 minutes, with a rate of blood flow 297 +\/- 47 ml\/min. 36% of patients used high-flux membranes. The patterns of vascular access were: 69% arteriovenous fistula, 5% synthetic graft and 26% catheter. Eighty nine percent of patients were treated with erythropoietin. The mean dose of erythropoietin was 109 +\/- 62 UI\/Kg weight\/week. Thirty nine percent of patients had haemoglobin below 11.0 g\/dl (mean 11.2 +\/- 1.4 g\/dl).

This fact could be due to the presence of conventional risk factor and specific uremic as increase of oxidative stress, hyperhomocystaenemia, deranged calcium-phosphate metabolism and chronic inflammatory state. In order to analyze the vascular effects of CRF, we studied the histomorphometric characteristics (intima-media thickness and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) accumulation (inmunohistochemical) on radial artery from 13 patients with CRF. We determined by Western blot analysis, the vascular nitrotyrosin abundance (footprint of nitric oxide (NO) inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression. The NOS activity was, also, determined. The results were compared with those obtained in pudenda artery from a healthy control group (n: 16). The CRF group showed a significant increase in intima and media thickness 108 +\/- 16 vs 14 +\/- 2.5 microm, p &lt; 0.001 and 291 +\/- 19 vs 153 +\/- 15 microm, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The CRF group exhibited a marked elevation of MCP-1 vascular expression (2 +\/- 0.15 vs 0.6 +\/- 0.12 u, p &lt; 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between MCP-1 vascular expression and its inmunohistochemical deposits (r: 0.98, p &lt; 0.0001). Nitrotyrosin abundance (western blot) was significantly increased in artery of CRF patients (2.1 +\/- 0.1 vs 0.42 +\/- 0.1 u, p &lt; 0.0001). No significant differences was found in NOS activity between CRF and control groups. However, eNOS expression was greatly increased in the CRF patients (1.73 +\/- 0.1 vs 0.67 +\/- 0.1 u, p &lt; 0.001). A significant positive correlation was found between nitrotyrosin and eNOS expression and systolic arterial pressure. However, the differences between CRF and control groups persisted after statistically fitting to arterial pressure. The present study demonstrate that in CRF there are arterial preatherosclerotic changes and an increase of vascular nitrotyrosin accumulation, which is the footprint of NO inactivation by ROS. The secondary NO inactivation can, in turn, contribute to eNOS vascular upregulation.","2708":"To analyse the histological correspondence, the renal survival and the clinical prognostic factors in the nephrotic syndrome for more than 20 years in our environment as well as the influence of the nephrotic proteinuria in the renal survival in the different histological particular types of glomerulonephritis. Among the 542 primary and secondary glomerulonephritis diagnosed by kidney biopsy for two decades in the Cadiz Bay Area, we selected 242 patients whose clinical presentation and the biopsy indication was the nephrotic syndrome. Statistics methods: means +\/- typical deviation, percentiles, percentages, Kaplan-Meier curves, long-rank test, student's t-test, chi-square analysis and Cox proportional hazards model test. 242 patients with nephrotic syndrome (44.66% out of the total of glomerulonephritis), average age of 39.15 +\/- 18 years old. Average proteinuria 6.75 +\/- 4.53 g\/day. membranous nephropathy (33.85%), lupus nephritis (14.46%), minimal change disease (11.57%), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (10.33%), renal amyloidosis (9.95%). 33%, 45%, 63% and 72% of the patients with nephrotic syndrome developed to the End-stage Renal Disease and starting point of dialysis in 5, 10, 15 and 20 years respectively. After the multivariate model, the age older than 60 years old, the high levels of proteinuria and the coexistence with hypertension or renal failure, in the moment of diagnosis, showed to be independents clinical prognostic factors. The nephrotic proteinuria had a negative influence in the prognosis in the different histological types, especially in the IgA nephropathy and the lupus nephritis. The nephrotic syndrome is the main indication of the renal biopsy in our environment. In general, as an independent group, its development is slowly progressive to the End-stage Renal Disease, having the possibility of being also conditioned by certain clinical factors present in the moment of the biopsy. The presence of nephrotic proteinuria is also a negative factor in the progression in many of the glomerulonephritis. ","2709":"[corrected] Left renal vein compression, causing retrograde hypertension, determines a syndrome characterized by the presence of hematuria, gonadal vein dilatation and varicocele. Being a rare cause of hematuria its aetiology is diverse but of precise characteristics. Diagnosis is not easy and treatment requires to rule out its precise aetiology and consider the intensity of the compression phenomenon because of interventionist attitudes have important implications and are not risk free. We report nine children, aged 8-15 years, presenting with hematuria of urologic characteristics. Diagnosis of left renal vein hypertension or nutcracker phenomenon was established through ultrasound (regular and doppler-ultrasound) and helical-TC performed in all, and left renal venography performed in six of them. Retroaortic renal vein was present in two cases, a varicose accessorial renal vein due to anomalous drainage in one and compression at the aortomesenteric space in six. Because of the symptoms severity therapeutic attitude was interventionist in two cases, performing an auto-transplantation in one, and endovascular stent placement al the level of the left renal vein compression in other. Diagnosis of this syndrome is not always easy because less invasive explorations usually show parameters that are difficult to distinguish from normality. Severity of clinical manifestations and therapeutic attitude are related with the presence of renal vein hyperpressure and collateral varicose circulation indicating the lack of compensation of a difficult drainage. ","2710":"All-trans retinoic acid (AR-t) is used for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia and renal cell carcinoma and it also has therapeutic value in several animal models of renal disease. Among its renal targets, mesangial cells have been widely studied: they have both retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid X receptors (RXR) and the cell growth is inhibited when human mesangial cells are incubated with 1-10 microM AR-t. Although his effect has been related with the antiproliferative action of AR-t, there are no studies on the involvement of apoptosis in AR-t induced cell growth when higher concentrations of retinoid are used. Our studies show that 25 microM AR-t triggers mesangial cell apoptosis assessed by light and fluorescence microscopy (Giemsa stain and acridine orange stain, respectively), DNA electrophoresis, flow cytometry (annexin-V) and immunocytochemistry (TUNEL). AR-t induced apoptosis was not inhibited by preincubation with the RXR pan-antagonist HX531 nor with the RAR pan-antagonist AGN 193109, this suggesting RAR and RXIR are not involved in AR-t induced cell death. Previous results of our group showed that ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) and INK (c-Jun kinase), two members of the MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase family, are involved in non apoptotic effects of AR-t on mesangial cells. Therefore we focussed on the stress activated p38 kinase, the third member of the MAPK family, to investigate its involvement in AR-t induced apoptosis. The results confirmed a role of p38 since: 1) preincubation with B5203589, a p38 inhibitor, inhibited ARA induced apoptosis; 2) incubation with AR-t induced p38 phosphorilation after few minutes and p38 remained phosphorilated for at least 8 hours and 3) AR-t induced p38 phosphorilation was inhibited by SB203589. These data suggest that AR-t might have toxic side effects on the kidney but also suggest that AR-t could be an useful inhibitor of pathological mesangial cell expansion.","2711":"","2712":"The Uruguayan Registry of Glomerulopathies began its activity in 1974 and since 1985 is a national registry. The aim of this report is to analyze the incidence and the variations in frequencies of the histological diagnosis and clinical presentation during the 1980-2003 period. From the 2,058 patients with renal biopsy in the whole period, we analyzed the histological diagnosis and the following data has been collected when the patients were registered: age, gender, clinical syndrome, proteinuria, hematuria, serum creatinine, blood pressure and time from the first symptom. Four periods of registry entry were considered: 1980-1989, 1990-1994, 1995-1999 and 2000-2003. Chi-square and Student test for independent samples were used to evaluate the differences among the variables frequencies in the four periods. The incidence of registered glomerulopathies per million population (pmp) increased from 13 (1980-1989) to 43 (2000-2003). In the 2000-2003 period, the incidences pmp were: primary glomerulopathy (PG), 25.3 and secondary glomerulopathy, 14.2. The highest incidences pmp were: focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis (FSGS) 6.4; vasculitis 5.4; lupus nephritis 4.6; minimal change disease (MCD) 4.6; IgA nephropathy (IgAN) 4.5; and membranous nephropathy (MN) 4.0. The most frequent PG were the FSGS (29.3%) and the MCID (19.6%). The FSGS frequency decreased from 36.3% in 1995-1999 to 19.1% in 2000-2003. The IgAN frequency increased from 5.2% in 1980-1989 to 17.5% in 2000-2003. Nephrotic syndrome was the most frequent clinical presentation; its frequency was over 30% in the four periods. Asymptomatic urinary abnormality frequency increased from 14.0% in 1980-1989 to 22.7% in 2000-2003. The frequency of serum creatinine under 1.5 mg\/dl, increased from 42.2% in 1980-1989 to 67.2% in 2000-2003 (p = 0.001). The frequency of serum creatinine over 6.0 mg\/dl, decreased from 19.3% in 1990-1994 to 7.2% in 2000-2003. The percentage of patients referred since the first month of the apparent onset of the disease increased from 24.0% in 1980-1989 to 40.1% in 2000-2003 (p &lt; 0.001). In Uruguay, the incidence of glomerulopathies with histological diagnosis has increased and the frequency of the different types has changed. Several indicators seem to show that the reference of patients to the nephrologist tended to be earlier in the last years.

Cysts in the liver, pancreas, lung, spleen, oesophagus, ovary, testis, epididymis, prostate, thyroid, bladder, uterus, brain, paraespinal, and seminal vesicle have also been described. The occurrence of seminal vesicle cysts is often unrecognised. We report here a man with seminal vesicle cysts and azoospermia associated with ADPKD. Seminal vesicle cysts are not uncommon in ADPKD and in some cases it is associated with infertility. Ultrasound and computed tomography imaging were effective in documenting the underlying lesions non-invasively. Studies evaluating fertility in patients with seminal vesicle cysts and ADPKD are needed.","2721":"The incidence of cryptococosis ranges from 0.4-5.8% in renal transplant. Meningitis is the principal clinical manifestation, frequently with a subacute curse. In renal transplantation recipients, disseminated cryptococcosis appears as the more frequent presentation. We report a case of a 32 years old woman renal transplant recipient who presents altered mental status, headache and tremor during the month before her assessment to our hospital. Microbiological study was performed in cerebrospinal fluid and cryptococcus was isolated. She was treated with amphotericin B and 5 flucytosine. She developed refractory increased intracranial pressure and a lumboperitoneal derivation was necessary. Cryptococcosis must be considered as cause of meningitis in patients with renal transplant. The early diagnosis and treatment are fundamental due to high mortality of this pathology.","2722":"Parvovirus B19 can produce a picture known as pure red blood aplasia in recipients of solid organ. Occasionally the viruses cause decrease of the other blood cells, and various extra-hematologic manifestations. Common diagnosis is realised by bone marrow examination. The diagnostic value of the viral genome in the blood stream is not well defined. We reported the case of a male of 17 years of age, whose diagnosis was done by repeated determinations of the viral parvovirus B19 genome in peripheral blood. It was confirmed by a biopsy of the iliac crest. The patient was treated with unspecific IgG immunoglobulins, with complete recovery from the symptoms and signs. It did not have any recurrence of the disease. This case suggests that the realisation of PCR of Parvovirus B19 in renal transplant patients with pure red cell aplasia could be of greater interest in the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. The detection of the viral genome could avoid the administration of unnecessary blood transfusions, and possibly the realization of bone marrow biopsy.","2723":"Vascular access failure is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for patients on haemodialysis. We have prospectively studied, with a 5 years follow up, a monitoring protocol of native vascular accesses, using the available methods in every haemodialysis unit. All the native vascular accesses, created from 1- 1998 to XII-2001, with a posterior follow up until XII-2002, were monitored. Monitoring was based on physical examination, dificulty for blood flow greater than 300 ml\/min, and in a monthly basis: dynamic venous pressure, urea recirculation and urea kinetic model. Abnormalities suggestive of fistulogram were a priori defined. During the recruitment period, a total of 164 accesses were created in 144 patients. Of these only 3 were grafts, 28 native vascular accesses were never functioning (primary failure rate 17. 1%), and 127 native accesses created in 113 patients (age 63.3 +\/- 12.4 years; 18 % diabetics), were monitored (83% cephalic vein). Monitoring findings indicated realization of fistulogram in 35% and percutaneus angioplasty in 25% of the accesses. In order to maintain patency, the surgical intervention rate was 0.03 procedures\/patient\/year, the radiological 0.10 and the total 0.13. During the 5 years of the study occurred 41 thrombosis episodes in 40 accesses (0.07 thrombosis\/patient\/year), with percutaneus repermeabilization in 30%. Primary (unassisted) survival was 30.3 months (Confidence Interval 95% 25.6, 35.0) and secondary (assisted) survival 42.8 months (Confidence Interval 95%: 38.7, 46.9). Logistic regression analysis showed that presence of a central catheter at the time of creating the vascular access posses a greater risk for thrombosis (Relative Risk 5.6 if in subclavian vein), whereas age, diabetes, time to canulation, number of previous accesses and anatomic type do not increase that risk. In conclusion, in an old haemodialysis population, with an important diabetes prevalence, it is possible to create functioning native vascular accesses in most of them. The monitoring protocol allowed the detection and posterior correction of stenosis in a great number of accesses. The main risk of thrombosis is the presence of a central catheter at the time of creating a vascular access.","2724":"With the purpose to improve the clinical situation of nine hemodialysis patients who suffer from severe cardiovascular disease and are highly symptomatic after weekends without dialysis because of fluid overload, their dialysis schedule was changed from 5 hours in 3 sessions per week to 4 hours every other day sessions (EODD), avoiding 72 hours of interdialitic weekend period. In each patient, during 38 sessions previous to starting the EODD (stage 1: 3 months) and the 38 sessions in EODD, which followed the first month of this dialysis regime (stage 2), the frequency of the next incidences was registered (ratio in 348 sessions, in every stage, of this patients group): presence of dysnea and\/or hypertension pre dialysis session, pre or intra dialysis angor, emergency sessions with hypotension and sessions without achieving predetermined dry-weight. During the EODD stage, sessions, with dysena, hypertension and pre or intra dialysis angor were reduced in 80% (p &lt; 0.001); the incidence of sessions with hypotensive episode or sessions without achieving dry-weight decreased in a third. All patients experimented a considerable improvement in their clinical situation. In addition, the whole group reduced dry-weight and later regained it without presenting symptoms which had motivated EODD schedule. EODD schedule improves the clinical situation in patients with cardiopathy who would not do so when following previous schedule (which includes 48 hours without dialysis).","2725":"Many hemodialysis patients from foreign countries arrived to be dialized in Madrid. They cames from all around the world, especially South America and Morroco. This group is younger (46.2 + 14.2 years) than the control group.

In the foreign group the primary renal diseases were similar to the control group, however they also had many other health unusual problems. Most of them (71 %) started hemodialysis without ever having permanent hemodialysis vascular access, and 25 % were not able to speak spanish, or other European languages. This caused many problems in administering correct treatment.","2726":"The nephrotoxic effect of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflamatory drugs (NSAIDS) has been widely described. The main benefit of the Cox-2 inhibitors in relation to the NSAIDS is the production of a very similar analgesic effect, but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. However, their effects on renal function are little known as yet and their long-term safety is still pending definition. The use of selective Cox-2 inhibitors as anti-inflamatory analgesic is becoming more and more common in our environment. We report two cases of tubulointersticial nephritis confirmed by renal biopsy, associated with administration of the two Cox-2 inhibitors currently available on the market, celecoxib and rofecoxib. In both cases, we were talking about elderly women, with deterioration of the general condition and acute renal failure. In the former case, renal biopsy showed an acute tubulo-intersticial nephritis (TIN) so highly \"variegated\" in its histologic expression. In the second case, was associated with strong indications of chronicity. Treatment with steroid was initiated in both patients and improvement of renal function was observed.","2727":"El Salvador has high mortality rates from chronic kidney disease (CKD). The actual prevalence and causes remain unknown and local resources are scarce. Previous studies have suggested very high prevalence in specific populations: adult male farmers living in the coastlands, with high frequency of pesticides exposure and alcohol consumption. This population has low incomes and poor healthcare accessibility. Our aim was to detect CKD cases in this population using proteinuria as an inexpensive initial screening, investigating associations with those characteristics and comparing them with another population from the midlands. We performed a transversal study on volunteer men from both regions, taking into consideration the variables: age, farmer living, pesticides, exposure, alcohol consumption, medical past history, blood pressure level, glycemia and proteinuria in a random urine sample. Coastland men with proteinuria were additionally screened for CKD measuring hemoglobin and serum creatinine levels. Finally, we employed a logistic regression model, and Perason's Chi2 to investigate associations between those variables and the presence of proteinuria or CKD. We included 291 men from the coastlands and 62 from the midlands: 35 and 16% off the total male population from their respective communities. Proteinuria (table I) was found in 133 (45.7%) and 8 cases (12.9%). CKD was diagnosed in 37 (12.7%) coastland men (table III), with mean creatinine 2.64 +\/- 2.5 mg\/dl, hemoglobin 12.32 +\/- 1.9 g\/dl and 81.1% with proteinuria 15-30 mg\/l. Only 14 (37.8%) out of those 37 CKD patients featured diabetes or hypertension, while the remaining (62.2%) did not appear to have a clear-cut cause for CKD. Only one of them was formerly diagnosed with CKD. Farmer living, pesticides exposure and alcohol consumption were found to be very common characteristics in both populations, and were not associated to the presence of proteinuria or CKD (table II and III) DISCUSSION: The prevalence of CKD within the adult male farmers from the Salvadoran coastlands is remarkably high: at least 12.7%. There is a large number of undiagnosed cases, but they can be easily detected with inexpensive methods. This high prevalence is not completely explained by usual CKD causes like diabetes or hypertension. In addition, pesticides exposure and alcohol consumption may not be related, too. The disease is moderate, non symptomatic and has fairly mild proteinuria, possibly from interstitial origin.

The three teams happened within two months. Owing to this, an evaluation of exposure was carried out in patients, staff and collective transport personnel making tuberculin test conversion clear in all three groups and establishing chemoprophylaxis afterward.

We explored whether factors such as age, gender, weight, renal disease, immunosuppression, rejection episodes or HCV could be independent risk factors for PTDM. Ninety four of the 325 patients were HCV positive and 231 were HCV negative. PTDM was observed in 22.3% of the HCV positive patients versus 6.5% of the HCV negative patients (p &lt; 0.001). The independent factors found by multivariate analysis to be predictive of PTDM were: HCV positivity (OR: 5.65, IC 95%: 2.6-12), body mass index (OR: 1,10, IC 95%: 1.02-1.2) and age (OR: 1.07, IC 95%: 1.03-1.12).

A total of 112 patients previously treated with epoetin and no dose modification during the 8 weeks prior to the study and stable levels of Hb were included. Of these, 92.1% finished the follow-up period (24 weeks). After changing the administration route of rHuEPO, a significant increase in the resistance index (REI, weekly dose per kilogram of weight\/levels of hemoglobin) was observed with mean values of 2.73 (p &lt; 0.018) and 4.37 (p &lt; 0.001) after 16 and 24 weeks respectively, requiring an increase of the dose greater than 15% over the baseline in 6 1.1% of the patients. The changeover to, darbepoetin alpha, independently of the administration route, was accompanied by a decrease in REI starting in the 8th week (mean levels of 0.012, 0.018 and 0.023 after 8, 16 and 24 weeks respectively), significant (p &lt; 0.001) at the 3 cutoff points of the study. The conversion factor increased significantly up to 1:260 in week 24. Both erythropoietic stimulating factors (EST) were well tolerated and no unexpected side effects were observed. In conclusion, treatment of anaemia with darbepoetin alpha in patients with CRI in haemodialysis previously treated with rHuEPO proved to be more effective than the use of epoetin intravenously, significantly improving the resistance index.

The angiotensin II mediate by glomerular permeselective function via the opening of large pores after elevations in transmembrane pressure and by acting on the glomerular pressure, too. There is evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors alone or with the angiotensin receptor-blockade may improve the glomerular size-selective function and the hemodynamic intrarenal accounted output of plasma proteins. We evaluated the Enalapril action only in two progressive doses (stage 1: 0.2 mg\/kg\/day and stage 2: 0.4 mg\/kg\/per day, respectively) and then we evaluated the combinated treatment (stage 3) with Enalapril (0.2 mg\/kg\/per day) + Losartan (0.8 mg\/kg\/day) in thirteen patients (2 female\/ 11 male, mean age 12 yrs, r: 10y-16y) normotensive with middle or heavy proteinuria and normal glomerular filtration rate.

Its incidence is controversial. The aim of the present study is to determine the incidence of histopathologic evidence of BKV-infection in a single centre. Renal allograft tissue samples (n = 838) from 526 patients undergoing renal transplant were evaluated by light microscopy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for BKV DNA was performed in 41 microdissected cell populations from cases with viral inclusions, cases with other nuclear changes, and cases without nuclear changes. Polyomavirus-inclusions were identified in six cases (five with interstitial nephritis and other one with only urothelial infection). In one case with interstitial nephritis the DNA was degraded. PCR confirmed BKV infection in the other five and was negative in cases without inclusions. Five patterns of inclusions bodies are observed and they appear to be characteristic. PCR assay seemingly have a high specificity for BKV detection and it does not usually detect latent viral infection. ","2769":"There has been increasing interest to find instruments to assess the HRQL quickly and easily in daily clinical practice. The main objective of this study is to measure the HRQL inhemodialysis patients using the Coop-Wonca Charts and to analyse whether they can be a useful instrument to assess the patient functional status and the HRQL in this population. A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed between March 2003 and May 2003 in 163 hemodialysis patients (106 males and 57 females). The HRQL has been measured according to the validated Spanish version of the Coop-Wonca Charts. The questionnaire has nine different scales with a single-item. The answers score from 1 to 5 with the higher scores indicating the worst health or functional problems. The filling middle time of Coop-Wonca charts was less than five minutes. The charts were easily understood for the patients and can be self-administered. The dimensions of \"Physical fitness\" (3.66 +\/- 0.8) and \"Overall health\" (3.43 +\/- 0.8) showed the higher score, and the item aSocial activities) showed the lower scores (better quality of life) (1.98 +\/- 1.3). The factors related to the worse health state are the variables: sex (females), the comorbility (diabetes and\/or hepatopathy), the labour status (retired) and the way of transport (taxi\/ambu lance). The time in hemodialysis was an independent variable and showed the worse score in the \"general quality of life\" (p &lt; 0.05) and in the \"perception of pain\" (p &lt; 0.01). The way of transport used (ambulances) was also an independent variable with worse scores for the dimensions \"Physical fitness\" (p &lt; 0.01), \"Daily activities\" (p &lt; 0.05) and \"Health status\" (p &lt; 0.05). The older patients showed a worse score in the dimension \"Physical fitness\" (p &lt; 0.01) and the patients with more than prescribed medicines scored worse in \"Social activities\" (p &lt; 0.01). Males (p &lt; 0.05), widows and single (p &lt; 0.05) scored worse in social support. The Coop-Wonca Charts could be a good instrument to measure of HRQL in the HD patients. Their application is easy, fast (less than 5 minutes), easily understood, and can be self-administered. ","2770":"Intradialytic hypotension is closely linked to hypovolemia and ascribed to the degree of ultrafiltration. Among the maneuvers used to recovery hypotension, we have the Trendelenburg position, the infusion of isotonic saline serum or plasma extenders as well as shutting of the ultrafiltration. The objective of this study is to quantify the influence that the different maneuvers employed for recovery hypovolemia will have on blood volume, employing the Crit-Line system. We have studied 32 hemodialysis patients over 5 consecutive hemodialysis sessions. The different maneuvers evaluated were: administration of saline serum, plasma extenders, Trendelenburg position, shutting off the ultrafiltration and administration of hypertonic saline serum. The administration of saline serum causes an increase of 2.9% in blood volume at the end of the third hour, which is higher than the increase achieved in the first hour (2.6%) and second hour (2.4%). The Trendelenburg position achieves a minimal blood volume increase of 0.4%. The administration of plasma extenders achieves the most significant increase in blood volume of 3.1% and the longer lasting one as well (37 minutes). The cessation of ultrafiltration at the end of the first and third hours, achieves a blood volume increase of 2% and 2.3% respectively. Lastly, the administration of hypertonic saline serum causes a minimal blood volume increase of 0.7%. The infusion of isotonic saline serum and plasma extenders, are the quickest, most efficient and long lasting maneuvers for blood volume expansion, followed by the cessation of ultrafiltration. In concerning to quick plasma volume recovery, the Trendelenburg position and the administration of hypertonic saline serum are not very efficient maneuvers. ","2771":"A protective effect of obesity on the mortality of end-stage renal failure patients has been observed in several studies. Most of these studies have been based on prevalent dialysis population. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if obesity has beneficial effects on the survival of advanced chronic renal failure patients. The study group consisted of 376 patients (mean age 63 +\/- 15 years) with advanced chronic renal failure not yet on dialysis. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) &gt; or = 30 kg\/m2. Grade of comorbidity was quantified by the method devised by Davies. Survival was analyzed as time from the referral to the predialysis outpatient clinic to patient death, censoring from contributing additional survival data to the analysis following transplantation. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to test survival differences according to quartiles of BMI, and between obese and nonobese patients. Further analysis were performed, stratifying survival curves by comorbid scores, lean body mass, age, and sex. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to investigate the best determinants of mortality, and the role of obesity adjusted for other covariates. Median survival time was 1,453 days. During the follow-up time, 158 patients (42%) died. Survival differences among quartiles of BMI were statistically significant (Breslow = 10.7, p = 0.017). Patients within the lowest and the highest quartiles of BMI had higher mortality than the rest of patients. Survival curves between obese and non-obese patients did not differ significantly. However, when patients without comorbidity were studied apart, those with obesity showed worse survival than the rest of patients (log-rank = 7.42, p = 0.0064). Since the effect of obesity on mortality did not follow a proportional hazard pattern throughout the study period, multivariable analysis for mortality was stratified by 18 months intervals. The variables which fitted the best model were: age (Hazard Ratio: 1.04), comorbid score (HR: 2.17), serum albumin (HR: 0.62), GFR at the study entry (HR: 0.91), male gender (HR: 1.48), and obesity (HR: 1.51). In conclusion, obesity had no survival benefit in patients with advanced chronic renal failure. Obesity had a noteworthy impact on early mortality of advanced chronic kidney disease patients without comorbidities.","2772":"Tunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheters (THC) are developed as a means of short hemodialysis access while a more permanent form of access are maturing. The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness, survival and complications of the THC used for long-term vascular access. In a retrospective study we looked at 42 THC inserted between November 2000 and October 2003, in 40 elderly patients, with systemic disease or when other vascular access was not possible. Procedural complications occurred in 5 cases (11.9%), which included: local haemorrhage (3), hemothorax (1) and one fatal venous tear. 6 catheters (14.2%) were removed due to complications (non-function 3 and bacteraemia 3). The total incidence of THC related infections was 0.18 episodes\/1,000 catheters-days. Patients were followed up for a mean 379 days (range 1-1,140) and a total of 15,946 catheter-days. Qb and KT\/V achieved at one month were 278.3 +\/- 34.1 ml\/min and 1.48 +\/- 0.27 respectively. At the end of the follow-up, 23 patients (54.7%) were alive with catheter functioning. One, three and twelve months survival was 90.4%, 73.1% and 59.5% respectively.

The incidence of arteriovenous fistulas appears to be low and has been infrequently mentioned in large series of biopsies although there are a number of individual reports. In most part of cases, no systemic effects of the arteriovenous fistulas were observed, so they close by themselves. Optimization of renal biopsy techniques aims not only at obtaining kidney tissue technically adequate for diagnosis, but at reducing biopsy-induced complications. When these complications are done, the new transvascular techniques can get the healing of fistula with the embolism by catheters. We describe the case of a 37-year-old woman who had chronic renal failure by a possible chronic glomerulonephritis. She developed deterioration of renal function after the percutaneous renal biopsy. An arteriovenous fistula of high flow was detected by Doppler ultrasound. Then, it was confirmed angiographically and closed by embolism's catheter without damage of renal tissue.","2784":"We report the case of a 37 year old man who suffered from Crohn's Disease (CD), and was receiving treatment with mesalazine (5-ASA). Nine years after the diagnosis, because of detecting a slight proteinuria, a renal biopsy is made, being the anatomo-pathologic result compatible with membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). Checking previous literature we have only found two cases reported of MGN in coincidence with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), one in association with Ulcerative Colitis and the other with Crohn's Disease in a 12 years old boy.

Although is demonstrated that intra-access pressure (IAP) is a good method of screening to evaluate arterial-venous (AV) fistulas, its utility is uncommon because its measurement requires a complex system. We would like to validate the utility of IAP monitoring using a simplified measure of IAP and its relation with other methods of screening in detecting stenoses prior to thromboses of AV grafts. We studied 24 AV grafts of 24 patients during 18 months we measured arterial pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), dynamic venous pressure, IAP, Kt\/v, URR, recirculation index (RI), access flow and color Doppler flow, dividing the patients in two groups, with stenoses or not, if IAP\/MAP &gt; 0.5 and stenoses &gt; 0.50 by Doppler we performed arteriography and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent if stenoses exits. The values of IAP, MAP, RI were higher significantly in the stenoses group with increase of vascular access in grafts were dilation by angioplasty was made. All stenoses detected with IAP were confirmed by Doppler and arteriography but one. We conclude that IAP is an early, useful, easy, effective method in detecting stenoses of AV grafts prior to thrombosis.","2787":"The sudden interruption of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients leads to rapid anemization. The mechanisms of this phenomenon are, however, insufficiently understood. The present study examined the response to immediate rHuEPO withdrawal in dialysis patients. 10 chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients regularly receiving rHuEPO were studied. rHuEPO was stopped and reinitiated after 7 days. Reticulocyte profile, haemoglobin and haematocrit were measured at 0, 7 and 15 days. As a complementary study, and with the purpose of analyzying whether uremia was a relevant factor, 10 non-uremic male Wistar rats were treated with rHuEPO. After two weeks, rHuEPO was withdrawn in 5 animals, and continued for 7 additional days in the remainder. The same variables than in the human study were determined. Changes in reticulocyte subtypes from baseline to day 7 were: total 18.2 +\/- 0.9 vs 14.3 +\/- 1.8% (p &lt; 0.06); high-fluorescence (HFR): 2.6 +\/- 0.4 vs 0.75 +\/- 0.2 (p &lt; 0.001); medium-fluorescence (MFR): 13.0 +\/- 1.1 vs 6.6 +\/- 0.9% (p &lt; 0.02); and low-fluorescence (LFR): 84.2 +\/- 1.4 vs 92.7 +\/- 1% (p NS). The baseline pattern was recovered upon 7 days of rHuEPO reinitiation (p NS). Mean hemoglobin and hematocrit decreased by day 14 (p &lt; 0.02) in spite of rHuEPO reinitiation at day 7. In non-uremic rats, changes were similar to that in the ESRD patients. rHuEPO induces changes in the reticulocyte pattern, consisting in a reduction of immature reticulocytes. These changes appear to be independent of the presence of uremia. Accordingly, complete rHuEPO withdrawal in HD patients will cause a rapidly-developing anaemia due to an alteration in the reticulocyte maturation series; therefore, sudden rHuEPO interruption should be avoided whenever is possible. As a collateral application, the specific changes described herein have potential use for detecting illegal administration of rHuEPO. ","2788":"The role of the double phase parathyroid scintigraphy with MIBI in the primary hyperparathyroidism has been well studied. The present work analyzes the benefit of this image technique in the diagnosis and therapeutic approach to uremia associated hyperparathyroidism. We studied 18 dialysis patients with clinical and analytical data of hyperparathyroidism. All of them were receiving treatment with i.v. vitamin D. We carried out two scintigraphic studies, the first under basal conditions (without changes in treatment) and the second one, a week later after the stimulation of the parathyroid gland through the cessation of the treatment with vitamin D and phosphorus binders, and the use of a low-calcium dialysate. In the basal study, fourteen patients had a positive uptake test in at least one of the four glands. These patients had significantly higher PTHi levels than those with a negative scintigraphic study. After the stimulation test, we found a statistically significative rise in PHTi (644 vs 979 p &lt; 0.001) and phosphorus levels (5.8 vs 7.3; p &lt; 0.01), a slight fall in calcium levels (p = NS) and a statistically significative increment in the score of scintigraphic captation (5.5 +\/- 4.5 vs 6.8 +\/- 5; p &lt; 0.05). We found a statistically significative correlation between the PTHi level and the score of scintigraphic uptake, in the basal study (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.01) and after stimulation (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.01). The only variable associated with the scintigraphic uptake was PTHi, justifying 31.1% of the variance in the first study and 32.7% in the second. In conclusion, the MIBI scintigraphic is a useful exploration in the uremic patient with hyperparathyroidism, as it predicts the functional state of the parathyroid glands according to uptake intensity. The stimulation test could be useful in planning therapy, but some of its characteristics need to be established, such as the precise time to reach the maximum level of parathyroid stimulation.","2789":"To evaluate the safe use of a new calcium channel blocker, lercanidipine, in diabetic chronic renal failure (CRF) patients.

Mean age was 68.2 +\/- 9.1 years. 53.8% were males and 46.2% females. Three patients were type 1 diabetics and 39 ones were type II. All patients were receiving ACE inhibitors (67.4%) or angiotensin II antagonist (32.6%) therapy but they had higher blood pressure than recommended for CRF patients (130\/85 mmHg). No patients were under diuretic treatment. Patients were clinically evaluated 1, 3 and 6 months after starting treatment with lercanidipine. Samples for urine and blood examination were taken during the examination. When needed, a third drug was added to treatment, excluding diuretics. Creatinine clearance was measured using 24 h urine collection. BP significantly decrease from 163 +\/- 18\/90 +\/- 8 mmHg to 134 +\/- 12\/77 +\/- 9 mmHg. One half of patients showed significant reduction of blood pressure, 26.7% reached the target blood pressure (&lt; 130\/85 mmHg) and 20.0% gets optimal BP control (&lt; 130\/85 mmHg). No one patient showed untoward effects. No edema was detected nor adverse effects related to vasodilatation were found. Plasmatic creatinine did not change (1.9 +\/- 0.5 baseline vs 1.8 +\/- 0.5 mg\/dl) and creatinine clearance increased at the end visit (40.1 +\/- 14.5 baseline vs 45.4 +\/- 18.2 ml\/min) but the difference was not significant.

","2790":"Although the epidemiology of subjects with end-stage renal disease is well-known in Spain, the prevalence of mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population is unknown. In order to measure this, it is necessary to carry out studies in the general population including those who are not health service patients. During epidemiology studies, the method of measuring glomerular filtration rate can change significantly the measurements of the prevalence of mild to moderate CKD. Between 1997 and 2000, we performed a multi-phase descriptive polistratified epidemiological transversal study. The section of public chosen was between the ages of 15 and 85 living in the health area of western Valladolid (Spain). We calculated creatinine clearance using four methods: serum creatinine concentration, creatinine clearance using 24-hour urine samples adjusting the volume to the expected creatinuria with the Walser formulas, using the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) equation and applying the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study abbreviated formula. We classified the level of kidney function, according to the National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Initiative (NFK-DOQI) guidelines. The instances of stages 2 and 3 CKD rise with age and are more common in women than men. This tendency is apparent in middle age and persons of 65 and above. Using the CG method, almost half the old women had a stage 3 CKD as opposed to a third of the men. If the measurement is performed using the abbreviated MDRD study, there are very few differences between the sexes. The prevalence of stage 3 CKD is similar (around 8%) but the prevalence of stage 2 CKD rises to 60% as opposed to 36% calculated using the CG equation. After comparing the results obtained with those of the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Study (see table VII), the measurements of stage 3 CKD using the CG formula or by means of expected creatininuria coincide relatively, although the prevalence of stage 2 CKD is higher in persons of 65 and over. If we use the abreviated MDRD study, the prevalences increase by more than 20%. The prevalence of stages 2 and 3 CKD is clearly influenced by the method of calculation used. The prevalence of stage 2 CKD affects at least a third of the general population while those affected by stage 3 CKD are between 3.3% and 8.5%.

A simulation model was developed to project long-term cost consequences of the IDNT in the Spanish setting. A Markov model simulated progression from nephropathy to DSC, ESRD and death in patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes and overt nephropathy. Treatment-specific probabilities were derived from IDNT. Country-specific ESRD-related data were retrieved from published sources. Delay in onset of ESRD, life expectancy and mean lifetime costs were calculated for patients with baseline age 59 years.

The aims of the present study are: a) to define the HRQOL dimensions in which there are differences between men and women on chronic hemodialysis (HD), correcting then the differences on the generic dimensions by means of standardization by age and gender of the obtained scores, using Spanish normative data, and b) to identify the variables that cause these possible gender-related differences on HRQOL. A cross-sectional multi-center study was carried out with 152 patients (69 men and 83 women) receiving HD treatment in 43 Spanish centers, using the KDQOL-SF to evaluate their HRQOL. The generic KDQOL-SF scores were standardized by age and gender using Spanish normative data. Sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables were also collected on each patient. A MANOVA was carried out to study the variables associated with the gender-related differences on HRQOL. The sociodemographic, clinical and psychosocial variables showing significant differences between men and women in the previous univariate analysis were entered as covariates. The KDQOL-SF scores showed statistically significant differences between men and women in four scales: physical functioning, emotional role limitation, social function and emotional well-being. In contrast, standardized scores showed no differences between men and women in the profile or degree of HRQOL impairment. Although statistically significant gender-related differences were shown in educational level, employment, haemoglobin, Kt\/V, trait anxiety and depressive symptoms, only the last two variables showed an independent effect on the differences in HRQOL. Impaired HRQOL in women on HD reflects the gender-related differences that are also shown in the general population, and they are related to the higher prevalence of trait anxiety and depressive symptoms in women.

Physiopathologic mechanisms of fibrotic proliferation that implicate those agents are not totally explained. With an experimental approach using cultured peritoneal fibroblasts, we have studied intracellular pH changes and Na+\/H+ antiporter activity under cells perfusion with peritoneal dialysis liquids containing acetate, lactate, hypertonic glucose and interleukin-1. All experiments were performed at extracellular pH 7.4 and physiologic HCO3\/CO2 concentration. 35 mM acetate produced a huge intracellular acidosis (ipH = 6.80 +\/- 0.08). Lactate effect was less important (6.95 +\/- 0.07), with a slow ipH recovery in about 30 min in both cases. IL-1, 10(-6) M also reduced ipH to 7.10 +\/- 0.03. Acidosis was linked to Ca2+ outflow via Ca\/H exchange and was blocked with Cd 20 nM. Extracellular Na = 0 and amiloride totally inhibited ipH recovery after acetate, lactate, or interleukin-induced acidosis. Hypertonic glucose perfusion increased ipH (7.31 +\/- 0.06) for 5-7 min. This increase was also inhibited by amiloride or extracellular Na absence. Na+\/H+ exchanger activity increased to 58%, and kept activated after ipH recovery. In conclusion, acetate, hypertonic glucose and IL-1 showed the common effect of stimulating the sodium-proton exchanger by different mechanisms, giving a possibility of potentiation. Activated Na+\/H+ exchanger may act as a signal-transduction increasing fibroblast proliferation and explaining the cellular mechanism of sclerosing peritonitis. ","2830":"Hypertension is a common and difficult clinic problem in patients undergoing cronical hemodialysis and exerts a deleterious effect on mordibidy and mortality in end stage renal disease. Identification of potentially reversible factors associated with hypertension would be rational fist step in designing and effective therapeutic strategy. Our study aimed to document the prevalence of hypertension in hemodialysis patients in Andalucia and identify and characterise the demographic, epidemiological, clinical factors and dialysis regimens associated with hypertension. The study population included 2,789 patients enrolled in 46 hemodialysis centers in Andalucia on 2002. Hypertension was defined as requiring the use of antihypertensive drugs. Patients wre classified as hypertensive and no hypertensive. Demographic, comorbidity, anaemia, inflammatory and nutritional data were collected in both groups. Hypertensive patients were divided into 4 groups of severity according to the number of antihypertensive drugs received. Comparisons between groups were done. Our results show a hypertension prevalence of 53.8% in comparing clinical data of no hypertensive and hypertensive patients, we observed that patients with hypertension were significantly younger (60.2 +\/- 15.6 vs 63.5 +\/- 15 years; p &lt; 0.001) and had shorter time on dialysis (months) (56.5 +\/- 60 vs 67.3 +\/- 68.2; p = 0.001). Coronary heart disease (p &lt; 0.001) and diabetes (p &lt; 0.001) were associated with hypertension. Hypertensive patients had higher levels of creatinine (mg\/dl) (8.8 +\/- 2.3 vs 8.5 +\/- 2.3; p = 0.006) and serum albumin (g\/dl) (3.9 +\/- 0.4 vs 3.8 +\/- 0.4; p &lt; 0.001), and lower C-reactive protein (CRP) (mg\/dl) (12.3 +\/- 19.7 vs 16.1 +\/- 25.15; p &lt; 0.001). Hypertensive patients received less time of dialysis (233 +\/- 25 vs 237 +\/- 25 minutes\/session; p &lt; 0.001 and 703 +\/- 85 vs 718 +\/- 88 minutes\/week; p &lt; 0.001) and lower dialysis dose (urea reduction ratio (URR), Kt\/V Daugirdas 2.a gen) (70.7 +\/- 7.8 vs 72.0 +\/- 7.8; p &lt; 0.001; 1.33 +\/- 0.28 vs 1.37 +\/- 0.29; p &lt; 0.001). A significative correlation existed between hypertension and the use of low-flux membranes. Interdialytic weight gain (kg) was higher in hypertensive patients (2.1 +\/- 0.9 vs 2.0 +\/- 0.9; p = 0.002). In a multiple logistic regression analysis the independent risk factors defining hypertension in hemodialysis patients were: age (OR = 0.98; CI = 0.976-0.988, p &lt; 0.001), time on dialysis (OR = 0.99; CI = 0.997-0.999; p = 0.006), creatinine (OR = 1.07; CI = 1.024-1.116; p 0.002). CRP (OR = 0.99; CI = 0.989-0.998; p = 0.003). Albumin (OR = 1.36; CI = 1.106-1.668; p = 0.004). Interdialytic weight gain (OR = 1.11; CI = 1.000-1.224; p = 0.049), duration of the session (OR = 0.99; CI = 0.986-0.993; p &lt; 0.001), low-flux membranes (OR = 0.74; CI = 0.618-0.883; p = 0.001), diabetes (OR = 1.81; CI = 1.435-2.274; p &lt; 0.001) and coronary hear disease (OR = 1.52; CI = 1.218-1.900; p &lt; 0.001). There was a relationship between hypertension severity and age (p &lt; 0.001), interdialytic weight gain (p &lt; 0.001) and albumin (p &lt; 0.001). 1) Hypertension prevalence in hemodiaysis patients in Andalucia was 53.8%. 2) Hypertensive patients: are younger; have shorter time on dialysis; receive shorter hemodialysis sessions; show excessive interdialytic weight gain. 3) Coronary heart disease and diabetes are risk factors for hypertension. 4) There are a relationship between hypertension severity and age, interdialytic weight gain and serum albumin. 5) An effective hypertension therapeutic strategy in hemodialysis patients must include: increase time of hemodialysis, strict control of dry weight and prevention and treatment of others cardiovascular risk factors. ","2831":"Sevelamer is a recent phosphate binder that is mineral-free, and represents a great advance in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with hypercalcemia and\/or gastric intolerance to calcium-based phosphate binders. The communications about the experience with the use of sevelamer in patients non-yet in dialysis is scanty. The aim of our study is to investigate retrospectively the gastrointestinal tolerance of sevelamer, their efficacy as phosphate binder and other parameters in a group of 89 patients with chronic renal failure in predialysis. We have analysed the effects of sevelamer at baseline and after 1, 3 and 6 months on the following data and parameters: calcium, phosphate, intact PTH, venous bicarbonate, urea, creatinine, creatinine clearance, side-effects, number of patients that were discontinued, and co-treatment during the study period with phosphate-based binders, calcitriol, lipid-lowering drugs and sodium bicarbonate. 19 patients (21.3%) refused to continue with sevelamer at the first month (16 patients had digestive intolerance and 3 several symptoms). Serum phosphate fell at 3 months (5 +\/- 0.8 mg\/dl basal vs 4.8 +\/- 0.7 mg\/dl, p = 0.02) and 6 months (5 +\/- 0.8 mg\/dl basal vs 4.7 +\/- 0.9 mg\/dl, p = 0.07). Serum calcium fell at 6 months (9.8 +\/- 0.7 mg\/dl basal vs 9.4 +\/- 0.6 mg\/dl, p = 0.03). Venous bicarbonate and iPTH were unchanged, but the quantity of sodium bicarbonate administered increased significantly. Blood cholesterol fell at 1 months (193 +\/- 49 mg\/dl basal vs 173 +\/- 52 mg\/dl, p = 0.001) and 3 months (205 +\/- 49 mg\/dl basal vs 170 +\/- 49 mg\/dl, p = 0.004), in spite of a significant reduction of the dose of statins. Sevelamer is an effective phosphate binder in predialysis patients and also reduces significantly the serum cholesterol, improving the blood lipid profile. The levels of venous bicarbonate remained unchanged, at expenses of an increment in the dose of sodium bicarbonate supplementation. ","2832":"The aim of our study is to analyze the clinic characteristics and evolution of the primary reflux in infants. We studied retrospectively 203 infants in our hospital, diagnosed of severe primary renal reflux. Renal ecography and cyclic mictional cystography were practiced in all cases. DMSA was carried out in 181 patients. Renal reflux was unilateral in the 23% of the patients, and bilateral in the remaining cases; 72% of the renal reflux were grade IV and 28% grade V. The renal injuries affected to male infants and reflux grade V. The renal injury was focal (27%), global (44%) and atrophic (29%). The 79% of the patients had conservative treatment, while 21% had surgical treatment. 100% infants with surgical treatment and 94.2% infants with conservative treatment were recovered (Test of Kaplan-Meier). The 27% of patients developed one or several urinary infections, but progression of old renal injuries or formation of new ones, were exceptional (3 cases): While the time the study lasted none of the patients developed chronic renal failure nor arterial hypertension. 1) The fetal severe primary reflux of the patients was characterized by the following features: to be bilateral reflux, to affect mainly to male infants and to be associated in 33% of cases with a severe renal injury of congenital origin (renal displasia) most of them unilateral. 2) The natural evolution of the reflux goes to spontaneous recovery, so treatment must be conservative. 3) Some patients underwent urinary infections, but progression or formation of new renal injuries were inusual. None of the patients had terminal renal failure nor hypertension and 4) Risk patients would be male infants with bilateral injuries although these are infrequent.

He was otherwise healthy until development of a history of edema and nocturia over 3 weeks. Physical examination was normal apart from ankle swelling. Renal biopsy showed amyloid deposits in the glomerulus with gentian violet and congo red. Positive staining by antibody against serum amyloid A protein was demonstrated. Nine months later because of persistent nephrotic syndrome, an abdominal tomography was performed and a mesenteric mass was detected. The patient underwent abdominal surgery. The histopathological examination showed plasma cell variant of Castleman disease and AA amyloidosis in the mass. After the removal of mesenteric mass, the proteinuria gradually decreased and disappeared, and no systemic findings were present.","2838":"First cause of secondary hypertension is renovascular hypertension which presents abdominal bruit in 16 to 20% of cases. This clinical sign is also associated with other vascular disease of the abdomen such as celiac trunk stenosis and\/or aneurysms located on the pancreaticoduodenal or gastroduodenal arcs level, with little representation among aneurysm. They usually appear on a context of digestive complications like neoplasias, chronic pancreatitis or gastric obstructions possibly with obstructive icterus, hemorrhage and acute abdomen episodes. Its presentation in other contexts is rare and constitutes a diagnostic challenge. Diagnosis is made by abdominal arteriography which is the best method because you can locate the problem as well as intervene therapeutically with embolization of the aneurysme. We would like to emphasize the importance of a quick diagnosis due to the risk of rupture and the high morbi-mortality associated.","2839":"A 68-year-old male with macroscopic hematuria and constitutional symptoms as fever and weight loss. There was nothing interesting in the anamnesis or in the physical exploration. The laboratory test had an elevation of creatinine of 4 mg\/dL and ten days before it had been 1.4 mg\/dL. In the urine analysis: proteinuria of 1.5 G\/24 h, and hematuria. On the second day we made a renal biopsy where we could seen segmental glomerular necrosis and crescent fromation in 80% of the glomeruli. In the immune study c-ANCA anti-PR3 was positive. In the complementary studies we didn't find other organs affected. With the diagnosis of pauci-immune glomerulonephritis limited to the kidney we began treatment with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. As the renal function was severely affected the patient needed one dialysis session. We began with 1 g intravenous methylprednisolone daily for 3 days followed by oral prednisone 60 mg daily tapering to 10 mg daily by 3 months. This was combined with 150 mg oral cyclophosphamide daily. Seven plasma exchanges were performed. At the beginning of treatment creatinine was 7 mg\/dL, it was decreasing rapidly and three week after cretinine was 3 mg\/Dl and he was asymptomatic. One year after treatment, creatinine is 1.4 mg\/dL and the urine analysis is normal, C-ANCA are negative.","2840":"Advances in the treatment of HIV infection in the recent years have improved the survival of these patients. This improvement in prognosis has been followed by a higher prevalence of kidney disease among these patients. We present a patient with a known HIV infection who developed renal insufficiency. The renal biopsy showed lesions of thrombotic microangiopathy and malignant hypertension with development of vascular and glomerular damage stages. The laboratory studies allowed us the diagnosis of anti phospholipid syndrome. Early diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome in patients with HIV infection is important, because it can have serious implications for the prognosis.","2841":"The antiphospholipid syndrome is defined by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent thrombosis, affecting the venous system more frequently than the arterial one. Renal involvement is only observed in approximately 20-25% of cases, main renal artery thrombosis has been exceptionally described. We report a 39-year-old woman with previous history of recurrent thrombosis diagnosed as primary antiphospholipid syndrome, who presented malignant hypertension in the context of a renal artery thrombosis. She had a high IgG anticardiolipin antibody titre and positive lupus anticoagulant. An isotopic renogram demonstrated asymmetrical activity (60% right vs 40% left kidney). Renal arteriography demonstrated preoclusive thrombosis in the left renal artery. Blood pressure was well controlled by the use of ACE-inhibitor and alpha blockers.","2842":"A 43-year-old female with Staphyloccocus-induced perianal abscess, was admitted to hospital because of a clinical picture of acute renal failure and thrombotic microangiopathy. Schistocytes, thrombopenia, a negative Coombs test and no detectable plasma haptoglobin were diagnostic for thrombotic microangiopathy. Antibiotics, surgical drainage, plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma were given with a favourable evolution. We review the prognostic factors determining recovery of renal function and hematological abnormalities.","2843":"We report the case of a 37-years-old woman with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome due to an attack of acute porphyria. The patient was admitted to our hospital for abdominal pain, sleepiness and pink urine. Family and personal history were normal. Seven days before the admission the patient had a laparoscopy operation for endometriosis in her left ovary. The patient had had two normal pregnancies. The physical examination was normal, the skin turgor was good and no edema was present, the blood pressure was 140\/90 mmHg. Her serum sodium was 114 mEq\/L, serum osmolality 243 mOsm\/kg, urine sodium 146 mEq\/L and urine osmolality 457 mOsm\/kg. Values from laboratory examination revealed a normal peripheral haematogram, a normal kidney function, normal liver, adrenal and thyroid function. The urine tested for amino-levulinic acid, coproporphyrin and uroporphyrin was strongly positive. These findings are compatible with Porphyria Variegata or Coproporphyria Hereditary. A diagnosis of Porphyria acute with SIADH was made, and water fluid restriction, i.v. hypertonic saline infusion and furosemide to correct the hyponatremia was begun. In 1966, lesions of the median eminence of the hypothalamus and both hypothalamic -hypophyseal tracts were described in a patient with Porphyria acute intermittent and SIADH. It was suggested that SIADH occurred because of damage to these areas of the brain from excessive exposure to porphyrins.","2844":"Hypertensive crises are situations when arterial hypertension shows its immediate damaging potential, and in such circumstance, antihypertensive therapy provides its life-saving effectiveness. Among these situations are hypertensive emergencies, hypertensive urgencies, hypertensive encephalopathy, and also accelerated-malignant hypertension characterised by the presence of grade 3 or grade 4 Keith-Wagener retinopathy and numerous complications (acute renal failure, heart failure, haemorrhagic brain stroke or acute coronary events). Despite of antihypertensive therapy, the mortality rate of accelerated-malignant hypertension is about 25% after the 5th year. We present the case of a thirty-three years old male, with a five-year history of non-treated hypertension, who develops accelerated- hypertension with heart failure, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and renal failure that requires renal replacement therapy. After a strict control of blood pressure; initially using parenteral agents such as Solinitrin and Urapidil, followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers and Hydralazine, the patient partially recovers his renal function, resulting in the withdrawal of haemodialysis.","2845":"A 32-year-old male patient was admitted at our department presenting microhematuria and full nephrotic syndrome in April 1995. A percutaneous kidney biopsy showed a stage I-lI membranous nephropathy and an eight-week course with oral prednisone was initiated without response. Then, oral cyclosporine A (3.5 mg\/kg\/day) was given and after 5 weeks of treatment, remission of the nephrotic syndrome was observed but creatinine raised to 1.6 mg\/dl, normalizing after reducing the dose of cyclosporine A. We discuss the settings, prognostic and therapeutic alternatives for idiopathic membranous nephropathy.","2846":"We present a case of Gitelman's Syndrome in a 20 year-old woman who came to our service with weakness, asthenia, leg cramps and tetany. Laboratory studies revealed metabolic alkalosis with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and low calcium in a 24-hour urine test. The diagnosis of this syndrome is made in some cases during adult life because this syndrome is asymptomatic over several years. Gitelman's Syndrome is autosomal recessive as is Bartter's Syndrome. The gene is located in chromosome 16q, which encodes the cotransporter Na\/Cl sensitive to thiazide in the distal convoluted tubule. The defect of cotransporter produces an alteration of sodium reabsorption that causes electrolytic disorders typical of this Syndrome and different from Bartter's Syndrome. The typical electrolytic alterations are hypocalciuria and hypomagnesemia secondary to high urinary magnesium excretion. The prognosis of this syndrome is excellent and treatment consists in correction of serum electrolytes with oral administration of magnesium and potassium. In spite of this treatment, in some cases it is very difficult to reach normal serum levels of magnesium because of the high doses of oral magnesium, which produce common crises of diarrhea that increase magnesium gastrointestinal losses.","2847":"A 46-year-old male, smoker of half a packet a day and an alcohol intake of 80 grams a day, with an unremarkable medical history, was referred to our service in the year 1988 for a study of nephrotic syndrome. He presented normal renal function, without either microhematuria nor hypertension. In blood analysis an albuminemia of 10 g\/l and proteinuria of 22 g\/d was observed. A first renal biopsy was carried out which indicated minimal change disease. Steroid treatment was started, as a result the nephrotic syndrome disappeared and the blood analysis normalized. Later he had 4 new outbreaks, all of them steroid-responsive. In 1992 a second renal biopsy was performed after the fourth outbreak and the presence of mild renal failure, that this time indicated a IgA nephropathy. Steroid treatment was tried again, and this time cyclophosphamide was added to try to reduce steroid doses. This result in normalization of renal function and decrease of proteinuria to 2 g\/d. The patient remained stable until 1996 when the fifth outbreak occurred, again with mild renal failure and proteinuria in nephrotic range. Therefore a third renal biopsy was performed, that confirmed the presence of IgA nephropathy, but now with signs of histological progression of the disease. Following this, he presented five outbreaks in 3 years, all of them steroid-responsive, with decrease of proteinuria although without renal function normalization. In the year 2000, at his tenth outbreak of nephrotic syndrome it was decided to add cyclosporine to the steroid treatment, achieving the stability of the patient, without further outbreaks until now, with proteinuria of 1.6 g\/d and C. creat. 59 ml\/min.","2848":"Vasculitis is diagnosed with increasing frequency in the elderly. We hereby present the case of an 84-year-old male, who had weight loss, low-degree fever, anemia and epigastric pain. After 14 days of study with the tentative diagnosis of digestive neoplasia, a progressive renal insufficiency was detected. This clinical picture was secondary to ANCA-positive vasculitis. The case poses the differential diagnosis of non-oliguric acute renal failure (FRA) in elder people and the systematics of the study of renal insufficiency in individuals with previously unknown renal function. Also, this patient's history emphasizes the importance of acute deterioration of renal function as a guiding symptom for orienting the interpretation of clinical data. In the present case, a diagnostic hypothesis based only in the pursue of an occult digestive tumor misguided the attention from the main cause of the disease.","2849":"From 1 to 3% of acute renal failures are due to acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Most of them are due to drugs. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, penicillins and sulfonamides are the most frequently reported. Clinical presentation of drug-induced AIN has changed over time and with the use of new drugs. In fact actually the classic triad of fever, rash and eosinophilia is uncommon. Omeprazole is a drug widely used in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease. Serious side effects are rare with this drug, but despite of its safety we can see serious adverse effects such as acute renal failure. We describe two cases of acute interstitial nephritis after use of omeprazole and a review of all the cases published in the last years.","2850":"Hemoglobin and myoglobin heme pigments and iron have acute and chronic nephrotoxic effects, which are often associated with massive hemolysis and rhabdomyolysis. We report a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phenotype who developed an acute renal failure after a severe haemolytic crisis. There was not evidence of renal vascular pathology, urinary tract obstruction or prerenal factors. Renal biopsy showed features of acute tubular necrosis, with extended iron deposits in tubule cell cytoplasm and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and atrophy. The patient was oliguric requiring hemodialisys during three weeks, recovering renal function on the fourth week after admission. This case underlines the nephrotoxic role of heme pigment and iron, and possible pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in acute and chronic toxicity of both agents are reviewed.","2851":"The acute renal failure is a grave pathology, of rapid establishment and relatively frequent in the hospital environment. We can describe three etiological groupS, which are responsible for it, amongst which are emphasized the pre-renal reasons. The obstructive pathology, of minor incidence, increases with the age. It is described the case of a 67-yr-old patient who was admitted in the Nephrology Service because of abrupt decline of the renal function. Among the initial symptoms, he presented arterial hypertension (190\/90) and preserved diuresis. Blood analysis: urea 199 mg\/dl, creatinine 7.7 mg\/dl, without proteinuria. Sonography reported a bilateral ureteral hydronephrosis with simple cyst of possible ischemic origin. In view of the absence of previous biochemical data of renal failure, we considered possible reasons which start with an acute pattern. In initial evaluation, pre-renal etiology was not seen (high blood pressure, right cardiac systole function). The absence of prostatic syndrome and sonography discovery did not justify a diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction. Finally, abdominal-pelvic scan showed a periaortic retroperitoneal mass which included both ureters and appeared to trigger the obstruction. Combined efforts were pursued with the Urology Service, which implanted a bilateral \"double J\" catheter and later operated surgically on the patient, carrying out an alternating ureterolysis of both ureters. The biopsy manifested a retroperitoneal fibrosis, and the renogram showed a residual renal function of 20% in the right kidney and 80% in the left kidney. Due to the failure of the previous measures and as a last therapeutic recourse when one year had passed from the diagnosis, a continuous regimen with tamoxifen (anti-estrogen drug) in dose of 20 mg\/dl each 12 hours was started, which began a progressive remission in the size of the observed mass by scan (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR). The treatment was completed during 12 months and in this time, the levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were reduced gradually too. Finally, at the end of the treatment, the magnetic resonance demonstrate the complete disappearance of the fibrosis.","2852":"Several cases of glomerular disease have been associated to thyroid diseases. The most frequent lesion described is membranous glomerulopathy, presented as a nephrotic syndrome. Here we report a 67-year-old man who developed a nephrotic syndrome accompanied by rapid derangement of renal function shortly after the onset of a primary hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis. High titers of circulating anti-thyroglobulin and anti-microsomal thyroid antigen antibodies were detected. Serum levels of C3 and C4 fractions of complement were markedly decreased. Renal biopsy showed a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with severe mesangial proliferation, a type of glomerular involvement non-described previously in the literature, in relation with thyroid diseases. Four boluses of intravenous steroids were administered, followed by oral prednisone for three months. A dramatic recovery of renal function, together with normalization of urinary sediment, proteinuria decrease and normalization of serum complement were observed. Three years later, the patient suffered from a similar event, with a positive response to steroids again. One year later, the patient had a new recurrence and was treated with mycophenolate mofetil , improving his clinical situation.","2853":"Traditionally, the treatment of viral hepatitis C (positive Polymerase Chain Reaction -PCR-) was with Interferon. A combination of Interferon plus Ribavirin has been producing better results in last years. Currently, Ribavirin is not indicated for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease because of a high risk of severe anaemia. In a few cases, this treatment is producing good results with previous dose adjustment. We show a case of a 28-year-old man with Chronic Kidney Disease on treatment with periodical hemodialysis and chronic hepatopathy HCV Positive RNA HCV (&gt; 1,000,000 copies\/ml) and persistent transaminase elevation. Before kidney transplantation, we decided to use Interferon (3,000,000 IU\/48 hours) and Ribavirin (200 mg\/24 hours) treatment. After 15 days, we saw normal transaminase values and HCV RNA was negative. The patient required temporary suspension of Ribavirin and two red blood cell transfusions due to severe anaemia. Ribavirin was reintroduced 200 mg\/48 h posthemodialysis. The patient did not present any complication again, and could be treated for 14 months. After next 11 months of evolution the patient has normal rates of liver function and negative HCV RNA values.","2854":"We present a patient with end-stage renal disease on maintenace hemodialysis through a permanent catheter (Permcath) on the right subclavian vein. One month after the catheter placement the patient exhibited a superior vena cava syndrome due to a pericatheter thrombosis. The patient was initially managed with anticoagulation with early clinical improvement. Nevertheless, the reappearance of the symptoms forced the removal of the catheter and percutaneous angioplasty of the superior vena cava. After those measures and anticoagulation with coumarin the patient remains stable with complete clinical resolution and angiographical improvement.","2855":"We describe a clinical case of two patients who received a cadaveric renal graft from the same donor in a multi-organ extraction procedure. The donor was a 39-years-old woman who died of intracranial tumour. A benign ganglioma was shown in biopsy. The two recipients received the same immunosuppressive regimen. Induction comprised cyclosporin A, steroids and basiliximab while cyclosporin A and steroids were used in maintenance immunosuppression. The A patient was a 53-year-old woman with chronic renal failure due to chronic pyelonephritis. She had been undergoing periodic haemodialysis for five years. She was hospitalised for sciatic pain refractory to rest and analgesics 35 days after transplantation. Two days later, her graft function deteriorated. Ultrasonography ruled out a urinary tract obstruction. Cyclosporine levels was normal. It was interpreted as an acute rejection episode and was treated with boluses of methylprednisolone (500 mg for 3 days). At the same time, her right leg began to show paraesthesia, coldness and a decreased arterial pulse. A spinal magnetic nuclear resonance was performed. It showed an aneurysm of right common iliac artery (fig. 1). An arteriography confirmed the existence of a pseudoaneurysm and an arteriovenous fistula to inferior vena cava (fig. 2). The B recipient was a 56-year-old woman with chronic renal failure due to chronic pyelonephritis. She required haemodialysis for two years. In the 4th month after transplantation her graft function deteriorated. Graft biopsy did not show acute cellular rejection, so she was kept on immunosuppressive treatment. A second graft biopsy was taken and no changes with the previous one was observed. Renal function deteriorated and haemodialysis was required. During the 6th month she began to show paraesthesia, coldness and decreased arterial pulse in her right leg. Ultrasonography showed pyelocaliectasis with an adjacent solid-liquid mass, abdominal CT scan confirmed. Arteriography proved the presence of a pseudoaneurysm of the right common iliac artery (fig. 3). Transplantectomy and pseudoaneurysm resection was performed in the two cases. Culture analysis revealed fungi identified as Aspergillus in both pseudoaneurysms. Medical treatment was started immediately with liposomal amphotericin B. The clinical evolution of the two recipients were different. While recipient A died, B patient recovered, requiring haemodialysis.","2856":"This is the case of a 32-year-old male patient, diagnosed with end stage renal disease secondary to a focal and segmental glomerulonephritis. After four years of haemodialysis, he received a renal graft from a cadaveric donor. During the following sixteen years, he developped many different complications. In the early post-transplant period, he developed a severe acute tubular necrosis and two episodes of acute rejection took place, both of them with later recovery. Among the outstanding infectious complications were a virus herpes zoster dorsal infection and a Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial pneumonia. Twelve months later, a series of severe digestive complications took place: cholecystitis that required cholecystectomy, pancreatic pseudocyst which required laparotomy because of an abdominal complication, two separate episodes of upper digestive bleeding that finally required gastric surgery, and an hemorrhagic subphrenic abscess that required a second laparotomy. Currently he has developed a calcified chronic pancreatitis. Moreover, metabolic complications must be mentioned carbohydrate intolerance, cataracts and an avascular bone necrosis, all of them closely related to the immunosuppressive therapy. In spite of these multiple complications, he mantains a good renal function and his quality of life is acceptable.","2857":"The patient was a 55 year-old-woman with chronic renal failure due to idiopathic mesngial deposition of Ig A. She received a second allograft of a kidney from a cadaver. Results of a preoperative serologic Ig G tests for EBV and CMV were positive. She was given triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy, consisting of cyclosporine,azathioprine, and steroids. Seven years later, azathioprine was changed to mycophenolate mofetil. One year later, she was admitted to the hospital with a three to four week history of vertigo (which did not improve after sulpiride was administrated) and an influenza-like syndrome. A CT scan of the brain appeared normal, so paroxysmal positional vertigo was the diagnosis. Two weeks after admission to the hospital, the patient reported visual hallucinations and impairment of consciousness. Results of laboratory tests were leukocyte increase (polymorphonuclear leukocytes), anemia, hyponatremia and renal failure. Chest radiography, brain CT, and electroencephalography revealed no pathologic signs. The CSF examination revealed 300 cells\/ml (79% PMNL), glucose 63 mg\/dl, protein 45 mg\/dl. Six hours later the treatment was initiated with ampicillin, ceftriaxone and ganciclovir iv, she experienced seizures that affected the left side of her body, but without interictal recovery. The patient required intubation and mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. An MRI of the brain images, revealed high signal-intensity regions indicating lesions on the bulb, protuberance, mesencephalon, left thalamus and parenchyma adjacent to the corpus callosum (fig. 1). Six days later, the patient partially recovered consciousness, and she had not neurologic sequelae. Intubation was terminated. As soon as PCR revealed EBV DNA in CSF samples, the treatment with ceftriaxone and ampicillin was discontinued. Treatment with ganciclovir was maintained for 8 weeks (4 weeks with iv and another 4 weeks with oral treatment). On day 35, the examination of a specimen of CSF revealed: glucose 46, protein 78, 15 cells\/ml (100% lymphocytes). The patient went home on day 55 after admission to our hospital. She regained her normal neurologic function. Three weeks later MRI, showed reduction of the size of the lesions and the lesions on the brain stem had disappeared.","2858":"Aspergillus infection is a rare but devastating complication following organ transplantation with high mortality rate. Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis. This fungus is present in the environment worldwide. Aspergillus infection is mainly acquired by inhalation of spores and several nosocomial infections in transplant recipient have been associated with construction work at hospitals. Risk factors for invasive aspergillosis include administration of steroid boluses, history of cytomegalovirus infection, neutropenia and prolonged antibiotic use after transplantation. Successful treatment depends on three factors: early diagnosis, aggressive antifungal therapy and decrease or removal of immunosuppression. Amphotericin deoxycholate has been the standard treatment for many years but lipid preparations for amphotericin are now used due to their significantly fewer adverse effects. A number of new antifungal drugs are now being developed including new azoles such as voriconazol and echinocandin. Invasive aspergillosis has a high mortality rate more than 95% when cerebral dissemination is demonstrated. We report the case of a 47 years old woman who received a cadaveric renal graft and developed pulmonary aspergillosis with fulminant cerebral dissemination two months later. The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis was by culture isolation obtained from bronchioalveolar lavage. Removal of immunosuppresive agents and liposomal amphotericin B therapy were started shortly after admission. Brain CT scan performed on the 12th day showed cerebral dissemination. The recipient died two days later. Our patient had several risk factors such as the administration of steroid boluses and cytomegalovirus infection. Invasive aspergillosis must be always included in the differential diagnosis of fever and pulmonary disease in the renal transplant recipient.","2859":"Calcineurin inhibitors are one of the most common drugs used for prevention of acute rejection in recipients of renal allografts. New immunosuppressors have reduced the incidence of acute renal allograft rejection. There have been numerous recent attempts to develop alternative patterns of immunosuppressors for prevention of chronic renal allograft failure, and enhancing its survival. We described a patient who developed numerous complications after the initial postransplant period. He was treated with a calcineurin inhibitors-free immunosuppression in order to avoid nephrotoxicity, but had over 30 ng\/ml of sirolimus. Renal function was impaired after cyclosponne withdrawal. Sirolimus was used in association with mycofenolate mofetil and prednisone.","2860":"Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug which has proved its effectivity to reduce the incidence of acute rejection in renal transplantation receptors. As this drug lacks nephrotoxic effects, its simultaneous use with other anticalcineurinic drugs allows the use of reduced doses. Thrombocytopenia and hyperlipidemia are the best known side-effects of sirolimus administration. Alterations in hepatic biochemistry results are also common. Some instances of interstitial pneumonitis associated to its use have been recently reported. In this paper we present a clinical case related to this rare but already confirmed adverse side-effect, which apart from the other more common nosologies occurring in immunosuppressed patients, should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis in patients who are being administered this drug.","2861":"Among the numeruos adverse side effects of tacrolimus (TAC), de novo thrombotic microangiopathy stands out as an infrecuente but severe complication. Renal dysfunction is the only alteration that should lead to suspicion of thrombotic microangiopathy, because the clinical features of intravascular hemolysis are not always found. The definitive diagnosis can usually be made with kidney biopsy. Patientes with TAC induced thrombotic microangiopathy usually promptly recover after treatment withdrawal or reduction in the dose of TAC and a short course of plasma therapy, but the risk of rejection increases. Switching from TAC to cyclosporine has also been tried with resolution of the hemolysis but thrombotic microangiopathy has been noted with both and this condition may later recur. We present a 29-year-old man who received a kidney-pancreas transplant for end-stage diabetic nephropathy. After initial induction with basiliximab, the immunosuppression consisted of prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Twenty four days posttransplantation his renal function declined with a peak creatine level of 2.35 mg\/dl. Laboratory studies showed thrombocytopenia and features of intravascular hemolysis. TAC associated hemolytic uremic syndrome was suspected and drug was immediately stopped and converted to sirolimus. Also he was treated with plasma infusion. The allograft biopsy showed focal glomerular and arteriolar acute thrombosis without evidence of rejection. Our experience demostrate that switching from tacrolimus to sirolimus could be an adecuate strategy for patients who develop FK506-associated de novo thrombotic microangiopathy without increase risk of acute rejection.","2862":"","2863":"The viric infections influence morbi-mortality in Chronic kidney Disease patients in hemodialysis therapy and can affect to the Staff of the Units.

The patient became pregnant on hemodialysis, concluding the pregnancy successfully. The evolution and management of pregnancy were described and the related literature was revised. We concluded that, although pregnancy on hemodialysis and\/or systemic lupus erythematosus patients involves a high risk for the mother and the fetus that makes advisable contraception, an increase in success in pregnancies in systemic lupus erythematosus patients on remission during the previous months, has been recently observed. Moreover, the increase of frequency and duration of hemodialysis sessions, has improved the neonatal survival around the 50% in pregnancies on dialysis. We emphasize the difficulty to maintain the mother's hemoglobin at an adequate target, as well as the high frequency of fetal prematury.","2873":"","2874":"Daily dialysis have showed excellent results because a higher frequency of dialysis is more physiological and it decreases the fluctuation of liquid, solutes and electrolytes. Improvement of certain causes of anorexia such as postdialysis fatigue, reduction in fluid overload, uremic milieu, medium and large-sized molecule removal could be observed with daily dialysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate nutritional parameters when thrice weekly on-line hemodiafiltration (OL-HDF) were switched to daily OL-HDF. 24 patients have been studied. Eight patients, 6 males and 2 females, mean age of 65.9 +\/- 14 years, on thrice weekly 4 to 5 hours OL-HDF were switched to 2 to 2.5 hours six times per week. Dialysis parameters were the same in both periods and only frequency and dialysis time were changed. Other sixteen patients, mean age of 68.4 +\/- 14 years, were a control group which dialysis parameters were maintained. Clinical and biochemical outcome were carried out over twelve months.

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of darbepoetin alfa given once every other week as treatment of anemia in predialysis patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) previously treated with once-weekly epoetin alfa. A total of 42 CRF patients were included, all of whom had previously been treated with epoetin alfa and showed stable hemoglobin (Hb) levels without dose changes during the last 8 weeks prior to enrolment in this study. All patients received s.c. darbepoetin alfa once every other week at doses calculated from the protein mass equivalence between rHuEPO and darbepoetin alfa. Follow-up lasted for 24 weeks. Dose adjustments were conducted to preserve target Hb levels between 11 and 13 g\/dl. Thirty-nine patients completed the 24 weeks of study. Hb levels increased during follow-up [mean values of 0.39 (p &lt; 0.002), 0.58) (p &lt; 0.001), and 0.83 g\/dl (p &lt; 0.001) at 8, 16 and 24 weeks, respectively] despite reducing the darbepoetin alfa dose up to 15% at 24 weeks [from 0.192 microg\/kg body weight to 0.185, 0.178 and 0.163 at 8, 16, and 24 weeks, respectively (p &lt; 0.001)].

In conclusion, these results show s.c. administration of darbepoetin alfa once every other week was superior to weekly epoetin alfa as a maintenance treatment for anemia in predialysis CRF patients, since the former provided higher Hb levels. Moreover, darbepoetin alfa administration was safe in these patients.","2876":"To determine factors which may predict mortality in patients admitted to intensive care unit who present acute renal failure.

The inclusion criteria were a creatinine plasmatic value &gt; or = 2 mg\/dl (177 micromol\/l) or an increase (30% or higher) of its basal value on admittance. One hundred and twenty-seven patients (age = 65.83 +\/- 15.06 years; 38% male) with acute renal failure, were prospectively enrolled in the study (13% of intensive care unit admissions). The univariate analysis showed that hospital origin, acute tubular necrosis, late ARF, oliguria, maintained hypotension, sedation or coma, oncological disease and need of mechanical ventilation were significantly associated with mortality (p &lt; 0.05). This association was also found for sepsis (OR: 41.5), multiorganic failure (OR: 3.58) and respiratory, cardiovascular or haematological failure according to the SOFA score. The multivariate analysis found that four clinical variables had an independent predictive value for mortality risk: acute tubular necrosis [OR: 4.57 (2.32-9.00)], use of vasoactive drugs [OR: 2.32 (1.22-4.40)], oliguria [OR: 2.15 (1.12-4.13)] and the acute renal failure starting during admission [OR: 2.06 (1.09-3.88)].

Perforin and granzyme B can be used as activation markers for cytotoxic cells in allograft tissue. The aim of the study was to determine the immunoexpression of perforin and granzyme B by immune cells infiltrating renal tissue during acute allograft rejection and to evaluate any correlation between the phenotype of infiltrating lymphocytes and cells expressing cytotoxic granules as well as the severity of graft damage as defined by Banff 97 criteria. Immunoperoxidase staining was carried out using monoclonal antibodies anti-perforin, -granzyme B, -CD3 and -CD8 on renal allograft biopsy specimens from twenty one patients with acute renal transplant rejection: Banff 97 IA (n = 11) and Banff 97 IB (n = 10). As a control 11 biopsy specimens of renal transplant patient without any signs of rejection were used. All allograft biopsy specimens with acute renal transplant rejection contained a high number of CD3+ T cells (Banff IA: 437.4 +\/- 154.4 and Banff IB: 825 +\/- 339.9 vs 123.4 +\/- 52.5 in controls) and CD8+ T lymphocytes (Banff 97 IA: 177.6 +\/- 89.2 and Banff IB: 293.2 +\/- 112.4 vs 64.2 +\/- 37.1 in controls). Immunostaining for granzyme B and perforin was negative in controls. The immunopositivity for perforin was similar in Banff IA and Banff IB acute allograft rejection (1.5 +\/- 0.6 vs 1.8 +\/- 0.8, respectively). Granzyme B+ cell count was significantly higher in severe rejection group Banff IB (128.3 +\/- 74.3) than in Banff IA group (48.2 +\/- 18.3). Moreover, in acute allograft rejection Banff IB the number of granzyme B+ cells and perforin+ cells was correlated with the number of CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that in acute tubulointerstitial allograft rejection activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes play a major role. The strong immunopositivity for granzyme B on infiltrating cells in renal transplant tissue is suggested as a marker of severity of graft damage.","2889":"In view of the increasing interest in measuring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and that is widely accepted Quality of life (QL) is a valid marker of results of treatment in chronic dialysis, we marked the aim to determine QL of the patients &gt; or = 75 years in chronic haemodialysis and to determine the influence of different factors (comorbidity, analytical, cognitive deterioration, depression and self-sufficiency) over the results. We used the Kidney Disease Quality of Life (KDQOL-SF), questionnaire of health that has been become an useful instrument for measuring CV into this population. Demographic and analytical data, comorbidity (Charlson Index), depression (Yesavage), self-sufficiency (Karnofsky) and impaired cognitive function (Cognitive Mini-Exam) were collected. We evaluated the influence of these factors on the different dimensions of the KDQOI-SF and compared our scores with general Spanish population scores standardised according to age and sex. We included 51 patients (24 men) with a mean age 79.5 +\/- 3.7 years and 39 +\/- 56 months in dialysis. Women had lower scores than men in all scales of KDQOL-SF. We found that months in dialysis, depression scale, Karnofsky scale and cognitive deterioration test were also influencing about these scores. Multivariate analysis showed that CV is especially associated with sex, depression, cognitive deterioration and self-sufficiency. After we calculated standardised scores according to age and gender, out population showed a level of CV lower than general population, especially in female gender. In our population the women had worse CV than men. The CV of the elders in HD is lower than general population of equal sex and age and it was not modified with factors related to the end-stage renal disease and its treatment. Suffering from cognitive deterioration or depression had an important impact on the well-being of our patients, which would justify a wider diagnostic and therapeutic boarding in these patients.

Comparing HDs performed with low bicarbonate (B and D) respect to current buffer formulations (A and C), total P removal was 997.3 (+\/- 237.3) vs 882 (+\/- 216.1) mg (p NS). No differences were found by grouping the sessions according to glucose concentration. There were no significant differences in total phosphate removal between the two different S or Qd. The most important predictive factor of total P removal was the initial P and 2 hours serum P concentration, and PTH concentration. i) Removal of P is better predicted by pre-dialysis P serum concentration; ii) P removal was not affected by the changes in bicarbonate and glucose concentration in the dialysate; iii) the increase of the dialyzer area between 2 and 2.6 m2 augments Kt\/V, but without influencing P elimination; iv) a higher Qd does not determine significant differences in P removal and v) higher PTH is associated with a higher P elimination. ","2891":"The rate of decline of renal function (RDRF) in the pre-end stage renal disease setting (pre-ESRD) is highly variable. Several factors have been involved as potential modifiers of renal failure progression. This retrospective study attempts to establish which were the main determinants of the RDRF in pre-ESRD patients followed in the predialysis consult. The study group consisted of 230 patients with pre-ESRD not yet on dialysis who were referred to the predialysis consult from January 1998 to July 2002. The mean follow-up time per patient was 356 days. RDRF was assessed as delta of the average of creatinine and urea clearances (CrCl-UCl). Data obtained at time of referral to the predialysis consult were analyzed as potential predictors of the subsequent RDRF. These independent variables included: demographics, comorbid conditions, main hematological and biochemical data, antihypertensive and statin treatment, mean blood pressure, and CrCl-UCl at time of referral. The predictors of delta CrCl-UCl were determined by multiple linear regression analysis. The determinants of the survival without dialysis were established by the Cox regression hazard model, adjusted to renal function at time of referral. Mean CrCl-UCl at time of referral was 10.98 +\/- 2.58 ml\/min\/1.73 m2, and mean delta CrCl-UCl was -0.37 +\/- 0.46 ml\/min\/1.73 m2\/month. Patients with diabetic nephropathy and chronic glomerulonephritis had the fastest RDRF, while patients with ischemic nephropathy and chronic interstitial nephritis had the slowest RDRF. Seventy-five patients (46%) required EPO therapy. The best determinants of delta CrCl-UCl were: the 24-hour proteinuria (p &lt; 0.0001), and the hematocrit at time of referral (p = 0.0024). The best determinants of the survival rate without dialysis during the study period were: the proteinuria (in g\/24 hours) (R 1, 16; p &lt; 0.0001), the hematocrit at time of referral (OR: 0.88; p &lt; 0.0001), the treatment with EPO (OR: 0.59; p = 0.02), and the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.59; p = 0.01).

In the year 2002 we have controlled the delivered dialysis in our unit with the Diascan Kt\/V. The aim of the present study was to study the agreement between de Diascan Kt\/V and the Lowrie Kt\/V. During the year 2002, 63 patients have been dialyzed in monitors with Diascan equipment. We calculated the V of each patient by dividing the Kt Diascan between the Lowrie Kt\/V in the same dialysis session. The mea of the two consecutive measurements was considered the V value. Throughout the year 2002, 7 agreement studies were realized. The inter-method variability was assessed by the relative difference (absolute difference Diascan Kt\/V-Lowrie Kt\/V, divided by the average of both tests). A good agreement was considered when the relative difference was equal or lower than 10%. In the 7 agreement studies realized, the mean of the relative difference oscilled between 5.2 and 6.6%, and the percentage of patients with a relative difference equal or lower than 10% oscilled between 83 and 91%. During a month, the Diascan Kt\/V was controlled in all dialysis sessions in 41 patients (554 sessions in total). Failure in the lecture of Kt\/V Diascan was observed in 41 sessions (7%). A Diascan Kt\/V greater than 1 (the minimum delivered dialysis considered in our unit) was obtained in 93% of the valid sessions. 38 of 41 patients had a mean monthly Diascan Kt\/V greater than 1.

The data pertaining to Spain--Sp--refers to 575 patients and their comparison with those of the Euro-DOPPS countries--Eu--(Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and Spain), which encompass 3,038 patients, represent the formal goal of this paper. Diabetes mellitus, at 21.5% in Eu and 21.7% in Sp, was the most common cause of renal insufficiency in dialysis and coronariopathy, as a concomitant disease, was present in 67.8% in Eu as opposed to 75.8% in Sp. Differences were observed in the incident of hypertension (73.4% in Eu vs 77.4% in Sp), hepatitis C (11.6% vs 19.5%), depression (12.7 vs 16.2%) and left ventricular hypertrophy (54.9% vs 62.3%). The patterns of vascular access were similar (79% vs 81% AV fistulas in Eu and Sp, and 10% synthetic grafts for both) and the mean applied dose of dialysis--Kt\/V--smaller (1.19) in Sp than in Eu (1.24); likewise the duration of the dialysis (in minutes) was shorter (234 in Eu vs 217 in Sp) and the % of synthetic membranes used was smaller (60% in Eu vs 52% in Sp). There were no differences between the groups in the figures for urea, creatinine, albumin, nPCR, calcium, phosphate or PTH. There were also no differences in the mean values of Hb (10.7 for Eu vs 10.8 for Sp), given that the values of ferritin were noticeably lower in Sp (288 vs 355) and the dose of EPO\/kg\/week was higher to in Sp (115 vs 102); s.c. route was used in similar proportions (69% in Eu vs 67% in Sp).

Vascular damage was evaluated by measurement of thickening of Intimal\/Media complex (TI\/MC) in carotid artery by ecco doppler ultrasonography and by the presence of microalbuminuria. IR was estimated by the calculation of the HOMA index of IR. A prevalence of MS of 62% was found and MS was statistically significant associated to vascular damage (p = 0.000). Fifty seven percent of the hypertensive patients who had MS had hypertrigliceridemia which was also related to vascular damage. The prevalence of microalbuminuria (MA) in this population of hypertensive patients was 28% and the presence of MA was significantly associated to (TI\/MC) (p = 0000). The hypertensive patients who had vascular damage (a pathological value of TI\/MC and or MA) were more frequently males with higher BP, higher BMI (30.45 +\/- 4 vs 28.9 +\/- 4.3 p = 0.014), more elevated plasma insulin levels (37.38 +\/- 22 vs 24.86 +\/- 12 p = 0.000) and higher triglyceride levels (2.33 +\/- 1.29 vs 1.93 +\/- 1.08 p = 0.019). IR was found in 75% of the patients. In a multivariate logistic analysis the independent variables that define vascular damage in hypertensive patients were: Age (p = 0.05), male sex (p = 0.01), Systolic BP (p = 0.002) and IR (p = 0.001). In conclusion, MS is a frequent finding in hypertensive patients. The presence of MS of any of their components increase the vascular risk (TI\/MC of carotid artery and microalbuminuria). IR is a common finding in these patients and appears to be one of the most important markers of vascular risk.","2910":"Anti-basement membrane antibody mediated disease is an unfrequent entity but with a high mortality and morbidity. We present a revision of 32 patients diagnosed of anti-basement membrane antibody mediated disease between 1983 and 1997, and their evolution at one year of the diagnosis. The clinical pattern of presentation was as a Goodpasture's syndrome (glomerulonephritis and lung haemorrhage) in 15 patients and glomerulonephritis without lung involvement in 17. We reviewed retrospectively the features at the clinical presentation, the different treatments, and the delay of the starting of it since the beginning of the symptoms, in order to evaluate a prognosis dats of the disease. After the retrospective study we deduce that anti-basement membrane antibody mediated disease has a high mortality although the different regimes of treatment applied (25%), and the need of renal replacement therapy at one year of diagnosis is also high (70.8%). The renal survival at one year of the diagnosis is low and the response to therapy depends on the serum creatinine value at the diagnosis. The contribution of immunocompetent leucocytes to renal hypercellularity suggests that both humoral and cell-mediated immunity play a role in this disease.","2911":"","2912":"","2913":"","2914":"","2915":"","2916":"","2917":"","2918":"","2919":"","2920":"","2921":"","2922":"","2923":"","2924":"","2925":"","2926":"","2927":"","2928":"Loratadine is a second generation histamine H1 receptor antagonist, that has high potency antiallergic properties and is associated with low adverse effects compared with other antihistamines.

Although the number of drugs associated with acute intersticial nephritis is too large, the antihistaminic loratadine have never been reported before. We report a case of an interstitial nephritis with acute renal failure that suggesting hypersensitivity reaction in a 77 old man who had received loratadine (10 mg\/day) during ten days before his assessment to our hospital by disseminated pruritic syndrome.

Different methods have been described to calculate dialysis dose which take into consideration change in frequency. The aim of this study was to calculate all dialysis dose possibilities and evaluate the better and practical options. Eight patients, 6 males and 2 females, on standard 4 to 5 hours thrice weekly on-line hemodiafiltration (S-OL-HDF) were switched to daily on-line hemodiafiltration (D-OL-HDF) 2 to 2.5 hours six times per week. Dialysis parameters were identical during both periods and only frequency and dialysis time of each session were changed. Time average concentration (TAC), time average deviation (TAD), normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), Kt\/V, equilibrated Kt\/V (eKt\/V), equivalent renal urea clearance (EKR), standard Kt\/V (stdKt\/V), urea reduction ratio (URR), hemodialysis product and time off dialysis were measured. Daily on-line hemodiafiltration was well accepted and tolerated. Patients maintained the same TAC although TAD decreased from 9.7 +\/- 2 in baseline to a 6.2 +\/- 2 mg\/dl after six months, p &lt; 0.01. No significant changes were observed in weekly Kt\/V and eKt\/V throughout the study. However EKR, stdKt\/V and weekly URR were increased during D-OL-HDF in 24-34%, 46% and 50%, respectively. Hemodialysis product was raised in a 95% and time off dialysis was reduced to half. Dialysis frequency is an important urea kinetic parameter which there are to take in consideration. It's necessary to use EKR, stdKt\/V or weekly URR to calculate dialysis dose for an adequate comparison between different frequency dialysis schedules. ","2931":"Vascular access through a venous catheter for haemodialysis is associated with increased risk of thrombosis, central venous stenosis, short access survival and inadequate dialysis. The most important catheter-related complications, which determine method survival, are infection and dysfunction. In particular, infectious episodes are in some studies the leading cause for untimely catheter removal and for catheter-related morbidity but also for morbidity in dialysis patients. Double-lumen central venous catheters used for haemodialysis, are common causes of septicaemia. Most cases are caused by staphylococci. Episodes of gram-negative bacteriemia have been traced to bacterial contamination of water and\/or dialysate, errors in dialyzer reprocessing, and improper setup procedures. In this paper, we describe and outbreak of gram-negative bacteremia, firstly E. cloacae, in an outpatients haemodialysis unit, in the patients with long-term tunnelled haemodialysis catheters. We describe the epidemic investigation that we achieved to identify the source of contaminating bacteria and the route by which bacteria gained access to the bloodstream. We prove the contamination by gram-negative bacterium of the water-distribution lines and haemodialysis machines. Moreover, E. cloacae strains isolated from the lines and machines are genotypically identical to the isolated from the patients. Also, we prove that the hands of health care personnel are unintentional carriers. The outbreak was finished when decontamination of dialysis machines was enhanced and dialyzer-priming fluid was modified.","2932":"The conventional intact PTH assays detect not only PTH 1-84 but also inactive fragments (as PTH 7-84) that accumulate in renal failure. There has been a recent development of a new PTH assay that measures only true 1-84 PTH (Whole PTH or CAP assay, Scantibodies). As 7-84 PTH fragment is antagonistic on bone effects of 1-84 PTH, Moniere-Faugere has suggested that 1-84\/7-84 PTH ratio less than 1 is predictive of low turnover. We evaluated the usefulness of CAP assay and the 1-84\/7-84 PTH ratio as markers of bone turnover in a groups of 24 patients in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Patients were classified as having low bone turn over if they had a Total PTH (similar to intact PTH) of less than 100 pg\/ml. We also measured serum CrossLaps (CTX) as another serum resorption marker. Patients had a mean Whole PTH of 95.5 pg\/ml and a mesan total PTH of 155.4 pg\/l (range 9 to 900). Whole PTH represented 69.1% of total PTH. Fifteen patients (62.5%) had a total PTH of less than 100. These patients had a 1-84\/7-84 relationship of 1.9 +\/- 1.8 while 9 patients with Total PTH more than 100 had a relationship of 1.29 +\/- 0.6 (p = NS). There was a tight correlation between Whole PTH and total PTH (r = 0.98; p &lt; 0.0001) and with serum CTX (r = 0.78; p &lt; 0.0001). We conclude that 1-84\/7-84 ratio does not seem useful in the prediction of low bone turnover and that Whole PTH does not seem to be more useful than intact PTH in the prediction of bone turnover in this population. Future studies should correlate this markers with direct measurements of bone turnover in bone biopsies to demonstrate their usefulness in the prediction of the type of renal osteodystrophy.","2933":"Amyloidosis is a disease resulting from extracellular deposition of fibrillar protein in various organs. AA amyloidosis may complicate chronic inflammatory diseases, chronic infections and another chronic diseases. We review 31 patients (13 males and 18 females) with biopsy proven renal or rectal AA amyloidosis, referred to out hospital between january 1999 and november 2002. Renal failure was defined as serum creatinine &gt; or = 1.5 mg\/dl. Mean age was 58.4 +\/- 15.7 years. The causes of AA amyloidosis were an underlying chronic rheumatologic disease (51.6%), chronic infection (41.9%) and a chronic inflammatory intestinal disorder (6.5%). Renal failure (RF) was detected in 20 patients (61.2%) and proteinuria and hematuria were found in 90.3% and 45.5 respectively. Proteinuria at diagnosis was 5.2 +\/- 3.9 g\/24 h and mean serum creatinine 3.5 +\/- 3.7 mg\/dl. Survival of patients without dialysis was 66.8 (51.1% RF, 90.9% non-RF) and 53.4% (38.2 RF, 77.9% non-RF) at 12 and 24 months respectively (p = 0.017). End-stage renal disease developed in 13 patients (41.9%). Ten patients were maintained on hemodialysis and 3 on CAD. Survival in dialysis at 6 and 12 months was 68.3% and 42.7% respectively. Fifteen patients died and the main causes of death were: infections (46.6) haemorrhagic complications (33.3%), cardiovascular events (13.3%) and cachexia (6.6%).","2934":"Chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) is the main cause of graft loss after the first year of transplantation, and renal biopsies show a predominance of fibrotic lesions. Human transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-beta 1) is the principal profibrogenetic cytokine which has been recently implicated in the development of CAN. Seven TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms have been recently described and some of them have been related to the development of several diseases. To analyse the relationship between TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms and the development of CAN in a group of renal transplant patients with a long-term follow-up. A restriction enzyme-based method for TGF-beta 1 genotyping was used to detect four TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms in codon 10, 25 and 5'-flanking region (-800 and -509 positions). A retrospective case-control study were performed on sixty renal transplant recipients with 8 years of post-transplant, 22 of them with CAN (cases) and 38 with normal graft function (controls). We studied 73 subjects to analyse the distribution of the genotypes in the area. The genotype frequencies were similar in the study and control group. The presence of chronic allograft nephropathy was statistically associated with the combination Pro\/Pro10 TT509 polymorphism in the TGF-beta 1 gene, and these patients develop chronic rejection more quickly than the rest of the patients. Chronic allograft nephropathy was also associated with delta age recipient-donor, with older donors being a significant risk factor for chronic nephropathy. The logistic regression analysis confirmed the independent role of TT509 Pro\/Pro10 TGF-beta 1 polymorphism with a Odd Ratio of 5.8 (1.14-29.7) in chronic nephropathy being the delta age recipient-donor a confounder factor but not an effect modifier. The rest of the TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms and the classic risk factors were not associated with the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. These data suggest a leading role for TGF-beta 1 gene polymorphisms (TT509 Pro\/Pro10) in the development of chronic allograft nephropathy. The identification of this genetic predisposition to chronic allograft rejection could play a decisive role in the prevention of this common pathology. ","2935":"The European Best Practice Guidelines for the Anaemia Management (EBPG) represents the main reference for the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). This study was developed two years after EBPG's publication in order to evaluate the impact of theses guidelines in the clinical practice. This is an epidemiological, multicentric and prospective study including patients on dialysis and erythropoietin treatment. The aetiology of CRF, prevalence and anaemia treatment, concurrent pathologies and side effects had been evaluated during follow-up. The inclusion period was june-august 2000. Patients were evaluated during six months. Two thousands six hundred and eighteen dialysis patients were recruited from different national centres (2,171 on haemodialysis and 447 on peritoneal dialysis). Fifty one percent of haemodialysis patients and forty one percent of patients on peritoneal dialysis started erythropoietin treatment with a basal haemoglobin &gt; 9 g\/dL (mean 8.9 g\/dL and 9.2 g\/dL, respectively). At baseline, 35% of patients had haemoglobin &lt; 11 g\/dL (mean 11.4 g\/dL), but at the study end, 21.2% had haemoglobin &lt; 11 g\/dL (mean 11.8 g\/dL). Seventy nine percent of patients were treated with erythropoietin using subcutaneous route: 27.5% with once a week regimen, 33.0% in two weekly doses and 39.5% in three weekly administrations. No differences in doses requirements were showed by administration route. These results seem to support that there already exists a good knowledge of the International Guidelines for the anaemia management, but there is still a gap between them and the results in the clinical setting. In general erythropoietin treatment starts late and at low haemoglobin levels. However, close monitoring of haemoglobin levels seems to improve patient's outcomes.","2936":"","2937":"","2938":"","2939":"","2940":"","2941":"","2942":"","2943":"","2944":"","2945":"","2946":"","2947":"","2948":"","2949":"","2950":"","2951":"","2952":"","2953":"","2954":"We report the case of a woman with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis and treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa) administered subcutaneously, who developed a pure red cell aplasia secondary to the development of neutralizing antibodies anti-erythropoietin after 8 months of treatment. Despite epoetin withdrawal and immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids and gammaglobulins the patient still has high red blood cell transfusion requirements and undetectable plasma erythropoietin levels. Pure red cell aplasia secondary to the development of neutralizing antibodies anti-erythropoietin is a rare but severe complication associated with the use of recombinant human erythropoietin in uremic patients. In recent years, the incidence of this complication has sharply increased, specially associated with the use of epoetin alfa administered subcutaneously. For this reason, the Spanish Drug Agency has recently contraindicated treating uremic patients with epoetin alfa administered subcutaneously.","2955":"Simple renal cysts are the most common renal masses, accounting for roughly 65 to 70% of cases. They most often occur in patients over the age of 50 as determined from post-mortem examination or renal ultrasonography. The major concern with simple renal cysts is differentiating them from more serious disorders, such as polycystic kidney disease and solid masses such as a renal carcinoma or abscess. Renal arteriovenous malformations may present with ultrasound picture mimicking simple parapelvic cyst. Ultrasound, doppler ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are effective in documenting the underlying lesions non-invasively. Arteriography may be useful to characterise vascular lesion. We report here the spectrum of cystic kidney disease in adulthood in a group of patient with different disorders. The differential diagnosis, complications and associated process are discussed.","2956":"Ischemic colitis is a well-recognized complication occurring in renal transplant recipients. It has often been associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) vasculitis. However, the diagnosis of this pathology in the absence of CMV suggests that other etiological factors might be involved.

The objective of this report is to describe the incidence, etiology, symptoms and treatment of Hf in a Dialysis Unit (defined as phosphorus &lt; 2.5 mg\/dL). In a retrospective study over a period of three years, we identified 22 cases of Hf, occurring on 11 among 149 patients. A two-groups distribution was made: Group A, patients with more than one episode (n = 3, 14 episodes of Hf) and Group B, patients with only one isolated episode of Hf (n = 8, 8 episodes of Hf). Plasma Ca, P, Albumin and nPCR were significant lower in group A (p &lt; 0.05). Only two patients of group B had symptoms. Cases of Hf were: Group A: low-protein diet and alcoholism, Group B: decreased dietary intake due to non-digestive problems (n = 2) or due to digestive problems plus antacids (n = 4), phos-phate binders (n = 1) and dietary phosphorus restriction (n = 1). Three patients had secondary hyperparathyroidism. Treatment consisted on oral supplementarion by diet and changes in oral calcium salts. Intravenous supplementation was required acutely to raise serum P in a patient with auricular fibrilation. Two group A patients who has plasma 1.25 vitamin D &lt; 5 pg\/mL received vitamin D, and the third oral supplements of P. In all the cases, Hf resolved with these measures. We concluded that Hf is not so infrequent in hemodialysis. In patients with low-protein diet and low vitamin D concentration, Hf can be sustained. On the other hand, a decreased dietary intake maintaining similar phosphate binder's supplementation is the most frequent cause of occasional and symptomatic Hf, even in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.","2958":"Mesothelial cells (MC) are the first peritoneal membrane barrier in contact with dialysate. The aim of this study was to analyze the in vitro capacity of different pharmacological agents to modify the ex vivo proliferation of MC obtained from the peritoneal effluent of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Thirty cultures of MC taken from nocturnal peritoneal effluent were performed. After identification, MC are subcultured in 24 multi-well plates, adding the different exogenous agents. Proliferative capacity and cell morphology were estimated on day 16th of culture. The agents evaluated were insulin, IGF-1, tamoxifen, labetalol, carvedilol, enalapril and losartan. Insulin shows a dose-dependent effect on MC growth, with a limit that is stimulated by the addition of fetal bovine serum (FBS). Concentrations higher than 100 micrograms\/ml, are not associated with further growth, even with cell damage. In contrast, the wide range of IGF-1 dose used did not affect to MC proliferation. Tamoxifen causes negative effects on MC growth just a very high doses, not resembling doses in clinical practice. Labetalol does not modify MC proliferation used under therapeutic calculated range. However, concentrations higher than 40 micrograms\/ml showed a negative influence on growth, behaving as lethal doses that over 100 micrograms\/ml. The addition of FBS attenuates this effect. These effects were very similar to that caused by carvedilol addition. Enalapril and losartan act as antiproliferative agents for MC. This effect is potentiated with angiotensin II, reaching lethal concentrations increasing the dose. In conclusion, mesothelial cell growth ex vivo taken from nocturnal peritoneal effluent on PD patients is an useful tool to explore the effects of any pharmacological agent on the biology of the cell of the peritoneum. The agents used had any influence in the proliferation capacity of mesothelial cells. ","2959":"We studied the influence of early vs late referral to nephrologist of patients with chronic renal failure over clinical situation at the onset of hemodialysis and outcome. From january 1994 to december 1998, 139 patients started hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease at the Hospital General de Albacete, all of them included in the study and clinical follow-up concluded in december 2001. Patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis were excluded. Early (ER) and late referral (LR) were defined by the time of first nephrology encounter greater than or less than 6 months respectively, before iniciation of hemodialysis. 106 patients (76.25%) were referred early; mean follow-up time 6.3 +\/- 4.5 years. 33 patients (23.74%) had late referral, follow-up time was less then six months, 18 patients were followed during less than 4 weeks. There were no differences in demographic data and comorbid conditions between LR and ER patients (age, cardiac and vascular disease, diabetes, neoplasia...). Mean plasma concentration of creatinine and urea was significantly greater, whereas hematocrit and albumin were less in the LRA than the ER group. Emergency dialysis through central vein catheterisation was more frequent in the LR group. Number of admissions and duration of hospital stay were higher in the LR group. No significant differences in nutrition, dialysis doses or anemia were found between the two groups after 6 and 12 months of hemodialysis. Long term outcome was similar in both groups: no significant differences were found in percentage of patients transplanted or deceased after 3 years of treatment. Survival analysis failed to show a difference between ER and LR groups (mean survival time was 73.6 +\/- 4.3 months and 73.0 +\/- 6 months respectively). Late referral to the nephrologist is associated with increased early morbidity vs early referral, although long term outcome is not worse if predialysis comorbid conditions are comparable and dialysis care achieve equal results in dialysis doses, nutrition and anemia in both groups in the first months of treatment. Improvement of outcome of patients referred early to the nephrologist will depend on the adoption of preventive measures over comorbidity factors that should be applied in early stages of renal disease. ","2960":"It is widely known that renal disease progresses towards the terminal stage regardless of the cause. The aim of this study is to identify prognostic factors in the progression that determine the start of dialysis. From january 1998 until december 1999, 76 patients diagnosed with renal failure were monitored, 52 of whom started dialysis treatments. Clinical and analytical variables were studied. An actuarial analysis was carried out following the methodology of Kaplan-Meier to determine the likelihood of the need for dialysis and the Cox proportional risk analysis was also used. The patients enrolled in this study were between 20 and 78 years of age. 49 (64.5%) of the subjects were men and 27 (35.5%) were women. The most prevalent pathology was nephroangiosclerosis (26.3%), followed by diabetes (25.0%). During the monitoring program, 68.4% of the patients began dialysis treatments (table I). Systolic blood pressure, haemoglobin and the total proteins were univariately identified as prognostic variables. 89.47% and 71.58% of the patients with a systolic blood pressure reading of under 140 mmHg had not begun dialysis after 12 and 24 months respectively. 87.02% and 53.63% of the patients with a systolic blood pressure reading of over 140 mmHg had not begun dialysis after 12 and 24 months respectively (p = 0.025) (fig. 1). With a haemoglobin level higher than 10 gr\/dl after 12 months 92.7% had not started dialysis, dropping to 72.33% after 24 months. With a haemoglobin level of under 10 g\/dl 78.6% and 37.59% had not started dialysis after 12 and 24 months respectively (p = 0.0008) (fig. 2). Taking into account the mean values of different variables in the two year period prior to starting or not starting dialysis, it was found that haemoglobin significantly affected the risk of the need to start dialysis treatments [RR = 0.729; 95% CI = (0.554;0.959)], while systolic blood pressure was on the borderline of statistical significance (table IV). Haemoglobin levels significantly affect the risk of the need to start dialysis treatments, while other variables were identified as possible prognostic factors.

At 33 of them, was performed an acidification test with frusemide stimulus. We studied a control group of 13 healthy children so much for the first one as the second tests and other 14 healthy children for the acidification test with frusemide. In the tests performed with NaHCO3 and acetazolamide stimulus, they were not proven differences in the values of UpCO2 neither in the urinary concentration of HCO3- (UHCO3-) than control children. Nevertheless, the UpCO2 and the concentration of UHCO3- in the patients were significantly lower with acetazolamide with regard to the NaHCO3 stimulus. In the acidification test with frusemide, significantly lower values of titratable acid and ammonium were obtained than control children. In children with idiopathic hypercalciuria, the capacity of secretion of H+ is normal, what is evidenced, especially, when studying the maximum UpCO2 after stimulus with NaHCO3.

The mechanism by which hypertension damages the kidney and the relative contribution of high blood pressure to the progression of renal failure remains incompletely defined. The clinical quantification of renal function is usually thought to require determination of plasma clearance of endogenous creatinine (ClCr), an impractical test for epidemiological evaluation. For this reason several formulae have been proposed to estimate the ClCr from the serum creatinine concentration, such as sex, age, and body weight. The most often used formula is the one proposed by Crockroft and Gault in 1976. To determine the prevalence of loss of renal function and the influence of hypertension and age on this loss in hypertensive and normotensive patients. An observational, cross-sectional comparative study was carried out. 3,420 patients (1,171 normotensive and 2,249 hypertensive) were studied. Average age was 70 years (19.4% of patients &lt; 65 years; 23.3% &gt; 75 years). 98.1 of hypertensive patients were treated with drugs, 26.7% of them with more than one drug. 27.9% of treated patients achieved blood pressure control (&lt; 140-90 mm Hg). The level of renal function was estimated by means of ClCr using the Crockroft and Gault formula. 3.9% of normotensive and 12.2% of hypertensive patients had serum creatinine values &gt; 1.3 mg\/dl, but 28.6% of normotensive and 40.4% of hypertensive had ClCr &lt; 60 ml\/min. The patients over 75 years had ClCr mean values &lt; 60 ml\/min. There was correlation between ClCr and age, but there was no correlation between ClCr and blood pressure values. The estimated ClCr decrease with age and there existed correlation between both variables. The ClCr is lower in hypertensive than in normotensive patients. Hypertension and age influence loss of renal function, but age is a determining factor. The estimated ClCr was a more sensible method of evaluating the loss of renal function than the serum creatinine values. The use of Crockroft and Gault formula can be useful for making diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in primary care. ","2985":"Renal failure is a common complication of myeloma. Renal replacement therapy in these patients is controversial due to poor survival outcomes and low tolerance to treatment. We reviewed our experience on patients with myeloma undergoing dialysis therapy at one centre. Between 1980 and 2000, 28 patients (21 men and 7 women) with myeloma were admitted to chronic dialysis programme and the following variables were analysed: sex, age when starting dialysis, lapse of time between diagnosis of myeloma and admission to dialysis (TD), disease stage, comorbity, mode of presentation, calcium, creatinine at diagnostic, albumin and Hb at the beginning of dialysis, and cause of death. We studied survival among these patients (Kaplan-Meier), identified predictors of survival outcome (Cox's regression) and compared survival between the two decades studied. Mean age was 65 years, median TD was 0.4 months, and modes of presentation were: end-stage renal failure (18 patients), acute renal failure (8), amyloldosis (2). Eleven patients (39%) had myeloma IgG, four (14%) IgA and thirteen (46%) had light chains. Kappa light chain was the most frequent one. In 75% of patients myeloma was at IIIb stage. Cause of death were: Cardiovascular disease (5 patients), infections (4), suspension of treatment (4), tumours (4), and others causes (2). Median survival for all patients was 16.8 months (range 0.4-78) and 25% survived over 39 months. Hb level was the only significant predictor in the multivariant analysis (p = 0.02). In the 80's median survival was 6.17 months versus 17 months in the 90's but this difference was not significant with long-rank test. Although survival of patients with myeloma treated with dialysis is still short, 25 percent survive over 3 years, being Hb level the only predictive factor. Moreover, we observed an improvement of survival in recent years. ","2986":"The commonest clinical presentation of both immunoalergic interstitial nephritis (IIN) and atheroembolic renal disease (ATD) is an acute renal failure accompanied by skin lesions and eosinophilia. As a consequence, differential diagnosis between both entities is often very difficult. We have performed a comparative retrospective study of those patients diagnosed as having IIN or ATD in our Hospital in the period 1980-2000. A total of 42 patients have been diagnosed of IIN and 16 of ATD. Demographic data, as well as clinical and laboratory parameters and outcomes of every studied patient were analysed. We found a significantly higher prevalence of male sex (100% vs 57%, p &lt; 0.01), previous history of hypertension (100% vs 55%, p &lt; 0.01), chronic renal insufficiency (56% vs 17%, p &lt; 0.01), ischemic heart disease (56% vs 14%, p &lt; 0.001), peripheral ischemic disease, endovascular procedures (87% vs 7%, p &lt; 0.001) and anticoagulant treatments (25% vs 5%, p &lt; 0.001) among patients with ATD as compared with IIN, respectively. On the contrary, previous infections (45% vs 12%, p &lt; 0.01) and exposure to new drugs (100% vs 40%, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly more frequent among IIN patients in compare with ATD. ATD patients showed skin lesions consisting of livedo reticularis and digital infarcts (63% vs 31%, p &lt; 0.05) accompanied by blood pressure increase (100% vs 24%, p &lt; 0.001), whereas IIN patients showed fever (41% vs 19%, p &lt; 0.05) and cutaneous rash as significant clinical manifestations, respectively. The number of ATD patients with proteinuria &gt; 1 g\/24 h was significantly higher, but no differences between both groups in the prevalence of urinary sediment abnormalities were observed. The prevalence of absolute eosinophilia was high in both groups (88% among ATD patients, 64% among IIN patients; pNS). Prognosis of both entities was clearly different: Almost all patients with ATD died (69%) or evolved to end-stage renal failure, whereas most patients with IIN showed a recovery of renal function after withdrawal of responsible drugs and steroid treatment. In summary, the analysis of clinical and laboratory data allows an initial differential diagnosis in patients suspected as having IIN or ATD.","2987":"This Spanish single-arm, multicenter, prospective clinical trial assessed the maintenance of hemoglobin concentrations (Hb) between 10-13 g\/dL with unit doses of darbepoetin alfa and the safety of the treatment in dialysis patients. Eight-hundred twenty-six patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) (94% receiving haemodialysis and 6% receiving peritoneal dialysis) previously maintained on stable recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) therapy with stable hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations (mean Hb concentration = 11.7 g\/dL) were switched to darbepoetin alfa at a reduced dosing frequency for 24 weeks (a 20-week titration phase plus a 4-week treatment evaluation phase). Subjects receiving r-HuEPO two or three times weekly were switched to darbepoetin alfa once weekly, and those. who were receiving r-HuEPO once weekly were switched to darbepoetin alfa once every two weeks. The initial dose of darbepoetin alfa was determined from the r-HuEPO dose at inclusion into the study using a formula equating the peptide mass of the two molecules and rounding to the nearest available prefilled syringe dose. Overall, 86.8% of patients completed the 24-weeks of study. Changing the treatment from r-HuEPO to darbepoetin alfa and increasing the dose interval did not result in any clinically significant change in the Hb concentration. From base-line to the evaluation phase, the mean Hb fell 0.09 (95% CI, -0.2; -0.0) g\/dl, with an increase of 0.19 (95% CI, 0.0;0.3) g\/dL i.v. and a decrease of 0.22 (95% CI, -0.3; -0.1) g\/dL s.c.). This maintenance of the mean Hb concentration was accompanied by a mean 9.8% reduction of the darbepoetin alfa dose (19.7% (95% CI, -24.9; -14.2) i.v. and 4.7% (95% CI, -8.5; -0.7) s.c. Treatment with darbepoetin alfa was well tolerated and no unexpected adverse events were reported. In conclusion, the replacement of previous r-HuEPO treatment by darbepoetin alfa in the therapy of anemia secondary to chronic renal failure in diaiyzed patients was effective, well tolerated, and decreased the frequency of dose administration compared with the previous r-HuEPO treatment. Darbepoetin alfa administered once weekly or once every two weeks maintained the baseline Hb levels whilst allowing dose reduction, which was higher in patients receiving i.v. darbepoetin alfa.","2988":"","2989":"","2990":"","2991":"","2992":"The factors that affect bone mineral density (BMD) and the long term progress of BMD after transplantation in children is still unknown. Therefore we performed a cross-sectional study to determine BMD in 83 recipients who received living renal allotransplants in Mansoura Urology &amp; Nephrology Center between 1981 and 2001 (mean age at transplantation 13.2 +\/- 3.1 years) by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry at various time intervals up to 16 years after transplantation (mean duration after transplantation was 48 +\/- 34 months, range 6-192 months). The Z-score for lumbar spine was -2.28 +\/- 2.06 and -1.44 +\/- 1.44 for the total body. Osteopenia\/osteoporosis were present in about two thirds of our kidney transplant recipients. The significant predictors for osteopenia\/osteoporosis by univariate analysis were cyclosporine based immunosuppression, the cumulative steroid dose\/m2 surface area, graft dysfunction and the urinary deoxypyridinoline. Using logistic regression analysis the cumulative steroid dose\/m2 surface area and the urinary deoxypyridinoline were the major significant predictors for bone loss.","2993":"This study was performed to determine risk factors associated with osteoporosis that develops after renal transplantation. Sixty-five kidney graft recipients were included in this study. They were divided into four groups according to the time since transplantation: Group 1 (&lt; 1 year; n = 26), group 2 (1-3 years; n = 16), group 3 (3-5 years; n = 12) and group 4 (&gt; 5 years; n = 11). These groups were matched according to probable risk factors for osteoporosis, findings of serum biochemistry, biochemical markers of bone turnover and measurements of bone mineral density. One way ANOVA test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for statistical analysis. Osteoporosis was found in 22 recipients (33.8%). There were significant differences in recipient age, cumulative steroid dose, and episodes of acute rejection between the four groups. Increasing age, cumulative steroid dose and episodes of acute rejection were found to be risk factors for osteoporosis in our study.","2994":"Early after renal transplantation (RT) a rapid decrease in bone mineral density at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and femoral shaft has been documented. In addition, an appreciable proportion of patients still remain losing bone late after RT. As a consequence, RT patients are at a high risk of bone fractures as compared to general population. Most fractures involve appendicular skeleton, particularly the feet and ankles, and the diabetic patient is at increased risk of fractures. Thus, early institution of preventive measures and treatment of established osteoporosis are central. The major cause of post-transplantation bone loss is corticosteroid treatment, and this should be used at the lower dose compatible with graft survival. Preexisting hyperparathyroidism also affects the early cancellous bone loss at the spine, and post-transplantation bone loss reflects variable individual susceptibility, resembling the polygenic determination of bone mineral density in general. Clinical trials have demonstrated that bisphosphonates or vitamin D plus calcium supplementation, prevent post-transplantation bone loss during the first 6-12 months. However, their role in preventing bone fractures has not been proven. Finally, recommendations for management, prevention and treatment, are summarized.","2995":"Atherosclerosis is the principal cause of myocardial infarction, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease, accounting for nearly half of all mortality in developed countries. The excessive growth of vascular smooth muscle cells is an important component in the development of atherosclerotic lesion. The direct effect of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs on the VSMCs proliferation is not clear. In this study we have analysed if calcitriol, Paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D2) and EB1089 (experimental analog used as anticancerous) modify proliferation and the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene that is regulated at the transcriptional level by itself in the VSMCs. VSMCs proliferation was analysed by BrdU incorporation and VDR gene expression using RT-PCR. VSMCs proliferation was stimulated when calcitriol was added to the culture. VSMCs proliferation was significantly lower with analogs at the same dose. With regard to the functional study, the expression of VDR gene was upregulated by calcitriol at a concentration of 100 nM. There were no changes in this expression with the analogs. In conclusion, calcitriol, do not modify VSMCs proliferation. Therefore, Paricalcitol could have a minor proliferating effect on the wall of vessels that vitamin D.","2996":"The present paper aims to assess radiographic vascular and soft parts calcifications occurrence and its correlation with biochemical profiles. The study was performed in 47 patients (ten diabetic patients), 49 years old, who had been on dialysis for a period of 51 months. Vascular calcifications (VCs) were classified as proximal, distal and soft tissues. In addition, Ca, P, CaxP values in the six months prior to the recruitment period, PTH, FAL and calcium carbonate, calcium acetate, and vitamin D3 intake were determined. A higher frequency of VCs was observed in diabetics, yielding a significant association with proximal 60% (p = 0.05) and almost significant with distal calcifications 70% (p = 0.07). Likewise, a lower CaxP was noted for diabetic VCs in comparison to that seen in non-diabetic VCs (p &lt; 0.05). Proximal and distal VCs in the non-diabetics population were 25% and 20%, respectively; and tissue calcifications were 24%. Age was correlated with proximal and distal VCs (p &lt; 0.01). A higher CaxP was observed in patients with VCs and it yielded an even higher value for tissue calcifications. Lastly, calcium acetate and overall calcium intake was higher in patients with tissue calcifications (p = 0.05). VCs were more frequent in diabetics and they also showed a lower CaxP. VCs in non-diabetics were correlated with CaxP values, whereas tissue calcifications were associated with calcium intake. Therefore, the management of renal osteodystrophy should be changed in order to prevent calcifications as well as to decrease morbidity in hemodialysis patients.","2997":"Dialysis patients have bone metabolic disorders and a higher prevalence of fractures, principally peripheral fractures. However, there are few studies focusing on the prevalence of vertebral fractures. Moreover, aortic calcifications are very common and are an independent predictive factor of vascular morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of vertebral fractures and vascular calcifications in haemodialysis (HD) patients (n = 99), in comparison with a random sample of general population of similar age and from the same geographical area (n = 624) and study their relationship with clinical, biochemical and therapeutical data. The prevalence of vertebral fractures in HD patients and general population was 19.1% and 24.1% respectively (non-significant statistical differences). In both, sexes, the presence of vertebral fractures was positively associated with age, mean maximum Ca, mean maximum CaxP. In women, time in HD was positively associated as well. On the other hand, the prevalence of aortic calcifications was much higher in HD patients (77.9% vs 37.5%, p &lt; 0.001). HD was a risk factor for aortic calcification in women [OR = 7.7 (IC 95% = 2.6-22.9)] as in men [OR = 5 (IC 95% = 1.9-12.9)]. Severe vascular calcifications were more frequent in HD patients, it reached 57.4% compared with 17% of general population (p &lt; 0.001). Both, in women (64.5% vs 13.3% p &lt; 0.001) and in men (51.4% vs 20.9%), respectively (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, the prevalence of vertebral fractures was similar in HD patients and in general population. Nevertheless, frequency and severity of aortic calcifications was higher in HD patients.","2998":"Bone mass (BMD) may be evaluated by digital X-ray radiogrammetry (DXR) which it is estimated from multiple cortical measures carried out on five regions of interest over a simple hand-forearm X-ray film. We included 168 HD patients (108 men and 60 women; 63 +\/- 14 and 66 +\/- 12 years old respectively--p &lt; 0.05-) coming from seven HD units in Asturias. We performed a hand-forearm X-ray, an epidemiologic questionnaire and we revised their medical and analytical records. As the normative data we used the measurements of a random sample of 247 subjects from our own population. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 7% and 40% in men and women respectively. BMD was correlated with weight (r = 0.346), time on HD (r = -0.188), time on treatment (r = -0.235). The porosity was correlated with PTH levels.","2999":"Hyperphosphatemia is an important risk factor of secondary hyperparathyroidism and extraosseous calcifications in chronic renal failure patients. In this study our hypothesis is that physicians misconception of adequate phosphatemia is a risk factor for hyperphosphatemia. In 1999 GEMOR sent a renal osteodystrophy inquiry to different hemodialysis centers in Argentina. It included 80 dialysis centers in 17 Argentinian provinces. The enquire had 33 questions about renal osteodystrophy. Here we report the section related to phosphorous metabolism. We obtained responses from 80 dialysis centers (4,512 dialysis patients), which represents about 24% of Argentinian dialysis centers. Physicians considered phosphorous levels between 4.5 to 5.5 mg\/dl in 83.5% of centers as adequate, and between 5.5 to 6.5 mg\/dl in 10.1%. Five out of 77 centers reported that they had no patients with hyperphosphatemia. The percentage of hemodialysis patients that had more than 6 mg\/dl in each center was 28.8 +\/- 15.9%. Those centers that aimed for phosphatemia between 5.5 and 6.5 mg\/dl, had a higher percentage of patients with phosphatemia above 6 mg\/dl than those aiming for between 4.5 and 5.5 mg\/dl (42.8 +\/- 16.7 vs 27.1 +\/- 15.2% respectively, p = 0.007), and had higher mean of phosphatemia (6.4 +\/- 0.7 vs 5.3 +\/- 0.7 mg\/dl respectively, p = 0.0001), than the last group. In conclusion, a higher mean phosphate level was obtained in hemodialysis centers where physicians considered higher pre-dialysis target levels. Some centers had no patients with hyperphosphatemia (neglect or good control?).","3000":"Phosphorus is involved in the pathogenesis of hyperparathyroidism in Chronic Renal Failure (CRF) and in extra-osseous calcifications. Therefore, it is directly related with the morbi-mortality of these patients. The control of phosphorus is of the utmost importance and is often extremely difficult to achieve. A quick overview of the drugs that can bind phosphorus is given in this paper. Iron salts are beginning to come through as a viable possibility in the near future; nevertheless, calcium salts continue to be the most widespread. The problem is the ease with which a positive calcium balance can be produced, as extra-osseous calcifications (and above all, vascular calcifications) can appear and morbid-mortality increases. As a result of all this, calcium-free binders such as lanthanum carbonate and sevelamer are eagerly awaited. The lanthanum is as of yet little and not very well known. Sevelamer possesses good phosphorus-binding properties, as it is insoluble, does not cause intestinal degradation, does not contain traces of other elements and its use has few side effects. Long-term studies and accumulated experience have demonstrated its efficacy as a binder, plus additional advantages such as an improvement in the lipid profile, with a decrease in LDL--and an increase in HDL-cholesterol. As to whether these new binders--or any other compounds that could appear-will be of any real use only time will tell.","3001":"Bone disease develops relatively early in the development of CRF. The aim of this study was to evaluate the repercussion of estrogen insufficiency and the effectiveness of hormonal replacement therapy, after different periods of estrogen deprivation, on bone metabolism in an animal model with chronic renal failure and ovariectomy. A secondary purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness of bone densitometry for predicting changes in bone mass for comparison with bone histomorphometry. We used Sprague-Dawley rats with chronic renal failure and ovariectomy performed at the same time. Animals were divided into two phases according to the period of estrogen insufficiency, 4 weeks in the long estrogen insufficiency period and 1 week in the short estrogen insufficiency period. In both phases, the animals were divided into four treatment groups receiving placebo (corn oil), 17 beta-estradiol (15 micrograms\/kg body weight\/day), calcitriol (10 ng\/kg body weight\/day) or the combined treatment with estradiol and calcitriol. In both phases, a group of animals with chronic renal failure (normal ovarian function) was used as a control group. The period of treatment was 8 weeks. After this period the animals were sacrificed. This model emphasizes the importance of the period of estrogen insufficiency in the efficiency of the treatment. Four weeks of estrogen insufficiency resulted in an significant loss of trabecular bone, and less possibility of recovery. After one week of estrogen deprivation a response to the treatment was observed. The utilization of bone densitometry allowed to reproduce changes in bone mass observed afterwards by histomorphometric analysis.","3002":"The relationship between estrogens, bone metabolism and osteoporosis is well known. Chronic renal failure in women is associated with menstrual disorders, lower bone mineral density and increased risk of fractures. However, most studies on renal osteodystrophy have not taken into account the role of oestrogen deficiency, its interaction, and the possible benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in uremic women. According to these limitations and the actual evidence of benefits and risks of HRT, we conclude that: a) Osteoporosis must be evaluated as a part of renal osteodystrophy; b) HRT would be considered in women with climateric symptoms and osteoporosis, and should not be used for prevention of cardiovascular disease, and c) Clearly we need to do more studies related to osteoporosis and estrogens in CRF, but right now we have to try to optimize bone turnover in our uremic patients.","3003":"There has been a poor consensus in defining normal levels of 25(OH) D. It has been traditionally recognized that 25(OH)D serum levels below 5-7 ng\/ml induce osteomalacia, serum levels below 10-12 ng\/ml induce secondary hyperparathyroidism and osteoporosis, and serum levels above 18-20 ng\/ml are usually considered normal or adequate. Due to the results obtained in several studies, a more functional classification has recently been proposed defining serum 25(OH)D levels &gt; 40 ng\/ml or &gt; 100 nmol\/l as \"desirable\", serum levels between 20 and 40 ng\/ml or 50 and 100 nmol\/l as hypovitaminosis D, levels between 10 and 20 ng\/ml or 25 and 50 mmol\/l as vitamin D insufficiency and 25(OH)D levels below 10 ng\/ml or 25 nmol\/l as deficient. These new cut-off levels, suggest that, in the past, we had been using a wrong statistical approach for defining \"normal serum 25(OH)D levels\". In agreement with this new classification, in a recent study conducted in a random sample of our population, a high prevalence of low levels of 25(OH)D and secondary hyperparathyroidism was found. In our study, only in those people having \"excellent\" renal function, representing only 15% of the sample (serum creatinine &lt; 1 mg\/dl in men and &lt; 0.8 in women, mean age of 68 years) hyperparathyroidism was not diagnosed despite observing 25(OH)D serum levels around 18-30 ng\/ml or 45-75 nmol\/l). In the remaining people (85% of the sample), who showed the expected serum creatinine increments according to their age, secondary hyperparathyroidism was avoided only if the serum 25(OH)D levels were higher than 30 ng\/ml or 75 nmol\/l. These remarkable findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining higher 25(OH)D levels--in addition to normal calcitriol levels--in order to avoid stimulation of the parathyroid gland. In 87 patients with a functioning renal transplantation only a 11.5% of they had levels of 25(OH)D higher than 30 ng\/ml and it was correlated with PTH. These remarkable findings demonstrate the importance of maintaining higher 25(OH)D levels--in addition to normal calcitriol levels--in order to avoid stimulation of the parathyroid gland in aged people. Thus, the deficiency or even \"subtle deficiency\" of 25(OH)D, currently neglected in the daily management of patients with chronic renal failure, may play an important role in the maintenance of hormonal and mineral homeostasis.","3004":"As the chronic kidney disease patient is being managed for PTH, calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, calcium x phosphate product and bone quality an accurate PTH measurement is essential. Over and under PTH suppressive therapies pose significant risks of mineral metabolism disturbances, osteodystrophies and soft tissue calcifications. Until recently it was thought that there was only one hormone secreted by the parathyroid gland, 1-84 PTH (or CAP). It is now known that there is another hormone secreted by the parathyroid gland (CIP) which is most likely 7-84 PTH. 7-84 PTH has been demonstrated to be an antagonist of 1-84 PTH with inverse biological activities. 7-84 PTH has been demonstrated to be hypocalcemic and able to lower bone turnover through an inhibition of osteoclast formation resulting in an overall inhibition of bone resorption. Whereas, 1-84 PTH operates through the PTH\/PTHrp receptor the 7-84 PTH appears to operate through a C terminal PTH receptor. The CAP\/CIP ratio decreases in the dialysis patient when calcium increases and vice versa. The 2nd generation \"intact\" PTH assays measure the sum of CAP plus CIP which render them ineffective at predicting bone turnover (72% predictive) and monitoring PTH suppressive treatments. By contrast the CAP\/CIP ratio predicts bone turnover in the dialysis patient with a histologically determined 93% predictability. An elevated CAP\/CIP ratio indicates high bone turnover and a decreased CAP\/CIP ratio indicates adynamic low bone turnover.","3005":"Calcitriol deficiency and phosphorus retention are mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of renal hyperparathyroidism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary phosphorus restriction versus calcium carbonate treatment for one month on PTH and calcitriol levels in patients with mild renal failure. We studied two groups of patients: Group I: 21 patients (14M\/7F); mean age 61 years old; mean glomerular filtration rate 51 ml\/min. Their diet contained phosphorus 700 mg\/day. Group II: 30 patients (21M\/9F); mean age 58; mean glomerular rate 56 ml\/min. They were divided in two subgroups: 18 patients treated with calcium carbonate 2.5 g\/day and 12 patients with 5 g\/day. Serum PTH, calcitriol, 25(OH)D3, calcium, phosphorus and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus were measured before and after a 30 day period. The low phosphorus diet (Group I) resulted in a significant decrease in PTH levels (81.3 +\/- 35 vs 71 +\/- 39 pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.05) and significant increase in calcitriol levels (22.4 +\/- 4.4 vs 33.4 +\/- 7.5 pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.05). In our study calcium carbonate treatment (Group II) had no effect on PTH and calcitriol levels.","3006":"Secondary hyperparathyrodism (SH) is an early manifestation of chronic renal failure (CRF), which has serious complications. Moreover, treating SH is not a risk-free process. Once in its advanced state, it is extremely difficult to reverse and therefore it is critical an early intervention and prevention. An excess of phosphorus and a deficit of calcium and calcitriol are key factors in the evolution of SH. Despite the fact that plasma phosphorus levels remain normal until an extremely advanced stage of CRF, and even apparent hyperphosphatemia in mild CRF, it has been shown that restricting dietary levels of protein and phosphorus impedes the progression of SH. A decrease of protein in the diet also decreases the amount of calcium, thus the calcium levels must be supplemented in order to prevent their deficit. In addition to that slightly diminished levels of calcitriol can be observed in the early stages of CRF, thus it is logical to provide this hormone. However, administering calcitriol may induce hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, which in turn risks the onset of cardiovascular calcifications and complications. Therefore, the calcitriol dosage should be small and then adjusted according to the degree of SH. Neither the PTH levels nor alterations in the phospho-calcium metabolism follow a linear increase appropriate to the decrease in renal function, therefore we propose a treatment strategy which adapts to the different degrees of renal failure.","3007":"The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between the bone strontium content and bone histomorphometric parameters in bone biopsies from patients with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. The study was carried out in 74 illiac crest bone biopsies from patients with renal osteodystrophy from different worldwide regions (Argentina, Portugal and Spain). They were underwent to histological and histomorphometric evaluation. The bone strontium\/calcium ratio was measured by quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. The samples were classified into groups according to histological criteria: hyperparathyroidism (HP), mixed (MX), osteomalacia (OM) and adynamic bone disease (ABD). Serum PTH and alkaline phosphatase before biopsy were available in most of the patients. No correlation was found between the different histomorphometric parameters and the Sr\/Ca ratio. The one way ANOVA test showed statistical differences in the Sr\/Ca ratio of the different histological forms (HP: 0.58 +\/- 0.39; MX: 1.16 +\/- 0.74; OM: 1.10 +\/- 0.46; ABD: 0.91 +\/- 0.40 microgram Sr\/mg Ca; p &lt; 0.003). The post-Hoc analysis showed differences between HP and MX. The biopsies having greater or equal values than 1.4 micrograms Sr\/mg Ca showed higher levels of bone formation histomorphometric parameters and serum alkaline phosphatase (395 +\/- 519 vs 1,022 +\/- 989 UI\/L, p &lt; 0.05). Although it has been found that the biopsies with higher bone strontium had higher levels of osteoid tissue (characteristic of osteomalacia), the hypothesis of strontium-induced osteomalacia could not be demonstrated.","3008":"Between 1994-2001 we have performed 57 bone biopsies for diagnostic purposes in symptomatic CRF patients. We analyzed here 52 samples where the material was optimal for study, and divided them into 2 periods according to when the biopsy was performed: 1994-1996 and 1997-2001, to verify changes in the spectrum of renal osteodystrophy. Mean serum values were: serum calcium 9.9 +\/- 1.8 mg\/dl, phosphate 5.8 +\/- 3.2 mg\/dl, alkaline phosphatase 693.9 +\/- 968.9 Ul\/L, iPTH 562.0 +\/- 598.5 pg\/ml, serum aluminum 65.7 +\/- 79.3 ug\/L and bone aluminum 22.8 +\/- 22.4 ug\/g. Hyperparathyroidism was the most common histological diagnosis as severe in 13 patients (25%), or as mild in 14 (27%). Ten patients had osteomalacia (19%), adynamic bone disease was diagnosed in 5 (9.6%) and mixed renal osteodystrophy in 10 (19.2%). Low bone turnover patients showed higher bone and serum aluminum than high bone turnover patients. We observed a relative increment in high turnover bone disease in the later period (1997-2001) without changes in low turnover bone disease. These data showed a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism and aluminum-related low turnover bone disease, with no significant changes between the two time-periods analyzed here.","3009":"A cross-sectional study was developed with 100 of the first-time pre-dialysis patients visiting the Princesa University Hospital's Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease (ACKD) unit, with the aim of analysing various parameters of osteodystrophy at this time. Parameters evaluated were: age, gender, renal function, osteodystrophy serum parameters, comorbidity index (ICED) and the patients' origin to establish correlations between these parameters. Mean iPTH levels were higher irrespective of the patients' origin, and were significantly higher in men than in women, the former also having poorer renal function and higher comorbidity score. The mean levels of calcium, phosphorous, alkaline phosphatase and CO2 did not justify this rise in iPTH. Nutritional parameters NPNA and albumin were adequate in spite of ageing. At early stages of ESRD, iPTH could be elevated and ACKD units play an important part its early detection and subsequent treatment.","3010":"In a previous study we have observed that NH4Cl-induced metabolic acidosis halted the progression of renal disease in azotemic rats with a high phosphate diet. We hypothesized that NH4Cl-induced metabolic acidosis may exert its protective effect by decreasing renal calcium content independent of serum levels of PTH and phosphate loading. To test this hypothesis we studied azotemic rats with very low phosphate diet or parathyroidectomy. Rats with low phosphate diet and parathyroidectomized rats developed renal failure after 5\/6 nephrectomy, and in both groups the acid loading significantly decreased the progression of renal disease. Calcium renal content increased in both groups, even in rats with low phosphate diet, and this effect was also significantly decreased after an acid loading. Rats with acid loading developed greater hypertrophy of renal tissue than rats without acid loading. We conclude that NH4Cl-induced metabolic acidosis halted the progression of renal disease by decreasing calcium precipitation on renal tissue. Parathyroidectomy did not prevent progression of renal disease nor calcium precipitation, and a low phosphate diet in azotemic rats did not prevent increased calcium content on remnant renal tissue.","3011":"The role of vitamin D in the regulation of blood pressure is unclear. There are no studies that relate Bsm I polymorphism with blood pressure. To analyze if Bsm I polymorphism and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD3) influence blood pressure in healthy individuals with normal blood pressure. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), plasma creatinine, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, serum iPTH, serum 25OHD3 and Bsm I genotype were determined in 590 healthy individuals (260 men and 330 women). Data were analysed using a multiple linear regression model. SBP and DBP were defined as dependent variables and the rest of variables as independent. Gender was strongly associated with both SBP (beta: -12.01, p: 0.000) and DBP (beta: -4.78, p: 0.000). Therefore, a separate analysis was performed according to gender. In males, SBP was associated with BMI (beta: 0.83, p: 0.001), 25OHD3, (beta: 0.36, p: 0.000) and genotype (beta: -3.90, p: 0.002); and DBP with 25OHD 3 (beta: 0.16, p: 0.018) and age (beta: 0.28, p: 0.000). Differences of blood pressure among the three genotypes were explored by analysis of variance. SBP was higher in men with bb genotype than in the other genotypes (p: 0.007). In females, 25OHD3 and genotype were not associated with blood pressure. Healthy men with higher levels of vitamin D have higher levels of SBP and DBP. Moreover, men with bb genotype have the highest levels of SBP. Blood pressure levels in women are not influenced by vitamin D nor by Bsml genotype. Our data suggest a possible pathophysiological interaction between vitamin D and sex hormones in blood pressure control. ","3012":"Desferrioxamine and deferiprone are both metal-chelating drugs often used in aluminum-overloaded dialysis patients. In these patients, desferrioxamine produces an improvement on bone mineralisation without a relevant decrease in bone aluminum. Thus, desferrioxamine might have a direct effect on bone cells. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of desferrioxamine and deferiprone on 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated osteocalcin secretion in osteoblast--like cells. The study was carried out in MG-63 cell cultures. Cells were seeded at a density of 15,000 cel\/cm2 and grown to confluence for 72 hours in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. The medium was then replaced by another medium containing 1% BSA, 10(-9) M 1,25(OH)2D3 and desferrioxamine 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80 microM or deferiprone 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 microM. Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 was used as control. After 48 hours, supernatants were collected for the measurement of secreted osteocalcin. Desferrioxamine and deferiprone, at high doses (desferrioxamine: 60 microM, 80 microM; deferiprone: 180 microM, 240 microM), inhibited the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced osteocalcin secretion. On the contrary, at lower doses (desferrioxamine 5 microM; deferiprone 15 microM) stimulated the secretion. In summary, these results suggest that desferrioxamine and deferiprone exert a direct effect on bone cell metabolism that might be independent from their metal-chelating properties.","3013":"This study analyzed the modifications induced by growth hormone (GH) and\/or calcitriol treatments in the growth plate of growth retarded uremic rats. Four groups of 5\/6 nephrectomized rats were studied: untreated (U), treated with GH (U + GH), treated with calcitriol (U + D), treated with GH and calcitriol (U + GH + D). Treatments were given intraperitoneally during the second week of renal failure. Uremic groups were compared with sham-operated rats fed ad libitum (C) or pair-fed with U (CP). In comparison with C and CP, histomorphometric analysis of tibial proximal ends of U group showed decreased bone formation, as estimated by osseous front advance (OFA), elongation of growth cartilage and its hypertrophic zone, and decreased size of most distal chondrocytes. The U + D group tended to normalize growth cartilage height, and that of its hypertrophic zone, as well as the size of chondrocytes. In U + GH group OFA improved and chondrocyte size became normal, but growth cartilage remained elongated. Similar results were found in the U + GH + D group. These findings indicate that, in chronic renal insufficiency, the beneficial effect of GH on growth is not associated with normalization of growth cartilage morphology and that calcitriol facilitates chondrocyte maturation. When given together the effect of GH prevails.","3014":"Several alterations have been reported in the growth plate of young rats rendered uremic by subtotal nephrectomy, a widely used experimental model of growth failure secondary to renal insufficiency. In our lab's experience, uremia is associated with a markedly increased growth plate height which results from an elongation of the hypertrophic zone. These findings are not consistently observed in all studies, likely because of the different experimental conditions. Regardless of growth plate size, growth retardation induced by chronic renal failure is accompanied by an alteration of the dynamics of the growth plate with a decreased bone apposition rate at the metaphyseal end of growth cartilage and slower production and progression of chondrocytes from the resting zone up to the most distal hypertrophic zone adjacent to bone. These abnormal dynamics are associated with an irregular bone-cartilage interface and a disturbed process of chondrocyte maturation which becomes evident by a morphological criteria and by depressed expression of markers of chondrocyte maturation such as collagen X. The microscopic findings also suggest a disturbed process of capillary invasion, which precedes formation of new osseous tissue in the primary spongiosa, although the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, as measured by immunohistochemistry, have been reported to be similar in the growth plate of uremic and control rats. The meaning of these findings in the pathogenesis of growth impairment secondary to chronic renal failure remains to be determined.","3015":"Since its discovery in 1923, the parathyroid hormone (PTH), was thought to be the sole hormone capable of stimulating bone resorption, renal tubular calcium reabsorption, calcitriol synthesis, and urinary excretion of phosphate. However, in 1987, the PTHrP (PTH-related peptide), was demonstrated to share most of the biological actions of PTH through the activation of the same receptor. This receptor was cloned in 1992 and named PTH\/PTHrP receptor or PTH-R1. Both, PTH and PTHrP bind with great affinity to PTH-R1 and stimulate a signal transduction system involving different G-proteins, phospholipase C, and adenylate cyclase. A third member of the PTH family, the TIP-39 (tuberoinfundibular peptide), binds and activates another PTH receptor (PTH-R2). There is evidence for other PTH receptors, a PTH-R3, probably specific for PTHrP in keratinocytes, kidney, placenta and a PTH-R4 specific for C-terminal PTH fragments. Activating mutations in the PTH-R1 gene cause Jansen type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, whereas inactivating mutations are responsible for Blomstrand type rare chondrodysplasia and enchondromatosis. The renal and bone PTH-R1 expression is upregulated in vitamin D deficient rats and by endotoxin, interleukin-2, dexamethasone, T3, and TGF beta. On the contrary, PTH, PTHrP, angiotensin-II, IGF-1, PGE2, vitamin D, and chronic renal failure decrease its expression. In conclusions, the biological implications of the identification and cloning of different PTH receptors are at their beginning. The almost ubiquitous distribution of PTHrP and PTH-R1, the numerous PTHrP and PTH fragments, let us suppose the existence of other PTH-related receptors, and a great complexity of the bone and mineral metabolism.","3016":"The parathyroid glands have a great sensitivity to small changes in the extracellular ionic calcium. The calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) is a G protein-coupled receptor that responds to extracellular ionic calcium changes activating several intracellular signalling systems (phospholipases C, A2 and D) finally inhibiting the PTH secretion. In addition to calcium, there are some other agonists and modulators such as the Mg2+, spermine, amyloid beta-peptides, a variety of aminoacids, especially aromatic aminoacids and ionic strength. In the uraemia, the sensitivity of the parathyroid glands to calcium is altered and higher values of calcium are necessary to suppress the PTH. In the secondary hyperparathyroidism the CaR expression is reduced. It has been found a negative correlation between cellular proliferation and the expression of the CaR in hyperplasic glands. Despite it is a calcium receptor, the expression of the CaR does not seem to be regulated by calcium and there is some controversy about the role of calcitriol regulating its expression. On the other hand, the phosphorous induces hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland increasing the cellular proliferation and a decrease of the CaR expression.","3017":"Genetic abnormalities responsible for primary (pHPT) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) are not well described, especially those underlying the autonomous and refractory behaviour of glands from uremic patients with glandular hyperplasia and nodular growth. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique based on a double-color in situ fluorescent analysis, allowing a global description of gains and losses of genomic material. It is a useful tool that localizes unstable genetic areas whose alteration could modify the expression of one or several genes related to the pathology in study. Results on primary hyperparathyroidism adenomas have shown a series of genetic changes correlating with areas where genes related to pHPT are located, such as MEN1 and cyclin D1. A large number of chromosomal aberrations in glands from patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism have also been found, and although some of them are common with those described for primary hyperparathyroidism, most of them are located in different areas or in a different proportion. These results confirm that although severe sHPT hyperplasias can evolve into neoplasias similar to pHPT adenomas, both parathyroid alterations must be considered, from a genetic point of view, as unrelated.","3018":"","3019":"","3020":"","3021":"We report a 76-year-old man, stable on a thrice-weekly hemodialysis program over a period of 3 years, who developed acute intradialysis hemolysis secondary to hypophosphatemia, an unusual cause of hemolysis. During the dialysis session we monitored the starting point, the severity and duration of intradialysis hemolysis. Severe hyphosphatemia is a rare cause of intradialysis hemolysis. It is important to think of his possibility to make an adequate diagnosis and treatment. The patient was treated with a phosphorus-enriched acid concentrate, bicarbonate-buffered dialysate, with biochemical and clinical improvement.","3022":"We report here a case of systemic lupus erythematosus with severe, active pauci-immune necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis. This patient had been diagnosed of a lupus nephritis type III previously and treated with steroids and azathioprine. After a renal symptomless period of nine years, she developed heavy proteinuria and hypertension. A second kidney biopsy was then performed. The pathological study disclosed a pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic and segmental glomerulonephritis. The absence of subendothelial and mesangial deposits was confirmed by both immunofluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy. The simultaneous immunological study showed normal ANCA levels while complement, anti-dsDNA and ANA were altered. The patient was treated with steroids and cyclophosphamide eith good response. This case points out the possibility previously recognized by others of an association between lupus and an pauci-immune necrotizing glomerulonephritis.","3023":"The aim of this study was to perform a quantitative meta-analysis of the average bioequivalence criteria between Sandimmun and Sandimmun Neoral in kidney transplant patients, and to review the new bioequivalence criteria and their application to generic formulation of cyclosporin. In Medline, we searched for clinical trials evaluating the bioequivalence between Sandimmun and Sandimmun Neoral in kidney transplant patients and we collected the information regarding the bioequivalence, study design, sample size, and time post-transplant. The effect was measured by the Wolf method; publication bias was evaluated by the Galbraith method and the Rosenthal formula was used to calculate the number of additional studies with no statistical differences needed to get a statistically non-significant overall estimation. We selected 6 clinical trials with a latin square design and 4 clinical trials with sequential design. The average bioequivalence criteria between Sandimmun Neoral and Sandimmun were 1.327 (90% CI: 1,311 a 1,344), 1,663 (90% CI: 1,635 a 1,692) and 0.559 hours (90% CI: 0.544 a 0.574 hours) for logharitmic transformation of area under the curve and maximum concentration, and time to maximum concentration, respectively. For these three outcomes, we found statistical differences between different study designs and for area under the curve and maximum concentration, the average bioequivalence criteria significantly fall with the post-transplant time. We conclude Sandimmun Neoral and Sandimmun are not bioequivalents and the experience reached with these two drugs is not applicable to the evaluation of generic formulations of cyclosporin.","3024":"Programmed variable sodium in the dialysate can improve hypotension during hemodialysis but may also alter sodium balance and thus resulting in a increase of water intake and weight gain between dialysis sessions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes on plasma volume (PV), Ionic Mass Transfer (IMT) and plasma conductivity (PC) with two different hemodialysis techniques. We studied 10 patients during a four-period protocol (one week each: PF1-DC1-DC2PF2): 120 dialysis sessions. During periods PF1 and PF2, the dialysis procedure was as usual, with exponential decrease of dialysate conductivity (DC) profile (15.7 mS\/cm at start, 14.4 mS\/cm at middle and 13.8 mS\/cm at the end of the session) and UF profile (1.7 1\/h at start and 0.1 1\/h at the end). During periods DC1 and DC2, DC was automatically determined by a biofeedback modulae (Diacontrol) in order to reach a plasma water conductivity fixed at 14 mS\/cm. All hemodialysis parameters were the same for the four periods: duration, blood and dialysate flow rates, dialysis membrane. A lower reduction of PV was evident on PF1 and PF2 (104 +\/- 3.26% and -4.36 +\/- 2.7%) compared with DC 1 and DC2 (-6.53 +\/- 3.31% and -6.67 +\/- 3.12%) (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were seen in systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure pre-HD or post-HD, UF, and weight gain, between the four periods. Hypotensive episodes were seen in 33.3% of PF1, 20% of DC1, 23.3% of DC2 and 26.6% of PF2 sessions (NS). PF1 and PF2 periods resulted in a significantly higher 30', mid and post-dialysis PC as compared to DC1 and DC2 periods (p &lt; 0.001). The mean difference between the actual value and the prescribed value of PC at the end of the session was -0.01 +\/- 0.07 mS\/cm (n: 60). There was a negative correlation between the mean DC during session and the PC at 30' of session. IMT was 420.73 +\/- 126.9 mEq in PF1, 311.96 +\/- 161.75 in DC1, 278.34 +\/- 153.14 in DC2 and 417.66 +\/- 152.17 in PF2 (p &gt; 0.001 PF1 and PF2 vs. DC1 and DC2). Diacontrol determines automatically an individualized DC profile for each patient, and accurately reaches the prescribed PC target. By reaching both the dry weight and PC settings, the water and sodium pool is maintained lower in the hemodialysis session using a biofeedback module. Clinical tolerance was similar in the two different dialysis procedures.","3025":"To assess the usefulness of percutaneous treatment of abnormalities of the venous tree in extending the survival of external Thomas shunts (TS). Twelve cases of TS were included in a hemodialysis access fistula dysfunction monitoring program and were followed for up to 48 months. The abnormalities found were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or thrombolysis and PTA. Survival curves and the Kaplan-Meier method were used to calculate the likelihood of primary patency (P1), secondary patency (P2), and overall patency (OP). A total of 61 interventions were performed during the period of follow-up. On 12 occasions the fistula was thrombosed; in the rest, increased venous pressure to 150 mmHg or higher was detected during dialysis. Fistulography was performed after washing the thrombosed fistulas with urokinase, and revealed one or more of the following angiographic signs: 1) a short reduction of more than 50% in lumen caliber in the femoral vein adjacent to the anastomosis, present in 52% of the cases (fig. 1); 2) imaging a \"jet\" of contrast material at the site of entry of the shunt into the femoral vein (fig. 2), present in 22% of the cases; and 3) a filling defect or \"flap\" at the same site, owing to hyperplastic tissue or piece of thrombus adhering to the intima, present in 34% of the cases (figs. 3-5). This last-mentioned finding ordinarily gave rise to a \"valve\" effect, whereby injection into the venous branch was feasible but aspiration from the venous branch was difficult or impossible. PTA was carried out and attained anatomical and functional success in 100% of cases. PI was 58%, 33%, 8%, and 0% at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively; P2 was 100%, 75%, 58%, and 25%; respectively, at those same times. The comparison of the PI and P2 curves was statistically significant; p &lt; 0.001 (table 1). OP was 83%, 66%, 50% and 41% at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The comparison of the PI surgical and OP curves was statistically significant; p &lt; 0.01 (table II). Percutaneous treatment of TS dysfunction was proved to be effective in maintaining long-term patency. This type of fistula affords an alternative to tunneled central venous catheters. ","3026":"A chest X-ray has been routinely used to evaluate possible complications of a catheter installed for hemodialysis. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the utility of routine chest X-ray to detect complications derived from the installation of temporary catheters through a jugular vein access. We studied prospectively 95 successive jugular catheters for hemodialysis. After installation the operator answered a questionnaire that asked for details of the procedure and his opinion of the utility of a chest X-ray to detect a complication in each particular case. A chest X-ray was done in every patient and analyzed blindly. There were 17 minor complications: 7 arterial punctures, 5 neck hamatomas and 5 malpositions of catheters. No major complications were found. Sixty per cent of the catheters that required three or more punctures had a complication vs only 10% of the ones that required two or less puncture (p &lt; 0.05). In five occasions the catheters were malpositioned, in four of these cases a complication was suspected. The wire guide was twisted in all of these cases. The procedure was considered of medium or high difficulty in four of the five malpositioned catheters, in contrast a medium or highly difficult case was considered only in 13 of the 90 well positioned catheters (p &lt; 0.05). The time employed for the catheters installation was significantly higher for the malpositioned catheters. In 29.5% of the cases the operator considered a chest X-ray necessary, 2\/3 of the cases did not have a well founded clinical suspicion of complication. We conclude that routine chest X-ray after installation of a jugular catheter for hemodialysis has a low diagnostic value for the detection of complications derived from the procedure and should be ordered only when clinical features suggest a complication.","3027":"We report the experience of three hemodialysis centers registered with the ISO 9001-2000 standard, regarding the development of a quality measure system and providing an analysis of this system and its advantages and disadvantages.","3028":"","3029":"","3030":"","3031":"","3032":"","3033":"","3034":"","3035":"","3036":"","3037":"","3038":"","3039":"","3040":"","3041":"","3042":"","3043":"","3044":"","3045":"","3046":"","3047":"","3048":"","3049":"","3050":"We describe a renal transplant recipient, with overimmunosuppression induced by the interaction of tacrolimus and fluconazole, who developed two severe diseases produced by two different viruses of the herpes group (cytomegalovirus [CMV] disease and posttransplant lymphoproliferative [PTLD] disease EBV-related). Detection of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the blood preceded the histological diagnosis of PTLD. Both diseases improved after changes in the immunosuppressive regime and treatment with ganciclovir. Because CMV infection is a risk factor in developing PTLD, and the clinical and endoscopic manifestations of both diseases could be become confused, PTLD should be excluded in EBV seronegative patients that develop CMV disease.

To analyse the erythropoietin dose and the haemoglobin levels we divided the population in two groups according to the time with dialysis treatment: patients treated less than six months and patients between six months, and four years on therapy. We compared our results with the evidence based recommendations Guidelines: the European Best Practice Guidelines (EBPG) and the US National Kidney Foundation (NKF-K\/DOQI). We also compared our results with those presented by the ESAM2 on 2,618 patients on dialysis in Spain carried out in the second half of the year 2000. We observed that 70% of the population reaches an haemoglobin value higher that 11 g\/dl, with a mean erythropoietin (rHu-EPO) dose of 111.9 Ul\/kg weight\/week (n = 3,700; SD 74.9). However, for those patients on treatment for less than six months, the mean Haemoglobin only reaches 10.65 g\/dl (n = 222; SD 1.4). The rHu-EPO was administrated subcutaneously in 70.2% of the patients. About the iron therapy, 86% of the patients received iron treatment and the administration route was intravenous in 93% of the population. The ferritin levels were below 100 micrograms\/dl in 10% of the patients and 26.4% showed a transferrin saturation index (TSAT) below 20%. The erythropoieting resistance index (ERI), as rHu-EPO\/haemoglobin, has been used to evaluate the response to rHu-Epo, according to different variables. It was observed that the following factors lead to a higher rHu-EPO resistance: intravenous rHu-EPO as administration route, the presence of hypoalbuminemia, increase of protein C reactive, Transferrin saturation below 20% and starting dialysis during the last six months.","3054":"We studied the features of acute renal failure (ARF) in elderly patients treated in a hospital, without an intensive care unit, to identify etiological factors and establish adequate preventive measures and treatment. During twelve consecutive months we studied prospectively 99 patients with ARF diagnosed by conventional criteria, an incidence of 1,238 cases per million per year. ARF affected 1.78% of patients admitted to hospital. We analyzed age, sex, serum creatinine, diuresis, etiology, type of ARF, preexisting chronic diseases, treatment, complications and outcome. Preexisting chronic diseases were common, the most frequent being hypertension (54%) and diabetes (39%). Previous treatments for cardiovascular diseases were frequent (angiotensin-renin system blockade 35.4%, diuretics 50.5%). 79% of ARF arose in hospital, 21% outside hospital. ARF was pre-renal in 60%, renal in 31% and post-renal in 9%. 34.7% were caused by volume depletion, 23.4% by low cardiac output and 23.4% by infection. 44.4% of ARF patients had oliguria or anuria latrogenic factors contributed to the ethiology of ARF in 35.3% of patients. Hospital stay was doubled by ARF the presence of ARF and the mortality was 36.4%. The rate was higher in ARF arising in hospital than in ARF acquired before admission. Factors that had a significant influence on the mortality rate were comorbid conditions, oliguroanuria, ARF of renal origin and serum albumin. We conclude that ARF has a high incidence, morbidity and mortality in this elderly population. Volume depletion, associated cardiovascular pathology and pharmacological treatment are important etiological factors in those with ARF outside hospital. Adequate treatment of ARF and avoidance of nephrotoxic medications are necessary in hospital.","3055":"Fabry disease is an X-linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a partial or complete deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A. Intracellular accumulation of globotriaosylceramide, the glycolipid substrate of this enzyme, leads to severe painful neuropathy with progressive renal, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular dysfunction and early death. Men are predominantly affected but many female carriers have similar clinical involvement, including increased risk of stroke. Physical stigmata, such as angiokeratomas in skin and mucous membranes and characteristic benign corneal abnormalities, facilitate identification of Fabry disease. The finding of a marked decreased activity of (alpha-galactosidase A in plasma, white blood cells or cultured skin fibroblasts confirms the diagnosis. Treatment thus far has been symptomatic only. Etiology-based therapies are being developed that include enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy, and substrate deprivation. The recently completed double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of intravenous infusions of (alpha-galactosidase A in patients with Fabry disease demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this treatment.

Several authors described that up to 95% of \"essential\" mixed cryoglobulinemia could be attributed to this viral infection. Nevertheless, its prevalence and clinical significance are not well known. We review our experience in relation with the clinical, biological and evolutive characteristics of patients diagnosed of type II mixed cryoglobulinemia. Descriptive and protocolized study of all cases found to have type II mixed cryoglobulinemia over a period of 8 years. Secondary cryoglobulinemic nephropathy was defined in a restrictive way: a plasma creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg\/dl and\/or proteinuria &gt; 500 mg\/24 h and\/or hematuria (&gt; 15 red blood cells) need to be present in the absence of any other pathological conditions that could justify these alterations. Furthermore, the information obtained from available kidney biopsies was considered. 62 patients have been detected. C virus infection was demonstrated in 44 (72%). 52% had clinical symptoms related with cryoglobulinemia. 56% had alteration of renal tests, and 17 (27%) fulfil the conditions for the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemic nephropathy (nearly all with persistent microhematuria, median proteinuria 4.2 +\/- 3.9 g\/24 h; median plasma creatinine 2.8 +\/- 1.8 mg\/dl). Nine patients had been histologically examined, showing 6 cases a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis pattern, one with associated extraglomerular vasculitis; two with mesangial proliferative pattern and one with membranous glomerulonephritis. The most striking differences between cryoglobulinemic nephropathy patients and the rest has been: higher amount of cryoglobulins (49 +\/- 28 vs 20 +\/- 22); more frequent hypocomplementemia, especially C4 (93% vs 59%) and recurrent purpura (75% vs 32%). No differences in the presence of C virus infection could be observed (75% vs 71%). 72% of patients with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia are infected by C virus (so 28% in our serie are \"essential\"); 52% have symptoms related with the presence of cryoglobulins, half of them with cryoglobulinemic nephropathy.

The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential interaction between sildenafil therapy and circulating levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in a group of steady-state renal transplant recipients with erectile dysfunction. A prospective pilot study of sildenafil interactions was carried out in 9 stable male renal transplant recipients with severe erectile dysfunction (mean age 50 +\/- 8 years, range 38-64). All patients were receiving therapy with calcineurin inhibitors (5 with cyclosporine and 4 with tacrolimus). Erectile dysfunction was evaluated by clinical history, physical examination, International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) questionnaire and the nocturnal penile tumescence test (RigiScan). Each patient received a first dose of 50 mg of sildenafil, one hour before sexual activity and a second dose at 72 hours of 50 or 100 mg according to the clinical response to the first dose. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of sildenafil and the evolution of cyclosporine-tacrolimus levels. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus trough whole blood concentrations were determined in basal conditions (before starting sildenafil) and on days 1, 4 and 7 after sildenafil therapy. Eighty-nine percent of patients (n = 8) required a complete 100 mg dose of sildenafil. There was a positive clinical response in two-thirds of cases (6 patients). In 5 patients (55%) sildenafil administration produced a complete response, in one patient the response was incomplete, and in the remaining 3 cases (33%) no clinical response was observed. Associated side effects included self-limited tachycardia in one patient and mild visual disturbances in another. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus levels remained stable in all patients. There were no significant differences in circulating levels of cyclosporine (basal 120 +\/- 47; day 1: 116 +\/- 55; day 4: 123 +\/- 56 and day 7: 121 +\/- 56 ng\/ml p = NS) or tacrolimus (basal 11.6 +\/- 1.3; day 1: 11.9 +\/- 1.3; day 4: 11.1 +\/- 1.0 and day 7: 11.8 +\/- 0.9 ng\/ml p = NS) over the study period. Sildenafil therapy is safe and effective for the treatment of erectile dysfunction in renal transplant recipients. Recommended therapeutic doses of sildenafil did not modify cyclosporine and tacrolimus trough blood levels. ","3066":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are a group of heterogeneous lymphoid proliferations in chronic immunosuppressed recipients which appear to be related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Receptor EBV seronegativity, use of antilymphocyte antibodies and CMV disease have been identified as risk factors that may tigger development of PTLD. We have studied the incidence of PTLD and its relationship with EBV in 588 adult renal transplant recipients who were transplanted in our hospital from 1988 to 2001. We have also evaluated the diagnostic and therapeutic methods used, the risk factors and outcome of the patients who developed PTLD. We identified 8 recipients (4 males and 4 females), range from 18 to 67 years (mean age 45.6 years) with a median time between grafting and PTLD of 4.1 years (0.1-7 years), who developed PTLD (1.3%). Only 1 patient received OKT3 and had CMV disease, two of them (25%) had been treated with hight doses of prednisolone, another was EBV seronegative, but the rest of them (50%) had no risk factors. Two patients were diagnosed at autopsy, the diagnosis of 5 was based on the histology of biopsy and the last one by CT scans of chest-abdomen and cytology. The presence of EBV in the lymphoproliferative cells was assessed in 5 out of the 7 studied patients (71.4%). The outcome of our recipients was poor. Five out of 8 patients died shortly after diagnosis as a direct consecuence of PTLD and another of an infectious complication of the treatment (75%). The 2 patients alive started dialysis and 1 of them died 2 years later of a non-related cause. In conclusion, PTLD is a relatively frequent disease with a poor prognosis in renal transplant patients. It seems to have a close relationship with EBV and can develop in the absence of the classical risk factors.","3067":"Although the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in chronic renal failure is not clearly defined, the improvement in cardiovascular disease outcomes in the general population has resulted in its use in dialysis patients. The hemorrhagic risk of hemodialysis patients treated with anti-platelet agents has not been clarified. Our aim was to evaluate the risk of bleeding in hemodialysis patients treated with antiplatelet agents. We assessed haemorrhagic complications (HC) in 190 haemodialysis patients from May 1998 to August 2000. HC was defined an event that required hospitalization and\/or blood product transfusion. We evaluated the bleeding events in the haemodialysis patients treated with antiplatelet agents and compare them to those not receiving this therapy to establish the relative risk of bleeding. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to establish the relationships between the haemorrhagic event and the following variables: age, gender, time on dialysis, dialysis membrane (synthetic or cellulosic), systemic anticoagulation during haemodialysis, anaemia (haematocrit), PTH, urea, dialysis efficacy (Kt\/V), hypertension, diabetes, use of erythropoietin and antisecretory gastric agents. 81 (42.6%) were treated with antiplatelet agents. Of the 190 patients, 28 (14.7%) had 36 haemorrhagic events (10.3 episodes\/100 patient-years); 31 digestive-tract haemorrhages, 4 intracranial and 1 pulmonary. Twenty (24.7%) of patients treated with antiplatelet agents had 16.2 episodes\/100 patient-years and 8 (7.3%) without this therapy had 6 episodes\/100 patient-years (p &lt; 0.01). In the multivariate analysis the antiplatelet therapy remained associated with higher probability of having a haemorrhagic complication (OR 3.8; CI 95%: 1.52-9.76, p = 0.004). Older age (OR 1.03; CI 95%: 1-1.06, p = 0.043), anaemia (OR 0.91; CI 95%; 0.84-0.9, p = 0.027) and hypertension (OR 2.99; CI 95%: 1.05-8.48, p = 0.039) remained associated with the risk of bleeding. 88.2% of patients that had a digestive-tract haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy were receiving an antisecretory agent (histamine H2-receptor antagonist or a proton-pump inhibitor). 1) dialysis patients with antiplatelet therapy had a higher haemorrhagic risk. The relative risk of bleeding was more than three times that of the dialysis population without antiplatelet therapy, and 2) older age and hypertension were associated with the haemorrhagic risk. Optimal correction of anaemia was associated with less probability of bleeding. ","3068":"Haemodialysis patients frequently have simultaneous hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, posing a therapeutic dilemma for the traditional calcium--and aluminum--based binders. RenaGel (sevelamer hydrochloride) is an effective phosphate binder without changes in serum calcium or aluminum levels. However being an expensive medication it is currently used mainly for patients with moderate to severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. However most of the previous studies have not included patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Our purpose is to determine RenaGel binder efficacy in haemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. As a secondary purpose we have followed the variations of parathyroid hormone, serum calcium, serum lipids [low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and Lipoprotein(a)], uric acid and bicarbonate. All phosphate binders previously used were suspended one week before RenaGel prescription. Our study included 18 adult haemodialysis patients, with PTHi of 810 +\/- 330 pg\/ml after the \"pre-treatment\" washout. The binder was administered during 12 weeks, beginning with a mean dose of 2.4 +\/- 0.4 g daily and adjusted to obtain serum phosphorus under 6.5 mg\/dl (at the end of the study, the mean RenaGel dose was 2.8 +\/- 0.6 g daily. The mean changes after RenaGel in serum phosphorus was -0.7 +\/- 1.5. mg\/dl (P &lt; 0.05), in serum calcium was 0.5 +\/- 1.0 mg\/dl (P &lt; 0.05) and in calcium x phosphate product of -4.0 +\/- 12.4 mg\/dl (P = NS). \"Post-treatment\" the PTHi levels remained stable (820 +\/- 360 pg\/ml vs 810 +\/- 330) but serum alkaline phosphatase increased (14.3 +\/- 14.4 U\/l; P &lt; 0.01). LDL cholesterol serum levels decreased by -35 +\/- 10 mg\/dl (P &lt; 0.01), HDL cholesterol showed a trend to increase (3.0 +\/- 8.1 U\/l; P = NS), triglycerides decreased by 38 +\/- 56 mg\/dl (P &lt; 0.05) and Lipoprotein(a) remained stable. Serum albumin increased by 0.1 +\/- 0.2 g\/L (P &lt; 0.05), uric acid decreased -0.8 +\/- 1.2 mg\/dl (P &lt; 0.05) and bicarbonate remained unchanged. RenaGel is an effective phosphate binder, even in haemodialysis patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. The lipid profile improved with the treatment, with the exception of Lipoprotein(a) stabilization. Selection of patients with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism at the beginning of RenaGel disposal, for economic reasons is debatable, but could be correct. ","3069":"Protein calorie malnutrition is a common complication in chronic hemodialysis patients (CHP). Although many factors could promote malnutrition, inadequate nutrient intake seems to be one of the most important. An Appetite and Diet Assessment Questionnaire (ADAQ) was developed, and we have performed a cross-sectional study in 44 CHP to investigate its capacity to predict an inadequate intake. Dietary evaluation was based on a diet diary-assisted recalls (DDAR). On the other hand, the validity of PCR and the differences in the DDAR and ADAQ between the days of dialysis and the days without dialysis were studied. The predictive value of inadequate intake of the ADAQ and the PCR were analysed with the ROC curve. The protein intake was 1.3 +\/- 0.3 g\/kg\/day and the energy intake 29.2 +\/- 0.6 kcal\/kg\/day. The average PCR was 1.14 +\/- 0.3. The ROC curve to predict inadequate intake from the ADAQ shows an area under the curve of 0.84 for the protein intake and 0.73 for the energy intake. A cut-off ponit of 18 gives a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 44% for the detection of poor protein intake (&lt; 1.2 g\/kg\/day) and of 74% and 56% for the detection of poor energy intake (&lt; 30 kcal\/kg\/day). The ROC curve to predict inadequate protein intake from the PCR obtains an area under the curve of 0.81. The cut-off 1.06 gives the best sensitivity (100%) and specificity (64%) for the detection of insufficient protein intake. We did not find any significant difference in the DDAR or in the ADAQ between the days of dialysis and the days without dialysis. Despite the subjective interpretation, the relationship between ADAQ and protein-energy intakes analysed by DDAR was highly significant. The questionnaire is simple and can therefore be used as a screening rest to detect and correct alterations in the diet which could otherwise lead to malnutrition. The determination of PCR gives a good sensitivity and specificity for the detection of poor protein intake, although the results are modified in anabolic or catabolic states which can clinically go undetected. We do not register differences in diet between the days of dialysis and the days without dialysis.","3070":"From the results of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study, a prediction equation for a more accurate estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), was developed. The present study ais to compare the GFR estimated by MDRD formula and that calculated by the average of creatinine and urea clearances in unselected patients with advanced renal failure. The study group consisted of 320 (163 males) with advanced renal failure not yet on dialysis. Their mean age was 63 +\/- 14 years. Diabetic nephropathy was the most common etiology of renal failure (25%). Significant comorbidity was observed in 115 patients. Serum creatinine (Cr), urea and albumin were determined in all patients. Creatinine (Ccr) and urea clearance (Cu) were calculated on a 24-hour urine collection. The GFR was estimated by summing Ccr and Cu, and dividing by two (Ccr-Cu). THe clearances were corrected for a body surface area of 1.73 m2. The MDRD formula for the estimation of GFR included the following parameters: serum Cr, BUN, age, gender and serum albumin. Linear regression analysis and Bland-Altmann plot were utilized to establish the degree of correlation and agreement between both estimations of GFR. The percent differences between the two estimations of GFR was especially analyzed in those subgroups of patients which were not included in the MDRD study (patients older than 70 years, diabetics and those with comorbid conditions). The mean GFR estimated by Ccr-Cu and by MDRD formula were 10.04 +\/- 3.10 ml\/min and 10.55 +\/- 3.60 ml\/min, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). The two parameters correlated significantly (R = 0.76, p &lt; 0.0001). GFR by the MDRD formula tended to overestimate the highest values of Ccr-Cu. The mean percent difference between both methods was 6.5 +\/- 23.6. MDRD predictive equation overestimated significantly Ccr-Cu in patients older than 70 years (mean overestimation of 15%), males (10%), diabetics (10%), and mainly in patients with comorbidity (17%). In conclusion, the GFR estimated by MDRD formula is very similar to Ccr-Cu in young uremic patients without comorbidity. However, major discrepancies between these two methods could be observed in older patients, and mainly in those with comorbidity.","3071":"","3072":"","3073":"","3074":"","3075":"","3076":"","3077":"","3078":"","3079":"","3080":"","3081":"","3082":null,"3083":"Infection due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent opportunistic infection following renal transplantation (RT). It is usually asymptomatic. Cytomegalovirus disease causes fever leucopenia, thrombocytopenia and slightly elevated transaminases. The development of severe invasive forms is uncommon nowadays with post-transplantation monitoring, prophylactic regimens in high-risk patients and early treatment with ganciclovir. We report two renal transplant recipients who presented with severe gastrointestinal bleeding as the first manifestation of CMV disease at 9 and 14 weeks after transplantation. In both patients repeated post-transplantation pp65 antigenemia monitoring was negative. One patient developed hypovolemic shock due to severe rectal bleeding; an atypical bleeding ulcer was detected in the ileocecal valve. The other patient presented with upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage from a bleeding duodenal ulcer. Histological and immunohistochemical study confirmed the diagnosis. Both patients were elderly and on triple therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisone. We discuss the role of mycophenolate and the new immunosuppressant agents as factors favoring a state of enhanced immunosuppression, which may facilitate the onset of severe atypical forms of CMV disease.","3084":"We present two cases of uremic patients with poor medical control of their secondary hyperparathyroidism. They had to undergo surgery to control symptoms. A total parathyroidectomy with autotransplant in the forearm muscles was performed. After a symptom-free period, both showed a recurrence of their hyperparathyroidism. A double phase 99mTc-MIBI scintigraphy was essential in order to correctly locate hypertrophic parathyroid gland. In one case there was a cervical recurrence and in the second patient hyperplasia in a forearm gland autotransplant was found. Both patients remained asymptomatic with medication during their follow up.","3085":"One recent report have recommended to start calcitriol therapy with a dose according to PTH levels, rather than starting with a fixed dose increasing it according to PTH response. As there are no clinical studies supporting this strategy we tested his hypothesis. Haemodialysis patients from 28 centres (N = 141) were included, the aim was to achieve a PTH between 100 and 285 pg\/mL (goal) in 6 months. The main inclusion criteria were: serum PTH &gt; 250 pg\/mL, Ca &lt; 10.5 mg\/dL, P &lt; 6.5 mg\/dL and Ca x P &lt; 60. Patients were divided according PTH into 4 groups and calcitriol was dosed accordingly. A (PTH 250-350; 0.5 microgram), B (PTH 351-550; 1-1.5 micrograms), C (PTH 551-750; 1.5-2 micrograms) and D (PTH &lt; 750 pg\/mL; 2-3 micrograms). PTH was measured monthly in groups A, B, C and fortnightly in D. Ca, P and Ca x P were measured fortnightly (groups A, B, C) and weekly in D. According to PTH results calcitriol was modified, reducing 50% if PTH was suppressed &gt; 60%, and increasing 50% if PTH suppression was &lt; 15% (fig. 1). Patients were stopped treatment and excluded from study when Ca, P and Ca x P product trespass the established inclusion criteria. The study was completed by 100 patients, 34 with strict compliance of the protocol (compliant), and 66 with one o more protocol violations, the most frequent was lack of strict adherence to the dosing regime (non compliant). Among the compliant, 82.4% reached the goal in contrast with 13.8% of the non compliant (p &lt; 0.001) (table II). In addition, the compliant showed (all patients in all groups) a greater and significant decrease in PTH (from 616 +\/- 288 to 202 +\/- 82), by contrast, 21.5% of the non-compliant did not decrease--but increased--their PTH levels. The compliant showed also fewer side effects than the non-compliant (25% vs 55.6%, p &lt; 0.006). These results demonstrate several advantages when starting calcitriol therapy with a dose proportional to the severity of HPTH.","3086":"Cyclosporin A is a lipogenic immunosuppressor that can induce posttransplant hyperlipidaemia. Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been recognized as a major atherogenic factor. Tacrolimus seems to be less lipogenic with an apparently better cardiovascular profile than CsA. We have studied the lipidic profile and the oxidation of HDL and LDL in 20 renal transplant patients, 12 male and 8 female, mean age 45 +\/- 10 year, who where switched from CsA to tacrolimus due to CsA adverse effects. LDL were determined by ultracentrifugation. Oxidation study before and 6 months after conversion to tacrolimus was performed by adding CuSO4. After conversion, systolic blood pressure (BP) decreased from 154 +\/- 21 to 133 +\/- 21 mm Hg (p = 0.008), diastolic BP from 97 +\/- 13 to 77 +\/- 15 mm Hg (p = 0.016), total cholesterol from 6.08 +\/- 0.9 to 5.68 +\/- 1.1 mmol\/l (p = 0.02), LDL-chol from 3.29 +\/- 1.01 to 2.96 +\/- 0.3 mmol\/l (p = 0.04) and apo-B lipoprotein from 1.42 +\/- 0.28 to 1.15 +\/- 0.34 mg\/dl (p = 0.003).

Lag-phase increased from 33 +\/- 21 to 45 +\/- 17 min (p &lt; 0.05). Tacrolimus has improved hyperlipidaemia in our cyclosporin previously treated patients and increased the resistance to oxidation of high and low-density lipoproteins. ","3087":"Proteinuria is a risks factor that accelerates the progression of renal insufficiency by several mechanisms. In the renal transplant proteinuria is a predictor of progressive renal insufficiency and it is associated with poor patient and graft survival. We have performed a longitudinal observational case-control study to defect and quantify proteinuria in a group of 100 cadaveric renal transplant recipients and to evaluate the influence of several factors on its appearance. We have considered the variables age and sex of the donor and recipient, number of HLA-DR, A and B mismatches, cold ischemia time, basal renal disease, initial immunosuppression, immediate versus delayed graft function and acute rejection. Three patients who did with a functioning graft were excluded from the analysis of the data. All variables were analysed in a regression model of multivariate analysis. Proteinuria in the moths 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 was: 0.38 +\/- 0.27 g\/day, 0.38 +\/- 0.32 g\/day, 0.44 +\/- 0.99 g\/day, 0.42 +\/- 0.58 g\/day and 0.37 +\/- 0.54 g\/day, respectively. We analysed the profile of the proteinuria in each patient individually. Fifty three patients (54.6%) did not develop proteinuria, 12 patients (12.4%) had transient initial proteinuria, 23 patients (23.7%) had persistent proteinuria and 9 patients (9.3%) had progressive proteinuria. The renal function differed between groups. Higher creatinine levels were found in the patients with persistent proteinuria and those with progressive proteinuria. We analysed the patients according to several variables. The age of the donor was higher in the group of patients with persistent proteinuria and the incidence of acute rejection was higher in the group of patients who developed progressive proteinuria, with differences statistically significant. There was no difference in the univariate analysis in the other variables considered. The multivariate analysis confirms that the age of the donor and the basal glomerular disease predict persistent proteinuria and acute rejection predicts progressive proteinuria. According to our study, proteinuria is frequent in the renal transplant recipient with different evolutionary profiles. Two types are associated with bad renal function and have different predictive factors. We encourage the use of drugs which reduce proteinuria.","3088":"Icodextrin (IC) is an osmotic agent that produces sustained ultrafiltration (UF) during long dwell time periods in peritoneal dialysis patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of 7.5% IC for the diurnal exchange in automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients and to compare them with that of 2.27% glucose solutions. Seventeen patients treated on APD during 13.9 +\/- 12.7 months were included. The study was divided into three eight weeks phases. During the baseline period patients used 2.27% glucose for the daytime, second, IC 7.5% was prescribed for the day-exchange, and finally 2.27% glucose solution was used for the last eight weeks. Daytime UF increased in all patients during IC use (-53 +\/- 22 to 270 +\/- 304 ml\/day, p &lt; 0.01). Patients with higher peritoneal permeability capacity obtained more benefits. Daytime urea KT\/V and weekly creatinine clearance (WCC) augmented significantly during IC use, but the increase of weekly urea KT\/V and WCC was not significant (2.18 +\/- 0.45 to 2.26 +\/- 0.41 and 62.7 +\/- 18 to 66.6 +\/- 15 l\/week\/1.73 m2; respectively). On IC, nightly glucose load significantly decreased (289 +\/- 82 to 266 +\/- 94 g, p &lt; 0.05), returning to previous value after withdrawal. Plasma osmolality did not change, although plasma sodium levels decreased during IC use (140 +\/- 3 to 136 +\/- 2, p &lt; 0.001). Serum amylase levels significantly declined during IC use (279 +\/- 151 to 29 +\/- 9 U\/l), returning to previous values after transfer to glucose. Peritoneal function transport parameters and peritoneal protein losses did not change. IC metabolite plasma levels increased during the use of this solution, returning to previous values after withdrawal. In conclusion, IC dialysate is an excellent alternative to glucose dialysate for the day-exchange in APD patients. Daytime UF increased in all patients, but those with higher peritoneal permeability capacity obtained more benefits. The decrease of the glucose peritoneal load overnight and the reduction for more than 50% of exposure time of the peritoneal membrane to glucose solutions, probably make IC solution a more biocompatible fluid.","3089":"The aim of this study was to compare, under standard conditions (Peritoneal Equilibrium Test, \"PET\"), the peritoneal permeability to water and several solutes using icodextrin and glucose (3.86% and 1.36%) dialysates.

PETs with icodextrin were performed in all of them (n = 14); PETs with 3.86% glucose were carried out in 7, and PETs with all the three solutions were performed in 5 patients. Samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, 120, 240 minutes, and after the rinsing procedure using 1.36% glucose in order to calculate the residual volume. Sodium concentration in the effluent and D\/P sodium did not change significantly from minute 0 to 240 with icodextrin and 1.36% glucose; but with 3.86% glucose both sodium and D\/P sodium decreased at thirty minutes, remained at the same levels till the 120 minutes and then had a tendency to increase. Glucose concentration and osmolarity in the effluent did not vary throughout the time with icodextrin, but progressively decreased during the 4-hour period with 3.86% and 1.36% glucose solutions. The drainage after the 4-hour period was higher for the 3.86% glucose (2,608 +\/- 388 ml, p = 0.03) than for the 1.36% glucose (2,070 +\/- 120 ml) or the icodextrin (2,212 +\/- 213 ml). Low molecular weight permeability: D\/P creatinine after the 4-hour dwell was significantly lower for the icodextrin (0.66 +\/- 0.1, p = 0.05) than for the 3.86% glucose (0.71 +\/- 0.1) or the 1.36% glucose (0.72 +\/- 0.1). The creatinine clearance for 3.86% glucose (7.4 +\/- 0.4 ml\/min p = 0.007) was higher than for icodextrin (5.6 +\/- 0.5 ml\/min) or for 1.36% glucose (5.8 +\/- 0.6 ml\/min). The clearances for total protein, albumin and beta 2-microglobulin did not show significant differences between the solutions. Our study confirms that the icodextrin solution remains iso-osmolar with plasma during the 4-hour dwell. The sodium profile suggests that the ultrafiltration induced by icodextrin and 1.36% glucose depends on small pore-mediated sodium and water transport; on the other hand, 3.86% glucose also induces transport of water without solutes throughout the ultra-small aquaporin-mediated, pores, producing sodium dilution in the effluent. Ultrafiltration and solute clearances for icodextrin are lower than for 3.86 glucose during a 4-hour dwell.

In cases of primary ISM, the difference between the two treatments with MMF drops so, low that its loses statistical significance (7,206 and 6,443 euros). This is because the dose of MMF is 50% higher in cases treated with Cs, even though there is no difference in the trough level of MMF. The use of hypolipidemic agents (with a mean annual cost of 451 euros) is much lower in treatments with T in comparison with Cs (13.8% vs 41.4%, p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences could be established between T and Cs regarding the use of hypotensive agents and the frequency of postransplant insulin dependent diabetes. The treatment of ISM with T is more expensive than Cs based treatment but the difference is reduced in combination with MMF because of the use of lower doses of MMF in the association of T with MMF. The considerable economic impact of ISM would justify the provision of greater resources to the rationalisation of the treatments currently being applied.

Analysis of clinical variables: delayed graft function (DGF), acute rejection (AR), infections and comorbidity; analytical: haemogram, albumin and serum creatinine, hepatic function, cyclosporin levels; instruments for assessing the HRQOL: Psychological General Well-being Index (PGWBI) and Euroqol-5d (EQ-5d) health questionnaire, which includes a self-assessment scale of the state of health, Visual Analogical Scale (VAS). Controlled collection of data upon discharge following renal transplant, and subsequently 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following the first questionnaire. There were no differences between patients on azathioprine or MMF, except that AR occurred less frequently with MMF (7% vs 42%, p = 0.065). Global AR: 23%, cytomegalovirus infection\/illness: 81%\/8%, readmissions: 42%. There was an improvement in HRQOL measured by the progressive increase in the scores on the PGWBI, EQ-5d and VAS during the first three months following RT. By the sixth month, in comparison to the third, a decrease in the score was observed (PGWBI, p = 0.011). Later the HRQOL improved, but without reaching the maximum scores achieved. Patients on MMF showed less frequent incidence of AR. The HRQOL decreases during the third and the sixth month, but with less intensity in patients on MMF, probably related to the lower rate of AR, and excluding the over 60s. ","3113":"To choose the best possible dialysis technique for those patients with end-stage renal disease continues to be a matter of debate. Even after putting aside the evident influence that economic and geographic factors as well as the health politics may have in the selection of the technique, different studies comparing survival between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) have shown contradictory results which could be explained by the differing methodological and statistical methods used together with the different influence assigned to the comorbidity found when starting the treatment, a situation that has increased the confusion about this topic. Based on this we performed a retrospective analysis with a follow-up time of seven years including all those patients who started dialytic treatment in our area, with a final number of 3.106 hemodialysis patients and 542 peritoneal dialysis patients. Those patients who were transferred to another treatment technique during the time of the study were excluded. Age higher than 70 years, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, diabetes mellitus and the presence of dyslipidemia were included as comorbidity factors. Peritoneal dialysis patients were younger than those treated by hemodialysis (54.53 vs 60.1 years), but suffered from higher cardiovascular comorbidity and were more often diabetic. The global survival was the same in both groups up to 32 months of treatment. Although no differences were found when comparing those patients without comorbidity factors, those with comorbidity had better survival on hemodialysis. Age higher than 70 years was the only comorbidity factor with statistically significant difference for a better survival in hemodialysis.","3114":"To determine whether symptoms of anxiety or depression are factors associated with poor compliance of fluid restriction and dietary selection in chronic renal failure patients in hemodialysis. A cross-sectorial, descriptive, comparative and correlation study was designed between january and march of 2000, patients were selected in 3 hemodialysis centers of Social Security in Lima with Karnofsky index &gt; 80, without an acute failure of treatment or default from therapy in the last 3 months. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory and Anxiety Symptoms with the Zung Scale. Poor compliance with fluid restriction was defined as an interdialytic weight gain &gt; or = 2.5 kg and dietary restriction as a level of predialysis serum potassium &gt; or = 6 meq\/L. The evaluation of risk factors was made with a simple and multiple logistic regression analysis. Eighty eight patients were selected, 47 (53.4%) were men, the average values of age, time on dialysis, level of creatinine and hemoglobin were respectively 55.9 +\/- 15.8 years old, 48.8 +\/- 38.8 months, 8.5 +\/- 1.9 mg\/dl and 7.7 +\/- 1.4 g\/dl. The number of patients with adequacy of dialysis, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, poor compliance with fluid restriction and dietary selection were respectively 50 (62.5%), 54 (61.4%), 46 (52.3%), 47 (53.4%) and 31 (35.2%). The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that depressive symptoms are the only factor associated with poor compliance with fluid restriction (OR = 2.7, p = 0.002) and dietary selection (OR = 2.5, p = 0.0067). Depressive symptoms and them severity had a positive correlation with poor compliance. Depressive symptoms and its severity is associated with a higher interdialitytic weight gain and higher predialysis serum potassium in hemodialysis patients. Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention might benefit these patients. ","3115":"Urolithiasis is a common clinical disorder.

Our objective in this epidemiological study in a general population was to know the frequency, the potential risk factors, the morbidity, and social and economical impact of the urolithiasis in our subtropical Caribbean country. The prevalence was 4.64% and the annual incidence was 0.1%. Both are with in the estimated range of urolithiasis frequency in the world. It mainly started between 20 and 29 years in both genders. The white (5.2%) and the male (6.36%) patients were the most affected. 40% of all patients had a family history of urolithiasis. It was highly associated with diabetes mellitus, ischaemic cardiopathy, urinary tract infection and arterial hypertension. Stone formation was related to the warmer season. High calcium, protein-purine, carbohydrates and oxalic acid intake together with low fluid intake were closely associated with this disorder. 85% of patients had suffered renal colic and 75% of them more than once. Stone recurrence affected 33.8% of patients and 54.5% of them had more than one recurrence. Procedures for stone removal were needed in 33.8% of subjects. 40% of all patients were admitted to hospital due to urolithiasis morbidity. Non-specific medical treatment had been taken by 49.2% of the patients and specific treatment by none. Urolithiasis in this population was the some as has been reported in others studies. It has shown high frequency, increasing incidence, the same risks factors, high morbidity, and high social and economical impact.

The aim of our evaluation in these patients was: a) to study the correlation between office blood pressure (BP), self-monitored (SMBP) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). b) To study the correlation between these methods and cardiovascular and renal complications. We studied 60 patients (mean age 66.7 +\/- 9 years, mean duration of diabetes 11.3 +\/- 7 years) with arterial hypertension, type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Macroangiopathy and echocardiography were recorded. We measured, SMBP and ABPM without modifying the antihypertensive treatment. The white coat phenomenon (WCP) was determined and patients were classified as dippers or non dippers according to their blood pressure diurnal rhythm. Mean glycated haemoglobin was 7.8% and mean serum creatinine 1.2 +\/- 0.5 mg\/dl, 30% of patients had proteinuria and 70% microalbuminuria The mean number of antihypertensive drugs was 2.2 +\/- 1. The mean BP was: Office BP: 158.2 +\/- 24\/85.3 +\/- 9 mmHg, pulse pressure (PP) 72.9 +\/- 21 mmHg; SMBP: 145.4 +\/- 18\/77.5 +\/- 7 mmHg, PP 67.9 +\/- 18 mmHg and BP in the early morning 150.2 +\/- 20\/79.9 +\/- 9 mmHg; ABPM: diurnal mean 138.9 +\/- 15\/74.1 +\/- 6 mmHg, PP 64.8 +\/- 15 mmHg and BP in the early morning 146.5 +\/- 16\/78.5 +\/- 7 mmHg. The three techniques showed a good correlation and WCP was detected in 46.7% of patients with SMBP and in 56.7% with ABPM. We found no correlation between BP and macroangiopathy, but an increase of systolic BP in SMBP and ABPM in proteinuric patients were found and correlation between mass left ventricular index (MLVI) and PP in office and systolic BP and PP in SMBP and ABPM was significant. 70% of patients were non dippers, with a higher MLVI. Decreases in BP in type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy are difficult of maintain despite combinations of different antihypertensive drugs. These patients present an important WCP and worse prognosis data, such as elevation of systolic BP, increased PP, poor night BP fall and a BP rise in the early morning. Also, we can't reduced the BP during 24 hours in an important number of patients. These characteristics can be detected by combining the office BP measurement, SMBP and ABPM. The alternative possibility would be lifestyle modification, appropriate drug combinations and to start treatment at lower levels than those currently used as thresholds (the guidelines for antihypertensive treatment have been drastically shifted in this direction over the past years). ","3145":"Type II diabetic patients with albuminuria are at high risk for cardiovascular complications; the intense antihypertensive treatment required often involves using drug combinations. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of two different, renin-angiotensin blocking combinations, on blood pressure (BP), albuminuria and glycemic control. Its design was prospective, randomised, controlled, of parallel branches, and performed in one Endocrinology Department, in Spain. 77 type-II diabetic patients, with stable albuminuria (30-1,000 mg\/day) were included. After a pre-inclusion time of 2 weeks, patients were randomised to verapamil SR\/trandolapril 180\/2 (VT) or losartan\/hydrochlorothiazide (LH) 20\/12.5 mg\/day. Duration of treatment was 1 year. The evaluated parameters were changes in blood pressure, urinary albumin excretion for 24 hours, glycated hemoglobin and plasmatic urea. Overall BP significantly decreased from 161.6 +\/- 18.7\/83.6 +\/- 10.2 mmHg to 137.2 +\/- 15.7\/70.9 +\/- 8.3 mmHg (p &lt; 0.0005). Values, by treatment, were: For VT, 164.3 +\/- 18.5\/87.2 +\/- 10.7 mmHg at baseline and 135.0 +\/- 15.1\/71.3 +\/- 8.4 mmHg at conclusion. For LH, 158.8 +\/- 17.4\/80.1 +\/- 8.4 mmHg at baseline and 139.3 +\/- 16.1\/70.5 +\/- 8.2 mmHg at conclusion. Albuminuria significantly decreased from 308.2 +\/- 544.7 mg\/day to 198.0 +\/- 285.3 mg\/day. Both parameters showed no significant difference between treatments. Glycated hemoglobin decreased from 7.59 +\/- 1.3% to 7.14 +\/- 1.2% in the VT group, and from 7.96 +\/- 1.29% to 7.84 +\/- 1.62% in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.022). Changes adjusted from baseline values showed a trend to the difference between both treatments (p = 0.092). Plasmatic urea increased from 39.8 +\/- 12.7 to 40.5 +\/- 11.1 mg\/dL in the TV group and from 43.4 +\/- 12.0 mg\/dL to 52.4 +\/- 19.4 mg\/dL in the LH group (ANOVA, p = 0.028). In conclusion, both treatments reduce blood pressure and albuminuria in a similar way in type II diabetic patients. The verapamil\/trandolapril combination contributes to a better carbohydrate metabolism than losartan\/hydroclorothiazide.","3146":"Diabetic glomerulosclerosis is the most frequent cause of renal disease in patients with type II diabetes mellitus (DM), sometimes accompanied by vascular lesions. However, other glomerular pathologies are important in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of non-diabetic nephropathy (NDN) in selected patients with type II DM, and to identify clinical markers that may predict its presence in this population. We reviewed 20 renal biopsies performed on twenty patients with type II DM. Nine of them showed diabetic nephropathy (DN) (45%), whereas eleven showed NDN (55%): 1 IgA nephropathy, 3 vasculitis and 7 membranous nephropathy. We found no differences between the two groups with regard to sex, duration of DM, insulin therapy, glycosylated haemoglobin, proteinuria, presence of nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, serum IgA level or renal size. The NDN group had haematuria in 63.6%, whereas the patients with NDN had it in 44.4% (NS). Body mass index was higher in NDN patients (30 +\/- 6.7 vs 22 +\/- 2.9; p &lt; 0.01), The same was true for creatinine clearance (82.2 +\/- 51.4 ml\/m vs 40.4 +\/- 19.6 ml\/m; p &lt; 0.05). The age at the moment of diagnosis was higher in ND patients (67 +\/- 11.2 vs 54.3 +\/- 4.6; p &lt; 0.05). The 3 patients who had diabetic retinopathy were found to have DN on renal biopsy (diagnostic specificity = 100%), although 66.7% of the patients with diabetic glomerulopathy had no retinopathy. We conclude that patients with type II DM with renal findings suggesting non-diabetic renal disease frequently it have NDN, and a renal biopsy must be performed. The presence of retinopathy has a predictive value of 100% in predicting DN, therefore its existence may make this diagnostic procedure unneccesary.","3147":"Patients with type 2 diabetes use to be managed in their primary care settings during the early stages of the disease. The main objective of the study was to determine renal impairment prevalence, and to assess its significance, within type 2 diabetics controlled by their family physicians. Transverse observation of patients with type 2 diabetes who were the first 20 unselected cases seen by 183 family physicians from 16 of the 17 Autonomic Communities of our country. The following variables were determined: serum creatinine, glucose, and HbA1c concentrations, proteinuria (dipstick test in a first-voided morning urine sample), blood pressure levels, and associated cardiovascular disease. Data from 3,583 type 2 diabetic subjects were evaluated. Mean age was 64 +\/- 10 years and 45% were male. A serum creatinine &gt; or = 1.2 mg\/dl was observed in 523 (15.5%) patients. Proteinuria was present in 794 (23.5%) cases, being &gt; or = 2 + in 215 (6.5%) subjects. Patients with a serum creatinine &gt; or = 1.2 mg\/dl were older, shower higher blood pressure levels, and suffered from more cardiovascular disease (32.0 vs 19.5%) than those with a serum creatinine &lt; 1.2 mg\/dl. In a multivariate analysis, this difference continued to be significant (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14 to 1.90; p = 0.002. Patients with proteinuria showed a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.27; p &lt; 0.0001) than those without proteinuria. This association was continuous through no proteinuria to the &gt; or = 2 + proteinuria (p &lt; 0.001). Blood pressure level was &gt; or = 140\/90 mmHg in 69% of the cases, being &lt; 130\/85 mmHg in only 8% of the subjects. There is a high prevalence of renal impairment, approximately of 25% within type 2 diabetic patients seen at the primary care level. Optimal blood pressure level seems to be extremely infrequent bearing in mind the diagnosis of diabetes and the associated cardiovascular disease.

The study included 1,053 outpatients with serum creatinine lower than 2.5 mg\/dl referred to our nephrological laboratory for serum creatinine and GFR determination using the C-G formula. Patients were grouped into two groups: normal renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1.3 mg\/dl) and \"incipient\" abnormal renal function (serum creatinine 1.3-2.5 mg\/dl). In the group of females with normal creatinine 22% (60-70 y), 35% (70-80 y) and 57% (&gt; 80 y) had GFR values below 50 ml\/min. In the group of males 11.3% (70-80 y) and 33.3% (&gt; 80 y) also had GFR reduction in spite of normal serum creatinine.

To evaluate efficacy and safety of anti-CD325 monoclonal antibody (basiliximab) versus polyclonal antibodies as induction therapy in renal transplantation. Thirty consecutive kidney transplants performed in children 4-16 years age in Hospital Infantil La Fe through 1997-2000. The first 15 patients received polyclonal antibodies as induction therapy, and 15 consecutive ones received monoclonal anti-CD25 antibodies. Receptor, donor and graft characteristics were similar in both groups. Also, maintenance immunosuppression was the same. The follow-up was over one year in all patients. Four patients in the polyclonal antibody group suffered one acute rejection episode and four other patients had some drug reaction. In the anti-CD25 treatment group there was one episode of acute graft rejection and no collateral effects were observed. Glomerular filtration rate, proteinuria, hypertension, infection episodes, graft and patient survival were similar in both groups.

Patients who were started on RRT after acute renal failure were excluded. We carried out a retrospective analysis of the demographic characteristics, patients' conditions at the time of initiating dialysis and outcome and costs at six and thirty-six months of treatment. Patients were classified as planned (PL-D) or unplanned dialysis (UNPL-D), depending on whether or not the patient had a vascular or peritoneal access ready to use for initiating RRT. One hundred and eighty-six patients (51.4%) started on dialysis in the PL-D group whereas 176 (48.6%) did it as UNPL-D. In this latter group, 135 (37.3% of the total) had previously been monitored by a nephrologist, and 41 (11.3%) initiated dialysis without previous nephrological follow-up.

Immunocytochemical methods detected an enhanced expression of von Willebrand factor antigen on uremic ECMs (uremic 17.1 +\/- 4.2% vs control 13.57 +\/- 3.98%, p &lt; 0.05) and its mRNA expression in endothelial cells (uremic 213.24 +\/- 6.13 vs control 200.77 +\/- 7.52, p &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that uremic medium alters endothelial function and impairs the antithrombotic functions of cultured endothelial cells. This effect may contribute to the increased cardiovascular and thrombotic risk reported in ESRD patients.","3184":"The treatment of severe lupus nephritis is based on the combination of steroids and cytotoxic drugs. Intravenous cyclophosphamide administered in \"pulses\" is effective in the induction of remission but other therapeutic alternatives are sought in refractory cases or severely relapsing patients. Mycophenolate mofetil, used in renal transplantation, also can be useful in severe lupus nephritis. We describe the evolution of 6 patients (5 women and 1 man; age 17-45 years) with severe lupus nephropathy who after achieving remission with intravenous cyclophosphamide and steroids (5 cases) or cyclosporin A (1 case) showed relapse of proteinuria and were treated with mycophenolate mofetil (dose 1000-2000 mg\/day). Two patients have completed 24 months, 1 patient two cycles of 12 months, 2 patients 18 months and 1 patient 6 months. After this treatment, all patients have achieved remission (3 partial and 3 complete). There was no treatment failure and no one patient discontinued medication; however 1 case relapsed. There were no changes in leucocytes, haemoglobin, serum creatinine and serum albumin. ANA and alpha DNA antibodies decreased. Proteinuria (measured as protein\/creatinine urine ratio: initial 3 and final 0.3) and dose of steroids (initial: 17.5 mg\/d and final 5 mg\/d) decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05 Wilcoxon t-test). The most common side effects were nausea and abdominal discomfort that improved without discontinuation of treatment. We conclude that mycophenolate mofetil is effective and a safe drug in severe relapsing lupus nephritis.","3185":"","3186":"","3187":"","3188":"","3189":"The renin-angiotenin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is not only involved in cardiovascular disease but also in renal pathophysiology and progression of renal disease. Several polymorphisms of genes coding for components of the RAAS have been identified. The I\/D polymorphism of the ACE gene, a variant of the angiotensiogen gen, the M235T polymorphism, and the variant A1166 C polymorphism of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene are the most important. Several studies have suggested a potential role for I\/D polymorphism of the ACE gen in the progression of renal diseases and in the cardiovascular death rate of patients with renal failure. Data on RAAS polymorphisms as determinants of the prevalence of renal diseases and the response to renoprotective therapies are conflicting. Given the polygenic nature of renal and cardiovascular disease and the growing number of candidate genes, large prospective and collaborative studies are required to assess the effect of RAAS polymorphisms on the progression of renal disease and on the response to renoprotective therapies.","3190":"Molecular biology techniques have provided important advances in the search for causal relationships in complex diseases supporting traditional epidemiologic studies. Genetic epidemiology allows us to detect genetic variants that could be related to the onset and progression of different diseases. In cardiovascular and renal diseases, this approach linking traditional risk factors to new described ones and those allelic variants, which contribute to the development of these manifestations permits a better understanding of individual disease susceptibility. This is usually afforded through case-control studies evaluating allelic variants of candidate genes previously associated with the disease. Even in this candidate gene search, association-based methods are more powerful than linkage studies in complex traits if we assume that some of the typed polymorphisms are causative although with subtle phenotypic effects. Some brief examples may illustrate the progress in the understanding of renal and cardiovascular diseases.","3191":"Renal transplants have experienced a spectacular development in recent years, significantly improving the quality of life and life expectancy of patients. However, mortality due to cardiovascular disease in recent years has become the first cause of death in renal transplant patients, ahead of infections and neoplasic disorders. The causes of this increase are due to the following reasons: 1) Important changes in the characteristics of the donor and the renal receptor. 2) A significant decrease in the immediate post-transplant mortality rates, and 3) increase in the incidence of cardiovascular risk factors in transplant patients.","3192":"Dialysis patients constitute a high-risk subset of patients for developing cardiovascular disease, which accounts for nearly 50% of deaths. After stratification for age, race and gender, cardiovascular mortality is 10-20 times higher in dialysis patients than in the general population. Cardiovascular disease in this population cannot be fully explained by the high prevalence of classical cardiovascular risk factors (age, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, etc.). Thus, the involvement of \"new\" cardiovascular risk factors (hyperhomocysteinemia, hyperfibrinogenemia, high lipoprotein (a) levels, oxidative stress, inflammation, etc.), and uremia-related factors (anemia, impaired calcium-phosphorus metabolism, hyperparathyroidism, accumulation of endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis, etc.) has been also invoked to play a role in the increased cardiovascular risk in these patients. Endothelial dysfunction is the initial event in the development of atherosclerosis. Uremic patients exhibit an endothelial dysfunction, even before starting dialysis, which persists o is even aggravated under dialysis treatment. Uremic patients must be considered at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Thus cardiovascular risk factors in these patients should be managed early, aggressive and multifactorially in order to reduce their high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.","3193":"Cardiovascular complications are the main cause of death in patients with chronic renal disease. These complications are due to two important morphological changes. Firstly, left ventricular hypertrophy together with the changes in the cardiac remodelling and myocardiac fibrosis constitute the lesion with the highest incidence in renal chronic disease. Secondly, disease in the large arteries (macrovascular disease) involve two types lesions: Artherosclerosis, which is characterised by the formation of plaques in the intima arterial membrane and artherosclerosis due to lesions in the media arterial membrane, which causes a loss in elasticity of the arterial tree.","3194":"Diabetes patients with concomitant diabetic nephropathy are especially destined to cardiovascular complications due to the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria, that are potent inductors of dyslipidaemia. We have studied 98 type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, 61 male and 37 female, mean age 63 +\/- 13 year old, all of them with overt proteinuria (above 500 mg\/day), divided into 4 groups: G-I (n = 13): patients with t. cholesterol &gt; 6.25 mmol\/l treated with fibric-acid derivatives; G-II (n = 52): hypercholesterolemic patients treated with statins; G-III (n = 20): hypercholesterolemic patients with no lipid-lowering intervention; G-IV (n = 13): normocholesterolemic patients (control group). Lipidic profile, proteinuria and renal function have being compared after 1, 3 and 5 years. Base-line characteristics of the patients were similar when regarding age, onset of diabetes or nephropathy. Only proteinuria was higher in statins-treated group (p &lt; 0.05). Fibric-acid derivatives were more effective on hypertriglyceridaemia while statins were more effective lowering LDL cholesterol. A gemfibrocyl-treated patient presented a rhabdomyolysis episode. Statins were safe and well tolerated. Nine patients (19%) in G-II, 2 patients (10%) in G-III and 1 patient (7%) in G-IV achieved end-stage renal failure. Five-year cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality rate were 23%\/23% in G-I, 13%\/19% in G-II, 20%\/25% in G-III and 31%\/31% in G-IV. The difference was statistically significant when comparing normocolesterolemic versus statin-treated patients (p &lt; 0.05). Lipid-lowering therapy could probably delay but not avoid the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Since dyslipidaemia is closely related to the progression of cardiovascular disease and mortality, an aggressive lipid-lowering therapy is recommended, irrespectively of its potential effect on diabetic nephropathy. ","3195":"A cumulative incidence of diabetic nephropathy of 30-35% has been documented after duration of diabetes of at lest 25 years in type 1 diabetes mellitus and 15-25% in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetic Nephropathy has become the leading cause of chronic renal failure. Several strategies has been suggested to prevent renal disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. Two main treatment strategies for primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy are improved glycaemic control and lowering the blood pressure particularly with angiotensing-converting-enzyme inhibitors. Other therapeutics include, lipid-lowering therapy, dietary protein restriction, smoking cessation and aspirin therapy.","3196":"Nephroangiosclerosis and nephrosclerosis are terms used to define the renal disease induced by essential hypertension. The predominant histologic changes occur in the preglomerular microvasculature. Epidemiological data about the risk of hypertensive patients from developing renal failure offer conflicting results. Nevertheless, renal vascular disease, including nephroangiosclerosis and\/or ischemic nephropathy, appears to be an important cause of end-stage renal disease. Presumably, nephrosclerosis is the renal expression of systemic atherosclerosis: male sex, age &gt; 55-60 years, black race, high serum cholesterol and\/or uric acid levels, and coronary heart disease, peripheral artery disease, and\/or cerebrovascular disease are common associations with the renal alteration. Treatment strategy should include an intensive blood pressure control, probably below 130\/80 mmHg, together with antiplatelet and lipid-lowering agents when necessary. Although specific studies are lacking, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists may offer additional benefits in slowing the renal disease progression.","3197":"The incidence of arterial hypertension increases with age in such a way that by the age of 60 the incidence is greater than 50% in men and women. This increase is particularly relevant if we consider the changes in systolic blood pressure (increase) and diastolic blood pressure (decrease) in relation to age and as a consequence in the reduction of vascular compliance which is common in men and women over the age of 60. These disorders are associated to artheriosclerosis and the corresponding increase in pulse pressure. It is for these reasons that the most common form of hypertension is isolated systolic hypertension (SBP &gt; 140 mmHg and SBP &lt; 90 mmHg), which represents 50% of hypertensive patients in the elderly population. Isolated systolic hypertension is also associated to an increase in cardiovascular disease (MI, stroke), increasing the risk of mortality four times. In elderly people, hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension are risk factors that can be managed. Today there is sufficient evidence from clinical trials that show a clear benefit in the reduction of the cardiovascular and renal risk associated to the antihypertensive treatment in the elderly, at least when the blood pressure is greater than 160\/90 mmHg. The target blood pressure figures to control in the elderly person, probably below 160\/90 mmHg, still need to be determined.","3198":null,"3199":"","3200":"","3201":"","3202":"","3203":"","3204":"","3205":"","3206":"Burkitt's lymphoma is a tumour often associated with low immunity as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (l3) or infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Calciphylaxis is characterized by dermal arteriolar calcification that leads to skin ulceration, necrosis, ischemia and secondary infection. The pathogenesis is poorly understood, although the calcium phosphorus product has been proposed as a major cause. Given the high morbidity and mortality rate, emphasis should be placed on prevention and early diagnosis of vascular calcification, as well as in prophylaxis of secondary infection. We present changing concepts in four patients receiving dialysis.","3208":"Paracetamol poisoning is manifested by hepatotoxicity, but acute renal failure is very rare, especially when there is no fulminant hepatic damage with encephalopathy or severe haemodynamic alterations. We present here the case of a 22-year-old woman who presented with acute renal failure after the ingestion of 11.5 g of acetaminophen. The clinical course and laboratory data were consistent with tubular necrosis. The patient required hemodialysis, but finally renal function returned to normal. The acetaminophen pharmacology and the differential diagnosis of acute azotemia in paracetamol overdosage are reviewed.","3209":"","3210":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes are irregularly distributed among the different geographic area and groups at risk. To study the different HCV genotypes and subtypes of hemodialyzed patients from Alicante. We studied 640 patients on haemodialysis (HD) and we determined the RNA-HCV and the genotypes in the 120 patients with antibodies against HCV (HCV-Ab). We compared the results with the genotypes of 1,370 patients from other groups at risk in the same geographic area. RNA-HCV was not found in the serum in 15% (18\/120) of the patients on HD who were HCV-Ab positive. Prevalence of the different genotypes in the 102 patients with positive viral RNA was the following: 1b: 56.8% (58\/102), 1a: 19.6% (20\/102), 3: 17% (17\/102), 2a-2c: 1.9 (2\/102), 2b: 0.9% (1\/102) 4: 2.9 (3\/102), 5: 0.9% (1\/102). In conclusion, the genotype 1b was the most frequent in the patients studied in all these areas, and was the same as in the rest of the country. This genotype has been associated with the most severe hepatic disease and poor response to treatment, affecting the prognosis of these patients. The most frequent genotypes in HD in Alicante were 1b, 3 and 1a. HCV genotypes distribution among the HD units was not uniform in the different geographic areas. HCV genotypes distribution in the HD population is similar to other groups at risk from the same geographic area. ","3211":"The aim of this study was to analyse our experience with icodextrin in Andalusia, Spain. The study includes 51 patients (30 women and 21 men) on peritoneal dialysis (21 on CAPD and 30 on Automated Peritoneal Dialysis) treated with icodextrin for 10.3 +\/- 7 months (0-41 months). Their mean age was 57 +\/- 18 years (18-86 years). We have recorded the appearance of side effects, and the evolution of several biochemical parameters at baseline and after 6, 12 ans 18 months from initiation of icodextrin. We also studied drainage fluid from 12 patients after an icodextrin exchange. There were side effects (all cutaneous) in 4 out of 51 patients (7.8%). Two of the affected suffered from cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, and icodextrin had to be suspended; the other two had exfoliative dermatitis affecting hands and feet that disappeared without have to withdraws icodextrin. Biochemical parameters: Serum sodium levels decreased from baseline to six months (138 +\/- 6 mEq\/l vs 136 +\/- 3 mEq\/l; p = 0.006), and then persisted at the same levels throughout the rest of the study period. There was a slight but significant decreased of serum HDL-cholesterol at six months vs baseline (55 +\/- 26 mg\/dl vs 51 +\/- 20 mg\/dl, p = 0.04), and a further decrease at twelve months vs six months (42 +\/- 15 mg\/dl vs 51 +\/- 13 mg\/dl, p = 0.054). There were no significant variations of glucose, osmolality, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol (tendency to increase), triglycerides, beta 2 m and weight (tendency to increase; p = 0.08). In relation with the icodextrin exchange: average ultrafiltration 296 +\/- 119 ml (ranging from 104 to 480 ml), creatinine clearance 1.9 +\/- 0.5 litres (20.5% of daily creatinine clearance), urea clearance 2.08 +\/- 0.5 litres (18.7% of daily urea clearance), total protein losses 3.2 +\/- 0.9 g, albumin losses 1.4 +\/- 0.5 g; urea and creatinine clearances were negatively correlated with ratios D\/P4 of urea and creatinine of PET and positively correlated with ratio G4\/G0. In conclusion, side effects are scarce with the use of icodextrin. As described in other studies, there is a trend to a slight decrease in serum sodium. The long-term use of icodextrin does not-prevent weight gain or deterioration of patients on peritoneal dialysis, despite the diminution of glucose load. ","3212":"Pre-eclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality in mother and baby. With the increasing understanding of the disease process, the number of complications, and the maternal and perinatal deaths have fallen over the last few decades in the developed countries. In other parts of the world, the rates of mortality and morbidity remain high. We present eight cases of pre-eclamptic women with severe complications (eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, acute pulmonary edema, acute renal failure...) that were treated at our hospital in only a year, when we had not seen these pathologies in the last nine years. There was fetal death in three of the cases, related to abruptio placentae. There were no maternal deaths, but four mothers needed to be transferred to the intensive care unit, and required life-support techniques. The causes of these new events remain unclear. Can they be due to increase in maternal age or to the high incidence of abruptio placentae? Or maybe can they occur only by chance? These women with pre-eclampsia and severe complications that can have potentially devastating consequences are not an easily identified group. We concluded that women with pregnancy hypertension must be carefully managed by expert physicians, particularly if they are more than 30-35 years old, overweight, with previous history of hypertension or nulliparous, in order to decrease these several complications.","3213":"Previous studies have shown that acute inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis improves sodium and water excretion and increases blood pressure in cirrhotic rats with ascites, thus suggesting that NO is an important factor contributing to the arterial hypotension and sodium retention of liver cirrhosis. In the present work we have analyzed the renal effects derived from the chronic oral treatment (10 days) with aminoguanidine (AG, 100 mg\/kg\/day), a preferential inhibitor of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), or Nw-Nitro-L-Arginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME, 0.5 mg\/kg\/day), a nonselective inhibitor of NOS, in an experimental model of liver cirrhosis with ascites (carbon tetrachloride inhalation). Untreated cirrhotic rats showed lower mean arterial pressure (MAP), diuresis, natriuresis and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and similar renal blood flow (RBF) compared with the untreated control rats. Chronic administration of AG did not modify significantly any parameter in cirrhotic and control animals. Conversely, long-term L-NAME administration to cirrhotic rats normalized MAP and significantly increased water and sodium excretion, whereas in control animals these parameters were not significantly modified. These results show that chronic NO synthesis inhibition with L-NAME, but not with aminoguanidine, improves renal perfusion pressure and increases the lower sodium and water excretion of cirrhotic rats with ascites. Thus, an enhanced production of NO is an important factor contributing to the renal sodium and water retention characteristic of liver cirrhosis.","3214":"","3215":"","3216":"","3217":"","3218":"","3219":"","3220":"","3221":"","3222":"","3223":"","3224":"","3225":"","3226":"","3227":"","3228":"","3229":"","3230":"","3231":"","3232":"","3233":"","3234":"","3235":"","3236":"","3237":"","3238":"","3239":"","3240":"","3241":"Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare endocrine tumor whose management is difficult whenever surgery does not achieve complete en bloc resection or recurrence is detected.

We present a case report of a patient with recurrent PC after two surgical interventions who was treated with octreotide (SMS-201) taken into account the positive somatostatin staining of the specimen obtained during the last surgery. Short term effects (-2 weeks-) included a decrease in urinary calcium excretion paired with a simultaneous increase in urinary phosphorus excretion. Later on, continuous subcutaneous octreotide administration kept urinary calcium excretion at low levels and this effect was completely reversible\/reinducible upon discontinuation\/reintroduction of the drug. Neither iPTH nor total serum calcium were modified at short or long term basis. The lack of clear-cut therapeutic effects make this findings a pure clinical observation. Thus, octreotide cannot be recommended for the treatment of parathyroid carcinoma.","3242":"We report an 85 years-old patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and both clinical and biochemical nephrotic syndrome. The renal biopsy showed membranous nephropathy at stage I-II. There was no evidence of malignancy. The patient was treated with steroids, and two months later the proteinuria had not improved. The objects under discussion are the factors that should lead to suspect the existence of glomerulonephritis, other than diabetic glomerulosclerosis, suggesting the need for kidney biopsy. We also focus on the prognostic and therapeutic relevance, as well as on the common pathogenic aspects.","3243":"Acute hemolytic anemia is one of the side effects associated with cyclosporin and tacrolimus therapy, and three mechanisms have been described to account for hemolytic anemia in patients receiving these drugs: drug induced hemolysis, autoimmune hemolysis and alloimmune hemolysis resulting from donor lymphocytes derived from the allograft (passenger lymphocyte syndrome). We report four cases of renal transplant recipients who developed alloimmune hemolytic anemia due to minor ABO incompatibility while under treatment with cyclosporin (two) and tacrolimus (two). The anti-erythrocyte antibodies responsible for hemolysis were of the IgG isotype and showed anti-A or anti-B specificity. These findings suggest that the hemolysis could be related to alloantibodies derived from the clonal development of donor B lymphocytes in the recipients (microchimerism). In summary, hemolytic anemia due to ABO-minor incompatibility occurs infrequently after renal transplantation. Risks are higher for patients A, B or AB blood group receiving an O blood group graft under treatment with cyclosporin or tacrolimus. Follow-up of these patients is warranted for the early detection and optimal management may be achieved by reduction of immunosuppression and change to mycophenolate mofetil.","3244":"","3245":"Since the immune response in older recipients has been described as weaker they may have a lower risk of rejection of a transplanted organ. Therefore a less aggressive immunosuppressive regimen should be the best option. The aim of our study was to evaluate the incidence and severity of acute rejection (AR) episodes on graft survival of older patients (&gt; or = 60 years) and to compare them with the younger ones (&lt; 60 years). A total of 439 kidney transplants were performed between 1\/94 and 12\/99 at our Transplant Unit. Clinical and immunological data, incidence and severity of AR and cause of graft loss were recorded. Patients were divided into two groups, according to age at transplantation [A (&lt; 60, n = 342\/77.9%) and B (&gt; or = 60, n = 97\/22.1%)]. The percentage of aging recipients and mean age of both donors and recipients increased through the period of study. Although the incidence of acute tubular necrosis was higher in the older group (31% vs 22.8%, pNS), the incidence of AR was also similar (31.6% vs 29.8%, pNS). The number of AR episodes per patient was 0.44 and 0.41 respectively. The incidence of AR was higher in those patients who had ATN (50% vs 19.6%), p &lt; 0.01). The severity of AR was: Banff grade I: A (40.3%)\/B (45.7%) pNS; grade II: A (44.1%)\/B (48.5%) pNS; grade III: A (15.6%)\/B (5.8%) pNS. One-year patient survival was 96%\/91% (p &lt; 0.001) and graft survival was 81%\/78% (pNS) respectively. The age of recipient does not seem to have a significant influence on the incidence and severity of AR or on graft survival. So immunosuppression should be individualized for each patient.","3246":"During liver failure there is an accumulation of toxic substances secondary to the loss of liver function. In order to eliminate these substances various extracorporeal depuration therapies have been employed. Recently, we have used a new treatment, MARS (Molecular Adsorbent Recirculating System), in 3 patients diagnosed with severe liver failure. This system consists of an albumin rich (20%) dialysate circuit, with two areas of depuration. In one area, the albumin dialysate is in contact with blood through a high-flux albumin coated membrane, where albumin bound substances are eliminated. In the other area, the albumin dialysate is in contact with a standard bicarbonate dialysate through a low-flux membrane, which permits the elimination of water soluble substances. The albumin of the circuit is continuously regenerated through charcoal and ion exchanger filters. In order to determine those liver failure patients suitable to receive MARS therapy we established several inclusion criteria. All patients underwent a complete clinical and biochemical evaluation before and after each treatment. All of them showed an improvement of their clinical (attenuation of pruritus and encephalopathy) and biochemical (decrease of bilirubin levels) parameters. During the period of treatment 2 patients developed an increase in plasma creatinine levels together with a decrease of urinary volume. There were no hemodynamic or technical complications during the treatment. These promising results deserve further controlled studies large enough to permit confirmation.","3247":"Biocompatible hemodialysis membranes induce a smaller inflammatory response in hemodialysis patients, and remove a larger amount of higher molecular weight retention products, then cellulose membranes. These phenomena could improve uremic anemia in hemodialysis patients. The objective was to evaluate the effects of biocompatible AN69 membranes on anemia in hemodialysis patients. Twenty-five stable patients undergoing hemodialysis with cuprophane membrane for more than 6 months were studied prospectively. These patients were stratified in 2 groups. Group I (GI): 14 patients switched over to a more biocompatible dialyzer (from cuprophan to AN69) and Group II (GII): 11 patients continued treatment with the same cuprophan membrane. The study lasted 5 months. Baseline hematocrit (%), ferritin (ng\/mL), transferrin saturation (%), KTV, PCR (g\/kg\/day) and dose of erythropoietin (EPO) (UI\/week) were measured and were revised monthly. Target hematocrit was 33%-35%. A significant increase of hematocrit became obvious after 2 months in GI without changes in dose of EPO and intensity of dialysis, meanwhile GII remains stable. Hemodialysis using AN69 membranes increases hematocrit without modifying intensity of dialysis. ","3248":"Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) employing a 2.27%\/2.5% glucose exchange is the most widely used method of to evaluating peritoneal function and small solute transport. Hypertonic (3.86%\/4.25% glucose) PET has been recently recommended for the evaluation of ultrafiltration and to study certain causes of ultrafiltration failure, such as aquaporin dysfunction, through the analysis of dialysate sodium. However, there is not enough information on the optimal way to express the changes in dialysate sodium concentration, the normal range of values for this parameter, and possible adverse effects of hypertonic PET in the general population of peritoneal dialysis patients. A hypertonic PET was performed in 22 patients. Ultrafiltration failure (ultrafiltration &lt; 0.4 L) was present in seven patients. Patients with ultrafiltration failure had higher small solute peritoneal transport and dialysate sodium concentration and had been treated with peritoneal dialysis for longer periods of time. Dialysate sodium concentration at 60 and 240 minutes was directly correlated with small solute peritoneal transport calculated as D\/PCr240 (r = 0.74, p = 0.0008 y r = 0.84, p &lt; 0.0001) and inversely correlated with ultrafiltration (r = 0.64, p = 0.0016 y r = 0.72, p = 0.0002). An absence of a dip in dialysis sodium, suggestive of aquaporin dysfunction, was only observed in one patient with a high-average small solute peritoneal transport. Dialysate sodium concentration at 60 minutes is a better discriminator between ultrafiltration failure patients than parameters such as D\/PNa or the absolute dip in dialysate sodium with respect to time zero. We observed the following adverse effects: symptomatic hypotension in 2 patients with preserved ultrafiltration. In conclusion, hypertonic PET allows to confirm the diagnosis of ultrafiltration failure, but monitoring dialysate sodium concentration offers additional information only in patients with severe aquaporin dysfunction. Hypertonic PET may have adverse effects in patients without ultrafiltration failure.","3249":"The genetic functional variant C for T in position 825 of the gene encoding G protein beta 3 subunit, GNB3, has been associated with enhanced G protein activation, cell growth and proliferation. This phenotype is associated with enhanced G protein activation and Na(+)-H+ exchanger activity in cells from hypertensive patients. Salt sensitivity affects approximately 50% of hypertensive patients and constitutes an intermediate phenotype determined in part by genetic factors. An association between enhanced Na(+)-H+ exchanger activity and salt sensitivity has been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible association between the G protein polymorphism and salt sensitivity in patients with essential hypertension. A total of 46 patients were studied and classified according to their blood pressure response to a change in sodium intake from low (20 mmol\/day) to high (260 mmol\/day) into salt sensitive (SS) (n = 20) and salt resistant (SR) (n = 26). GNB3 polymorphism was determined by PCR of genomic DNA and restriction digestion with BseDI. The genotypes distribution among the SS hypertensives was: 8 CC and 12 CT + TT, whereas in SR was: 10 CC and 16 CT + TT (p = 0,577). 24 h mean blood pressure response to salt in the whole group was not different among the different genotypes: CC 4.1 +\/- 5.4 mmHg compared to CT + TT 2.9 +\/- 6.3 mmHg (p = 0.51). There were no significant differences in the salt induced changes in plasma renin activity, aldosterone, ANP or noradrenaline among the different genotypes. These results indicate that the GNB3 C825T polymorphism has no major influence on the pressor response to salt in essential hypertension and therefore do not support its usefulness as an early genetic marker of salt sensitivity in this disease.","3250":"Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritides (RPGN) are forms of necrotizing glomerulonephritis associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) against the antigens proteinase-3 (anti-PR3) and myeloperoxidase (anti-MPO). RPGN have a course of rapid progression to renal failure. We compared the results from the semiquantitative ELISAs for anti-GMB antibodies, PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA and the indirect immunofluorescence technique (IIF) against a new rapid assay (30 minutes) for the same antibodies in patients with clinically suspected RPGN. The semiquantitative ELISAs for anti-GBM antibodies and PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA have a proven diagnostic significance in patients with RPGN I and III. There were no significant differences between the ANCA-GBM screening test and the results from the semiquantitative ELISAs (p &gt; 0.05). We did not find significant differences between the results for PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA from the ANCA-GBM screening test with C-ANCA and P-ANCA IIF values (p &gt; 0.05). We also corroborated that the ANCA-GBM screening test is a diagnostic tool for RPGN I and III as useful as the semiquantitative ELISAs and the IFF technique. The ANCA-GBM ELISA screening test is a tool as useful as the semiquantitative ELISA against anti-GBM antibodies for diagnosis of RPGN I. The comparison of the screening ELISA with the IIF technique and the semiquantitative ELISAs against PR3-ANCA and MPO-ANCA showed similar utility for diagnosis of RPGN III. The advantages of the new screening assay are that three antibodies are tested at the same time, yielding results in only 30 minutes.","3251":"Uruguay is a developing country with 3.16 million inhabitants.

During the 1981-1998 period, about 4,819 patients were treatment, 2,365 patients had died, 454 were transplanted and 51 patients were lost to follow-up due to change in residence. At the start of the treatment, mean age was 57.0 +\/- 17.7 years, 37% were 65 or older than 65 year old, 61.3% were male and 98% of patients were white persons. The most common diseases responsible for End Stage Renal Disease were: hypertension (22%), chronic glomerulonephritis (19%) and diabetic nephropathy (15%). In 1998, there were 44 dialysis units in the country (13.6 units per million population--pmp), 100% of them had water treatment (reverse osmosis 96.8%) and reuse dialyzer. The most frequent causes of death were: cardiovascular and infection. In this paper, eighteen years of the mortality time course of CDT are analyzed. Annual mortality rate was expressed as deaths per 1,000 patients years at risk (M\/1,000). The indirect standardization method was applied to adjust the mortality rate. Two populations were used as standard: the 1996 population of USRDS to adjust for age, sex, race and nephropathy and the 1996 Uruguayan general population to adjust for age. Standardized mortality rate (SMR) for each year was obtained dividing observed deaths by expected deaths. From 1981 to 1998, the incident population increased from 32 to 133 patients per million populations and the prevalent population from 28 to 639 pmp. There was a simultaneously increase in the prevalence of diabetic patients and of patients older than 65 years. The annual mortality rate decreased from 249 to 138 deaths per 1,000 patient years (M\/1,000). The standardized mortality (SM) with the USRDS population as standard decreased from 452 in 1981 to 132 in 1998 and the SMR from 2.07 to 0.60. The SMR with the Uruguayan general population decreased from 17 to 4. In conclusion, these results are similar with those observed in developed countries. There has been a decrease both in the gross and the standardized mortality ratio in the period of observation.","3252":"","3253":"","3254":"","3255":"","3256":"After more than 40 years of clinical renal transplantation, the contribution of humoral immunity to the pathogenesis of allograft rejection is progressively being clarified. With the advent of a new generation of immunosuppressive agents, the production and consequences of anti-donor alloantibodies can now be controlled. In the upcoming years, immunosuppressive regimens that will specifically control both T- and B-cell responses may further improve long-term allograft survival, if the immunosuppressive efficacy of such regimens is not hampered by an increase in infectious, neoplastic or cardio-vascular complications.","3257":"","3258":"","3259":"","3260":"","3261":"","3262":"Secondary amyloidosis is a relatively common pathology in which chronic infectious diseases are common causes, especially infected bronchiectasis, osteomyelitis or chronic ulcers. The association of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis and systemic amyloidosis is extremely rare. To our knowledge, despite innumerable cases of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis reported in the literature, this association has been reported in only 8 previous cases. Patients usually complain of fever, back or flank pain and urinary tract symptoms. A long lasting evolution of the process is frequent. We report a 70 year old patient who developed amyloidosis secondary to xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis. As well as the rarity of this association, this case is exceptional in its clinical presentation, without any urinary tract symptoms that could suggest the diagnosis.","3263":"Calciphylaxis is an unusual complication of chronic renal failure associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This presentation is a clinical case describing a patient parathyreidectomized in 1997, followed by the condition was clinically suspected and then confirmed by skin biopsy. PTHi levels above 400 pg\/ml together with scintigraphic images suggesting parathyroid nodules resulted in the decision to try a new surgical procedure, which yielded two nodules of thyroideal tissue. After the surgery and in spite of this pathology result, the patient recovered completely from her symptoms. This corroborates the theory that the etiology of calciphylaxis is multifactorial, acquiring special relevance the use of calcium-containing phosphathe binders (representing a high risk of hypercalcemia) in the treatment of Chronic Renal Disease.","3264":"A 67-year-old man treated with gemfibrozil for a year development rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure after addition of cerivastatin. The clinical features and serological studies ruled out other causes of rhabdomyolysis. Drugs were stopped and hemodialysis was carried on for 14 days until diuresis occurred. The renal function improved steadily to a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg\/dl two months later. On the basis of its pharmacokinetic profile cerivastatin appears to have less interactions than other statins. There are only two reports of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure due to fibrates and cerivastatin combination. This patient shows the potential risk of a fibrates-cerivastatin combination. When this association is required it is necessary to avoid other nephrotoxic and myopathic factors and to monitor CK levels closely.","3265":"","3266":"The existence of a low-bone turnover, non-aluminium related, has been more prevalent in recent years. Factors involved include the increasing number of older and diabetic patients initiating dialysis. Also higher intake of calcium salts and the widespread use of vitamin D derivates may play a role. Demonstration of low PTH secretion allows the recognition of the group of patients with special risk of adynamic bone disease. Little can be done to improve bone remodelling apart from correct management of risk factors previously mentioned. A decrease in dialysate calcium concentration can act in this way, but the long term effect of this procedure on bone mineral density has scarcely been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long term effect of lowering the dialysate calcium concentration from 3.5 to 3 mEq\/L on bone mass and PTH activity in patients with hypoparathyroidism. We studied 19 patients with PTH &lt; 120 pg\/ml and calcemia between 8.5 and 10.5 mg\/dl, without aluminium intoxication. Blood levels of Ca, P, alkaline phosphatase, aluminium, iPTH and dialysis doses were measured every 4 months during the two years of follow-up. Phosphate binders were closely monitored. Also calcium dietary feeding was measured by a 5-day dietetic registry at the beginning and 6 and 12 months later. Bone mineral density was assessed by quantitative computed tomography of the distal radius initially and after 18 months. PTH values had significantly increased from the first measurement (from 46 +\/- 33 to 97 +\/- 68 four months later). At the end of follow up, 8 patients (42%) had reached the objective of maintaining a PTHi above 120 pg\/ml, while 11 had not reached it (3 were previously parathyroidectomized and two were diabetic). Only one patient has developed an exaggerated PTH response that has been controlled with oral vitamin D. No bone mineral loss was observed during the follow up. In conclusion, the use of a 3 mEq\/l dialysate calcium may improve hypoparathyroidism in a substantial number of patients, avoiding the untoward effect that lower calcium concentration has on bone mineralization.","3267":"The Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most frequent cause of hepatic disease in the dialysis population. Many observations suggest that nosocomial transmission is the principal way of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate HCV outbreak in a hemodialysis (HD) unit, using epidemiological and molecular methods. 50 patients in a HD unit were tested for HCV-RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the hepatitis C genotype determination (reverse hybridization assay). We analyzed the distribution of different genotypes by shifts and dialysis machines and the temporal association in the appearance of the HCV cases. 21 of 50 patients (42%) showed detectable anti-HCV antibodies (HCV-Ab) in serum. The prevalence of HCV RNA positivity was 90.4% (19\/21) among these patients. None of the HCV-Ab negative patients detectable HCV virus in thein blood. The PCR genotyping of HCV RNA was performed in 19 patients. It detected the presence of HCV subtype 1b in 10 out of 19 viremic patients (52.6%), HCV-subtype I a in 31.5% of the patients (6\/19) and genotype 3 in 15.7% (3\/19) of the viremic patients. All patients had been infected by only one genotype. We found epidemiological correlation and temporal association between the genotypes 1b (p &lt; 0.05) and 3 (p &lt; 0.05) with the shifts. The HCV genotype 1a shows statistical association with the machine 1 (p &lt; 0.05) but not temporal association. HCV genotype 1b was dominant in our cohort of HCV-infected patients. There was a high level of agreement between the PCR detection of HCV RNA and the detection of antibodies against the HCV genome. Genotyping and epidemiological analysis suggest that horizontal nosocomial patient to patient transmission plays an important role in the epidemiology of HCV in dialysis patients. There is a need for stringent implementation and regular auditi of infection control measures. ","3268":"The Uruguayan Dialysis Registry (UDR) is an obligatory registry and includes all the patients on dialysis treatment in the country. The dialysis prevalence rate at 12-31-1997 was 604 pmp and the mortality rate in 1997 was 132 deaths per 1,000 patient years at risk. Adjusted mortality of each dialysis center in the country (n = 35) is calculated every year. In this paper, mortality in the different centers was compared applying the usual methodology in order to identify centers with higher mortality and the importance of comorbidity m the mortality comparison among centers was analyzed. 1. The prevalent and incident population of the 1992-1996 period was considered (n 2989). The mortality rate of each dialysis center, adjusted for age and nephropathy by indirect standardization, was calculated. The prevalent and incident population (1985-1991) of the UDR was used as standard. Standardized mortality rate (SMR) for each center and for the total population was obtained dividing observed deaths by expected deaths. 2. The prevalent population at january 1, 1994 was considered (n 1131) and the observation period was extended from january 1, 1994 to december 31, 1997. Demographic and co-morbidity data were collected at the start of the observation period. Multivariate analysis of survival was applied to identify significant risk factors (Cox hazard regression model). The mortality rate of each dialysis center was adjusted for the significant risk factors. Seven centers had significant higher mortality rate adjusted for age and nephropathy than the average of the standard population. Four year survival in the 7 centers (51.6%) was lower than in the other 28 centers (63.6%) (p = 0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, 5 variables (age, diabetes, arteriosclerotic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease) were significantly related with mortality. The relative risk of death, adjusted for the five significant risk factors showed higher significant mortality only in four centers. Three centers did not show mortality differences with the other centers when mortality was analyzed in the multivariate analysis with the significant risk factors. We concluded that adjusting the mortality rate to the significant risk factors allow to discriminate if the differences observed among centers are related or not to an unequal distribution of the risk factors.","3269":"Catheter exit site infection (ESI) remains a common complication in peritoneal dialysis patients. All the efforts for controlling ESI have been focused on the preventive eradication of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) colonization, because this microorganisms has been shown to be implicated in most of ESI. The main aims of the present study was to analyse the long-term results from an eradicative regimen of SA colonization, and to compare them with those obtained from a historical control group. From january 1993 to december 1999, 60 unselected patients on PD underwent an exhaustive protocol of SA eradication. Every 30-45 days, cultures from nares and exit site were obtained in each patient. SA colonization in nares or exit site was treated with mupirocin, though the colonization of other microorganisms was not treated prophylactically. Thirty patients from the same unit who were followed between 1989-1992 served as historical control group. The rate of peritonitis and ESI, as well as the epidemiological data from the cultures were also analysed. The peritonitis and ESI rates were significantly less in the study group than those in the control group (0.398 +\/- 0.553 vs 0.899 +\/- 0.970 ep.\/pat\/year, p = 0.002; and 0.102 +\/- 0.235 vs 0.340 +\/- 0.553 ep.\/pat\/year, p = 0.004). The ESI rate caused by SA was also significantly less in the study group (0.018 +\/- 0.096 vs 0.300 +\/- 0.53 ep.\/pat\/year, p = 0.0001), though there was a statistically nonsignificant increase in the ESI rate caused by gram negative microorganisms in the study group (0.066 +\/- 0.194 vs 0.040 +\/- 0.219 ep.\/pat.\/year). The percent of patients free of ESI was larger in the study group (80% vs 63%, p = 0.01), though the percent of patients with more than one ESI was the same in both groups (10%). Nasal and exit-site SA colonization occurred in 52% and 32% of the study patients. The rate of catheter loss was less in the study group, though it did not reach statistical significance (0.043 +\/- 0.154 vs 0.178 +\/- 0.443 losses\/pat.\/year). In conclusion, the eradication of SA colonization is an efficacious measure for the control of ESI. However, further efforts should be carried out in order to control the emergence of gram negative microorganisms, and to discover which factors make a small proportion of PD patients to be more prone to develop ESI of whatever origin.","3270":"The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of the ACE-1, Trandolapril, alone or with Verapamil on blood pressure, albuminuria and metabolic profile in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and albuminuria. It was an open multicenter, consecutive and prospective study conducted in 281 patients. There was a four-week wash-out period of antihypertensive drugs, after which we carried out a measurement over a 24-h period of the urinary excretion of albumina (UEA). Blood pressure was recorded after at least 5 minutes of rest in the sitting position at 1 to 3 minute intervals with a mercury sphygmomanometer in good condition. Average BP was obtained from three consecutive readings. Within treatment changes were analysed using descriptive statistics and t-tests on the change from baseline. Analysis of variance, chi-square and Mc Nemar tests were also used. If after 8 weeks of treatment with Trandolapril 2 mg o.q.d. the patients were non-responders (mean blood pressure reduction of 5 mmHg or less) or their blood pressure remained uncontrolled (blood pressure &gt; or = 140\/90 mmHg), Verapamil 180 mg o.q.d. was added. Two hundred and thirty patients completed the 12 weeks study. Population included 157 (55.9%) males with an average of 61.7 +\/- 9.2 years. Baseline measurements were systolic 165.4 +\/- 14.6 and diastolic 94.8 +\/- 8.5 mmHg blood pressures, fasting glucose 162.7 +\/- 43.9 mg\/dL, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc) 6.8 +\/- 1.2%, and albuminuria 520.9 +\/- 602 mg\/day. UEA fell significantly (p &lt; 0.001) after treatment to 177.9 +\/- 24.3 mg\/day (CI 95%, 129.9 to 225.8). The percent reduction reached 29.6%. Albuminuria was lower than 30 mg\/day in 47 patients. Blood pressure was completely controlled in 125 (54%) patients. Glucemia fell significantly (p &lt; 0.001) to 153.2 +\/- 42.7 mg\/dL, and the HbAlc to 6.5 +\/- 1.3% (p = 0.012). In summary, in those diabetic type 2 patients with arterial hypertension and proteinuria, Trandolapril alone or associated with Verapamil significant lowered albuminuria and blood pressure facilitated the control or their metabolic profile.","3271":"We report clinical data of a female patient with Bartter's syndrome who was initially diagnosed with idiophatic hypercalciuria and, subsequently, with hyperprostaglandin E, syndrome.

The acid-base balance was normal except metabolic acidosis during the first few days after she was born. When hypercalciuria was observed, she was treated with thiazides and a low-salt diet. With such treatment she frequently showed hypokalemic alkalosis. Afterwards, once it was possible to determine the levels of renin and aldosterone and the urinary excretion of PGE2, we suspected the diagnosis. DNA sequencing analysis showed that the patient carried a homozygotic mutation in the KCNJ1 gene, coding for the potassium channel ROMK, which results in the premature termination of the protein. It is the first time that this mutation has been found in Spain.

Muscle toxicity is an adverse effect reported with a low incidence and rarely associated with acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis. We describe two patients with chronic renal failure treated with pravastatin and simvastatin who suffered rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. One patient started pravastatin several days after cessation of bezafibrate and developed acute renal failure without needing dialysis. The other was treated with simvastatin three years ago and suffered rhabdomyolysis when renal function was impaired after indomethacin was prescribed for backache. He needed hemodialysis because of acute cardiac failure and died from a respiratory infection while on mechanical ventilation. Myopathy was reversible in both patients. We recommend starting statins with the lower doses in chronic renal failure and monitoring muscle enzymes when renal function changes or when new drugs with potential interactions are prescribed.","3331":"Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome is a brain disorder characterized by headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbance, depressed level of consciousness, convulsions and occasionally focal neurologic deficits. It is commonly associated with malignant hypertension, toxemia of pregnancy or the use of immunosuppressive agents. Early diagnosis and specific treatment is essential. We report a case of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy in the context of a hypertensive crisis in an habitual cocaine sniffer. Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy must be suspected in every patient with hypertensive crisis and compatible clinic manifestation. Neuroimaging studies show characteristic features which confirm the diagnosis.","3332":"Renal transplants may undergo changes secondary to the decrease of the renal mass, the effects of rejection, and various other risk factors that contribute to the progression of renal insufficiency. We have performed a prospective study of 285 cadaveric renal transplants recipients, that were receiving various maintenance immunosuppressives regimens, to study the evolution of their renal function and to evaluate the influence of various factors in the progression of renal insufficiency. All variables were analysed in a regression model of multivariate analysis. We found a progressive increase of the serum creatinine in the studied population. The mean initial creatinine was 1.70 +\/- 0.84 mg\/dl and final creatinine in the study 2.17 +\/- 2.06 mg\/dl, difference statistically significant (p = 0.000). We calculated the increase of creatinine in each patient. We observed that 113 patients (42.2%), had stable serum creatinine but the remaining 155 patients (57.8%) had a mean increase of 0.04 +\/- 0.8 mg\/dl\/month. We analysed the patients according to various variables. Although in most the final creatinine is significantly greater than the initial, this increase of creatinine level was not present in patients with delayed graft function, in patients with no acute rejection, in the extreme age groups, in the grafts from younger donors and in those patients without initial proteinuria. The patients transplanted from younger donor had the best renal function, without any decrease in their function during the study. The advanced age of the donor has a great negative impact in the evolution of the renal transplant. According to our study, proteinuria and its quantity is a major predictor of progressive renal insufficiency. The multivariate analysis confirms that the age of the donor and initial proteinuria predict decrease of renal function. It is important to identify the factors that they could predict a greater progression to the failure of the graft. We have the possibility of acting on them, establishing immunosuppressive strategies that reduce the deleterious effects of the calcineurin inhibitors in the recipients of grafts from older donors' and to encourage the use of drugs which reduce proteinuria.","3333":"In this study regular dialysis treatment costs during 1998 and 1999 in a public hospital, which is responsible for a population of 178,000, has been analysed. Hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) costs have been differentiated and compared with those of external providers. The best technical and productive efficiency of both treatments have been estimated by analyzing the \"treatment cost\/human resources of the community utilized\" relationship. The HD treatment costs per patient per year were 20,343 and 18,871 euros in 1988 and 1,999, respectively, lower than the costs reported in other studies. In 1999 these costs were similar to those of external providers and lower than the PD treatment costs (23,295 euros). HD retains its advantage even after costs of erythropoietin, hospital admissions and transport are included. In the hospital studied, the best technical efficiency in HD would be reached with 64 patients on treatment (17,851 euros per patient per year) and in PD with 48 patients (21,167 euros per patient per year). If we take into account our population characteristics and consider a patient distribution of 70% on HD and 30% on PD, the best productive efficiency would be reached with 56 patients on HD (17,916 euros per patient per year) and 24 patients on PD (21,813 euros per patient per year). HD confers the greatest economic and social benefits on the population supplied by the hospital since it provides the community with more jobs than PD in relation to treatment costs while the two yield the same clinical results. In conclusion, HD in a public hospital, at least in our environment, may be efficient and competitive with HD from external providers and it may be more efficient and provide a bigger economic and social profit for the population serviced by the hospital than PD, at least while the current supply systems for this treatment in our country are maintained.","3334":"The mortality among end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT) remains high. An important proportion of these patients die shortly after the initiation of RRT. The present study aims to determine the best predictors for the early mortality in a group of 140 ESRF patients who initiated RRT between october 96 and december 99. The mean age of the study group was 61 +\/- 13 years, and the mean follow-up time was 20 +\/- 12 months. Diabetic nephropathy was the most prevalent etiology of renal failure (30%). The following data, collected immediately before the initiation of RRT, were included as independent variables: demographic and clinical characteristics, including the nutritional status established by the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), follow-up time in the predialysis clinic (less or longer than 3 months), EPO therapy, vascular access, renal function (creatinine and urea clearances, and Kt\/V urea), hematological and biochemical data including serum albumin, bicarbonate, transferrin, PTH and C-Reactive protein, as well as the protein catabolic rate and the percent of lean body mass normalized for ideal body weight, calculated from the 24 h total urine excretion of nitrogen and creatinine. The Cox proportional hazard regression model, stratified for an age over or less than 65 year, was utilized to determine the best predictors for the mortality during the study period. Sixty percent of patients had at least one comorbid condition, and 35% had cardiovascular diseases. Mild-moderate or severe malnutrition was observed in 48% of patients. The creatinine clearance and Kt\/V urea before the initiation of RRT were: 9.50 +\/- 2.64 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 and 1.47 +\/- 0.44, respectively. Forty-one patients died during the study period (annual death rate: 17%). The best predictor of mortality was the nutritional status assessed by the SGA (OR: 2.32, IC 95% 1.54-3.48, p &lt; 0.0001). In a second analysis in which the SGA was removed from the model, the previous history of cardiovascular diseases (OR: 2.07, CI 95%: 1.06-4.06, p = 0.032), and the percent of lean body mass\/ideal weight (OR: 0.96; IC 95%: 0.93-0.99; p = 0.042), proved to be the best predictor of mortality. In conclusion, nutritional indices prior to the initiation of RRT, and the previous history of cardiovascular diseases were the best predictors of the early mortality in this unselected population on dialysis. Because nutritional status appeared to be a marker of the severity of the comorbid conditions, a better control of the number and severity of these comorbid conditions may be the best way for reducing the mortality in patients on RRT.","3335":"Complications arising from vascular access are major causes of morbidity in patients on renal replacement therapy. They contribute to frustration of health care providers and to high medical cost. To prevent failures in the future it will be helpful to identify the factors that are related to vascular access, malfunction. In a retrospective analysis we analysed the types, duration and primary patency rate of 1,033 permanent vascular access in 544 consecutive patients established during a 13-year period in a tertiary care hospital. Patient characteristics, incidence and risk factors related to vascular access failure were registered. In addition vascular access outcomes in patients who started haemodialysis with a catheter and in whom initial vascular access failure occurred were analysed separately. Forty-five per cent of patients required a central catheter at the start of HD, but 92% of them were being dialysed with an a-v fistula at the last observation. The total number of complications was 0.24 episodes per patient per year at risk, and the rate of thrombosis 0.1. A total of 52% of patients were dialysed throughout the observation period with their initial a-v fistula; 9.3% had more than three episodes of vascular access failure. The radiocephalic a-v fistula was the access with the best median duration, exceeding 7 years, but also the type that had the highest initial failure rate, i.e. 25% of patients and 13% of events. The brachiocephalic a-v fistula was the second most frequent type of vascular access, with a median duration of function of 3.6 years, in contrast the humerobasilar a-v fistula, lasted on average over 5 years. Average patency of the different types of grafts did not exceed 1 year, with the exception of the autologous saphenous graft with a median duration of function of 1.4 years. Patients with glomerulonephritis had the best function rates for their access, the median duration exceeding the duration of the study, whereas in half of diabetic patients it was less than 1 year. The duration of patency of the vascular access was twice as long in patients below age 65 years and in elderly males compared to elderly females. Patients who start HD with a catheter, as well as those with initial vascular access failure, have a higher rate of access failure in the subsequent course on renal replacement therapy. In conclusion, the radiocephalic and the brachiocephalic a-v fistula are the two types of vascular access with the longest duration of function, although a high rate of initial failure is seen with the radiocephalic a-v fistula. Age, female gender, presence of diabetic nephropathy, start of dialysis with a catheter, and failure to wait for initial maturation of vascular access are risk factors, and account for the majority of vascular access failure during renal replacement therapy.","3336":"Fourteen renal biopsy specimens from patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis type I (MCGN-I) for whom both light and electron microscopy as well as immunofluorescence microscopy and full clinical data were available were examined quantitatively. As a control 10 biopsy specimens of kidneys removed because of trauma were used. Morphometric investigations were performed by means of a computer image analysis system to evaluate whether mast cells have a role in tubulointerstitial fibrosis in MCGN-I and to examine the relationship between mast cells and interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression as well as interstitial infiltrates. The morphometric study revealed that the mean values of the interstitial tryptase positive cells, expression of alpha-SMA, interstitial volume, CD 68+, CD 45RB+, CD 43+ and CD 20+ cells were significantly increased in MCGN-I patients in comparison with control group. In MCGN-I group there were significant positive correlations between interstitial tryptase positive cells and interstitial expression of alpha-SMA, interstitial volume, serum creatinine as well as CD 43+ and CD 68+ cells. The correlations between interstitial tryptase positive cells and CD 45+, as well as CD 20+ cells did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that mast cells are one of the constitutive cell types in the interstitium in MCGN-I. Additionally, significant positive correlations between interstitial mast cell count and relative interstitial volume as well as serum creatinine concentration suggest the role of these cells in the development of interstitial fibrosis which may contribute to the renal deterioration in patients with MCGN-I.","3337":"","3338":"","3339":"","3340":"","3341":"","3342":"","3343":"","3344":"","3345":"","3346":"","3347":"A 45 year old man with IgA-Kappa myeloma had adult Fanconi Syndrome.

All patients who had been on CHD for a minimum of three months were eligible for the study. Eight of them were excluded: six because they were unable to answer the questionnaires and two because they refused to participate. The 58 remaining patients were the subject of our study (median age 68.5 years; median duration of HD 29.5 months). Diverse sociodemographic and clinical data were recorded. The patients answered the following questionnaires: 1) The \"physical symptoms\" dimension of the Kidney Disease Questionnaire; 2) A measure of anxiety (STAI); 3) A measure of depression (Beck Depression Inventory and Cognitive Depression Index); and 4) The Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). The most frequent and severe symptoms were tiredness, itching, thirst, bone and joint pain and sleep disturbance. The severity of the symptoms was positively associated with female sex, and the presence of clinically relevant degrees of anxiety and\/or depression. A quarter of the patients were anxious and almost half of them suffered from depression. Emotional disturbances were associated with the severity of somatic symptoms and comorbidity. Only anxiety and depression were significantly associated with the global NHP score; they explained 47% of its variance. A score of 50 or more in the \"Emotional Reactions\" dimensions with the NHP detected 69% of the patients with anxiety and 81% of those with depression. Somatic symptoms are common among patients on CHD and they appear to be associated with emotional distress (anxiety and depression) that influences significantly the perceived health status. Measuring the perceived health status by means of generic and specific questionnaires, may help to establish the diagnosis of these problems.

The aim of our study was to analyse the long term results of percutaneous thrombectomy as a treatment of occluded VA for HD. We conducted a prospective study from june 1995 to april 1999, including 123 consecutive thrombectomies in 64 VA in patients submitted to our hospital because of recent thrombosis of VA for HD. We used two different techniques, hydrodynamic catheter thrombectomy (Hydrolyser) in the 42 first procedures (34.1%), and since october 1996 we used mechanical balloon thrombolysis in the remaining 81 patients (65.9%). Underlying stenoses were evaluated by angiography, and treated by angioplasty. After the procedure, intravenous heparin was administered for 24 hours. The VA were 28 Brescia-Cimino arteriovenous fistulae (30.4%) and 64 PTFE grafts (69.6%). mean age: 63 +\/- 15 years (18-84), previous VA: 3.3 +\/- 2.5 (0-9). The mean follow-up was 10.5 +\/- 8.6 months (3-35). Percutaneous thrombectomy was able to remove the clots in 120 instances (technical success: 97.5%). After the thrombectomy 15 patients (16.3%) were immediately referred to the surgeon to perform a new VA due to vascular lesions in which percutaneous treatment was not indicated. Thirteen cases (14.1%) showed early thrombosis (&lt; 72 hours). During the follow-up, 27 cases developed thrombosis (30%) and 26 VA were still patent (28.3%). In 23% of perfusion lung scans and in 2 of the 5 angiographies performed after thrombectomy, subsegmentary or segmentary perfusion defects were detected, without clinical significance. There were no relevant undesirable effects related to the technique and no symptomatic pulmonary embolism. In summary, percutaneous thrombectomy, whether hydrodynamic or mechanical, has shown to be an efficacious treatment of VA thrombosis for HD, preserving the VA with satisfactory long-term results.

Nevertheless the problem has not disappeared. Bone biopsy with specific staining for Al remains the only reliable method for the diagnosis of ARBD. Currently there is not a total agreement on the reliability of serum Al levels and of the DFO test in the identification of patients with Al overload or toxicity. In a series of patients (mean age 48 +\/- 14 years old) from our hemodialysis units we carried out bone biopsy and we studied the prevalence of bone aluminium overload and of ARBD and the usefulness of serum aluminium and of DFO test in their diagnosis. Seventy- three bone biopsies were evaluated by histomorphometric analysis and aluminium staining (Aluminon). Al overload was diagnosed when the Aluminon staining was positive independent of the bone surface covered with Al and of the bone formation rate (BFR). Patients were consider to have ARBD when aluminium covered &gt; 25% of bone surface and BFR was &lt; 0.031 micron 3\/micron 2\/day. Fifteen patients had aluminium overload while 7 patients were considered to have ARBD. Positive Aluminon staining appeared in all histopathological forms of renal osteodystrophy although it appeared mainly in patients with mixed lesion and osteomalacia. Most of the patients with adynamic bone disease had negative Aluminon staining. Patients with aluminium overload showed lower bone formation and mineralization rates. Serum aluminium levels below 40 micrograms\/l were useful to exclude bone aluminium overload. Serum aluminium levels and DFO test were not specific in diagnosing aluminium overload or ARBD. A DFO test with an increment in serum aluminium over 100 micrograms\/l in combination with a serum PTH below 200 pg\/ml was useful to diagnose ARBD.","3354":"Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in ESRD, but about 80% of total homocysteine (tHcy) is bound to albumin (alb). We have tried, prospectively, to reduce tHcy levels by using folic acid (f.a.) and vitamin B6 (P.P.) supplementation. All patients on HD, not receiving f.a. or P.P. and all new patients, after their third month on HD, were supplemented with f.a. 5 mg\/48 hours p.o and P.P. 40 mg\/week. We determined folate, P.P. (RIA), vit. B12, KTV, residual renal function (KRU), PCRn, alb and tHcy levels (HPLC). 80 patients, age 62.6 +\/- 13.6 years, time on HD 16.2 +\/- 25.1 months, all dialysed with AN69 or PPMA, and bicarbonate, were included. The prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia was 84.4%, and P.P. deficit was present in 32%, with folate in the low normal range. At the beginning of the study, before supplementation, tHcy was negatively correlating only with folate (r = -0.336) (p = 0.01), and not with P.P., vitamin B12, age, albumin, KTV, KRU or PCRn. 58 patients received six months of supplementation, with normalization of P.P. levels, a significant increase of folate (7.25; I.C = 95% confidence intervals: 6.45, 8.05 vs 61.29; I.C.: 44.47, 78.11) (p &lt; 0.001), and decrease of tHcy (24.1; IC: 21.5, 26.3 vs 19.9; I.C: 17.5, 22.4) (p &lt; 0.05). 33 patients have received 12 months of supplementation, but in spite of a continued increase of folate (100.78; I.C: 74.81, 126.74) (p &lt; 0.001), only 3 have normal levels of tHcy; correlating directly tHcy with albumin (r = 0.56) (p = 0.001), that had increased compared to the beginning of the study (3.39; I.C. 3.29, 3.49 vs 3.50; I.C: 3.37, 3.63) (p &lt; 0.05). After f.a. and P.P. supplementation, though initially tHcy is reduced, this response is short lived, and tHcy directly correlates with albumin levels. Good nutrition associated with HD adequacy, in absence of B vitamin deficits, seems to be the best determinant of tHcy levels rather than its removal by dialysis tHcy levels should be interpreted taking into account the serum albumin.

A prospective study was performed on 103 patients included in our peritoneal dialysis program. The mean follow-up time was 26 +\/- 21 months. A multivariate analysis (Cox regression was made to identify different risk factors that could influence patient survival during peritoneal dialysis. Age, gender, parathyroid hormone, albumin, cholesterol, and the presence of diabetes mellitus were evaluated as potential risk factors. Patients were distributed in three groups (high, medium and low risk), according to the risk factors with a significant influence in multivariate analysis, and patient survival was studied depending on the prognostic index using Kaplan-Meier estimator. Overall patient survival was 90% (95%CI: 83 to 96%) after the first year and 40% (95%IC: 32 to 58%) after 5 years of follow-up. The Cox regression analysis identified albumin below 4 g\/dL (RR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.16 to 5.72), age older than 65 years RR: 3.10; 95%IC: 1.20 to 7.98) and diabetes mellitus (relative risk, RR: 4.36; 95%IC: 1.43 to 13.31) as independent risk factors for mortality in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. Patient survival after two years was 40% (95%IC: 31 to 59%), 73% (95%IC: 60 a 86%) and 100% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively.

Unfortunately the Spanish experience has not been related in the nephrological literature. Initiation of, and withdrawal from, dialysis pose ethical questions for medicine in the 21st century. The dialysis population is aging and they have multiple medical problems. The choice may be between prolongation of quantity or quality of life. We evaluated a protocol for initiation of dialysis in patients with end stage renal failure and their subsequent withdrawal. We determined the factors predicting withdrawal of dialysis and revised the protocol to take account of these. We carried out an opinion poll of doctors and nurses about the effectiveness of the protocol. We studied prospectively the reasons for death of patients in the last seven years. Thirty patients were withdrawn from dialysis out of 116 who died during treatment by hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in the last seven years. Vascular nephropathy is the principal disease predicting withdrawal from dialysis; the main precipitating cause is mental incapacity. The availability of a protocol for withdrawal of dialysis is well received by doctors and nurses and it engenders moral and legal calm when facing difficult decisions.

Preeclampsia is associated with PPCM. However, cardiomyopathy is an infrequent complication of preeclampsia. Treatment of PPCM is similar to that other types of congestive heart failure. The pregnancy outcome is uncertain. Probably it depends on whether ther heart size returns to normal. We present the case of a 38 years old woman, who developed in an 33rd week of gestation a PPCM.

It is automatic, does not need blood samples and displays the results in real time. The aim of the present study was to compare the Diascan Kt\/V with the Kt\/V obtained with four simple formulas: two based on a single pool model of urea kinetics (Lowrie 1983 and Daugirdas 1993) and the other based on the two pool model (Maduell formulation applied to Lowrie Kt\/V and that proposed by Daugirdas 1995). We have analyzed the inter-method variability, the degree of relationship among the different procedures for Kt\/V calculation and the intra-individual variability. The intermethod variability between Kt\/V Diascan and Kt\/V calculated by the four simple formulas were studied in one hemodialysis session in 19 patients. The Kt\/V Diascan was statistically different from that calculated by the four formulas (1,021 +\/- 0.140 Diascan vs 1,147 +\/- 0.124 for Lowrie-83; vs 1,373 +\/- 0.164 for Daugirdas-93; vs 0.963 +\/- 0.105 for Maduell and vs 1,173 +\/- 0.143 for Daugirdas-95, p &lt; 0.01). The lowest inter-method variability was obtained with the Maduell's Kt\/V (relative difference 9%) but even in this case 37% of patients had a variability above 10%. The correlation coefficient was not high enough to allow an estimation of the different Kt\/V measurements from the Diascan Kt\/V by a regression equation. To study the individual relationship between the Diascan Kt\/V and the Kt\/V calculated by the four formulations, we have determined the Kt\/V every 30 minutes in one hemodialysis session in 30 patients. In all patients we observed a good relationship between the Diascan Kt\/V and the other four (correlation coefficient of 0.9952 for Lowrie-83, 0.9976 for Daugirdas-93, 0.9961 for Maduell and 0.9971 for Daugirdas-95); with these correlation coefficientes it was possible to derive regression equations and to obtain an estimation of the four Kt\/V's from the Diascan Kt\/V. To study the individual variability of each procedure used in the Kt\/V calculations we determined the coefficient of variation of the different methods in 5 consecutive hemodialysis sessions performed under identical conditions in 19 patients. The coefficient of variation was 3.7 +\/- 1.8% for the Diascan Kt\/V; 6.0 +\/- 2.8 for the Lowrie-83 Kt\/V; 5.8 +\/- 2.4 for the Daugirdas-93 Kt\/V; 6.5 +\/- 2.6% for the Maduell Kt\/V; and 5.7 +\/- 2.2% for the Daugirdas-95 Kt\/V (p &lt; 0.01 between the Diascan Kt\/V and the other four). Although the Diascan Kt\/V was statistically different from the other four Kt\/V's calculated by the usual formulas, the Diascan Kt\/V has an excellent correlation with all of them and showed a lower intra-individual variability. It is possible to obtain an estimation of the calculated Kt\/V for each patient by linear regression equation. ","3378":"One of the main goals of dialysis is to reach a correct sodium balance. Dietary sodium restriction facilitates control of thirst, water overload, hypertension and cardiac failure. Nowadays, it is possible to estimate sodium mass transfer and known interdialytic salt intake, by means of non-invasive methods. The use of dialysate sodium profiles improves dialysis tolerance but it has been reported that interdialytic thirst may increase because of an inappropriate sodium balance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usual salt intake in hemodialysis patients, the effects on interdialytic gain weight, arterial pressure, blood volume preservation and dialysis tolerance of two different profiles of dialysate sodium and an additional session with salt restriction. Seventeen dialysis patients, 12 male and 5 females, were studied. Each patient underwent seven hemodialysis treatments: three consecutives sessions (a week) with constant sodium and ultrafiltration hemodialysis; three consecutive sessions with exponential decrease of conductivity (Initial 15.5-16.0, mid-session 14.3 and at the end 13.9-14 mS\/cm) and ultrafiltration (1.6 l\/h initial and 0.1 at the end) profiled hemodialysis; and an additional session which had a special dietary salt restriction. Dialysis parameters and dry weight were kept constant. Integra monitor with Diascan and Hemoscan biosensors (Hospal) were used in all sessions. We measured pre- and postdialytic plasma conductivity, sodium mass transfer, interdialytic weight gain, mean arterial pressure (MAP), percent reductions of blood volume (%R-BV) and hypotensive episodes during dialysis. Mean sodium mass transfer was 1,144 +\/- 356 mmol (no profile week) vs 1,242 +\/- 349 mmol (week with profiles), NS. It was equivalent to a salt ingestion of 9.6 +\/- 3 and 10.4 +\/- 3 g\/day respectively. End plasma conductivity was 14.04 +\/- 0.14 (no profile) versus 14.21 +\/- 0.08 mS\/cm (profiled), p &lt; 0.001. Interdialytic weight gain was 2.49 +\/- 0.76 (no profile) vs 2.32 +\/- 0.56 kg (profiled), NS. MAP was 101 +\/- 11 (no profile) vs 99 +\/- 10 mmHg (profiled), NS. The %R-BV was -7.73 +\/- 3 (no profile) vs -6.46 +\/- 3% (profiled), p &lt; 0.01. Hypotensive episodes\/session were 0.66 +\/- 0.75 (no profiles) vs 0.41 +\/- 0.57 (profiled), NS. Mean sodium mass transfer was 356 +\/- 125 mmol with usual salt intake and 240 +\/- 81 mmol with salt restriction, p &lt; 0.001. It was equivalent to a salt ingestion of 10.47 +\/- 3 versus 7.06 +\/- 2 g per day respectively, p &lt; 0.001. Initial plasma conductivity was 14.31 +\/- 0.21 (usually sodium intake) versus 14.16 +\/- 0.17 mS\/cm (salt restriction), p &lt; 0.01. Predialysis blood pressures were decreased with dietary salt restriction, MAP was 99.1 +\/- 11 vs 94.4 +\/- 12 mmHg (p &lt; 0.01). Interdialytic weight gain decreased with salt restriction, 2.32 +\/- 0.76 vs 1.78 +\/- 0.49 kg (p &lt; 0.001). The %R-BV was -7.25 +\/- 2 (usual sodium intake) vs -5.91 +\/- 2% (salt restriction), p &lt; 0.01. Hypotensive episodes\/session were 0.71 +\/- 0.8 (usual sodium intake) vs 0.18 +\/- 0.5 (salt restriction), p &lt; 0.05. In conclusion, automatic measurement of sodium mass transfer is a practical tool to follow dietary salt ingestion in hemodialysis patients. It allows us accurate, individualised and continual dietary interventions. The use of exponential decrease sodium profiles improve dialysis tolerance without changes in sodium balance, interdialytic weight gain or arterial pressure. A reduction of three g in salt intake observed in this study was beneficial in interdialytic weight gain, dialysis tolerance and blood pressure control.","3379":"High blood pressure is both a cause and a manifestation of renal disease. It has an increasing prevalence among renal patients renal function is declining. Blood pressure is not a constant value, but it shows a high intrinsic and extrinsic variability. It is common to find striking discordances between blood pressure values and target organ damage. The average values obtained through ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) are better related with cardiovascular morbility and mortality than office measurement, even in renal disease patients. We report the experience with ABPM on 51 renal patients. None of them was on renal replacement therapy. In 7 out of 14 non treated patients ABPM showed clinic hypertension only. Mean age of truly hypertensive patients was higher, but this difference was not significant (normotensive 31.7 +\/- 17.1; hypertensive 49.4 +\/- 17.9 years, p &lt; 0.1). There were no sex differences (normotensive, 5 males and 2 females; hypertensive, 4 males and 3 females). Three normotensive patients had chronic renal failure, and as did 6 hypertensive patients (p &lt; 0.1). There were no differences in night-time drop either for systolic (normotensive 3.7 +\/- 3.5 hypertensive 6.1 +\/- 8.9%) or for diastolic blood pressure (normotensive 10.4 +\/- 4.7 hypertensive 6.2 +\/- 8.9%). Thirty-seven patients who were on antihypertensive drug treatment: 23 (68.2%) showed hypertension after the ABPM and 14 (37.8%) have normal blood pressure values, more over, 4 of these 14 patients showed hypotension. There were neither age differences between the groups (normotensive 49.0 +\/- 12.5, hypertensive 51.9 +\/- 15.4 years), nor sex differences (normotensive 9 males and 5 females, hypertensive 11 males and 12 females). The prevalence of renal failure was similar (normotensive, 85.7%; hypertensive, 82.6%). Mean night-time drop was not different (SBP, normotensive 6.1 +\/- 7.6 hypertensive 7.2 +\/- 7.6%; DBP, normotensive 9.0 +\/- 8.3 hypertensive 13.5 +\/- 7.6%).

CyA also inhibited the Posm response to Ang II (10(-7) M) in toad skin in concentrations of 0.42. 10(-6) M and 0.42. 10(-7) M. In toad bladder it could be demonstrated that the inhibitory effect was reversible. CyA in concentrations of 0.42. 10(-6) M inhibited the Posm response of toad skin to theophylline (3.2. 10(-3) M) and to dibutyryl cyclic AMP (6.3. 10(-3) M) suggesting an effect distal to the generation of cyclic AMP.

We analyzed whether the use of carvedilol (CVD), a new beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and vasodilator slows the progression of glomerulosclerosis in 5\/6 nephrectomised (Nx) rats. Fifty-four adult Sprague-Dawley rats were distributed among five groups, four with 5\/6 Nx, vehicle treated and CVD at 5, 10 and 20 mg\/kg\/day and sham (no renal ablation or drug treatment). Tailcuff blood pressure, serum creatinine and urine protein concentration were measured. At the end of the experiment remnant kidney was removed for morphometric studies. Rats treated with 10 and 20 mg\/kg\/day of CVD showed controlled systemic blood pressure. Serum creatinine was similar in all treated groups with CVD, and half the levels observed in the vehicle-treated rats. The prevalence of glomerular lesions was closely associated with the degree of proteinuria. Eleven weeks after 5\/6 Nx, vehicle-treated rats exhibited marked GS with 76% of affected glomeruli and creatinine retention. By contrast, renal injury was largely prevent in those rats treated with 10 and 20 mg\/kg\/day of CVD. Tuft enlargement occurred in all groups but was more prominent in vehicle-treated group, 1.5 times higher than the group treated with 20 mg\/kg\/day of CVD.

The aim of this study was to know the distribution of different kinds of vascular access between prevalent hemodialysis patients, the proportion of incident patients that holds a permanent vascular access, the monthly hospital ratio for access repair and the use of surveillance systems of vascular access adequacy in the different Centers. This is a National survey that shows results of a questionnaire sent to all hemodialysis units in Spain on september 1999. Eighty-eight units answered the questionnaire (42%) providing information about 5,476 prevalent patients. Of these patients, 81% receives treatment through an arteriovenous fistula, 10% uses a central catheter and 9% a graft. Only 56% of incident patients have a permanent vascular access. Reasons for catheter use between prevalent patients were exhaustion of vascular sites in 42%, maduration of permanent access in 24%, thrombosis of the access in 14% and another reasons in 19%. Patients monthly hospitalization ratio for vascular repair was 3%, that might represent more than 5,600 hospital ingress by year. More than 80% of the Units releases different surveillance programs of access adequacy, 69% by fiscal detection problems, 47% by dynamic alterations and 18% by dilution and imaging procediments. The conclusions of this survey are that arteriovenous fistula is the most used vascular access in Spain. Almost half of the patients do not have vascular access in use for the beginning of hemodialysis. Exhausted vascular sites is the primary reason for central catheter using. A great proportion of Units are employing programs for access monitoring.","3383":"","3384":"","3385":"","3386":"","3387":"","3388":"A general overview of hypertension as a major health problem in Cuba in the last 25 years are presented.

We report the case of a renal transplant recipient who develop a rectus sheath hematoma as the first clinical feature of PTLD.","3395":"Fever is one of the most frequent causes of hospital admission in patients with end-stage renal disease. Lack of an identified source of infection and\/or lack of clinical response to the first empirical antibiotic treatment favour the use of broader spectrum antibiotics. The availability of fourth-generation cephalosporins (e.g. cefepime) and the increasing incidence of bacterial resistances to classical antibiotics has increased their use in the clinical practice. We present two cases of non-convulsive status epilepticus in patients with advanced chronic renal failure who received cefepime at doses corrected for the degree of renal function according to the manufacturer's instrument as. The clinical symptoms included shouthough, processes, disorientation, loss of attention, and the later appearance of myoclonus. In both cases the electroencephalogram (EEG) was compatible with non-convulsive epileptic status. After cefepime withdrawal there was a clinical remission of symptoms and normalization of the EEG. It is concluded that cefepime treatment can induce a non-convulsive epileptic status in patients with advanced chronic renal failure. Pharmacokinetic studies are urgently needed to clearly define the appropriate dose of cefepime in patients with advanced chronic renal failure.","3396":"We present a case of an exceptionally late HCV seroconversion in a hemodialysis patient. The clinical case illustrates the difficulty of appropriately and quickly isolating a HCV infected patient, and it demonstrates the necessity to consider all the dialysis patients as potentially infectious patients. The standard precautions in hemodialysis must be applied routinely to all the patients, because the diagnosis of the HCV infection is very often late, and on some occasions it is difficult to interpret correctly the results of the available diagnostic tests.","3397":"Low y serum albumin and high C-reactive protein (CRP) have been shown to be significant predictors of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Although hypoalbuminemia has been attributed to malnutrition, it has recently been recognized evidence of inflammation that predicts serum albumin concentration in dialysis patients. To establish, in our HD patients, the factors associated with malnutrition, hypoalbuminemia and elevated levels of C-reactive protein to determine its influence in the incidence and cause of death during a one year follow-up period. A cross sectional study was performed in 64 patients (35 males, 13% diabetics; mean age 64 +\/- 12), who had beep on HD for 64 +\/- 58 months. We assessed nutritional status by anthropometric and biochemical parameters and estimated protein and calorie intake by diet recall. The dialysis dose was measure by KT\/V normalized for actual and ideal body weight (BW). Comorbidity (total and cardiovascular) were measured using a modified M. Charlson index. CRP was used as a marker of inflammation. During a one year follow-up period we determined the incidence and cause of death. According to Bilbrey index only seven patients (11%) were well nourished. The variables associated with malnutrition were civil status (not married) and dialysis dose estimated by KT\/V normalized to ideal BW. Serum albumin (mean 4.1 +\/- 0.3 g\/dl) was associated with creatinine, comorbidity age and infection. 37.5% of the patients had CRP &gt; 1 mg\/dl and they had more cardiovascular comorbidity and lower serum albumin, and they used higher doses of erythropoietin (table III). Patients using modified cellulosic membranes had higher levels of CRP. Multivariate analysis showed that high global comorbidity, low serum cholesterol, and high level of CRP and hematocrit predicted death. The principal cause of mortality was infection. Malnutrition is a common problem in HD patients. Low dialysis dose is associated with malnutrition in some patients. We propose to normalize urea clearances to ideal body weight. Inflammatory activity is frequent in HD, probably as a result of intermittent activation of the acute phase response during the dialysis procedure. Low serum albumin in HD patients is principally associated with infection\/inflammation but not with malnutrition. CRP is a sensitive marker of inflammation and an power predictor of mortality in HD patients. ","3398":"The relationship between urea Kt\/V and nPCR (nPNA) is partly due to a mathematical coupling and greatly depends on the residual renal function (RRF). On the other hand, albumin could be just a comorbidity marker. Our objective in this study was to verify whether dialysis dose in peritoneal dialysis (PD) is biologically related to the nutritional state measured by the mean values of several parameters not mathematically related while analyzing the influence of RRF and comorbidity (C). 101 stable PD patients, 60M and 41F with a mean age of 59.3 +\/- 14.3 years, were studied and followed up every six months for a mean time of 35.8 +\/- 22.3 months (8-112). The variables studied were initial comorbidity, plasma albumin, normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA), lean body weight % (LBW%) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) derived from creatinine, and RRF. In every study (n = 471) the 24 hours dialysate and urine volumes were collected and the total (T), dialytic (P) and renal (R) urea KT\/V and normalized creatinine clearance (CCR) were determined and compared with the nutritional parameters. When starting PD 48 patients (47.5%) had some C and 34 (33.7%) were already anuric. The correlations of nPNA with T-KT\/V and T-CCR (n = 101) were r = 0.67 and 0.50 (p &lt; 0.0005) while the correlations of LBW% with T-KT\/V and T-CCR were r = 0.36 and 0.40 (p &lt; 0.0005) respectively. The correlations of albumin with T, P and R KT\/V and CCR did not reach significance. The nutritional state was better in patients with a higher RRF and albumin showed significant differences when related to morbidity. KT\/V and CCR correlations with nutritional variables not mathematically related verify the hypothesis that dialysis dose is biologically associated with the nutritional state.","3399":"Lupus membranous glomerulonephritis (LMG) is sometimes difficult to distinguish from idiopathic membranous glomerulonephritis (IMG) and little is known about its natural history. We have performed a retrospective study of 16 patients with LMG, types Va (\"pure\" LMG) (8 patients) and Vb (mesangial proliferation) (8 patients). Analytical and clinical characteristics were analyzed in each case at the onset of the disease and during follow-up. At the time of diagnosis, 7 patients (43%) did not present any extrarenal manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Nephrotic syndrome was the most common clinical presentation (81%). 14 patients (87%) showed positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA), but at low titres (&lt; 1\/300); anti-DNA antibodies were positive only in 3 cases (18%) and hypocomplementemia was observed in 2 (12%). The most relevant histological findings were the presence of Clq deposits (83%) and subendothelial and mesangial deposits. Treatment consisted of corticosteroids, adding immunosuppression when no response was obtained in 2-3 months. In recent years, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) was added before immunosuppression. At the end of the study, 6 patients (42%) developed chronic renal insufficiency and 8 (58%) renainea with normal renal function. Actuarial renal survival was 100% at 5 years and 75% at 10 years. The evolution towards a non-nephrotic range proteinuria throughout the follow-up was the only parameter significantly associated with a good prognosis. LMG can present without extra-renal symptoms of SLE and even with very poor expression of its serological markers. Almost half of the patients (42%) developed chronic renal insufficiency. The evolution towards a non-nephrotic range proteinuria correlated with the maintenance of a normal renal function. ","3400":"Tubular secretion of creatinine is increased by meat meals. This increment has been attributed to the formation of new creatinine from creatine contained in the cooked meals. However, no studies are available using amino acid infusions containing no creatine, which allow to further investigate the putative causes of increment in tubular creatinine secretion. We performed a prospective, interventional study involving 34 individuals with normal renal function participating in a protocol on arterial hypertension. A continuous infusion of L-arginine (6%, i.v., in four 30 min periods at 50, 100, 200 and 300 ml\/h) was administered. Creatinine (CCr) and inulin (CIn) clearances were determined at baseline and during L-arginine infusion. We analyzed the effects of L-arginine on tubular secretion by comparing CCr and CIn and calculated tubular secretion of creatinine (TSCr). L-arginine infusion induced a significant increase in both CCr and CIn. CCr and CIn were respectively 117.9 +\/- 22.7 and 107.5 +\/- 23, before and 170.3 +\/- 23 and 144.2 +\/- 47.8 after the infusion of L-arginine (both p &lt; 0.01). This increase was simultaneous with an increment in TSCr from 1.12 +\/- 0.4 to 1.43 +\/- 0.6 (p &lt; 0.01). CCr correlated significantly with CIn at baseline and at 60 min of infusion (r = 0.365, p = 0.031 and r = 0.368, p = 0.038, respectively), but not at 120 min (r = 0.130, p = 0.412), a time corresponding to the maximum increase in CIn and TSCr. L-arginine induces a substantial increase of CCr, which exceeds that expected from the increase in glomerular filtration rate measured by CIn and corresponds to an increment in TSCr. This phenomenon adds a new interpretation of the effect of amino acids on tubular handling of creatinine and has practical implications in the evaluation of renal function by means of creatinine clearance.

Increased production of calcitriol by activated macrophages has been shown to be the cause in most cases. In this article, we describe three cases of hypercalcemia associated with inappropriately elevated calcitriol levels and suppressed PTH in hemodialysis. In addition to conventional techniques for tuberculosis diagnosis we used Ligase Chain Reaction (LCR) to detect mycobacterial DNA in pleural effusion with acid-fast stain and culture negativity. Antituberculous therapy was associated with a decrease in the levels of calcium, as well as in serum calcitriol concentrations, and a substantial increase in the levels of iPTH. The serum levels of 25(OH)D3 remained unchanged. These findings suggested ectopic production of calcitriol. The discussion reviews the previously reported cases of hypercalcemia and tuberculosis that occurred during hemodialysis, and concludes that ectopic production of calcitriol by tuberculous granulomas is extremely unusual and its demonstration requires a high index of suspicion. Molecular techniques are a potentially useful approach for early and rapid diagnosis of tuberculous infection in dialysis patients.","3424":"","3425":"Hemoglobin is one of the health quality of life predictors in chronic hemodialysis patients.

We evaluated the HRQOL of 170 patients undergoing hemodialysis and 210 transplant patients from Asturias (Spain), using the SF-36 Health Survey. Sociodemographic and clinical data, Karnofsky Scale and a Comorbidity Index were also collected. The raw scores of the SF-36 and the standardised scores according to age and gender were employed. The majority of elderly patients on hemodialysis lived alone, constituted a smaller percentage on the transplant waiting list, had a lower serum albumin and lower score of the Karnofsky Scale, than patients under 65 years. No differences were found in transplant patients. The raw scores on the SF-36 were less for the elderly patients on hemodialysis and transplant. The raw scores for elderly undergoing hemodialysis were less than those obtained by the general population, and raw scores for elderly transplant patients were similar or slightly greater. The standardized scores of the SF-36 were greater for the elderly in both treatment groups. Important differences exist in the evaluation of HRQOL differences between the two groups of age according to the method of analysing the results.

The pathogenesis of this complication in uremia is complex and not fully elucidated. An imbalance between the vasoconstrictor and vasodilator systems may be involved in its pathogenesis. In this study we have evaluated the state of nitric oxide (NO) and adrenomedullin (ADM) in hemodialyzed patients, especially those with hypertension. We included a group of hypertensive hemodialyzed patients (n = 9) and a group of normotensive control patients (n = 10). We measured plasma renin activity, as well as plasma catecholamines, ADM, and nitrite\/nitrate levels in basal conditions before starting the hemodialysis session. Plasma volume, as well as left ventricular ejection fraction were also measured. Hemodialysis patients showed plasma levels of nitrite\/nitrates and ADM higher than the reference values in the normal population. We observed no differences in the plasma levels of nitrite\/nitrates, but ADM levels were higher in hypertensive (278.2 +\/- 15.5 pg\/ml) patients than in normotensive patients (225 +\/- 9.9 pg\/ml) (p &lt; 0.05). When considering all patients together, mean arterial pressure positively correlated with plasma ADM (r = 0.468, p &lt; 0.05). Plasma volume and left ventricular ejection fraction were similar in the two groups of patients. In summary, plasma levels of nitrite\/nitrates and ADM are increased in hemodialyzed patients, although only ADM levels were further increased in hypertensive patients. Our results do not suggest that a decreased production in the vasodilator factors evaluated is involved in the pathogenesis of hypertension in uremic patients.","3428":"Recent studies have shown that cardiovascular events and end-organ damage occur more frequently in patients with salt-sensitive essential hypertension (SH) than in salt-resistant essential hypertension (RH). Nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in regulating the pressure-natriuresis relationship. Therefore impaired NO synthesis may produce or aggravate salt-sensitive hypertension. This study was conducted to determine the hormonal levels and nitric oxide metabolites in hypertensive patients. 25 patients underwent salt sensitivity testing. 24 h ambulatory blood pressure was recorded after a 5-day period on low salt diet (20 mEq\/d) and after a 5-day period on a high salt diet (200 mEq\/d). Subjects showing &gt; or = 10 mmHg increase in mean BP when changing from low to high dietary salt intake were classified as salt sensitive and as salt resistant when the BP changes were &lt; 10 mmHg. Based on BP recordings 13 patients were characterised as white coat hypertension (WC), 13 patients as salt resistant (SR) and 12 as salt sensitive (SS). A significative relationship was seen between plasma glucose-insulin concentration and body mass index. The ventricular mass index was similar in SS and SR patients. The plasma uric acid, triglicerides and PAI-I were elevated in SS compared with SR, and control group (C). During low sodium intake, plasma renin and aldosterone were decreased in SS compared with SR, and C. No differences in plasma catecholamines or their changes with intake sodium modifications were seen among the patients. During high sodium intake urinary NO excretion increased in SR (38 +\/- 9 vs 18 +\/- 2 mg\/g creat), and C (24 +\/- 2 vs 16 +\/- 3 mg\/g creat) (p &lt; 0.01) but not in SS patients (21 +\/- 3 vs 26 +\/- 4 mg\/g creat). The NO excretion changes showed negative correlation with BP changes (r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.01). During low sodium intake, SR and SS patients showed a normal nocturnal decrease of BP (dippers). During high sodium intake SS patients became non-dippers. Our results showed that patients with salt sensitive hypertension displayed a suppressed renin-aldosterone system, an attenuated nocturnal decline in blood pressure on high-salt diet and an impairment of endothelial function.

Undecalcified bone biopsy with histomorphometric measurements and tetracycline labelling remains the gold standard for diagnosis of the different forms of renal osteodystrophy. But because of its invasive nature and complicated laboratory processing a number of non-invasive biochemical parameters have been proposed. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of the different forms of renal osteodystrophy in our patients in hemodialysis. Moreover we analyse the correlation between several biochemical parameters and the histological findings and evaluate their diagnostic and predictive value. Transiliac bone biopsies were performed in seventy three uremic patients (31 males) on chronic hemodialysis and static and dynamic parameters were measured. Serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), osteocalcin (OC), total alkaline phosphatase (FAT) and bone alkaline phosphatase (FAO) were determined. High-bone remodelling (50 pts, 68.5%) predominates over low-bone remodelling (23 pts, 31.5%). The distribution of the different types of bone disease was: Mild hyperparathyroidism 8 pts, Osteitis fibrosa 37 pts, Mixed lesions 5 pts, Adynamic bone disease 21 pts and Osteomalacia 2 pts. Six of our 73 patients were diabetics and they had adynamic bone disease (4 pts), osteomalacia (1 pt) and osteitis fibrosa (1 pt). Patients older than 50 years presented lower cellular activity (osteoblast surface, ObS\/BS) and lower bone formation rate (BFR\/BS). iPTH showed different correlation with these parameters of bone formation in patients above and below 50 years old suggesting that older patients need higher levels of PTH to obtain a determined level of bone formation. iPTH, OC, FAT and FAO correlated with the majority of histomorphometric indices of bone formation and resorption, though the best correlations were those with iPTH. The diagnostic and predictive value of these bone markers is better with high-bone remodelling. Serum levels of FAT &gt; 300 U\/l, OC &gt; 150 ng\/ml, FAO &gt; 40 ng\/ml and iPTH &gt; 200 pg\/ml showed a positive predictive value of 1 (with a specificity of 1, but sensibility below 0.78 except for iPTH that is 0.95) in the diagnosis of high-bone remodelling.

To control serum phosphate levels, we can use the following therapies: 1) Restriction of dietary phosphate (but on CAPD, obligatory protein losses via peritoneal fluid makes impractical any reduction of phosphate diet. 2) Reduction of phosphate absorption, using phosphate binders. 3) Peritoneal phosphate removal. 1) To evaluate the factors affecting peritoneal phosphate removal such as plasma phosphate, peritoneal membrane transport type, peritoneal dialysis modality prescription (CAPD or APD) and daily dialysate volume. 2) To test the best calcium concentration in the peritoneal dialysis fluid (5, 6 or 7 mg\/dl) in order to permit the use of calcium carbonate or acetate without the risk of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Phosphate was measured in seventy 24-hour dialysate collections, 33 from patients on CAPD and 37 from patients on APD. 24-hour peritoneal phosphate removal (mg\/24 hours) and weekly peritoneal phosphate clearance was calculated (L\/week). The peritoneal membrane was studied by the peritoneal equilibrium test (PET), using a 2.27% glucose. We calculated also the peritoneal calcium balance in 25 daily peritoneal fluid collections from patients using a calcium dialysate concentration of 5, 6 or 7 mg\/dl each one. IPTH levels and doses of vitamin D were compared at 6 months in patients using a calcium concentration of 5, 6 or 7 mg\/dl from the beginning of peritoneal dialysis (5 patients of each calcium dialysate concentration).

The percentage of patients who used the HED in 1998 was 66.3% (55\/83). The total number of emergency episodes in 1998 was 118 (mean of 55 patients 2.27 +\/- 1.51). Fifty one percent of the emergency episodes were due to patients initiative. The 4 more frequent diagnoses of HED in 1998 were infectious, 19.5% (23\/118); traumatologic emergencies, 15.3% (18\/118); digestive disease 15.3% (18\/118); relationed problem vascular access, 11.9% (14\/118). Thirty percent (36\/118) of the emergency consultations needed HA leading to a mean hospitalitation of 10.2 +\/- 9.3 days. The infectious disease were the highest percentage of HA (36.1%) and the longest days of hospitalitation (12.7 +\/- 11.2 days). The risk factors for repeated emergency consultation (more than 3 times) were: age (68.9 vs 61.4), lower hematocrit (31.6 vs 34.4%), lower hemoglobin (10.2 vs 11), high EPO dose (166.3 vs 109.7 unit\/kg\/week) and lower Kt\/V (0.99 vs 1.11). If we compare these results with 1991 the percentage that used the HED was similar 66.2% (pNS); the number of emergency episodes was higher (mean 2.99 +\/- 1.96) than 1998 (p &lt; 0.006) and there are a significant differences in the diagnoses of HED between 1998 and 1991: acute pulmonary edema 1.7 vs 11.2% (p &lt; 0.003); hiperkalemia 0.8 vs 7.9% (p &lt; 0.009); gastrointestinal disease 15.3% vs 4.5% (p &lt; 0.008) and infectious 19.5% vs 7.9% (p &lt; 0.01). In conclusion our study provides data previously not available on the epidemiology of Emergency Consultation by outpatient HD patients treated in the same peripheral unit. The data obtained albeit limited because of the number provide information of potential protocol usefulness for the possible reduction in the frequency of Hospital Emergency Consultations by outpatient HD patients.

At present, there is no satisfactory method to assess MC function and regenerative capacity in individual peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. MC may be cultured from peritoneal biopsy specimens, but peritoneal biopsy is an invasive procedure that cannot be performed serially. The aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of serial culture of MC from the peritoneal effluent of PD patients. Fifty-two randomly selected PD patients were studied. MC were obtained from the peritoneal effluent of nocturnal 2.27% glucose exchanges and cultured in T25 tissue culture flasks. Subconfluent MC cultures were obtained in 80.7% of patients. At this stage, the percentage of cells in the tissue cultured flask characterized as MC by morphology and immunostaining had increased to 95.5%. MC were then subcultured in multi-well culture plates, where they showed exponential cell growth until day 16. Nine (17%) patients released low numbers of MC into the effluent and MC could not be cultured to subconfluence. One additional patient released and apparently adequate number of MC that repeatedly failed to reach confluence. Patients showed the same behavior in several cultures performed. In conclusion, peritoneal MC released into peritoneal effluent are accessible for profound analysis by a culture technique. This technique opens the possibility of serial follow-up of the biology of MC individual PD patients.","3454":"At present we have a great variety of high-flux dialyzers whose characteristics in vitro seem similar. On-line HDF is a technique which combines diffusion with elevated convection and uses dialysate as replacement fluid. On-line HDF provides the highest clearances for small, medium-sized and large molecules and gives the best performance from the dialyzers. Conscious of this wide choice of dialyzers we evaluated the performance of different dialyzers in renowing small and medium-large molecules. Eleven patients were included in this study, 7 males and 4 females. Every patient received 11 on-line HDF sessions with Fresenius 4008B machine, Qi 100 ml\/min or 6 L\/h, QB 400 ml\/min, QB 800 ml\/min, UF 0.5 L\/h and Td 60 min. Only the dialyzer was changed: 1.9 m2 cellulose triacetate (Tricea 190G), 2.1 m2 poly methyl methacrylate of PMMA (BK-2.1P), 1.8 m2 polyester-polymer Allol or PEPA (FLX-18GWS), 2.05 m2 acrylonitrile (Filtral 20), 2.1 m2 polyamide (Poliflux 2.1) and 1.8-2.4 m2 polysulfones (HF 80, BS-1.8S, APS-900, Arylane H9, Idemsa 2000, HdF 100). Arterial pressure, venous pressure and transmembrane pressure (TMP) were monitored. Plasma, urea, creatinine, phosphate, uric acid and beta 2m concentrations were measured at the beginning and at the end dialysis from arterial and venous blood lines, and arterial blood line with the slow flow method. Recirculation, dialyzer solutes clearance and solute reduction rates were calculated. No significant differences were found in arterial pressure, venous pressure and recirculation. Small molecule removal was similar except in BK-2.1P and HdF 100 dialyzers which were lower and higher respectively. There were differences in TMP and beta 2m removal among dialyzers employed. Mean TMP, beta 2m clearance and beta 2m reduction ratio were: Tricea 190G (TMP 336 mmHg, beta 2m K 79 ml\/min and beta 2m reduction ratio 44.9%), BK-2.1P (TMP 485, beta 2m K 102 and beta 2mRR 48.3%), FLX-18 GWS (TMP 195, beta 2m K 140 and beta 2mRR 54.6%), Filtral 20 (TMP 245, beta 2m K 132 and beta 2mRR 54.1%), Poliflux 2.1 (TMP 209, beta 2m K 158 and beta 2mRR 56.0%), HF 80 (TMP 208, beta 2m K 160 and beta 2mRR 57.4%), BS-1.8S (TMP 186, beta 2m K 179 and beta 2mRR 59.6%), APS-900 (TMP 174, beta 2m K 176 and beta 2mRR 64.8%), Arylane H9 (TMP 206, beta 2m K 171 and beta 2mRR 59.9%), Idemsa 2000 (TMP 203, beta 2m K 169 and beta 2mRR 60.4%), HdF 100 (TMP 152, beta 2m K 186 and beta 2mRR 64.6%). Of the dialyzers evaluated in on-line HDF, cellulose triacetate and PMMA have a smaller beta 2m removal and their use is limited by an elevated TMP. The polysulfones provide greater beta 2m removal with lower TMP, particularly the APS-900 and HdF 100 dialyzers. The acrylonitrile, PEPA and polyamide are intermediate. ","3455":"Nitric oxide (NO) is derived from the metabolism of the amino acid L-arginine by NO synthase (NOS). One of the forms of NOS (i-NOS) can be induced by cytokines, bradykinin and endotoxin. During hemodialysis (HD), blood-dialysis membrane interaction can induce production of these mediators. HD can also induce changes of asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADA), a potent inhibitor of NOS. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of HD, using cuprophane (C, polyacrilonytrile (PAN) and special polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) membranes, on cellular NOS activity, and changes of plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), bradykinin, ADA and nitrate concentration. Before HD, cellular i-NOS activity was similar with the three membranes. Cuprophane HD induced a significant increase in i-NOS activity from 31 +\/- 10 to 48 +\/- 12 fmol-1 10(6) cells (p &lt; 0.05). No changes were found in PAN and SPAN HD. The TNF-alpha values increased significantly during HD with C (56 +\/- 6 vs 47 +\/- 5 pg\/ml, p &lt; 0.05). No changes of bradykinin concentration were found during HD. A significant decrease of ADA and nitrate levels was observed during HD with three membranes. No significant correlation was found between percentage increase in i-NOS activity and the changes in other parameters. These findings suggest that HD with bioincompatible membranes can induce activation of cellular i-NOS.","3456":"Low PTH secretion is known to be associated with Adynamic Bone Disease (ABD). Positive balance calcium by CaCO3 or dialysate calcium (DCa) might play a role in the parathyroid gland suppression and a decrease in DCa to 2.5 mEq-l or lower has been proposed. The long-term effect of this procedure on bone mineral density (BMD) has not been established. The aim was to evaluate the effect of lowering dialysate calcium on bone mass in patients with relative hypoparathyroidism. We studied 20 patients with intact PTH below 120 pg\/ml, using 3 mEq\/l DCa and CaCO3 as sole phosphate binder. Sex: 10M\/10F. Age: 57 +\/- 13 yrs. Months on dialysis: 40 +\/- 29. None of them had previous renal transplantation, parathyroidectomy nor aluminic toxicity. BMD of the lumbar spine was assessed by Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). They were randomized in two groups (GI and GII), with similar age, sex, and time on dialysis. There were no difference in BMD, levels of intact PTH, serum calcium, phosphate and AP (Alkaline Phosphatase) GI (n = 11; 5M\/6F) was transferred to 2.5 mEq\/l DCa and GII (n = 9; 5M\/4F) continued using 3 mEq\/l. BMD was measured one year later. Calcium, phosphate and AP were measured monthly and PTH every three months. After one year of hemodialysis with 2.5 mEq\/l of calcium dialysate, BMD showed a significant reduction. BMD mg\/cc Baseline (B): 146.09 +\/- 54; Final (F): 125.42 +\/- 54 (p &lt; 0.01). Z-score B: 0.13 +\/- 1.89; F: -0.68 +\/- 1.89 (p &lt; 0.05). GII did no show change. The mean change: GI: -15 +\/- 13%, GII: 1.28 +\/- 17% (p &lt; 0.05); Z-Score GI: -0.81 +\/- 0.92, GII: 0.27 +\/- 0.67 (p &lt; 0.01). A separate analysis of BMD in both sexes (GI) revealed a tendency for females to lose more bone mineral than males: F: = 17.12 +\/- 7.1%. M: -12.23 +\/- 18.6% (ns). GI: PTH and AP increased: PTH B: 38.75 +\/- 41; F: 99 +\/- 69 (p &lt; 0.01); AP: B: 118.4 +\/- 47; F: 152 +\/- 38 (p &lt; 0.01). GII: PTH B: 53.8 +\/- 28; F: 79 +\/- 5 (ns). AP: B: 125.1 +\/- 36; F: 138 +\/- 38 (ns). The rate of BMD loss inversely correlated with the increase of PTH (r = -0.61, p &lt; 0.01). Serum calcium and phosphate did not change. In GI CaCO3 doses were: B: 332 +\/- 261; F: 537 +\/- 260 (as grams of element calcium, every three months, p &lt; 0.01). By multiple lineal regression only delta PTH and DCa were predictors of greater BMD loss. In conclusion, the use of 2.5 mEq\/l dialysate calcium resulted in: 1) Loss of trabecular vertebral bone mass. 2) Increase in PTH secretion and biochemical markers of bone formation. 3) A greater CaCO3 dose.","3457":"Renal osteodystrophy has become one of the most important aspects related with morbidity in dialysis patients. The aim of our study was to analyse the main biochemical markers of mineral metabolism in 7,422 dialysis patients from 147 Spanish centres. We present data about serum Ca, P, Ca-P, product, Al and vitamin D. Due to the distribution of the analytical results (not normal), non-parametric tests were used. In this analysis a p &lt; 0.01 was considered as significant. The mean total levels were: Ca 9.7 +\/- 0.9 mg\/dL; P 5.6 +\/- 1.6 mg\/dL; Ca-P product 54 +\/- 16 mg\/dL; PTH 294 +\/- 360 pg\/mL and Al 27 +\/- 23 micrograms\/L. There was a great variation particularly on serum Ca and PTH levels. On the contrary, serum P and Ca-P product values were less spread: only a quarter of the patients had P levels higher then 6.5 mg\/dL and one third Ca-P product higher than 60. Fifty percent of patients had Al levels lower than 20 micrograms\/L. Forty one percent of patients (2,811 out of the 7,422) had a PTH equal or lower than 120 pg\/mL and 23% have PTH equal or lower than 60 pg\/mL. Patients with PTH equal or lower than 60 have serum Ca levels significantly higher than the remaining patients, on the contrary, serum P, Ca-P product and Al levels were significantly lower. In this group, 21% of patients were receiving vitamin D (in spite of low PTH). On the contrary 32% of patients were not receiving calcitriol (despite PTH higher than 250 pg\/mL). Forty four percent of patients were receiving vitamin D (46% on haemodialysis and 31% on peritoneal dialysis). Patients on haemodialysis showed serum Ca, P, PTH and Al levels higher than patients on peritoneal dialysis.","3458":"In order to know the current management of renal osteodystrophy in Spain we collected data from 172 centres (10,724 patients) obtained from a 30 questions enquiry designed to show different aspects of the current management of renal osteodystrophy. The levels considered the \"goal\" for treatment were: Calcium 10-10.5 mg\/dL (53% of centres), 9.5-10 mg\/dL (28%), 10.5-11 mg\/dL (14%) and 9-9.5 mg\/dL (5% of centres). Phosphorus: between 4.5 and 5.5 mg\/dL (77% of centres), between 5.5 and 6.5 mg\/dL (15%) and less than 4.5 mg\/dL (8% of centres). Parathormone (PTH): between 120 and 250 pg\/mL (75% of centres), between 60 and 120 pg\/mL (19% of centres). The calcium concentration used in the dialysis fluids was 2.5 in 44% of centres, 3 in 28%, 3.5 in 26% and 2 mEq\/L in the remaining 2% of centres. Pulse therapy was started with PTH higher than 750 in 16% of centres; with PTH higher than 500 pg\/mL in 52% and with PTH higher than 250 pg\/mL in 28% of the centres. Only 51% of centres decreased the calcium concentration in dialysis fluids when the patients were receiving parenteral calcitriol. Fifty-nine percent of centres considered a positive response to treatment any reduction in PTH levels, 24% of centres considered response a decrease of at least 20%, 78% of centres maintained the treatment with calcitriol 6 months before deciding if the patient was a \"responder\" or a \"non-responder\". Parathyroidectomy was performed when PTH was higher than 1,000 pg\/mL in 38% of the centres; in 41% when PTH was between 1,000 and 750; in 19% when PTH was between 750 and 500; and when PTH was between 500 and 250 pg\/mL in the remaining 2% of the centres.

A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample including all patients on hemodialysis (n = 170) and transplant patients (n = 210) of our region. The HRQOL assessment instruments used in this study were: the Spanish versions of the sickness impact profile (SIP) and the SF-36 health survey (SF-36). Sociodemographic and clinical data (including age at start of RRT, age at the interview, gender, hospital, socioeconomic level, educational level, living conditions, inclusion in transplant waiting list, renal disease diagnosis, time in any RRT, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum urea, creatinine, proteins and albumin, hospital admissions and length of hospital stay during last year), a comorbidity index and the Karnofsky performance scale score step. To investigate which studied variables had independent influence over the HRQOL measures, logistic regression method was employed in the case of the SF-36, and multiple regression, in the case of the SIP. A model was adjusted step by step in each RRT method (hemodialysis and transplantation) for each dimension of the PCE (physical dimension, psychosocial dimension and total score), and for each component summary score of the SF-36 (physical and mental component summary). In patients on hemodialysis, variables associated with better HRQOL were: higher age, female gender, higher educational level, and better functional status; and variables associated with worse HRQOL were: higher number of hospital admissions, and higher comorbidity index. In transplant patients, variables associated with better HRQOL were: higher age and higher functional status; and variables associated with worse HRQOL were: longer time on dialysis before transplant, longer time with functioning transplant, and higher comorbidity index. Despite the independent influence on the HRQOL demonstrated for some of the studied variables, it seems that HRQOL assessment instruments scores may mainly depend on other non-studied variables, and it may be that these instruments evaluate other aspects of the patients which have not been taken into account until now.","3469":"Several factors influence the efficacy of the action of human recombinant erythropoietin during treatment of anaemia in haemodialysis patients. We carried out a six-month prospective study of 23 stable patients who had been on haemodialysis for at least one year to attempt to evaluate those factors modifying the dose of the hormone to attain a similar haematocrit, such as use or not of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, hepatitis C virus positive or negative, age older or younger than 60 years, acquired cystic kidney disease or not, and sex. The patients were treated with subcutaneaous erythropoietin for over a year to attain a haematocrit of 35%, intravenous iron to reach plasma ferritin levels &gt; 250 ng\/ml and a transferrin saturation index &gt; 20%, folic acid and group B vitamins. Parameters studied included age, time and duration of haemodialysis, Kt\/V, albumin, haematocrit, erythropoietin in U\/kg\/week, intact PTH, hepatitis C virus, PCR of the hepatitis C virus, transaminases, ferritin, transferrin saturation index, folic acid, vitamin B12, and aluminium. No statistically significant differences were seen between the patients with and without hepatitis or in age or acquired cystic kidney disease and sex in the hormone dose given to achieve similar levels of haematocrit. Higher doses of erythropoietin were necessary in those patients treated with antihypertensive agents (71 +\/- 25 vs 44 +\/- 25 U\/kg\/week; p &lt; 0.05). There were no differences between groups in factors known to cause resistance to the action of the hormone. The most important conclusions from this study concern the cost-benefit relation of treating hypertensive patients on haemodialysis with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and erythropoietin.","3470":"Calcitriol deficiency and phosphate retention are two main factors in the pathogenesis of renal hyperparathyroidism. In spite of normal serum levels, phosphate may have an important role even in moderate RI. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dietary phosphorus restriction on serum levels of calcitriol in patients with moderate RI. We studied 21 patients (7 F\/14 M); mean age 61.7 +\/- 15 years old; corrected creatinine clearance 51.4 +\/- 14 ml\/m. Serum PTH, calcitriol 25(OH)D3, calcium, phosphorus and urinary excretion of calcium and phosphorus were measured before and after 30 days on phosphorus restricted diet (700 mg\/day). [table: see text] Our patients with moderate RI have elevated serum levels of PTH while calcitriol was in the lower normal range. Dietary phosphorus restriction resulted in a significant decrease in PTH levels and a significant increase in serum calcitriol concentrations. The levels of 25(OH)D3 did not change in this study. ","3471":"This is a study of a group of 23 patients from 16 families with a shared family tree, developing chronic renal insufficiency (CRI). Out of the 23 patients, 18 were female and five male with an average renal death age of 18.4 years old, showing fevo clinical manifestations. The main reason for consultation was the significant level of anemia. 17 patients had normal arterial tension, 1 patient manifested severe artery hypertension (AHT), 3 manifested mild AHT, and 2 manifested slight AHT. All the patients entered the final stage of CRI with a low level of hemoglobin overaging 6.5 g%. The urinalysis revealed an average SG of 1,010, without proteinuria or with slight proteinuria, lower than 500 mg in 24 hours. Three patients had microhematuria and the remainder had normal urinary sediment. A renal ultrasound in 18 cases revealed a bilateral reduction in the kidney size, loss of the cortcomedullar relation, an increase in the echogenety of the renal parenchyma, scattered in all cases, and the presence of corticomedullar cysts in 5 cases. The histopathological study performed in 8 cases revealed some findings which were compatible with chronic interstitial nephritis with corticomedullar cysts. The findings resemble those described in the literature in cases of familial juvenile nephronophthisis (FJN). An important aspect to be pointed out is the presence of an interstitial infiltrate with mononuclear cells, an even more significant feature than any previously reported. We can conclude that the members of these familial groups are carriers of FJN of recessive autosomic transmission, which, in view of some differences in the clinical presentation, age of onset of, CRI some biochemical and morphological findings, and the absence of genetic alterations as described in type 1 FJN, is a variant of this disease.","3472":"Ionic dialysance is a method of continuous on-line monitoring of delivered dialysis without blood sampling. To compare the results obtained by ionic dialysance and those obtained by the traditional measurements of the dialysis dose, it is necessary to know the relationship between the ionic dialysance and urea clearance. Ionic dialysance and the urea clearance were determined in 18 patients (13 dialyzed with cuprophan and 5 patients with AN69). Urea clearance was measured by 6 different methods: urea clearance in whole blood calculated with the arteriovenous difference in the urea concentration rates and the arterial flow measured by the rolling pump (KBAVb) or by ultrasounds (KBAVu); urea clearance in whole blood measured by the urea concentration in the dialysate (KBD); urea blood water clearance measured by the arteriovenous difference in the concentration rates using the arterial flow measured by the roller pump (KwBAVb) or by ultrasounds (KwBAVu) and urea blood water clearance measured by the urea concentration in dialysate (KwBD). The mean arterial flow measured by the roller pump was 314.4 +\/- 16.2 ml\/min and 275.1 +\/- 13.8 ml\/min when measured by ultrasounds (p &lt; 0.001). The data of ionic dialysance and urea clearances were as follow (ml\/min): ionic dialysance 185.6 +\/- 11.7; KBAVb 245.7 +\/- 15.7; KBAVu 215.4 +\/- 13.2; KBD 231.6 +\/- 13.1; KwBAVb 218.1 +\/- 14; KwBAVu 191.2 +\/- 11.8; KwBD 183.1 +\/- 11.7. The absolute difference of ionic dialysance with the KwBAVu was 8.4 +\/- 6 ml\/min (range between -17.8 and 11.5 ml) and with the KwBD was 7.6 +\/- 5.4 ml (range between -12.9 and 21.4 ml). There was a relationship between ionic dialysance and urea blood water clearance. The best concordance was obtained when the clearance was calculated with the urea concentration of dialysate, or with the arteriovenous difference of the urea concentration rates and the arterial blood flow measured by ultrasounds. ","3473":"The presence of genetic prothrombotic factors (factor V Leiden and the prothrombin II20210 mutation) was investigated in 38 patients with glomerulonephritis with or without a history of thrombotic events and\/or nephrotic syndrome. We found an increased prevalence (36%) of heterozygous factor V Leiden in those patients with a history of thrombotic events. This is ten times the prevalence in the normal Spanish population. Carrier status for this mutation may be a determining factor in the development of thrombotic events along with the acquired disorders of coagulation to which these patients are prone. We found only one patient who was a carrier of the G-A II20210 mutation of the prothrombin gene; this patient had no history of venous thrombosis or embolism. Our findings suggest the need to measure activated protein C resistance and to look for the most frequent genotype causing it, Factor V Leiden, in patients with glomerulonephritis to identify those at risk who may benefit from prophylaxis against thrombosis.","3474":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a systemic disorder mainly characterized by renal cyst formation. Cysts in ADPKD are focal in nature, since only a small fraction of nephrons become cystic. The hypothesis that a second hit may be required for cyst formation has been proposed. This hypothesis suggests that inactivation of the inherited wild-type allele by a somatic mutation triggers cyst formation. In some cases, this second hit eliminates the normal allele and the affected cells remain with a single allele, which is the inherited mutated copy, and we only visualize one allele after the amplification by polymerase chain reaction; this is called loss of heterozygosity (LOH). In this study we have analysed the DNA isolated from epitehlial cells from 164 cysts of 8 kidneys affected by ADPKD type I and 30 cysts form a kidney affected by ADPKD type II. We have demonstrated the presence of LOH in 20.1% of PKD1 cysts and in 10% of PKD2 cysts. We have also found eight other different mutations in PKD2 cysts without LOH; so the percentage of somatic mutations in the PKD2 kidney reaches 36.6% of cysts. In conclusion, our data suggest that a recessive mechanism at the cellular level is implicated in cyst formation in the PKD1 and the PKD2 disease. The loss of both copies of the gene triggers the proliferation of a single cell, resulting in the cyst formation.","3475":"","3476":"","3477":"","3478":"","3479":"","3480":"","3481":"","3482":"A vital conceptual difference between intermittent and continuous dialysis therapies is the difference in the relationship between Kt\/V urea and dietary protein intake. For a given level of protein intake the intermittent therapies require a higher Kt\/V urea due to the reasons mentioned above. The recently released adequacy guidelines by DOQI for intermittent and continuous therapies are based on these assumptions. The link between adequacy targets and patient survival is well documented for an intermittent therapy like HD. For a continuous therapy like CAPD however, the evidence linking improved peritoneal clearance to better survival is not as direct. However, present consensus allows one to extrapolate results based on HD. The concept of earlier and healthier initiation of dialysis is gaining hold and incremental dialysis forms an integral aspect of the whole concept. Tools like urea kinetic modeling give us valuable insight in making mathematical projections about the timing as well as dosing of dialysis. Daily home hemodialysis is still an underutilized modality despite offering best survival figures. Hopefully, with increasing availability of better and simpler machines its use will increase. Still several questions remain unanswered. Despite availability of data in hemodialysis patients suggesting that an increased dialysis prescription leads to a better survival, optimal dialysis dose is yet to be defined. Concerns regarding methodology of such studies and conclusions thereof has been raised. Other issues relating to design of the studies, variation in dialysis delivery, use of uncontrolled historical standards and lack of patient randomization etc also need to be considered when designing such trials. Hopefully an ongoing prospective randomized trial, namely the HEMO study, looking at two precisely defined and carefully maintained dialysis prescriptions will provide some insight into adequacy of dialysis dose and survival. In diabetic patients, the relationship between outcome and dialysis dose needs to be better defined. Data relating adequacy of dialysis to outcome in a pediatric population is not available. In dialysis therapy, the Risk\/Dose (R\/D) function does not bear a linear relationship. This together with a lack of proof equating peritoneal to renal clearance lends some uncertainty to the validity of the recommendation that there is a linear and constant decrease in RR for std (Kt\/V) [equivalent standardized Kt\/V calculated from average predialysis BUN for any frequency and\/or combination of intermittent and continuous dialysis ref] up to 2.3 as reported in the CANUSA study. Due to the complex nature of this problem it may be prudent to undertake a multi-center trial with std (Kt\/V) prospectively randomized to either 2.0 or 2.4. This would provide a reliable database to evaluate the R\/D function over this critical range of normalized peritoneal urea clearance. Likewise in PD, the postulated linearity between dialysis dose and outcome needs to be studied in a prospective randomized manner. The amount of dialysis dose required for malnourished patients, diabetic and pediatric patients needs to be better defined. The role of aggressive dialysis in reversing malnutrition needs to be studied and studies need to be done to identify the most scientific use of V in malnourished patients. Justification of a healthy start\/incremental dialysis based on outcome measures needs to be established and it's cost effectiveness validated by clinical trials. Again, a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing incremental dialysis with dietary protein restriction in patients with GFR &lt; or = 10.5 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 with properly defined outcome measures like morbidity, mortality, decline of GFR and quality of life needs to be conducted. Comparisons of incremental hemodialysis and incremental peritoneal dialysis need to be made especially with regard to technique survival and preservation of residual renal function (RRF).

Furthermore the patients should have sufficient information to be able to make these decisions wisely.","3486":"","3487":"","3488":"","3489":"","3490":"","3491":"","3492":"","3493":"Gene therapy has many potential applications for the treatment of vascular disease.

Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) is defined as temperatures higher than 38.3 degrees C on several occasions, with a duration of more than 3 weeks, and failure to reach a diagnosis despite 1 week of in-patient investigation. There is a large list of causes of PUO including infections, malignancies and autoimmune diseases, but antiglomerular basement disease has not been described as a cause. We present the first case of antiglomerular basement disease which presented with PUO.","3500":"There are several shortcut formulas to calculate Kt\/V, the most widely used because of its simplicity is the logarithmic formula proposed by Lowrie in 1983. The DOQI report recommends use of the formula proposed by Daugirdas's in 1993 to estimate the Kt\/V, it must be &gt; or = 1.2. The aim of the present work was to analyse the concordance between the second generation Daugirdas's formula and the other shortcut formulas. In 208 hemodialysis sessions performed on 61 patients, Kt\/V was estimated by thirteen formulas: 10 single-pool modeling and three double-pool modeling. The Kt\/V values obtained by Daugirdas's formula was different from those obtained with the other single-pool based formulas (p &lt; 0.01). When the dialysis sessions were classified in 4 groups according to the Kt\/V values calculated by Daugirdas's formula, most of the single-pool formulas gave Kt\/V values statistically different from those given by Daugirda's formula in all ranges examined. The concordance among Kt\/V calculated by every one of the single-pool formulas and Daugirdas's formula was variable. The highest agreement was with Keshaviah's and Lowrie's 1992 formulas and the lowest with Calzavare's and Lowrie's 1983 formulas. The linear multivariate analysis showed that the two factors which influenced the concordance were the Kt\/V value obtained by the Daugirdas's formula, and the quotient between the postdialysis body weight and the ultrafiltration rate. Despite the weak concordance with Daugirdas's formula, the Kt\/V obtained by Lowrie's 1983 formula and the urea reduction ratio (URR) are still useful tools to monitor the adequacy of dialysis: a Kt\/V &gt; 1.065 calculated by the Lowrie's 1983 formula and a PRV &gt; 65% are equivalent to a Kt\/V &gt; or = 1.2 calculated by Daugirdas's formula. The shortcut formulas used to calculate Kt\/V give different results with high inter-method variability. When Kt\/V is reported it is absolutely necessary to indicate the formula used to calculate it. The Kt\/V obtained by Lowrie's 1983 formula and the URR are useful tools to monitor dialysis adequacy. ","3501":"The serum anion gap (AG) is a calculated value defined as the difference between the sum of sodium and potassium and the sum of chloride and bicarbonate concentrations. Thus, the anion gap is equal to the unmeasured cations minus the unmeasured anions (UA). To evaluate the AG changes during HDF-on line, we studied 20 patients treated with this technique. Blood pH, HCO3, NA, K, Cl, albumin, phosphorus, urea, creatinine and lactate were determined pre and post-HDF. The AG, negative charger of serum albumin (CAA) and phosphate (CAP) were computed by equations. AG decreased during HDF from 23.1 +\/- 3.4 mEq\/l to 17.3 +\/- 3.6 mEq\/l (p &lt; 0.001). The CAA rose from 10.9 +\/- 0.8 to 12.3 +\/- 1.7 mEq\/l (p &lt; 0.001). The CAP and lactate fell significantly during HDF (p &lt; 0.001 and 0.05 respectively). Other unmeasured anions (UA) decreased from 7.9 +\/- 3.0 to 2.4 +\/- 2.7 mEq\/l (p &lt; 0.001). The CAA contributed 47.7 +\/- 6.5% and 73.01 +\/- 12.7% to the pre and post-HDF serum anion gap respectively. The CAP accounted for 12.4 +\/- 3.4% and 8.6 +\/- 1.8%, lactate 6.4 +\/- 3.9% and 6.0 +\/- 3.0% and UA for 33.2 +\/- 7.7% and 12.2 +\/- 13.6% of the anion gap pre and post-HD respectively. AG and UA correlated significantly with blood urea pre-HDF and urea generation. The increase in serum albumin and pH can mask an decreased concentration of unmeasured anions in patients treated with HDF on-line. An adjusted anion gap without effect of CAA and CAP can be obtained. With the help of this adjustments the changes in some undetermined anions organic and inorganic (sulphate and others in renal failure) can be calculated.","3502":"The in vivo contribution of diffusion, convection ad adsorption to beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) elimination by hemodiafiltration (HDF) was investigated. 11 patients (8M\/3W), with a mean age of 59 +\/- 10 years and weighing 62.7 +\/- 8.7 kg were studied. A 1.89 m2 polysulphone membrane was used in 180 min postdilution HDF. Samples at blood inlet (bi), blood autlet (bo), dialysate outlet (do) and ultrafiltrate (uf) were taken to determine beta 2-m concentrations at 30 and 150 min. Rates of flow (Q, ml(min) prescribed were: infusion, Qinf = 103.6 +\/- 12.3, Quf = 14.6 +\/- 4.0 y Qb = 465 +\/- 5.0. Effective Qbi was automatically measured by the machine and Qdo = 800 + Quf. The removed beta 2-m mass (M, mg\/min) was obtained by multiplying rates of flow (Q, L\/min) by beta 2-m concentrations (mg\/L) at each sampling point. From mass balance, we calculated the mass of beta 2-m removed (mg\/min) by adsorption 0.23 +\/- 0.2, by convection 0.7 +\/- 0.3 and by diffusion 1.0 +\/- 0.4, at 30 min. At 150 min, the beta 2-m mass removed was -0.06 +\/- 0.1 by adsorption 0.4 +\/- 0.1 by convection and 0.3 +\/- 0.1 by diffusion. In HDF, these beta 2-m eliminating mechanisms play a variable role throughout the session. The more significant conclusion is that diffusion of beta 2-m with a synthetic \"open\" membrane is an important method of removing beta 2-m, comparable to convection over the whole procedure. That result explain the relative efficacy of beta 2-m clearance by HDF convection, and also explain why isolated diffusion is an efficient mechanism for beta 2-m removal by high-flux hemodialysis.","3503":null,"3504":"The high incidence of arteriosclerotic disease in patients with chronic renal failure seems to be due to certain peculiarities in their lipid metabolism. These are principally a disorder in the transportation of lipoproteins and a concomitant defect in triglyceride metabolism causing an accumulation of triglyceride-rich-lipoproteins which predispose to atherosclerosis. We studied the disturbances in concentration of apolipoproteins, notably Apo C-II and C-III, which modulate the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) without replacement therapy and in hemodialysis patients with and without hyperlipidemia. LPL hydrolyses triglycerides in the lipoprotein-triglyceride (LPRTG) core. The main lipid parameters were measured in 4 groups of normolipidemic and hyperlipidemic patients with and without CRF in comparison with healthy controls. We found that the lipolytic activity index (A-I\/C-III) was decreased, and Apo C-III levels were increased, in patients with CRF and patients on HD, including normolipidemic patients. We conclude that high Apo C-III levels are found in uremic patients before starting dialysis and do not change during dialysis treatment. This increase could be one of the initial causes of impaired triglyceride catabolism and LPRTG accumulation even in normolipidemic patients with CRF and may be one explanation of the high mortality from cardiovascular disease in these patients.","3505":"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary kidney disease. It is caused by mutations in at least two different genes: PKD1 and PKD2. The study of mutations in these genes is very difficult nowadays. In this study we have analyzed the non reiterated region of the PKD1 gene and all the exons and intron exon boundaries of the PKD2 gene. The technique used to study these genes have been single strand conformation analysis and heteroduplex. We have found 25 differences within the DNA sequence of the PKD1 gene with respect to the published sequence. Seven of these changes correspond to nonsense, missense, frameshifting and splicing mutations. The rest of changes correspond to polymorphisms or rare DNA variants. In the PKD2 gene we have identified 8 new mutations and one polymorphism. Six of these mutations are frameshifting, one is missense and the other one is a large deletion of the PKD2 gene. The rate of mutation detection within the PKD1 gene has been 4% and the rate for PKD2 has been 100%. We have not observed any correlation between genotype and phenotype either in the PKD1 nor in the PKD2 gene. The mutation analysis of ADPKD genes is very difficult, specially for the PKD1 gene. The rate of mutation detection is higher in the PKD2 gene but the global efficacy of the technique is very low as PKD2 represents only 15% of ADPKD patients. Nowadays linkage analysis is still the most useful technique for the molecular diagnosis of ADPKD patients.","3506":"","3507":"","3508":""},"articletitle":{"0":"[Management of immunosuppressive therapy in kidney transplant recipients with COVID19.
