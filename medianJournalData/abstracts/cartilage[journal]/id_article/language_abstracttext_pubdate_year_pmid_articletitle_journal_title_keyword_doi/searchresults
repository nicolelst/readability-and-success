zonal properties of articular cartilage critically contribute to the mechanical support and lubrication of the tissue. Current treatments for articular cartilage have yet to regenerate this zonal architecture, thus compromising the functional efficacy of the repaired tissue and leading to tissue degeneration in the long term. In this study, the efficacy of zonal cartilage regeneration through bilayered implantation of expanded autologous zonal chondrocytes was investigated in a porcine chondral defect model. Autologous chondrocytes extracted from articular cartilage in the non-weight bearing trochlea region of the knee were subjected to an expansion-sorting strategy, integrating dynamic microcarrier (dMC) culture, and spiral microchannel size-based zonal chondrocyte separation. Zonal chondrocytes were then implanted as bilayered fibrin hydrogel construct in a porcine knee chondral defect model. Repair efficacy was compared with implantation with cell-free fibrin hydrogel and full thickness (FT) cartilage-derived heterogenous chondrocytes. Cartilage repair was evaluated 6 months after implantation. Sufficient numbers of zonal chondrocytes for implantation were generated from the non-weight bearing cartilage. Six-month repair outcomes showed that bilayered implantation of dMC-expanded zonal chondrocytes resulted in substantial recapitulation of zonal architecture, including chondrocyte arrangement, specific Proteoglycan 4 distribution, and collagen alignment, that was accompanied by healthier underlying subchondral bone. These results demonstrate that with appropriate expansion and isolation of zonal chondrocytes, the strategy of stratified zonal chondrocyte implantation represents a significant advancement to Autologous Chondrocyte Implantation-based cartilage regeneration, with the potential to improve the long-term integrity of the regenerated tissues. ","2":"The present study explored whether low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) enhances the therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in osteoarthritis (OA) cartilage repair by regulating autophagy-mediated exosome release. MSCs were isolated from the rat bone marrow and treated with rapamycin, 3-methyladenine, or LIPUS. The mechanism of the LIPUS-stimulated exosome release by MSCs was analyzed by inhibiting autophagy. In addition, the MSCs were co-cultured with OA chondrocytes and stimulated by LIPUS, with or without exosome release inhibitor intervention. The exosome release was detected through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis, and biomarker expression analysis. Autophagy was analyzed through TEM, autophagy-related gene expression analysis, and immunofluorescence analysis in vitro. Furthermore, a rat knee OA model was constructed and treated with MSCs, GW4869, and LIPUS. The cartilage repair was assessed through histopathological analysis and extracellular matrix protein expression analysis. The in vitro results indicated that LIPUS promoted MSC exosome release by activating autophagy. The in vivo results demonstrated that LIPUS significantly enhanced the positive effects of MSCs on OA cartilage. These effects were significantly blocked by GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome release. LIPUS can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs in OA cartilage repair, and the underlying mechanism is related to the increase in autophagy-mediated exosome release. ","3":"To validate a semi-automated technique to segment ultrasound-assessed femoral cartilage without compromising segmentation accuracy to a traditional manual segmentation technique in participants with an anterior cruciate ligament injury (ACL). We recruited 27 participants with a primary unilateral ACL injury at a pre-operative clinic visit. One investigator performed a transverse suprapatellar ultrasound scan with the participant's ACL injured knee in maximum flexion. Three femoral cartilage ultrasound images were recorded. A single expert reader manually segmented the femoral cartilage cross-sectional area in each image. In addition, we created a semi-automatic program to segment the cartilage using a random walker-based method. We quantified the average cartilage thickness and echo-intensity for the manual and semi-automated segmentations. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC2,k) and Bland-Altman plots were used to validate the semi-automated technique to the manual segmentation for assessing average cartilage thickness and echo-intensity. A dice correlation coefficient was used to quantify the overlap between the segmentations created with the semi-automated and manual techniques. For average cartilage thickness, there was excellent reliability (ICC2,k = 0.99) and a small mean difference (+0.8%) between the manual and semi-automated segmentations. For average echo-intensity, there was excellent reliability (ICC2,k = 0.97) and a small mean difference (-2.5%) between the manual and semi-automated segmentations. The average dice correlation coefficient between the manual segmentation and semi-automated segmentation was 0.90, indicating high overlap between techniques. Our novel semi-automated segmentation technique is a valid method that requires less technical expertise and time than manual segmentation in patients after ACL injury. ","4":"The aim of this meta-analysis was to study the evidence on pain sensitization in knee osteoarthritis (OA), providing a quantitative synthesis of its prevalence and impact. Factors associated with pain sensitization were also investigated. Meta-analysis; PubMed (MEDLINE), Cochrane Central Register (CENTRAL), and Web of Science were searched on February 2021. Level I to level IV studies evaluating the presence of pain sensitization in patients with symptomatic knee OA, documented through a validated method (questionnaires or quantitative sensory testing), were included. The primary outcome was the prevalence of pain sensitization. Factors influencing the prevalence were also evaluated, as well as differences in terms of pain thresholds between knee OA patients and healthy controls. Fifty-three articles including 7,117 patients were included. The meta-analysis of proportion documented a prevalence of pain sensitization of 20% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16%-26%) with a significant heterogeneity of results (I2 = 89%, P &lt; 0.001). The diagnostic tool used was the main factor influencing the documented prevalence of pain sensitization (P = 0.01). Knee OA patients presented higher pain sensitivity compared with healthy controls, both in terms of local pressure pain threshold (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -1.00, 95% CI = -1.67 to -0.32, P = 0.007) and distant pressure pain threshold (SMD = -0.54, 95% CI = -0.76 to -0.31, P &lt; 0.001). Knee OA pain presents features that are consistent with a significant degree of pain sensitization. There is a high heterogeneity in the reported results, mainly based on the diagnostic tool used. The identification of the best methods to detect pain sensitization is warranted to correctly evaluate and manage symptoms of patients affected by knee OA. PROSPERO CRD42019123347. ","5":null,"6":"Nasal septum cartilage is a hyaline cartilage that provides structural support to the nasal cavity and midface. Currently, information on its cellular and mechanical properties is widely dispersed and has often been inferred from studies conducted on other cartilage types such as the knee. A detailed understanding of nasal cartilage properties is important for several biological, clinical, and engineering disciplines. The objectives of this scoping review are to (1) consolidate actual existing knowledge on nasal cartilage properties and (2) identify gaps of knowledge and research questions requiring future investigations. This scoping review incorporated articles identified using PROSPERO, Cochrane Library (CDSR and Central), WOS BIOSIS, WOS Core Collection, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global databases. Following the screening process, 86 articles were considered. Articles were categorized into three groups: growth, extracellular matrix, and mechanical properties. Most articles investigated growth properties followed by extracellular matrix and mechanical properties. NSC cartilage is not uniform. Nasal cartilage growth varies with age and location. Similarly, extracellular matrix composition and mechanical properties are location-specific within the NSC. Moreover, most articles included in the review investigate these properties in isolation and only very few articles demonstrate the interrelationship between multiple cartilage properties. This scoping review presents a first comprehensive description of research on NSC properties with a focus on NSC growth, extracellular matrix and mechanical properties. It additionally identifies the needs (1) to understand how these various cartilage properties intersect and (2) for more granular, standardized assessment protocols to describe NSC. ","7":null,"8":"To investigate the expression of Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway proteins in knee articular cartilage from Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Knee articular cartilage samples were collected from normal (N), OA, and KBD adults (aged 38-60 years) and divided into 3 groups with 6 subjects in each group. The localization of the HH pathway proteins bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), Sonic hedgehog (SHH), and Indian hedgehog (IHH) was observed with the microscope after immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Positive staining cell rates of each proteins were compared. The strongest stainings of all proteins were observed in the middle zones of all 3 groups. The positive staining rates of BMP4 and IHH were significantly lower in the OA and KBD groups than those in the N group in all 3 zones. The positive staining rates of BMP2 and SHH tend to be lower in the OA and KBD groups than those in the N group in the deep zone, while higher in the OA and KBD groups than those in the N group in superficial and middle zones. Altered expression of the HH pathway proteins BMP2, BMP4, SHH, and IHH was found in OA and KBD articular cartilage. There seemed to be a compensatory effect between SHH and IHH in cartilage damage. Further studies on the pathogenesis of OA and KBD may be carried out from these aspects in the future.

We retrospectively reviewed knee magnetic resonance images including sagittal T2 maps of distal FCC performed in patients with or without discoid meniscus. Combined meniscal pathology such as degeneration or tears was also reviewed. Regions of interest were selected, and T2 relaxation time profiles were generated according to medial and lateral and FCC and according to weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing FCC. Nonparametric comparison tests using median values were performed. Seventy-nine knees from 73 patients (2-20 years) including 45 knees with lateral discoid meniscus (discoid group) were studied. T2 values of FCC showed negative correlation with age in both the discoid and nondiscoid groups (P &lt; 0.01), except for medial weight-bearing FCC. In the discoid group, T2 relaxation times of lateral weight-bearing FCC (median, 46.5 ms) were lower than those of lateral non-weight-bearing (median, 53.2 ms; P &lt; 0.001) and medial weight-bearing (median, 50.5 ms; P = 0.012) FCC. Lateral weight-bearing FCC also showed lower T2 values than other areas in patients with meniscal pathology in the discoid group. However, T2 relaxation times did not differ between the discoid and nondiscoid groups in patients without meniscal pathology. Children and young adults with discoid meniscus have lower T2 relaxation times in lateral weight-bearing FCC compared with non-weight-bearing or medial FCC, suggesting compositional changes have occurred in these patients.

Ovine translational models are used to investigate novel treatments aimed at remedying these conditions to prevent articular cartilage degeneration and subsequent joint degradation. However, topographical properties of articular cartilage in the ovine shoulder are undefined. This study investigates the biomechanical, morphological, and biochemical attributes of healthy ovine humeral head articular cartilage and characterizes topographical variations between surface locations. Ten humeral heads were collected from healthy skeletally mature sheep and each was segregated into 4 quadrants using 16 regions of interest (ROIs) across the articular surface. Articular cartilage of each ROI was analyzed for creep indentation, thickness, and sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) and collagen quantity. Comparisons of each variable were made between quadrants and between ROIs within each quadrant. Percent creep, thickness, and sGAG content, but not collagen content, were significantly different between humeral head quadrants. Subregion analysis of the ROIs within each surface quadrant revealed differences in all measured variables within at least one quadrant. Percent creep was correlated with sGAG (r = -0.32, P = 0.0001). Collagen content was correlated with percent creep (r = 0.32, P = 0.0009), sGAG (r = -0.19, P = 0.049), and thickness (r = -0.19, P = 0.04). Topographical variations exist in mechanical, morphologic, and biochemical properties across the articular surface of the ovine humeral head. Recognizing this variability in ovine humeral head cartilage will provide researchers and clinicians with accurate information that could impact study outcomes.

Histology is probably the gold standard, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to decrease the need for invasive histological biopsies. The 3D magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score is a reliable yet elaborate tool. Moreover, literature is controversial concerning the correlation of histology and MRI. To test the applicability of the International Cartilage Regeneration and Joint Preservation Society (ICRS) II and MOCART 3D score for the evaluation of aged osteochondral regenerates in a large animal model, and to identify correlating histological and MRI parameters. Osteochondral defects in medial femoral condyles of n = 12 adult sheep were reconstructed with biodegradable bilayer implants. About 19.5 months postoperation, n = 10 joints were analyzed with MRI (3D MOCART score). Histological samples were analyzed using the ICRS II score; both pre- and post-training. The intraclass correlation coefficient, the inter-rater reliability, and the 95% confidence interval were calculated. Matching histological and MRI parameters were tested for correlation. We found a statistically significant correlation of all histological parameters. MRI parameters reflecting \"overall\" assessments had very strong inter-rater correlations. Statistically significant strong correlations were found for the MRI parameters defect filling, cartilage interface, bone interface, and surface. For defect overall (MRI) and overall assessment (ICRS II), we found a significant yet mild correlation. The ICRS II and the 3D MOCART score are applicable to aged osteochondral regenerates. Prior training on the scoring systems is essential. Select MRI and histological parameters correlate; however, the only statistically significant correlation was found for overall assessment.

In this prospective clinical trial, 56 OA patients completed the study. One single dose of injection of HYAJOINT Plus into the knee cavity was performed. The primary efficacy outcome measure for structural change of knee joint was evaluated by US using a semiquantitative grading system. Secondary efficacy outcome measures included Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total and subscale scores. All efficacy outcomes were measured at baseline and at first, third, and sixth month following treatment. There were significant US grade-improvement changes of cartilage between baseline and follow-up visits over medial femoral condyle and transverse overall evaluation at 3- and 6-month follow-ups, and over lateral femoral condyle, intercondylar notch, and medial longitudinal area at 6-month follow-up. The improved score change of WOMAC from baseline was significant at 1- and 3-month follow-ups in pain subscale, whereas score change from baseline was significant at 6-month follow-up in total score and all 3 subscale scores. It was determined that significant improvement was found on cartilage by US after intra-articular injection with high-molecular weight, biological fermentation-derived HYAJOINT Plus. The semiquantitative grading system by US is a promising tool to identify the efficacy on cartilage band after interventions.

Patellofemoral involvement accounts for less than 1% of cases; tibial plateau and multifocal involvement is an even rarer instance. The purpose of this study is to review what is currently known about patellofemoral OCD (PF-OCD) and to present an unusual case of PF-OCD which progressed to become multifocal in an adult female patient. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed\/Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases on September 2021 for all levels of evidence and English language. After duplicate removal, 234 papers pertaining to PF-OCD were retrieved. Thirty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. As an example, a unique case of delamination of patellar cartilage consistent with PF-OCD with progressive involvement of trochlea and both tibial plateau in a 35-year-old woman is also presented. PF-OCD is a rare localization of knee OCD. Two hundred eighty-eight cases have been reported in the literature to date. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 16 years and the location could also be bilateral and multifocal. The etiology is still debated but traumatic, vascular, and hereditary mechanisms are likely. Management mirrors that of classical OCD. PF-OCD is an uncommon cause of anterior knee pain but should be considered even when physeal plates are closed. Current available evidence on treatment is of low quality, based on single case reports or small retrospective case series.

The GSE74089 was obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including 4 necrotic tissues and 4 normal tissues, and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by limma package in R language. Simultaneously, we searched for the genes related to oxidative stress in the Gene Ontology (GO) database. GO and signaling pathways analysis were performed using DAVID, Metascape, and GSEA. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database, and the Degree algorithm of Cytoscape software was used to screen for hub genes. Finally, the NetworkAnalyst web tool was used to find the hub genes' transcriptional factors (TFs). In total, 440 oxidative stress-related genes were found in GSE74089 and GO database, and 88 of them were significantly differentially expressed. These genes were mainly involved in several signaling pathways, such as MAPK signaling pathway, PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, FOXO signaling pathway. The top 10 hub genes were JUN, FOXO3, CASP3, JAK2, RELA, EZH2, ABL1, PTGS2, FBXW7, MCL1. Besides, TFAP2A, GATA2, SP1, and E2F1 may be the key regulatory factors of hub genes. We identified some hub genes and signaling pathways associated with oxidative stress in ONFH through a series of bioinformatics analyses.

Therefore, a method for the unbiased scoring of OA histology is needed. In this study, as the first step for establishing this system, we developed a computer-vision algorithm that automatically detects the medial and lateral compartments of mouse knee sections in a rigorous and unbiased manner. A total of 706 images of coronal sections of mouse knee joints stained by hematoxylin and eosin, safranin O, or toluidine blue were randomly divided into training and validation images at a ratio of 80:20. A model to detect both compartments automatically was built by machine learning using a single-shot multibox detector (SSD) algorithm with training images. The model was tested to determine whether it could accurately detect both compartments by analyzing the validation images and 52 images of sections stained with Picrosirius red, a method not used for the training images. The trained model accurately detected both medial and lateral compartments of all 140 validation images regardless of the staining method employed, severity of articular cartilage defects, and the anatomical positions and conditions of the sections. Our model also correctly detected both compartments of 50 of 52 Picrosirius red-stained images. By applying deep learning based on the SSD algorithm, we successfully developed a model that detects the locations of the medial and lateral compartments of tissue sections of mouse knee joints with high accuracy.

This study aims to (1) identify OA patient subgroups phenotypes and (2) determine predictors of OA severity and cartilage-derived stem\/progenitor concentration using clinical-, tissue-, and cell- level metrics. Cartilage, synovium (SYN) and infrapatellar fatpad (IPFP) were collected from 90 total knee arthroplasty patients. Clinical metrics (patient demographics, radiograph-based joint space width (JSW), Kellgren and Lawrence score (KL)), tissue metrics (cartilage histopathology grade, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)) and cell-based metrics (cartilage-, SYN-, and IPFP-derived cell concentration ([Cell], cells\/mg), connective tissue progenitor (CTP) prevalence (PCTP, CTPs\/million cells plated), CTP concentration, [CTP], CTPs\/mg)) were assessed using k-mean clustering and linear regression model. Four patient subgroups were identified. Clusters 1 and 2 comprised of younger, high body mass index (BMI) patients with healthier cartilage, where Cluster 1 had high CTP in cartilage, SYN, and IPFP, and Cluster 2 had low [CTP] in cartilage, SYN, and IPFP. Clusters 3 and 4 comprised of older, low BMI patients with diseased cartilage where Cluster 3 had low [CTP] in SYN, IPFP but high [CTP] in cartilage, and Cluster 4 had high [CTP] in SYN, IPFP but low [CTP] in cartilage. Age (r = 0.23, P = 0.026), JSW (r = 0.28, P = 0.007), KL (r = 0.26, P = 0.012), GAG\/mg cartilage tissue (r = -0.31, P = 0.007), and SYN-derived [Cell] (r = 0.25, P = 0.049) were weak but significant predictors of OA severity. Cartilage-derived [Cell] (r = 0.38, P &lt; 0.001) and PCTP (r = 0.9, P &lt; 0.001) were moderate\/strong predictors of cartilage-derived [CTP].

","25":"To assess the quality and variability of osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation rehabilitation protocols associated with academic orthopedic programs in the United States. A systematic review was performed to collect all publicly available online rehabilitation protocols for femoral condyle OCA transplant from US academic orthopedic programs participating in the Electronic Residency Application Service. These protocols were evaluated for inclusion of different rehabilitation components as well as timing of suggested initiation of these activities. A total of 22 protocols were included. Although 91% of protocols recommended bracing, wide variation exists in total time of utilization. Median time for full weight bearing (FWB) was 7 weeks (range 4-8). On average, each protocol mentioned 9 (range 2-18) different strengthening exercises. The median time suggested to return to high-impact activities was 9 months (range 8-12). Only 3 protocols (14%) offered criteria of advancement for each phase as well as criteria for discharge. Very few of the academic orthopedic programs have published online rehabilitation protocols following OCA transplantation. Although there is wide variation between the protocols, it allowed the identification of trends or patterns that are more common. However, there is need for more standardized evidence-based rehabilitation protocols which are easy to understand and follow by patients.

Arthroscopic ICRS score can give a maximum score of 12 and the histological score can give values between 0% and 100% for each of its 14 subscores. This study compares these methods in an animal cartilage repair model. This study hypothesizes that there is a significant correlation between these methods. A chondral defect was made in the medial femoral condyle of 18 pigs. Five weeks later, 9 pigs were treated with a novel recombinant human type III collagen\/polylactide scaffold and 9 were left untreated to heal spontaneously. After 4 months, the medial condyles were evaluated with a simulated arthroscopy using the ICRS scoring system followed by a histological ICRS scoring. This porcine cartilage repair model produced repaired cartilage tissue ranging from good to poor repair tissue quality. The mean arthroscopic ICRS total score was 6.8 (SD = 2.2). Histological ICRS overall assessment subscore was 38.2 (SD = 31.1) and histological ICRS average points were 60.5 (SD = 19.5). Arthroscopic ICRS compared with histological ICRS average points or its overall assessment subscore showed moderate correlation (r = 0.49 and r = 0.50, respectively). The interrater reliability with the intraclass correlation coefficients for arthroscopic ICRS total scores, histological ICRS overall assessment subscore, and ICRS average points showed moderate to excellent reliability. Arthroscopic and histological ICRS scoring methods for repaired articular cartilage show a moderate correlation in the animal cartilage repair model.

This study investigated several candidate diagnostic biomarkers and the metabolic phenotype in end-stage KOA in the context of obesity. In this cross-sectional study, adult patients undergoing knee arthroplasty were enrolled and KOA severity was assessed using the Lequesne index. Blood biomarkers with an important role in obesity, the metabolic syndrome, or KOA (oxidized form of low-density lipoprotein [oxLDL], advanced glycation end product [AGE], soluble AGE receptor [sRAGE], fatty acid binding protein 4 [FABP4], phospholipase A2 group IIA [PLA2G2A], fibroblast growth factor 23 [FGF-23], ghrelin, leptin, and resistin) were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; n = 70) or Luminex technique (subgroup of n = 35). H1-NMR spectroscopy was used for the quantification of metabolite levels (subgroup of n = 31). The hip-knee-ankle angle was assessed. Multivariable and multivariate regression analysis was used to examine the relationship of biomarkers with body mass index (BMI) and KOA severity in complete case and multiple imputation analysis. While most of the investigated biomarkers were not associated with KOA severity, FABP4 and leptin were found to correlate with BMI and gender. Resistin was associated with Lequesne index in complete case analysis. Using a targeted metabolomics approach, BMI-dependent changes in the metabolome were hardly visible. Our findings confirm studies on FABP4, leptin, and resistin with regard to obesity and the metabolic syndrome. There was no association of the investigated biomarkers with KOA severity, most likely due to the patient selection (end-stage KOA patients). Based on this absence of BMI-dependent changes in the metabolome, we might assume that BMI is not correlated with KOA severity in this specific patient group.

Patients were treated with HSAM and followed for 2 years. Subjects with focal chondral lesions of the femur (International Cartilage Repair Society grade 3-4) were enrolled in this single-arm prospective study. Standard of care imaging was completed. PROs, including the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Marx Activity Scale, and Visual Analog Scale (VAS), were collected at baseline and at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Three subjects underwent an optional arthroscopy and biopsy of the repair at 24 months. Ten subjects were enrolled and completed the study. At 24 months, KOOS Sports &amp; Recreation improved 173.3% and Quality of Life improved 195.3% from baseline. Marx Activity Scale increased 266.8% from 12 to 24 months. VAS scores improved 84.8% and 81.0% from baseline to 24 months for average and maximum pain. Modified Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) scoring showed that 7 of 10 subjects had complete defect repair and filling by 24 months. Biopsy staining for collagen II revealed integration and remodeling of HSAM into a mix of hyaline-like cartilage and fibrocartilage matrix. This study provides evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of HSAM for treating symptomatic cartilage lesions. Subjects showed a high degree of defect fill and integration with the native cartilage and reported improvements in pain and function post-treatment.

Temperature, which can be quantified using infrared thermography, provides information about the inflammatory component of joint diseases. This systematic review aims at assessing infrared thermography potential and limitations in these pathologies. A systematic review was performed on 3 major databases: PubMed, Cochrane library, and Web of Science, on clinical reports of any level of evidence in English language, published from 1990 to May 2021, with infrared thermography used for diagnosis of osteoarthritis and rheumatic diseases, monitoring disease progression, or response to treatment. Relevant data were extracted, collected in a database, and analyzed for the purpose of this systematic review. Of 718 screened articles 32 were found to be eligible for inclusion, for a total of 2094 patients. Nine studies reported the application to osteoarthritis, 21 to rheumatic diseases, 2 on both. The publication trend showed an increasing interest in the last decade. Seven studies investigated the correlation of temperature changes with osteoarthritis, 16 with rheumatic diseases, and 2 with both, whereas 2 focused on the pre-post evaluation to investigate treatment results in patients with osteoarthritis and 5 in patients with rheumatic diseases. A correlation was shown between thermal findings and disease presence and stage, as well as the clinical assessment of disease activity and response to treatment, supporting infrared thermography role in the study and management of rheumatic diseases and osteoarthritis. The systematic literature review showed an increasing interest in this technology, with several applications in different joints affected by inflammatory and degenerative pathologies.

The aim of the current meta-analysis was to compare surgical treatment versus nonoperative management of ACL tears to assess the impact of these approaches on knee OA development at a 5 and 10 years of follow-up. A meta-analysis was performed after a systematic literature search (May 2021) was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Both randomized and nonrandomized comparative studies with more than 5 years of follow-up were selected. Influence of the treatment was assessed in terms of knee OA development, subjective and objective clinical results, activity level, and risk of further surgeries. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed following the Cochrane guidelines. Twelve studies matched the inclusion criteria, for a total of 1,004 patients. Level of evidence was rated low to very low. No difference was documented in terms of knee OA development, Tegner score, subjective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Lysholm scores. A significant difference favoring the surgical treatment in comparison with a nonsurgical approach was observed in terms of objective IKDC score (P = 0.03) and risk of secondary meniscectomy (P &lt; 0.0001). The level of evidence was considered very low for subjective IKDC, low for knee OA development, objective IKDC, number of secondary meniscectomies, and Lysholm score, and moderate for post-op Tegner score. The meta-analysis did not support an advantage of ACL reconstruction in terms of OA prevention in comparison with a nonoperative treatment. Moreover, no differences were reported for subjective results and activity level at 5 and 10 years of follow-up. On the contrary, patients who underwent surgical treatment of their ACL tear presented important clinical findings in terms of better objective knee function and a lower rate of secondary meniscectomies when compared with conservatively managed patents.Protocol Registration: CRD420191156483 (PROSPERO).

Mitochondria also participate in many intracellular processes involving modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS), responding to instantaneous hypoxia stress, regulating cytoplasmic transport of calcium ion, and directing mitophagy to maintain the homeostasis of individual chondrocytes. To summarize the specific role of mitochondria in chondrocytes, we screened related papers in PubMed database and the search strategy is ((mitochondria) AND (chondrocyte)) AND (English [Language]). The articles published in the past 5 years were included and 130 papers were studied. In recent years, the integrity of mitochondrial structure has been regarded as a prerequisite for normal chondrocyte survival and defect in mitochondrial function has been found in cartilage-related diseases, such as osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the understanding of mitochondria in cartilage is still largely limited. The mechanism on how the changes in mitochondrial structure and function directly lead to the occurrence and development of cartilage-related diseases remains to be elusive. This review aims to summarize the role of mitochondria in chondrocytes under the physiological and pathological changes from ATP generation, calcium homeostasis, redox regulation, mitophagy modulation, mitochondria biogenesis to immune response activation. The enhanced understanding of molecular mechanisms in mitochondria might offer some new cues for cartilage remodeling and pathological intervention.

The thinning and loss of matrix staining in the articular cartilage and the decrease in bone volume induced by hindlimb suspension recovered to the same level as the control group after 2 weeks of reloading. The proportion of the noncalcified and calcified layers of the articular cartilage and the thinning of subchondral bone recovered to the same level as the control group after 4 weeks of reloading. Disuse atrophy of the articular cartilage and bone induced by hindlimb suspension in the tibia of rats was improved by physiological reloading.

In patients with severe OA, its potential is limited because it is unable to reach the subchondral bone, so a new strategy is needed, and intraosseous (IO) infiltration has been suggested. The purpose is to assess the impact of IA together with IO infiltration of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) in serum hyaluronic acid (HA) and type II collagen cleavage neoepitope (C2C) levels. A total of 32 rabbits were included in the study and randomly divided into 2 groups: control and treatment. A 4-mm chondral defect was created in the medial femoral condyle and IA followed by IO infiltration were performed. Serum C2C and HA levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests before infiltration and 28, 56, and 84 days post-infiltration. Significant lower C2C serum levels were obtained in treatment group (IA + IO infiltration of PRGF) at 84 days post-infiltration than in control group (IA infiltration of PRGF + IO infiltration of saline solution), while no significant differences between groups were reported at any other study times. Regarding HA, at 56 days post-infiltration, greater significant levels were seen in the treatment group. However, at 84 days post-infiltration, no significant differences were obtained, although lower levels were reported in the treatment group. Despite inconclusive, the results suggest that the combination of IA and IO infiltration with PRGF may enhance cartilage and subchondral bone regeneration, but further studies are needed.

Seven PT patients and 5 ACT patients who underwent surgery on the femoral condyle between 1986 and 1996 were included. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were assessed by the clinical questionnaires: Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for knee pain. The morphological (MOCART score) and biochemical quality (glycosaminoglycans [GAGs] content and collagen integrity) of cartilage transplants and surrounding articular cartilage were analyzed by 7T MRI. The results of the PT and ACT patients were compared. Finally, a detailed morphological analysis of the grafts alone was performed. No statistically significant difference was found for the PROMs and MOCART scores of PT and ACT patients. Evaluation of the graft alone showed poor repair tissue quality and high prevalence of intralesional osteophyte formation in both the PT and ACT patients. Penetration of the graft surface by the intralesional osteophyte was related to biochemically damaged opposing tibial cartilage; GAG content was significantly lower in patients with an osteophyte penetrating the graft surface. Both PT and ACT patients have a high incidence of intralesional osteophyte formation 25 years after surgery. The resulting biochemical damage to the opposing tibial cartilage might be dependent on osteophyte morphology.

For collagen subtyping, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analysis was performed on tissues digested in trypsin. For collagen crosslinks, LC-MS analysis was performed on hydrolysates. Samples were also examined histologically and with bottom-up proteomics. Ten cartilages (femoral condyle, femoral head, facet joint, floating rib, true rib, auricular cartilage, annulus fibrosus, 2 meniscus locations, and temporomandibular joint disc) were analyzed. The collagen subtyping assay quantified collagen types I and II. The collagen crosslinks assay quantified mature and immature crosslinks. Collagen subtyping revealed that collagen type I predominates in fibrocartilages and collagen type II in hyaline cartilages, as expected. Elastic cartilage and fibrocartilages had more mature collagen crosslink profiles than hyaline cartilages. Bottom-up proteomics revealed a spectrum of ratios between collagen types I and II, and quantified 42 proteins, including 24 collagen alpha-chains and 12 minor collagen types. The novel assays developed in this work are sensitive, inexpensive, and use a low operator time relative to other collagen analysis methods. Unlike the current collagen assays, these assays quantify collagen subtypes and crosslinks without an antibody-based approach or lengthy chromatography. They apply to any collagenous tissue, with broad applications in tissue characterization and tissue engineering. For example, a novel finding of this work was the presence of a large quantity of collagen type III in the white-white knee meniscus and a spectrum of hyaline and fibrous cartilages. ","42":"To support the preclinical evaluation of therapeutics that target chondrogenesis, our goal was to generate a rat strain that can noninvasively report endogenous chondrogenic activity. A transgene was constructed in which the dual expression of bioluminescent (firefly luciferase) and fluorescent (mCherry) reporters is controlled by regulatory sequences from rat Col2a1. Candidate lines were established on a Lewis background and characterized by serial bioluminescence imaging as well as ex vivo measurement of molecular reporter levels in several tissues. The sensitivity and specificity of the reporter strain were assessed in models of orthotopic and ectopic chondrogenesis. Substantial bioluminescence signal was detected from cartilaginous regions, including the appendicular synovial joints, spine, sternum, nose, and pinnae. Bioluminescent radiance was intense at 1 month of age, rapidly declined with continued development, yet remained detectable in 2-year-old animals. Explant imaging and immunohistochemistry confirmed that both molecular reporters were localized to cartilage. Implantation of wild-type bone marrow stromal cells into osteochondral defects made in both young adult and aged reporter rats led to a time-dependent elevation of intra-articular reporter activity concurrent with cartilaginous tissue repair. To stimulate ectopic, endochondral bone formation, bone morphogenetic protein 2 was overexpressed in the gastrocnemius muscle, which led to bioluminescent signal that closely preceded heterotopic ossification. This strain can help develop strategies to stimulate cartilage repair and endochondral bone formation or to inhibit chondrogenesis associated with heterotopic ossification.

Loss of meniscus tissue has been associated with early-onset knee osteoarthritis due to an increase in joint contact pressures in meniscectomized knees. Clinically available replacement strategies range from allograft transplantation to synthetic implants, including the collagen meniscus implant, ACTIfit, and NUSurface. Although short-term efficacy has been demonstrated with some of these treatments, factors such as long-term durability, chondroprotective efficacy, and return to sport activities in young patients remain unpredictable.

This study aims to characterize endogenous ACPCs from healthy and osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, evaluate their potential for cartilage regeneration, and compare this to cartilage formation by chondrocytes. ACPCs were isolated from full-thickness healthy and OA human cartilage and separated from the total cell population by clonal growth after differential adhesion to fibronectin. ACPCs were characterized by growth kinetics, multilineage differentiation, and surface marker expression. Chondrogenic redifferentiation of ACPCs was compared with chondrocytes in pellet cultures. Pellets were assessed for cartilage-like matrix production by (immuno)histochemistry, quantitative analyses for glycosaminoglycans and DNA content, and expression of chondrogenic and hypertrophic genes. Healthy and OA ACPCs were successfully differentiated toward the adipogenic and chondrogenic lineage, but failed to produce calcified matrix when exposed to osteogenic induction media. Both ACPC populations met the criteria for cell surface marker expression of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Healthy ACPCs cultured in pellets deposited extracellular matrix containing proteoglycans and type II collagen, devoid of type I collagen. Gene expression of hypertrophic marker type X collagen was lower in healthy ACPC pellets compared with OA pellets. This study provides further insight into the ACPC population in healthy and OA human articular cartilage. ACPCs show similarities to MSCs, yet do not produce calcified matrix under well-established osteogenic culture conditions. Due to extensive proliferative potential and chondrogenic capacity, ACPCs show potential for cartilage regeneration and possibly for clinical application, as a promising alternative to MSCs or chondrocytes. ","45":"Accurate analysis to quantify cartilage morphology is critical for evaluating degenerative conditions in osteoarthritis (OA). Three-dimensional (3D) optical scanning provides 3D data for the entire cartilage surface; however, there is no consensus on how to quantify it. Our purpose was to validate a 3D method for evaluating spatiotemporal alterations in degenerative cartilages in a rabbit OA model by analyzing their curvatures at various stages of progression. Twelve rabbits underwent anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) unilaterally and were divided into 4 groups: 4 weeks control, 4 weeks OA, 8 weeks control, and 8 weeks OA. 3D scanning, India ink staining, and histological assessments were performed in all groups. In 3D curvature visualization, the surfaces of the condyles were divided into 8 areas. The standard deviations (SD) of mean curvatures from all vertices of condylar surfaces and subareas were calculated. Regarding the site of OA change, curvature analysis was consistent with India ink scoring. The SD of mean curvature correlated strongly with the India ink Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score. In curvature histograms, the curvature distribution in OA was more scattered than in control. Of the 8 areas, significant OA progression in the posterolateral part of the lateral condyle (L-PL) was observed at 4 weeks. The histology result was consistent with the 3D evaluation in terms of representative section. This study demonstrated that 3D scanning with curvature analysis can quantify the severity of cartilage degeneration objectively. Furthermore, the L-PL was found to be the initial area where OA degeneration occurred in the rabbit ACLT model.

This study aimed to elucidate the effects of melatonin (MT), an antioxidant indolamine secreted from the pineal gland, on chondrocyte senescence and cartilage degeneration, thereby clarifying the underlying mechanisms of ROS-induced OA pathogenesis. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was used to induce oxidative stress in rat chondrocytes. ROS levels were evaluated using cytometry and immunofluorescence. Cell viability was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Western blotting and qPCR (Quantiative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction) were used to examine apoptosis and autophagy. For in vivo experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham-operated group, DMM (destabilization of the medial meniscus) surgery group, and surgery groups that received melatonin. Knee joints were collected and stained for histological analysis. The data demonstrated that melatonin treatment significantly suppressed H2O2-induced matrix degradation and apoptosis, and maintained mitochondrial redox homeostasis. In addition, an enhancement of autophagic flux was observed through western blotting. These findings corresponded with activation of the AMPK\/Foxo3 signaling pathways upon melatonin treatment. Histological staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) micrographs also demonstrated that melatonin alleviated cartilage ossification and chondrocyte hypertrophy in vivo. Our results indicated that melatonin protected chondrocytes via mitochondrial redox homeostasis and autophagy. The effects of melatonin on senescence may apply to other age-related diseases. Thus, melatonin may have multiple potential therapeutic applications. ","47":"To analyze and compare cartilage samples from 3 groups of patients utilizing low-input RNA-sequencing. Cartilage biopsies were collected from patients in 3 groups (n = 48): Cartilage lesion (CL) patients had at least ICRS grade 2, osteoarthritis (OA) samples were taken from patients undergoing knee replacement, and healthy cartilage (HC) was taken from ACL-reconstruction patients without CLs. RNA was isolated using an optimized protocol. RNA samples were assessed for quality and sequenced with a low-input SmartSeq2 protocol. RNA isolation yielded 48 samples with sufficient quality for sequencing. After quality control, 13 samples in the OA group, 9 in the HC group, and 9 in the CL group were included in the analysis. There was a high degree of co-clustering between the HC and CL groups with only 6 genes significantly up- or downregulated. OA and the combined HC\/CL group clustered significantly separate from each other, yielding 659 significantly upregulated and 1,369 downregulated genes. GO-term analysis revealed that genes matched to cartilage and connective tissue development terms. The gene expression profiles from the 3 groups suggest that there are no major differences in gene expression between cartilage from knees with a cartilage injury and knees without an apparent cartilage injury. OA cartilage, as expected, showed markedly different gene expression from the other 2 groups. The gene expression profiles resulting from this low-input RNA-sequencing study offer opportunities to discover new pathways not previously recognized that may be explored in future studies. ","48":"The classic chondrocyte isolation protocol is a 1-step enzymatic digestion protocol in which cartilage samples are digested in collagenase solution for a single, long period. However, this method usually results in incomplete cartilage dissociation and low chondrocyte quality. In this study, we aimed to develop a rapid, high-efficiency, and flexible chondrocyte isolation protocol for cartilage tissue engineering. Cartilage tissues harvested from rabbit ear, rib, septum, and articulation were minced and subjected to enzymatic digestion using the classic protocol or the newly developed sequential protocol. In the classic protocol, cartilage fragments were subjected to one 12-hour digestion. In the sequential protocol, cartilage fragments were sequentially subjected to 2-hour first digestion, followed by two 3-hour digestions. The collected cells were then subjected to analyses of cell-yield efficiency, viability, proliferation, phenotype, and cartilage matrix synthesis capacity. Overall, the sequential protocol exhibited higher cell-yield efficiency than the classic protocol for the 4 cartilage types. The cells harvested from the second and third digestions demonstrated higher cell viability, more proliferative activity, a better chondrocyte phenotype, and a higher cartilage-specific matrix synthesis ability than those harvested from the first digestion and after the classic 1-step protocol. The sequential protocol is a rapid, flexible, high-efficiency chondrocyte isolation protocol for different cartilage tissues. We recommend using this protocol for chondrocyte isolation, and in particular, the cells obtained after the subsequent 3-hour sequential digestions should be used for chondrocyte-based therapy. ","49":null,"50":"Autologous chondrocyte implantation was the first cell-based therapy that used a tissue engineering process to repair cartilage defects. Recently improved approaches and tissue-engineered cell constructs have been developed for growing patient populations. We developed a chondrocyte construct using a collagen gel and sponge scaffold and physicochemical stimuli, implanted with a surgical adhesive. We conducted a proof-of-concept study of these improvements using a cartilage defect model in miniature swine. We implanted the autologous chondrocyte constructs into full-thickness chondral defects in the femoral condyle, compared those results with empty and acellular scaffold controls, and compared implantation techniques with adhesive alone and with partial adhesive with suture. Two weeks after the creation of the defects and implantation of the cellular or acellular constructs, we arthroscopically confirmed that the implanted constructs remained at the chondral defects. We evaluated the regenerated tissue macro- and microscopically 6 months after the cell constructs were implanted. The tissues were stained with Safranin-O and evaluated using Sellers' histology grading system. The defects implanted with processed cell constructs and acellular scaffolds were filled with chondrocyte-like round cells and with nearly normal tissue architecture that were significantly greater degree compared to empty defect control. Even with the adhesive alone and with suture alone, the cell construct was composed of the dense cartilaginous matrix that was found in the implantation using both the sutures and the adhesive. Implantation of cell constructs promoted regeneration and integration of articular cartilage at chondral defects in swine by 6 months. ","51":"Synovial inflammation influences the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Herein, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers and analyze transcriptional regulatory-immune mechanism of synovitis in OA using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). A data set of OA synovium samples (GSE55235) was analyzed based on WGCNA. The most significant module with OA was identified and function annotation of the module was performed, following which the hub genes of the module were identified using Pearson correlation and a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. A transcriptional regulatory network of hub genes was constructed using the TRRUST database. The immune cell infiltration of OA samples was evaluated using the single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) method. The hub genes coexpressed in multiple tissues were then screened out using data sets of synovium, cartilage, chondrocyte, subchondral bone, and synovial fluid samples. Finally, transcriptional factors and coexpressed hub genes were validated via experiments. The turquoise module of GSE55235 was identified via WGCNA. Functional annotation analysis showed that \"mineral absorption\" and \"FoxO signaling pathway\" were mostly enriched in the module. JUN, EGR1, FOSB, and KLF4 acted as central nodes in protein-protein interaction network and transcription factors to connect several target genes. \"Activated B cell,\" \"activated CD4T cell,\" \"eosinophil,\" \"neutrophil,\" and \"type 17 T helper cell\" showed high immune infiltration, while FOSB, KLF6, and MYBL2 showed significant negative correlation with type 17 T helper cell. Our results suggest that the expression level of apolipoprotein D (APOD) was correlated with OA. Furthermore, transcriptional regulatory-immune network was constructed, which may contribute to OA therapy. ","52":"Osteoarthritis is a painful joint disease responsible for walking impairment. Its quantitative assessment by gait analysis in mice may be a relevant and noninvasive strategy to assess the disease severity. In this study, we aimed to determine the severity of osteoarthritis at the tissular and gait levels in unilateral and bilateral posttraumatic murine osteoarthritis. Twenty-four C57BL\/6 male mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups (n = 8\/group): controls, unilateral surgery, and bilateral surgery. Posttraumatic osteoarthritis was induced unilaterally or bilaterally by destabilization of the medial meniscus. Gait analysis was performed weekly with the CatWalkTM XT system until the 16th week after surgery. After animal sacrifices, histological and micro-computed tomographic assessment was performed. Operated knees showed a significant increase in the histological score compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001). Calcified anterior medial meniscal bone volume was higher on the ipsilateral side after unilateral destabilization of the medial meniscus (P &lt; 0.001) and on both sides after bilateral intervention (P &lt; 0.01). One week after surgery, the mice mean speed decreased significantly in both operated groups (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05). In the unilateral group, a significant increase in the contralateral hind print area appeared from week 4 to week 16. While bilateral destabilization of the medial meniscus induced no detectable gait modification except 1 week after surgery, unilateral model was responsible for a gait disturbance on the contralateral side. Further studies are needed to better define the place of the CatWalkTM in the evaluation of mouse models of osteoarthritis. ","53":null,"54":"To compare CA4+-enhanced micro-computed tomography (microCT) of bovine articular, meniscal, nasal, and auricular cartilage, each of which possesses a different extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and structure. The diffusion kinetics of CA4+ in different native cartilage types were assessed over 20 hours. The feasibility of CA4+-enhanced microCT to visualize and quantify glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in these different tissues was tested using safranin-O staining and 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue assay. The diffusion kinetics of CA4+ in auricular cartilage are significantly slower compared with all other cartilage types. Total GAG content per volume correlates to microCT attenuation with an R2 value of 0.79 for all cartilage types. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced microCT images of spatial GAG distribution reflect safranin-O staining and highlight the differences in ECM structure, with heterogeneous regions with higher GAG concentrations highlighted by the contrast agent. CA4+-enhanced microCT enables assessment of 3-dimensiona distribution and GAG content in different types of cartilage and has promise as an ex vivo diagnostic technique to monitor matrix development in different tissues over time as well as tissue-engineered constructs.

This study aims to identify the NIR spectral range that is optimal for characterizing cartilage integrity by (a) identifying the contribution of its major constituents (collagen and proteoglycans) to its overall spectrum using proxy constituent models and (b) determining constituent-specific spectral contributions that can be used for assessment of cartilage in its physiological state. The NIR spectra of cartilage matrix constituent models were measured and compared with specific molecular components of organic compounds in the NIR spectral range in order to identify their bands and molecular assignments. To verify the identified bands, spectra of the model compounds were compared with those of native cartilage. Since water obscures some bands in the NIR range, spectral measurements of the native cartilage were conducted under conditions of decreasing water content to amplify features of the solid matrix components. The identified spectral bands were then compared and examined in the resulting spectra of the intact cartilage samples. As water was progressively eliminated from cartilage, the specific contribution of the different matrix components was observed to correspond with those identified from the proxy cartilage component models. Spectral peaks in the regions 5500 to 6250 cm-1 and 8100 to 8600 cm-1 were identified to be effective for characterizing cartilage proteoglycan and collagen contents, respectively.

As articular cartilage has low regenerative power, potent local tissue engineering approaches are needed to support chondrogenic differentiation. Acellular preparation methods as well as approaches to coax endogenous reparative cells into the joint space appear to have limited success. Supported by our in-vitro and clinical studies, we propose that our novel intra-articular administration of human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (IA-hG-CSF) combined with autologous activated peripheral blood stem cells (AAPBSC) is safe and offers treatment advantages not seen with other cellular interventions in early osteoarthritis.","58":"A major obstacle in the clinical translation of engineered auricular scaffolds is the significant contraction and loss of topography that occur during maturation of the soft collagen-chondrocyte matrix into elastic cartilage. We hypothesized that 3-dimensional-printed, biocompatible scaffolds would \"protect\" maturing hydrogel constructs from contraction and loss of topography. External disc-shaped and \"ridged\" scaffolds were designed and 3D-printed using polylactic acid (PLA). Acellular type I collagen constructs were cultured in vitro for up to 3 months. Collagen constructs seeded with bovine auricular chondrocytes (BAuCs) were prepared in 3 groups and implanted subcutaneously in vivo for 3 months: preformed discs with (\"Scaffolded\/S\") or without (\"Naked\/N\") an external scaffold and discs that were formed within an external scaffold via injection molding (\"Injection Molded\/SInj\"). The presence of an external scaffold or use of injection molding methodology did not affect the acellular construct volume or base area loss. In vivo, the presence of an external scaffold significantly improved preservation of volume and base area at 3 months compared to the naked group (P &lt; 0.05). Construct contraction was mitigated even further in the injection molded group, and topography of the ridged constructs was maintained with greater fidelity (P &lt; 0.05). Histology verified the development of mature auricular cartilage in the constructs within external scaffolds after 3 months. Custom-designed, 3D-printed, biocompatible external scaffolds significantly mitigate BAuC-seeded construct contraction and maintain complex topography. Further refinement and scaling of this approach in conjunction with construct fabrication utilizing injection molding may aid in the development of full-scale auricular scaffolds.

To better understand the maintenance hyaline cartilage, we assessed the angiogenic potential of complete cartilage releasate with functional assays in vitro and in vivo. We evaluated the gene expression profile of angiogenesis-related factors in healthy adult human articular cartilage with a transcriptome-wide analysis generated by next-generation RNAseq. The effect on angiogenesis of the releasate of cartilage tissue was assessed with a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay as well as human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and proliferation assays using conditioned media generated from tissue-engineered cartilage derived from human articular and nasal septum chondrocytes as well as explants from bovine articular cartilage and human nasal septum. Experiments were done with triplicate samples of cartilage from 3 different donors. RNAseq data of 3 healthy human articular cartilage donors revealed that the majority of known angiogenesis-related factors expressed in healthy adult articular cartilage are pro-angiogenic. The releasate from generated cartilage as well as from tissue explants, demonstrated at least a 3.1-fold increase in HUVEC proliferation and migration indicating a pro-angiogenic effect of cartilage. Finally, the CAM assay demonstrated that cartilage explants can indeed attract vessels; however, their ingrowth was not observed. Using multiple approaches, we show that cartilage releasate has an inherent pro-angiogenic capacity. It remains vessel free due to anti-invasive properties associated with the tissue itself. ","62":null,"63":"Hypertrophic cartilage formation is a major setback in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-mediated cartilage repair, and overcoming it requires optimization of differentiation. Here, we tested the miR-140 activated collagen hydrogel for the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs and to produce hyaline cartilage. Bone marrow MSCs isolated from 3 patients were pretreated with miR-140 and then chondrogenic differentiated. The 3-dimensional (3D) transfection potential of 5 different transfection reagents (Polyethylenimine, Lipofectamine, TransIT-X2, Amide:Cholesterol-based liposomes [AmC] and AmC pegylated with Tocofersolan [AmCTOC]) was compared and the reagent that showed higher green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was selected. Finally, the collagen hydrogel was activated using miR-140-transfection complex and sustained delivered to MSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. After differentiation, the outcome was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), histology, immunohistochemistry, and compared with scrambled miRNA treated control. Pretreatment of MSCs with miR-140 significantly increased the expression of cartilage-specific genes (COL2A1, SOX9, and ACAN) with reduced hypertrophic chondrocyte (COL10A1) marker expression and better safranin-O staining than the control. The AmCTOC liposome showed a significant increase in 3D transfection of GFP expressing plasmid than the others. Furthermore, the knockdown of GAPDH using siRNA in HEK cells and expression of GFP mRNA in human bone marrow MSCs confirmed the 3D-transfection efficiency of AmCTOC. The sustained delivery of miR-140 using activated matrix formed a hyaline cartilage-like tissue with minimal COL10A1 expression in RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Our results demonstrated the therapeutic potential of miR-140-activated hydrogel for MSCs-based cartilage tissue engineering, which could also be used for endogenous stem cells-mediated cartilage repair. ","64":"Nasal septal pathologies requiring surgical intervention are common in the population. Additionally, nasal chondrocytes are becoming an important cell source in cartilage tissue engineering strategies for the repair of articular cartilage lesions. These procedures damage the nasal septal cartilage whose healing potential is limited due to its avascular, aneural, and alymphatic nature. Despite the high incidence of various surgical interventions that affect septum cartilage, limited nasal cartilage repair characterizations have been performed to date. To evaluate the healing of the nasal septum cartilage perforation, a septal biopsy was performed in 14 sheep. Two and 6 months later, the tissue formed on the place of perforation was explanted and compared with the native tissue. Tissue morphology, protein and gene expression of explanted tissue was determined using histological, immunohistochemical and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Tissue formed on the defect site, 2 and 6 months after the biopsy was characterized as mostly connective tissue with the presence of fibroblastic cells. This newly formed tissue contained no glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II but was positively stained for collagen type I. Cartilage-specific genes COL2, AGG, and COMP were significantly decreased in 2- and 6-month samples compared with the native nasal cartilage. Levels of COL1, COL4, and CRABP1 genes specific for perichondrium and connective tissue were higher in both test group samples in comparison with native cartilage. Newly formed tissue was not cartilage but rather fibrous tissue suggesting the role of perichondrium and mucosa in tissue repair after nasal septum injury. ","65":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that causes serious damage to joints, especially in elderly patients. The aim of study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of intraarticular therapies that are currently used or recently popularized in the treatment of OA. The baseline values were determined by walking the rats on the CatWalk system. Afterwards, a monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-induced knee OA model was created with intraarticular MIA, and the rats were walked again on the CatWalk system and post-OA values were recorded. At this stage, the rats were divided into 4 groups, and intraarticular astaxanthin, intraarticular corticosteroid, intraarticular hyaluronic acid, and intraarticular astaxanthin + hyaluronic acid were applied to the groups, respectively. The rats were walked once more and posttreatment values were obtained. Nine different dynamic gait parameters were used in the comparison. Significant changes were measured in 6 of the 9 dynamic gait parameters after the MIA-induced knee OA model. While the best improvement was observed in run duration (P = 0.0022), stride length (P &lt; 0.0001), and swing speed (P = 0.0355) in the astaxanthin group, the results closest to basal values in paw print length (P &lt; 0.0001), paw print width (P = 0.0101), and paw print area (P = 0.0277) were seen in the astaxanthin + hyaluronic acid group. Astaxanthin gave better outcomes than corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid in both dynamic gait parameters and histological examinations. Intraarticular astaxanthin therapy can be a good alternative to corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid currently used in intraarticular therapy to treat OA. ","66":"Chondrocytes, isolated from articular cartilage, are routinely utilized in cell-based therapeutics for the treatment of cartilage pathologies. However, restoration of the biological tissue faces hindrance due to the formation of primarily fibrocartilaginous repair tissue. Chondroprogenitors have been reported to display superiority in terms of their chondrogenic potential and lesser proclivity for hypertrophy. In line with our recent results, comparing chondroprogenitors and chondrocytes, we undertook isolation of progenitors from the general pool of chondrocytes, based on surface marker expression, namely, CD166, CD34, and CD146, to eliminate off-target differentiation and generate cells of stronger chondrogenic potential. This study aimed to compare chondrocytes, chondroprogenitors, CD34-CD166+CD146+ sorted chondrocytes, and CD34-CD166+CD146- sorted chondrocytes. Chondrocytes obtained from 3 human osteoarthritic knee joints were subjected to sorting, to isolate CD166+ and CD34- subsets, and then were further sorted to obtain CD146+ and CD146- cells. Chondrocytes and fibronectin adhesion-derived chondroprogenitors served as controls. Assessment parameters included reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for markers of chondrogenesis and hypertrophy, trilineage differentiation, and total GAG\/DNA content. Based on gene expression analysis, CD34-CD166+CD146+ sorted chondrocytes and chondroprogenitors displayed comparability and significantly higher chondrogenesis with a lower tendency for hypertrophy when compared to chondrocytes and CD34-CD166+CD146- sorted chondrocytes. The findings were also reiterated in multilineage potential differentiation with the 146+ subset and chondroprogenitors displaying lower calcification and chondroprogenitors displaying higher total GAG\/DNA content compared to chondrocytes and 146- cells. This unique progenitor-like population based on CD34-CD166+CD146+ sorting from chondrocytes exhibits efficient potential for cartilage repair and merits further evaluation for its therapeutic application.

Chondrogenic potential also varies with MSC source and donor age. We assessed the chondrogenic potential of first-trimester and term placental MSCs and compared their response to commonly used bone marrow MSCs (BM-MSCs). MSCs were isolated from first-trimester and term placentae. BM-MSCs were commercially obtained. Chondrogenesis was induced by micromass culture in commercial chondrogenic media for 7, 14, or 21 days. Pellets were assessed for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content, and types I, II, and X collagen. Gene expression was profiled using Qiagen RT2 human MSC arrays. At day 0, first-trimester and term MSCs expression levels of many chondrogenic genes to BM-MSC after 21 days of culture. Only first trimester MSCs showed significant changes in chondrogenic gene expression during induction compared to day 0 undifferentiated MSCs (greater BMP4, KAT2B, and reduced GDF6 expression). Additionally, first-trimester MSCs showed significantly greater expression of ABCB1 (at days 14 and 21) and BMP4 (at days 7, 14, 21) compared with term MSCs. Both first-trimester and term pellets showed increased GAG content over time and term MSCs had significantly GAG greater compared with BM-MSCs at days 7 and 14. Type II collagen was present in all pellets but unlike BM-MSCs, type I collagen was not observed in first-trimester or term MSC pellets. These data highlight differences in BM-MSC and placental MSC chondrogenesis and demonstrate that placental MSCs may be an alternative cell source. ","69":"Case reports of severe acute localized reactions (SALR) following intraarticular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) injections for knee osteoarthritis (OA) have been described. We compared surrogate SALR measures between patients using hylan G-F 20 and specific non-hylan G-F 20 HA products. Knee OA patients were identified from the Optum Clinformatics dataset (January 2006 to June 2016), stratified into hylan G-F 20 and non-hylan G-F 20 HA users, matched by single or multiple injection products. Occurrences of surrogate SALR measures including inflammation\/infection, intraarticular corticosteroid (CS) injections, arthrocentesis\/aspiration, arthrotomy\/incision and drainage, and arthroscopy were evaluated within 3 days post-HA. Based on 694,404 HA injections, inflammation\/infection rate was rare within 3 days of HA (up to 0.03%), with no statistical differences between hylan G-F 20 and non-hylan G-F 20 groups (matched by single or multiple injection products). The risk of knee arthrotomy\/incision and drainage, arthroscopy, or arthrocentesis for hylan G-F 20 (2 mL) 3 weekly injection patients was lower than Hyalgan\/Supartz and Orthovisc patients, but greater than Euflexxa patients. Overall, we found that Hylan G-F 20 (2 mL) 3 weekly injection had lower SALR rates compared to Hyalgan\/Supartz and Orthovisc. However, Hylan G-F 20 (2 mL) 3 weekly injection had slightly higher rates of SALR when compared to Euflexxa. Among the single injection products, Hylan G-F 20 (6 mL) single injection had lower rates of SALR than Monovisc and Gel-One. This study shows no clear correlation between avian-derived or cross-linked products and SALR and provides evidence against avian-derived products or crosslinking as a source for these reactions. ","70":"Meniscal degeneration is a common finding even in young patients' knees, and it is regarded as a predictor for the onset of early osteoarthritis (OA). When symptomatic, it represents a challenge since arthroscopic surgery provides unpredictable results: recent evidence has shown that partial meniscectomy is not better than conservative management up to 2 years of follow-up, and the removal of meniscal tissue may accelerate OA progression toward OA. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid may help in providing temporary symptomatic relief, but no influence should be expected on the quality of the meniscal tissue. Biologic agents have been adopted to treat a variety of degenerative musculoskeletal pathologies, and the use of platelet-derived growth factors (GFs) has become routine. Preclinical studies have documented that platelet-derived GFs may play a beneficial role in stimulating meniscal repair and regeneration by triggering anabolic pathways and stimulating local mesenchymal stem cells from synovium. Furthermore, also mechanical stimulation (e.g., arthroscopic trephination or percutaneous needling) in the red-red or red-white zone may further promote tissue healing. The purpose of the present brief report is to describe the clinical outcomes at 18 months' follow-up in a cohort of patients affected by symptomatic medial meniscus degeneration and treated by percutaneous needling plus intra- and perimeniscal injection of autologous conditioned plasma (ACP). The procedure was shown to be safe and provided significant pain reduction and improvement in subjective scores. This treatment option deserves further investigation in a comparative setting, to establish whether it could offer advantage over isolated intra-articular injections.","71":null,"72":"The knowledge about functions of caspases, usually associated with cell death and inflammation, keeps expanding also regarding cartilage. Active caspases are present in the growth plate, and caspase inhibition in limb-derived chondroblasts altered the expression of osteogenesis-related genes. Caspase inhibitors were reported to reduce the severity of cartilage lesions in osteoarthritis (OA), and caspase-3 might represent a promising biomarker for OA prognosis. The objective of this investigation was to decipher the transcriptomic regulation of caspase inhibition in chondrogenic cells. Limb-derived chondroblasts were cultured in the presence of 2 different inhibitors: Z-VAD-FMK (FMK) and Q-VD-OPH (OPH). A whole transcriptome RNA sequencing was performed as the key analysis. The analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the expression of 252 genes in the FMK samples and 163 genes in the OPH samples compared with controls. Conversely, there was a significant decrease in the expression of 290 genes in the FMK group and 188 in the OPH group. Among the top up- and downregulated genes (more than 10 times changed), almost half of them were associated with OA. Both inhibitors displayed the highest upregulation of the inflammatory chemokine Ccl5, the most downregulated gene was the one for mannose receptors Mrc1. The obtained datasets pointed to a significant impact of caspase inhibition on the expression of several chondro-\/osteogenesis-related markers in an in vitro model of endochondral ossification. Notably, the list of these genes included some encoding for factors associated with cartilage\/bone pathologies such as OA. ","73":"The goal of the present study was to observe the effect of autophagy in tibial plateau chondrocytes on apoptosis in spontaneous knee osteoarthritis (OA) in guinea pigs. Fifty 2-month-old female Hartley guinea pigs were divided into a normal group (10 animals, all euthanized after 7 months) and an OA group (40 animals, 10 of which were euthanized after 10 months). Immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to evaluate autophagy levels, intracellular glycogen accumulation and apoptosis in tibial plateau chondrocytes in vivo and in vitro. The remaining 30 guinea pigs in the OA group were divided into 3 groups: a rapamycin group, a normal saline group, and a 3-methyladenine (3-MA) group. Intracellular glycogen accumulation and chondrocyte apoptosis were assessed by altering the level of autophagy in chondrocytes in vivo. When spontaneous OA occurred in guinea pigs, autophagy levels in tibial plateau chondrocytes decreased, while intracellular glycogen accumulation and the rate of chondrocyte apoptosis increased. After enhancing the level of autophagy in tibial plateau chondrocytes in guinea pigs with OA, intracellular glycogen accumulation and the rate of chondrocyte apoptosis decreased, while inhibiting autophagy had the opposite effects. The results indicate that the function of autophagy in chondrocytes may at least partly involve the catabolism of glycogen. In guinea pigs with OA, the level of autophagy in tibial plateau chondrocytes decreased, and chondrocytes were unable to degrade intracellular glycogen into glucose, leading to less energy for chondrocytes and increased apoptosis. ","74":"The underlying mechanisms and molecular factors influencing intervertebral disc (IVD) homeostasis and degeneration remain clinically relevant. Tenomodulin (Tnmd) and chondromodulin (Chm1) are antiangiogenic transmembrane glycoproteins, with cleavable C-terminus, expressed by IVD cells that are implicated in the onset of degenerative processes. We evaluate the organ-level biomechanical impact of knocking out Tnmd alone, and Tnmd and Chm1, simultaneously. Caudal (c5-8) and lumbar vertebrae (L1-4) of skeletally mature male and female 9-month-old wildtype (WT), Tnmd knockout (Tnmd-\/-), and Tnmd\/Chm1 double knockout (Tnmd-\/-\/Chm-\/-) mice were used (n = 9-13 per group). Disc height index (DHI), histomorphological changes, and axial, torsional, creep, and failure biomechanical properties were evaluated. Differences were assessed by one-way ANOVA with post hoc Bonferroni-corrected comparisons (P &lt; 0.05). Tnmd-\/-\/Chm1-\/- IVDs displayed increased DHI and histomorphological scores that indicated increased IVD degeneration compared to the WT and Tnmd-\/- groups. Double knockout IVDs required significantly less torque and energy to initiate torsional failure. Creep parameters were comparable between all groups, except for the slow time constant, which indicated faster outward fluid flow. Tnmd-\/- IVDs lost fluid faster than the WT group, and this effect was amplified in the double knockout IVDs. Knocking out Tnmd and Chm1 affects IVD fluid flow and organ-level biomechanical function and therefore may play a role in contributing to IVD degeneration. Larger effects of the Tnmd and Chm1 double knockout mice compared to the Tnmd single mutant suggest that Chm1 may play a compensatory role in the Tnmd single mutant IVDs.

Full-thickness OCD was bilaterally created in the knee joints of rats. Animals were randomly divided into 2 groups based on the anatomical site used for micrograft collection: articular (TO) and xiphoid (XA). Micrograft was injected into the knee via an intra-articular approach. The contralateral joint served as the control. Euthanasia was performed 2 months after the set-up of OCD. Histological evaluations foresaw hematoxylin\/eosin and safranin-O\/fast green staining, the modified O'Driscoll score, and collagen 1A1 and 2A1 immunostaining. Kruskal-Wallis and the post hoc Dunn test were performed to evaluate differences among groups. Histological results showed defect filling in both autologous micrografts. The TO group displayed tissue repair with more hyaline-like characteristics than its control (P &lt; 0.01). A fibrocartilaginous aspect was instead noticed in the XA group. Immunohistochemical assessments on type 2A1 and type 1 collagens confirmed the best histological results in the TO group. TO and XA groups contributed to a different extent to fill the OCD lesions.

To tackle this problem, we used the cellular reprogramming technique to epigenetically alter human MSCs derived from the synovial fluid of joints with osteoarthritis (OA) to explore the potential of reprogrammed MSCs for repairing articular cartilage. MSCs isolated from the synovial fluid of three patients' OA knees (Pa-MSCs) were reprogrammed through overexpression of pluripotency factors and then induced for differentiation to establish reprogrammed MSC (Re-MSC) lines. We compared the in vitro growth characteristics, chondrogenesis for articular cartilage chondrocytes, and immunomodulatory capacity. We also evaluated the capability of Re-MSCs to repair articular cartilage damage in an animal model with spontaneous OA. Our results showed that Re-MSCs increased the in vitro proliferative capacity and improved chondrogenic differentiation toward articular cartilage-like chondrocyte phenotypes with increased THBS4 and SIX1 and decreased ALPL and COL10A1, compared to Pa-MSCs. In addition, Re-MSC-derived chondrocytes expressing elevated COL2A and COL2B were more mature than parental cell-derived ones. The enhancement in chondrogenesis of Re-MSC involves the upregulation of sonic hedgehog signaling. Moreover, Re-MSCs improved the repair of articular cartilage in an animal model of spontaneous OA. Epigenetic reprogramming promotes MSCs harvested from OA patients to increase phenotypic characteristics and gain robust functions. In addition, Re-MSCs acquire an enhanced potential for articular cartilage repair. Our study here demonstrates that the reprogramming strategy provides a potential solution to the challenge of variation in MSC quality.

This growing interest has been associated with an equally significant spread of websites dedicated to public information on this topic, often lacking scientific bases. This study aims to evaluate the quality of information on the World Wide Web about stem cells for cartilage disorders in orthopedic practice. On February 19, 2021 we performed a search on Google using as keywords \"cartilage stem cells,\" considering only the freely accessible sites in Italian, English, French, and Spanish. We selected the first 50 valid results for each language and evaluated them using the DISCERN scale. A total of 249 sites were observed, of which 49 were discarded as duplicates (8) or not relevant to the topic (41). Of the 200 sites surveyed, 47 were affiliated to a singular surgeon (23.5%), 31 to private stakeholders (15.5%), 73 to information sites (36.5%), 8 to public hospitals (4%), 13 to universities (6.5%), and 28 referred to international scientific journals (14%). Only 76 sites (38%) were rated as fair or better, while the remaining 124 (62%) were classified as poor or very poor. The quality of the information promoted for stem cells in orthopedics is generally low, although a significant minority of the sites offers good quality information.

This study focused on evaluating the effects of polycaprolactone\/silk fibroin\/gelatin\/ascorbic acid (PCL\/SF\/Gel\/AA) composite scaffolds seeded with adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs), in the meniscus repair. To this end, composite scaffolds were cross-linked using N-hydroxysuccinimide and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl-aminopropyl)-1-carbodiimide hydrochloride. Scaffolds were then characterized by scanning electron microscope, mechanical tests, total antioxidant capacity, swelling, and toxicity tests. The PCL\/SF\/Gel\/AA scaffolds exhibited suitable mechanical properties. Furthermore, vitamin C rendered them the highest antioxidant capacity. The PCL\/SF\/Gel\/AA scaffolds also showed good biocompatibility and proliferation for chondrocytes. Moreover, the PCL\/SF\/Gel\/AA scaffold seeded with allogeneic ASCs was engrafted in New Zealand rabbits who underwent unilateral punch defect in the medial meniscus of the right knee. After 2 months postimplantation, macroscopic and histologic studies for new meniscus cartilage were performed.

","82":"A pivotal aspect of cartilage tissue engineering resides in cell culture medium supplementation, in view of maximizing in vitro cell proliferation and preserving cellular functionality. Autologous human serum (aHS) is commonly used as an inducive supplement for safe human articular chondrocyte (HAC) proliferation prior to clinical implantation. However, practical clinical use of aHS is hindered by constraining manufacturing requirements and quality assurance-driven downstream processing. The present study investigated potential alternative use of commercial human platelet lysate (hPL) supplements in HAC manufacturing workflows related to clinical therapeutic pathways. Differential effects of hPL, aHS, and fetal bovine serum were assessed on primary cultured HAC parameters (viability, proliferative rates, and morphology) in 2-dimensional in vitro systems. A 3-dimensional HAC pellet model served for postexpansion assessment of cellular functionality, by visualizing proteoglycan production (Alcian blue staining), and by using qRT-PCR relative quantification of chondrogenic marker (SOX9, COL2-A1, and ACAN) genetic expression. We found that monolayer HAC culture with hPL or aHS supplements presented similar characteristics (elongated cell morphology and nearly identical growth kinetics). Chondrogenic activity appeared as conserved in HACs expanded with human or bovine supplements, wherein histologic analysis indicated a progressive sGAG accumulation and SOX9, COL2-A1, ACAN gene expression was upregulated in 3-dimensional HAC pellet models. This study therefore supports the use of hPL as a functional equivalent and alternative to aHS for cultured HAC batch preparation, with the potential to effectively alleviate pressure on clinical and manufacturing bottlenecks in cell therapy approaches for cartilage regeneration.

Seventy-nine patients, after either microfracture (MFX) or matrix-associated chondrocyte transplantation (MACT), were examined on a 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner with morphological and quantitative (T2 mapping) MR sequences 2 years after surgery. Twenty-one texture features from a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) were extracted. The texture feature difference between 2 repair types was assessed individually for the femoral condyle and trochlea\/anterior condyle using linear regression models. The stability and reproducibility of texture features for focal cartilage were calculated using intra-observer variability and area under curve from receiver operating characteristics. There was no statistical significance found between MFX and MACT for T2 values (P = 0.96). There was, however, found a statistical significance between MFX and MACT in femoral condyle in GLCM features autocorrelation (P &lt; 0.001), sum of squares (P = 0.023), sum average (P = 0.005), sum variance (P = 0.0048), and sum entropy (P = 0.05); and in anterior condyle\/trochlea homogeneity (P = 0.02) and dissimilarity (P &lt; 0.001). Texture analysis using GLCM provides a useful extension to T2 mapping for the characterization of cartilage repair tissue by increasing its sensitivity to tissue structure. Some texture features were able to distinguish between repair tissue after different cartilage repair procedures, as repair tissue texture (and hence, probably collagen organization) 24 months after MACT more closely resembled healthy cartilage than did MFX repair tissue.

Biological cartilage repair procedures are used for patients younger than 40 years, and knee arthroplasties are generally reserved for patients older than 60 years. Resurfacing implants are well suited for patients in this treatment gap. The objective was to investigate the 10-year survival of resurfacing implants in the Danish Knee Arthroplasty Registry. In this retrospective cohort study, patients treated with resurfacing implants were followed longitudinally in the Danish Knee Arthroplasty Registry from 1997 to 2020. The primary endpoint was revision surgery. The survival of the resurfacing implants was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 379 resurfacing implant procedures were retrieved from the Danish Knee Arthroplasty Registry. The mean age and weight of patients were 50 years (SD = 11) and 84 kg (SD = 17), respectively. The indications for surgery were as follows: secondary osteoarthritis (42%), primary osteoarthritis (32%), and osteochondral lesions (20%). Within the follow-up period, 70 (19%) of the implants were revised to arthroplasties. The 1-, 5-, and 10-year revision-free survival estimation was 0.95 (95% CI 0.93-0.97), 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.88), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75-0.84), respectively. The median time to revision was 2 years. The 10-year revision-free survival rate for resurfacing implants was 80%. Based on the revision rates, this treatment offers a viable alternative to biological cartilage repair methods in patients aged 40 to 60 years with focal cartilage pathology. Improved patient selection could further improve the implant survival rate. Further studies are needed to investigate this treatment method.

The Japanese Knee Osteoarthritis Measure (JKOM) was evaluated as clinical outcomes. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was used to evaluate systemic inflammation. We divided the participants into normal, medial-, lateral-, and medial &amp; lateral-OA types and compared their JKOM using an analysis of covariance. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between the knee pain and stiffness of JKOM and the grading of each radiographic feature using a multiple regression model. Lateral- and medial &amp; lateral-OA groups had a significantly worse symptoms in the total and the pain score, especially in movement subscales, in JKOM score. Lateral-OA groups had higher hsCRP than medial-OA group. Multivariate analysis showed that medial joint space narrowing (JSN), and lateral femoral and tibial osteophytes significantly affected knee pain (adjusted odds ratios: 1.73, 1.28, and 1.55, respectively). The radiographic changes are associated with pain more in JSN in the medial side and osteophytes in the lateral side. Lateral- and medial &amp; lateral-OA groups showed worth symptom.

","90":"Shockwave application is a potential treatment for osteoarthritis (OA), but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Oxidative stress and a counterbalancing antioxidant system might be the key to understanding this mechanism. We hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2),which is an important regulator of cellular redox homeostasis, are plausible elements. Porcine chondrocytes were cultured in a 3-dimensional pellet model and subjected to shockwaves. The effects of shockwaves with various energy-flux densities on optimal extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis were assessed. ROS, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, and the redox activity of Nrf2 were measured. To investigate the signaling mechanism involved in the shockwave treatment in chondrocytes, specific inhibitors of ROS, MAPK signaling, and Nrf2 activity were targeted. Shockwaves increased ECM synthesis without affecting cell viability or proliferation. Furthermore, they induced transient ROS production mainly through xanthine oxidase. The phosphorylation of ERK1\/2 and p38 and the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 were activated by shockwaves. By contrast, suppression of ROS signaling mitigated shockwave-induced MAPK phosphorylation, Nrf2 nuclear translocation, and ECM synthesis. Pretreatment of chondrocytes with the specific inhibitors of MEK1\/2 and p38, respectively, mitigated the shockwave-induced nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and ECM synthesis. Nrf2 inhibition by both small hairpin RNA knockdown and brusatol reduced the shockwave-enhanced ECM synthesis. Shockwaves activated Nrf2 activity through the induction of transient ROS signaling and subsequently enhanced ECM synthesis in chondrocytes. This study provided fundamental evidence confirming the potential of shockwaves for OA management.

In this study, the DMOAD activity of rat IL4-10 FP (rIL4-10 FP) was tested in a rat model of surgically induced OA under metabolic dysregulation. rIL4-10 FP was produced with HEK293F cells. Bioactivity of purified rIL4-10 FP was determined in a whole blood assay. Male Wistar rats (n = 20) were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) to induce metabolic dysregulation. After 12 weeks, OA was induced according to the Groove model. Two weeks after OA induction, rats were randomly divided into 2 groups and treated with 10 weekly, intra-articular injections of either rIL4-10 FP (n = 10) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS; n = 10). Possible antibody formation was evaluated using ELISA, cartilage degeneration and synovial inflammation were evaluated by histology and mechanical allodynia was evaluated using the von Frey test. Intra-articular injections with rIL4-10 FP significantly reduced cartilage degeneration (P = 0.042) and decreased mechanical allodynia (P &lt; 0.001) compared with PBS. Only mild synovial inflammation was found (nonsignificant), limiting detection of putative anti-inflammatory effects. Multiple injections of rIL4-10 FP did not induce antibodies against rIL4-10 FP. rIL4-10 FP showed chondroprotective and analgesic activity in a rat OA model with moderate cartilage damage, mild synovial inflammation, and pain.

Using rat ACL transection (ACLT) and ACLR models, we aimed to reveal (1) the formation process of meniscal tears secondary to ACLT and (2) the protective effects of ACLR on secondary meniscal tears. ACLT surgery alone or with ACLR was performed on the knees of rats. Histomorphological and histopathological changes were examined in the posteromedial region of the meniscus in intact rats and in rats that received ACLT or ACLR up to 12 weeks postsurgery. In addition, anterior-posterior joint laxity was measured using the universal testing machine to evaluate the effects of ACLT and ACLR on joint laxity. AAnterior-posterior laxity was significantly increased by ACLT compared to the intact knee. This ACLT-induced joint laxity was partially but significantly reduced by ACLR. Meniscal proliferation and hyaline cartilage-like tissue formation were detected in the medial meniscus at 4 weeks post-ACLT. At 12 weeks post-ACLT, hyaline cartilage-like tissue was replaced by ossicles and meniscal tears were observed. These ACLT-induced abnormalities were attenuated by ACLR. Our results suggest that ACLT-induced joint laxity induces secondary medial meniscal tears through meniscal proliferation and ossicle formation via endochondral ossification.

Nineteen RCTs containing 60 dichotomous outcomes were included for analysis. The FI and FQ of all outcomes was 4 (IQR 2-7) and 0.067 (IQR 0.034-0.096), respectively. The average number of patients lost to follow-up (LTF) was 3.9 patients with 15.8% of the included studies reporting LTF greater than or equal to 4, the FI of all included outcomes. The orthopedic literature evaluating articular cartilage defects of the knee is fragile as the reversal of relatively few outcome events may alter the significance of statistical findings. We therefore recommend comprehensive fragility analysis and triple reporting of the P value, FI, and FQ to aid in the interpretation and contextualization of clinical findings reported in the cartilage restoration literature.

Retrospective cohort study, level III. Patients who underwent knee ACI (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] 27412) or OCA (CPT 27415) with minimum 2-year follow-up were queried from a national insurance database. Resulting cohorts of patients that underwent ACI and OCA were then divided into patients who underwent isolated cartilage restoration procedure and patients who underwent concomitant osteotomy (CPT 27457, 27450, 27418). Reoperation was defined by ipsilateral knee procedure after the index surgery. The 30-day postoperative complication rates were assessed using ICD-9-CM codes. The cost per patient was calculated. A total of 1,113 patients (402 ACI, 67 ACI + osteotomy, 552 OCA, 92 OCA + osteotomy) were included (mean follow-up of 39.0 months). Reoperation rate was significantly higher after isolated ACI or OCA compared to ACI or OCA plus concomitant osteotomy (ACI 68.7% vs. ACI + osteotomy 23.9%; OCA 34.8% vs. OCA + osteotomy 16.3%). Overall complication rates were similar between isolated ACI (3.0%) and ACI + osteotomy (4.5%) groups and OCA (2.5%) and OCA + osteotomy (3.3%) groups. Payments were significantly higher in the osteotomy groups at day of surgery and 9 months compared to isolated ACI or OCA, but costs were similar by 2 years postoperatively. Concomitant osteotomy at the time of index ACI or OCA procedure significantly reduces the risk of reoperation with a similar rate of complications and similar overall costs compared with isolated ACI or OCA.

It has been previously reported that microRNAs may participate in the occurrence and development of intervertebral disc degeneration through regulating its target genes directly. The regulatory roles of miR-142-3p\/HMGB1 in some orthopedic diseases have been determined successively, but there was no report about the degeneration of CEP. Therefore, we aimed to determine the regulation of miR-142-3p\/HMGB1 or potential molecular mechanisms on proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and autophagy of CEP cells. The target gene of miR-142-3p was determined by double luciferase assay. We selected ATDC5 cell lines. CCK-8 method was used to detect cell proliferation. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine gene expression levels, and western blot analysis was used to determine protein expression levels. We chose flow cytometry to measure cell apoptosis and cell cycle. The result of luciferase detection showed that the target gene of miR-142-3p in CEP cells was HMGB1. Knockdown of the miR-142-3p inhibited the expression level of HMGB1, the proliferation and migration of CEP cells, but it promoted apoptosis of CEP cells. In addition, the detection results of the proteins related to apoptosis or autophagy showed that knockdown of miR-142-3p promoted apoptosis and autophagy. The negative regulation of miR-142-3p\/HMGB1 can affect the proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and autophagy of CEP cells. Our results provide a new idea for the targeted treatment of CEP degeneration by inhibiting the expression of HMGB1.

The nature of the tissue involved and the changes therein do not allow self-healing; and most of these problems are progressive. Tissue engineering offers some solutions provided we focus on the right kind of cells and the appropriate surrounding niches created for a particular tissue. The present study deals with the formation of polysaccharide rich stable scaffold of collagen after cross-linking with oxidized gum arabic. The scaffold was tested for its biocompatibility and ability to support cells. The in vitro cytotoxicity of the scaffolds toward induced pluripotent stem cells and chondrocytes was evaluated. Evaluation of expression of lineage specific markers indicates differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells to chondrogenic lineage and maintenance of chondrocytes per se when grown in the scaffold. Animal studies were carried out to study the efficacy of the scaffold to repair the knee injuries. Cells along with the scaffold appeared to be the best filling, in repair of injured cartilage. These studies show that these scaffolds are potential candidates in applications such as tissue engineering of cartilage.","119":"To assess the clinical and radiological results of patellofemoral osteochondral lesions treated with microfractures associated with a chitosan scaffold. A retrospective observational analytical study was performed. Fifteen patients with full-thickness patellofemoral osteochondral lesions were included.

Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was applied as well as Wilcoxon's signed rank test and Kruskal-Wallis H test for clinical scores within subjects and patella versus trochlea subgroups comparisons. Analysis of variance test was used for imaging subgroups comparison, with P &lt; 0.05 defined as statistical significance. Mean follow-up was 33.36 months (range 24-60 months). Postoperative Kujala scores improved an average of 19 points compared with the preoperative state (SE = 17.6; P &lt; 0.001). No statistical difference was found through the clinical location assessment (P = 0.756), as well as the cartilage imaging assessment (P = 0.756). The mean MOCART 2.0 scale was 67.67 (range 50-85).

The aim of this study was to identify factors influencing the functional outcome after opening wedge valgus HTO. A total of 175 cases (155 patients) of varus-correcting high tibial open-wedge osteotomies using the Tomofix plate were reviewed retrospectively. Patients answered the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) questionnaire and 4 survey follow-up questions. A total of 76 of the 155 patients studied (84 of the 175 knees) completed the KOOS questionnaire, on average 3.1 years (SD 1.8 years) after the surgery. The median scores (with median absolute deviations [MAD]) for the KOOS pain, symptoms, daily activities, sports, and quality of life sections were, respectively, 76.4 (MAD 12.5), 75.0 (MAD 14.3), 85.3 (MAD 11.8), 50.0 (MAD 25.0), and 59.4 (MAD 21.9). No cases of nonunion were observed throughout the length of the study. Identified predictors of worse outcomes were higher weight and body mass index, limited knee flexion, genu varum and tibial varus of small magnitude, active smoking status at the time of surgery, further surgery for plate removal, and some grades of chondropathy in the patellofemoral, medial tibial, and femoral compartments. Patient gender, joint obliquity and over- or undercorrection were not associated with any of the outcomes.

Total triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels were analyzed in serum and SF of OA patients, and in serum of healthy individuals. The Noyes rating criteria, Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, and Western Ontario McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores were, respectively, used to assess cartilage damage, radiographic severity, and symptomatic severity of OA. No significant differences were found in serum TG and ApoB levels between the 2 groups, while OA patients had higher TC and LDL-C levels and lower HDL-C and ApoA1 levels (P &lt; 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis revealed SF HDL-C and ApoA1 levels were negatively correlated with cartilage damage scores, KL grades as well as WOMAC scores (P &lt; 0.05), which were still significant after adjusting for confounding factors (P &lt; 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed SF HDL-C (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.816) and ApoA1 (AUC: 0.793) were also good predictors of advanced-stage OA (P &lt; 0.001). SF HDL-C and ApoA1 levels were negatively correlated with cartilage damage, radiographic severity, and symptomatic severity of primary knee OA, emerging as potential biomarkers for radiographic advanced-stage OA, which may serve as predictors of disease severity.

Our aim is to treat patients with focal lesions of articular cartilage with autologous hyaline cartilage implants using a scaffold-free approach. In this article, we describe experiments to optimize production of scaffold-free cartilage discs. Articular chondrocytes were expanded in vitro, seeded in transwell inserts and redifferentiated using established chondrogenic components. Experimental variables included testing 2 different expansion media, adding bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), growth\/differentiation factor 5 (GDF5), or fibroblast growth factor 18 (FGF18) to the differentiation medium and allowing the disc to float freely in large wells. Cartilage discs were analyzed by weight and thickness, real-time RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase qualitative polymerase chain reaction), fluorescence immunostaining, transmission electron microscopy, second harmonic generation imaging, and measurement of Young's modulus. Addition of BMP2 to the chondrogenic differentiation medium (CDM) was essential for stable disc formation, while IGF1, GDF5, and FGF18 were redundant. Allowing discs to float freely in CDM on a moving platform increased disc thickness compared with discs kept continuously in transwell inserts. Discs cultured for 6 weeks reached a thickness of almost 2 mm and Young's modulus of &gt;200 kPa. There was abundant type II collagen. Collagen fibrils were 25 nm thick, with a tendency to be organized perpendicular to the disc surface. Scaffold-free engineering using BMP2 and providing free movement in CDM produced firm, elastic cartilage discs with abundant type II collagen.

The study and sample characteristics, LT intervention parameters and posttreatment outcomes were analyzed. Risk of bias was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS) tool. Three in vitro and 30 in vivo studies were included. Most studies were judged as high risk of performance and detection bias. Biochemical outcomes were analyzed for both in vitro and in vivo studies, and histological and behavioral outcomes were analyzed for in vivo studies. LT reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, inflammation, and OA progression, promoting ECM synthesis. LT improved pain-like behavior in animal models, having no apparent effect on gait performance. There were conflicting findings of some of the biochemical, histological, and behavioral outcomes.

R software was utilized to screen and confirm the candidate differentially expressed genes in the development of OA. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway were performed to identify the enriched GO terms and signaling pathways. Protein and protein interaction (PPI) models were built to observe the connected relationship among each potential protein. A total of 113 upregulated genes and 161 downregulated genes were found by integrating 3 datasets. GO enrichment indicated that cell differentiation, cellular response to starvation, and negative regulation of phosphorylation were important biological processes. KEGG enrichment indicated that FoxO, IL-17 signaling pathways, and osteoclast differentiation mainly participated in the progression of OA.

To achieve this, we first aimed to determine protocols for consistent calculation of GAG content between cartilage types. Auricular cartilage containing both collagen and elastin was used to determine the effect of lyophilization on GAG depletion activity. Bovine articular, auricular, meniscal, and nasal cartilage plugs were treated using different reagents to selectively remove GAGs. Sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) remaining in the sample after treatment were measured, and sGAG loss was compared between cartilage types. The results indicate that dry weight of cartilage should be measured prior to cartilage treatment in order to provide a more accurate reference for normalization. Articular, meniscal, and nasal cartilage lost significant amounts of sGAG for all reagents used. However, only hyaluronidase was able to remove significant amount of sGAG from auricular cartilage. Furthermore, hyaluronidase was able to remove over 99% of sGAG from all cartilage types except auricular cartilage where it only removed around 76% of sGAG. The results indicate GAG-specific ECM binding for different cartilage types and locations. In conclusion, lyophilization can be performed to determine native dry weight for normalization without affecting the degree of GAG treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare GAG-ECM interactions of different cartilage types using different GAG extraction methods. Degree of GAG depletion not only varied with cartilage type but also the same type from different anatomic locations.

There is a high level of evidence to support the treatment of small to medium size lesions (&lt;2-4 cm2) without subchondral bone involvement with traditional techniques such as marrow stimulation, osteochondral autograft transplant (OAT), or osteochondral allograft transplant (OCA). Newer techniques such as autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis and bone marrow aspirate concentrate implantation have also been shown to be effective in select studies. If subchondral bone loss is present OAT or OCA should be performed. For large lesions (&gt;4 cm2), OCA or matrix autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) may be performed. OCA is preferred over MACI in the setting of subchondral bone involvement while cell-based modalities such as MACI or particulated juvenile allograft cartilage are preferred in the patellofemoral joint.

Arthroscopic surgeries can be used to treat joint injuries, but arthroscopic evaluation of articular cartilage quality is subjective. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy combined with fiber optics and attenuated total reflectance crystal could be used for the assessment of tissue quality during arthroscopy. We hypothesize that fiber-optic mid-infrared spectroscopy can detect enzymatically and mechanically induced damage similar to changes occurring during progression of osteoarthritis. Bovine patellar cartilage plugs were extracted and degraded enzymatically and mechanically. Adjacent untreated samples were utilized as controls. Enzymatic degradation was done using collagenase and trypsin enzymes. Mechanical damage was induced by (1) dropping a weight impactor on the cartilage plugs and (2) abrading the cartilage surface with a rotating sandpaper. Fiber-optic mid-infrared spectroscopic measurements were conducted before and after treatments, and spectral changes were assessed with random forest, partial least squares discriminant analysis, and support vector machine classifiers. All models had excellent classification performance for detecting the different enzymatic and mechanical damage on cartilage matrix. Random forest models achieved accuracies between 90.3% and 77.8%, while partial least squares model accuracies ranged from 95.8% to 84.7%, and support vector machine accuracies from 91.7% to 80.6%.

MaK and SIRT5 were immunostained in knee articular cartilage of obese db\/db mice and different aged C57BL6 mice with or without destabilization of the medial meniscus surgery to induce OA. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from 7-day-old WT and Sirt5-\/- mice and treated with varying concentrations of glucose and insulin to mimic obesity. Sirt5-dependent effects on MaK and metabolism were evaluated by western blot, Seahorse Respirometry, and gas\/chromatography-mass\/spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolic profiling. MaK was significantly increased in cartilage of db\/db mice and in chondrocytes treated with high concentrations of glucose and insulin (GluhiInshi). Sirt5 was increased in an age-dependent manner following joint injury, and Sirt5 deficient primary chondrocytes had increased MaK, decreased glycolysis rate, and reduced basal mitochondrial respiration. GC-MS identified 41 metabolites. Sirt5 deficiency altered 13 distinct metabolites under basal conditions and 18 metabolites under GluhiInshi treatment. Pathway analysis identified a wide range of Sirt5-dependent altered metabolic pathways that include amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and glycolysis. This study provides the first evidence that Sirt5 broadly regulates chondrocyte metabolism.

Using a hand lens, Sir William Hunter demonstrated that the collagen fibers ran perpendicular and later aspects were supported by Benninghoff. Despite these 2 historical studies, modern technology has conflicting data on the collagen alignment. Ten mature New Zealand rabbits were used to obtain 40 condyle specimens. The specimens were passed through ascending grades of alcohol, subjected to critical point drying (CPD), and viewed in the scanning electron microscope. Specimens revealed splits from the dehydration process. When observing the fibers exposed within the opening of the splits, parallel fibers were observed to run in a radial direction, normal to the surface of the articular cartilage, radiating from the deep zone and arcading as they approach the surface layer. After these observations, the same samples were mechanically fractured and damaged by scalpel. The splits in the articular surface created deep fissures, exposing parallel bundles of collagen fibers, radiating from the deep zone and arcading as they approach the surface layer. On higher magnification, individual fibers were observed to run parallel to one another, traversing radially toward the surface of the articular cartilage and arcading. Mechanical fracturing and scalpel damage induced on the same specimens with the splits showed randomly oriented fibers. Collagen fiber orientation corroborates aspects of Hunter's findings and compliments Benninghoff.

HA-TG in a collagen scaffold supported infiltration and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal cells, which migrated from the subchondral bone through the calcified cartilage layer. Additionally, HA-TG and collagen treatment led to better adjacent cartilage preservation compared with empty defects (P &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that the adhesive HA-TG hydrogel in a collagen scaffold shows good biocompatibility, supports in situ cartilage regeneration and preserves the surrounding cartilage.

We directly compared the results of T2-mapping MRI of cartilage repair tissue with the histology of a biopsy specimen from the corresponding area at 48 weeks postoperatively in 5 patients who underwent the implantation of a scaffold-free tissue-engineered construct generated from autologous synovial mesenchymal stem cells to repair an isolated cartilage lesion. T2 values and histological scores were compared at each of 2 layers of equally divided halves of the repair tissue (upper and lower zones). Histology showed that the repair tissue in the upper zone was dominated by fibrous tissue and the ratio of hyaline-like matrix increased with the depth of the repair tissue. There were significant differences between upper and lower zones in histological scores. Conversely, there were no detectable statistically significant differences in T2 value detected among zones of the repair tissue, but zonal differences were detected in corresponding healthy cartilage. Accordingly, there were no correlations detected between histological scores and T2 values for each repair cartilage zone. Discrepancies in the findings between T2 mapping and histology suggest that T2 mapping was limited in ability to detect details in the architecture and composition of the repair cartilage. ","152":"Advanced glycation end-product (AGE) accumulation is implicated in osteoarthritis (OA) pathogenesis in aging and diabetic populations. Here, we develop a representative nonenzymatic glycation-induced OA cartilage explant culture model and investigate the effectiveness of resveratrol, curcumin, and eugenol in inhibiting AGEs and the structural and biological hallmarks of cartilage degeneration. Bovine cartilage explants were treated with AGE-bovine serum albumin, threose, and ribose to determine the optimal conditions that induce physiological levels of AGEs while maintaining chondrocyte viability. AGE crosslinks, tissue stiffness, cell viability, metabolism and senescence, nitrite release and loss of glycosaminoglycans were assessed. Explants were cotreated with resveratrol, curcumin, or eugenol to evaluate their anti-AGE properties. Blind docking analysis was conducted to estimate binding energies of drugs with collagen II. Treatment with 100 mM ribose significantly increased AGE crosslink formation and tissue stiffness, resulting in reduced chondrocyte metabolism and enhanced senescence. Blind docking analysis revealed stronger binding energies of both resveratrol and curcumin than ribose, with glycation sites along a human collagen II fragment, indicating their increased likelihood of competitively inhibiting ribose activity. Resveratrol and curcumin, but not eugenol, successfully inhibited AGE crosslink formation and its associated downstream biological response. We establish a cartilage explant model of OA that recapitulates several aspects of aged human cartilage. We find that resveratrol and curcumin are effective anti-AGE therapeutics with the potential to decelerate age-related and diabetes-induced OA. This in vitro nonenzymatic glycation-induced model provides a tool for screening OA drugs, to simultaneously evaluate AGE-induced biological and mechanical changes.

Histological changes in the articular cartilage of the tibia were evaluated by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores and histomorphometrical analyses at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after OA induction. We confirmed that disuse atrophy of the articular cartilage was caused by thinning of the articular cartilage and the decrease in matrix staining for the nonloading period of 4 weeks. The OARSI scores and histomorphological analyses revealed that OA progressed significantly wider and deeper in the HS-OA group than in the OA group over time. In the sham group, disuse atrophy of the articular cartilage recovered at 2 weeks after reloading.

Products were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) analysis and searched against a UniProt Homo sapiens database. Relative protein abundance was determined for each sample. Based on proteomics results, lumican was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis was performed for interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2).

Three-week-old BMP2 flox\/flox-CreER-positive mice and their Cre-negative littermates were treated with tamoxifen and raised until 3 or 6 months. We also investigated the direct effects of BMP2 on chondrocytes in vitro. Cells from the mandibular condyle of mice were treated with recombinant human BMP2 (rhBMP2) or rhNoggin (inhibitor of BMP2 signaling). Conditional deletion of BMP2 caused breakage of the cartilage integrity in the mandibular condyle of mice from both age groups, accompanied by a decrease in cartilage thickness, matrix synthesis, mineralization, chondrocyte proliferation, and increased expression of degeneration markers, while the effects at articular cartilage were not significant. In vitro results revealed that rhBMP2 increased chondrocyte proliferation, mineralization, and differentiation, while noggin induced opposite effects.

Female C57BL\/6 mice were divided into control and model (excessive GC treatment) groups. The structure of the femoral heads was evaluated by using micro-computed tomography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and safranin staining analyses. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect angiogenesis and cartilage metabolism. Western blotting and TUNEL staining were used to examine epiphyseal cartilage chondrocyte apoptosis. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from the femoral heads of healthy mice for in vitro studies. The effects of GCs on chondrocyte apoptosis and metabolism were determined by flow cytometry and Western blotting.

Vascular invasion into the epiphyseal cartilage of the model mice was observed at 4 weeks posttreatment. GCs induced chondrocyte apoptosis and altered chondrocyte metabolism in the epiphyseal cartilage. The epiphyseal cartilage ossification accelerated in the femoral heads of female C57BL\/6 mice after excessive GC treatment.

International Society for Extracellular Vesicles and the European Network on Microvesicles and Exosomes in Health and Disease have formed guidelines to foster the use of the growing therapeutic potential of exosomal therapy in osteoarthritis. Although regenerative therapies with MSC are being seen to hold a future in the management of osteoarthritis, extracellular vesicle-based technology holds the key to unlock the potential toward knee preservation and regeneration. The intricate composition and uncertain functioning of exosomes are inquisitive facets warranting further exploration.","196":"Employ an automated indentation technique, using a commercially available machine, to assess the effect of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression on structural stiffness over the surface of both murine femoral articular cartilage (AC) and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) mandibular condylar cartilage (MCC). Experiments were performed using 3-month-old female homozygote Fgf2KO mice with wild type (WT) littermates. After euthanization, isolated mandibles and hindlimbs were either processed for histology or subjected to automated indentation on a Biomomentum Mach-1 v500csst with a 3-axis motion controller in a phosphate buffered saline bath using a 0.3 mm spherical tip indenter. The effect of indentation depth on normal force was characterized, then structural stiffness was calculated and mapped at multiple positions on the AC and MCC. Automated indentation of the AC and TMJ MCC was successfully completed and was able to demonstrate both regional variation in structural stiffness and differences between WT and Fgf2KO mice. Structural stiffness values for Fgf2KO AC were significantly smaller than WT at both the medial\/anterior (P &lt; 0.05) and medial\/posterior (P &lt; 0.05) positions. Global Fgf2KO also lead to a decrease in MCC thickness of the TMJ compared with WT (P &lt; 0.05) and increased structural stiffness values for Fgf2KO at both the posterior and anterior location (P &lt; 0.05). Automated indentation spatially resolved differences in structural stiffness between WT and Fgf2KO tissue, demonstrating FGF2 expression affects femoral AC and TMJ MCC. This quantitative method will provide a valuable approach for functional characterization of cartilage tissues in murine models relevant to knee joint and TMJ health and disease.

Thirteen patients with low-grade femoral cartilage defects were included in the study and were scanned twice on a 7-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner 8 days apart. A 3-dimensional double-echo steady-state (3D-DESS) sequence was used to acquire MR images for automated cartilage segmentation, and T2-mapping was performed using a 3D triple-echo steady-state (3D-TESS) sequence. Cartilage volume, thickness, and T2 and texture features were automatically extracted from each knee for each of the 21 subregions. DESS was used for manual cartilage segmentation and compared with automated segmentation using the Dice coefficient. The reproducibility of each variable was expressed using standard error of measurement (SEM) and smallest detectable change (SDC). The Dice coefficient for the similarity between manual and automated segmentation ranged from 0.83 to 0.88 in different cartilage regions. Test-retest analysis of automated cartilage segmentation and automated quantitative parameter extraction revealed excellent reproducibility for volume measurement (mean SDC for all subregions of 85.6 mm3), for thickness detection (SDC = 0.16 mm) and also for T2 values (SDC = 2.38 ms) and most gray-level co-occurrence matrix features (SDC = 0.1 a.u.). The proposed technique of automated knee cartilage evaluation based on the segmentation of 3D MR images and correlation with T2 mapping provides highly reproducible results and significantly reduces the segmentation effort required for the analysis of knee articular cartilage in longitudinal studies.

While systemic high-dosage corticosteroids are known to trigger osteonecrosis and result in osteochondral (OC) lesions, the effect of IACIs on joint cartilage and subchondral bone remains unclear. This study was conceived to analyze the coincidence of IACI and the subsequent manifestation of osteochondral lesions in a large cohort of pediatric JIA patients. Retrospective data assessment and comparative analysis of skeletally immature JIA patients treated with IACIs between 1993 and 2017. A total of 280 JIA patients were included in the analysis, the majority were girls (64%). Osteochondral lesions were present in 16 patients (5.7%) at a mean age of 10.7 years (range 4-14 years) and appeared on average after 63-month duration of disease. The majority was present at atypical locations such as the lateral femoral condyle. Multivariable analysis using cox regression showed that steroid injections were a risk factor to develop an OC lesion (hazard ratio [95%CI] for number of steroid injections per year, 8.20 [3.18, 21.16]). Pediatric patients with JIA show a relatively high incidence of osteochondritic lesions, which present at an early age and in rather atypical locations and repetitive steroid injection need to be considered an associated risk factor.

In this study, key functional properties were assessed for cartilage biopsies collected from the central part of traumatic joint lesions (central) and from regions surrounding the defect (peripheral). These properties were then correlated with the quality of the initial cartilage biopsy and the inflammatory state of the joint. Cartilage samples were collected from knee joints of 42 patients with traumatic knee injuries and analyzed for cell phenotype (by reverse transcriptas-polymerase chain reaction), histological quality, cellularity, cell viability, proliferation capacity, and post-expansion chondrogenic capacity of chondrocytes (in pellet culture). Synovium was also harvested and analyzed for the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Cartilage quality and post-expansion chondrogenic capacity were higher in peripheral versus central samples. Differences between these 2 parameters were more pronounced in joints with high inflammatory features characterized by &gt;100-fold difference in the mRNA levels of IL6 and IL8 in the corresponding synovium. Peripheral chondrocytes isolated from good- versus bad-quality biopsies expressed higher levels of collagen II\/I and aggrecan\/versican and lower levels of MMP13 and ADAMTS5. They also exhibited reduced proliferation and enhanced cartilage-forming capacity. Chondrocytes at the periphery of traumatic lesions better maintain properties of healthy cartilage compared to those isolated from the center, even when derived from bad-quality tissues harvested from highly inflamed joints. Future studies are necessary to investigate the change of functional properties of peripheral chondrocytes over time.

A literature search was carried out on PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases in January 2020. The following inclusion criteria were adopted: (1) studies of any level of evidence, dealing with subchondral injection of bone substitute materials and\/or biologic agents; (2) studies with minimum 5 patients treated; and (3) studies with at least 6 months' follow-up evaluation. All relevant data concerning clinical outcomes, adverse events, and rate of conversion to arthroplasty were extracted. A total of 12 studies were identified: 7 dealt with calcium phosphate administration, 3 with platelet-rich plasma, and 2 with bone marrow concentrate injection. Only 2 studies were randomized controlled trials, whereas 6 studies were prospective and the remaining 4 were retrospective. Studies included a total of 459 patients treated with intraosseous injections. Overall, only a few patients experienced adverse events and clinical improvement was documented in the majority of trial. The lack of any comparative evaluation versus subchondral drilling alone is the main limitation of the available evidence. Knee intraosseous injections are a minimally invasive and safe procedure to address subchondral bone damage in osteoarthritic patients. They are able to provide beneficial effects at short-term evaluation. More high-quality evidence is needed to confirm their potential and to identify the best product to adopt in clinical practice.

Further experiments examined the ability of the TAT-PTD to bind to human osteoarthritic cartilage. The results show that the TAT-PTD associates with chondrocytes, is capable of delivering siRNA for chondrocyte gene knockdown, and that the recombinant enzyme TAT-Cre is capable of inducing in vivo genetic recombination within the knee joint in a reporter mouse model. Last, binding studies show that osteoarthritic cartilage preferentially uptakes the TAT-PTD from solution. The results suggest that the TAT-PTD is a promising delivery strategy for intra-articular therapeutics.

In this study, we sought to determine the effects of prebiotic fiber supplementation, aerobic exercise, and the combination of the 2 interventions, on the progression of knee osteoarthritis in a high-fat\/high-sucrose diet-induced rat model of metabolic disturbance. Twelve-week-old male CD-Sprague-Dawley rats were either fed a standard chow diet, or a high-fat\/high-sucrose diet. After 12 weeks on diets, rats consuming the high-fat\/high-sucrose diet were randomized into 4 subgroups: a sedentary, an aerobic exercise, a prebiotic fiber supplementation, and an aerobic exercise combined with prebiotic fiber supplementation group. The aerobic exercise intervention consisted of a progressive treadmill training program for 12 weeks, while the prebiotic fiber was added to the high-fat\/high-sucrose diet at a dose of 10% by weight for 12 weeks. Outcome measures included knee joint damage, body mass, percent body fat, bone mineral density, insulin sensitivity, and serum lipid profile. Aerobic exercise, or the combination of prebiotic fiber and aerobic exercise, improved select markers of metabolic disturbance, but not knee joint damage. However, these results need to be considered in view of the fact that the chow-fed rats had similar knee OA-like damage as the high-fat\/high-sucrose-fed rats. Exercise or prebiotics did not increase joint damage and might be good strategies for populations with metabolic knee osteoarthritis to alleviate other health-related problems, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disorders.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the predictive association of the physical component (PCS) and mental component (MCS) scores of the Short Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire for achievement of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) after OCA transplantation. This retrospective study of a longitudinally maintained institutional registry included 91 patients who had undergone OCA transplantation for symptomatic focal osteochondral lesions of the femoral condyle. Included patients were those with complete preoperative questionnaires for the SF-36 and IKDC and completed postoperative IKDC at 2-year follow-up. Multivariate analysis was performed evaluating predictive association of the preoperative MCS and PCS with achievement of the MCID for the IKDC questionnaire. Logistic multivariate modeling demonstrated a statistically significant association between lower preoperative PCS and achievement of the MCID (P = 0.022). A defect diameter &gt;2 cm was also associated with achievement of MCID (P = 0.049). Preoperative MCS did not demonstrate a significant association (P = 0.09) with achievement of the MCID. For this cohort of 91 patients, the preoperative SF-36 PCS and lesion size were predictive of achievement of the MCID at 2-year follow-up after femoral OCA transplantation.

Primary outcome was treatment success or failure. Failure of PT was defined as revision surgery in which the transplant was removed, such as (unicondylar) knee arthroplasty or patellectomy. The functioning of nonfailed patients was evaluated using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. In addition, the influence of patient characteristics was evaluated. Ninety knees in 88 patients, aged 16 to 55 years with symptomatic cartilage defects, were treated by PT. Eighty knees in 78 patients were eligible for analysis and 10 patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-eight knees in 26 patients had undergone major revision surgery. Previous surgery and a longer time of symptoms prior to PT were significantly associated with an increased risk for failure of cartilage repair. Functioning of the remaining 52 patients and influence of patient characteristics was analyzed using their IKDC score. Their median IKDC score was 39.08, but a relatively young age at transplantation was associated with a higher IKDC score. This 22-year follow-up study of PT, with objective outcome parameters next to patient-reported outcome measurements in a unique group of patients, shows that overall 66% was without major revision surgery and patient characteristics also influence long-term outcome of cartilage repair surgery.

There was no association between the number of years in practice and the self-reported proportion of microfracture cases performed (P = 0.37). Fifty-eight subjects (15%) indicated that they do not perform microfracture at all. Regarding indication for surgery, 56% of surgeons would limit their indication of microfracture to lesions measuring 2 cm2 or less. Half of the surgeons reported no upper age or body mass index limit. Regarding surgical technique, 90% of surgeons would recommend a formal debridement of the calcified layer and 91% believe it is important to create stable vertical walls. Overall, 47% of surgeons use biologic augmentation, with no significant difference between regions (P = 0.35) or years of practice (P = 0.67). Rehabilitation protocols varied widely among surgeons.

This retrospective case series included patients who underwent OAT for steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the knee from 1998 to 2008. The survivorship and need for secondary surgery were evaluated, and the clinical outcome was evaluated with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective score. Preoperative and final Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade of the femorotibial and patellofemoral joints were individually evaluated. Fourteen knees of 10 patients whose mean age was 32.5 (95%CI 26.4-38.6) years were included and followed for 14.0 (12.4-15.7) years.

The objective of this systematic review was to identify and collate information pertaining to hyaline cartilage-derived chondroprogenitors, with regard to their isolation, culture, and outcome measures. As per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a web-based search of Scopus and PubMed databases was performed from January 2000 to May 2020, which yielded 509 studies.

Literature search revealed that progenitors demonstrated inherent chondrogenesis and minimal tendency for hypertrophy. Multiple sources also demonstrated significantly better outcomes that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and comparable results to chondrocytes. With regard to progenitor subgroups, collated evidence points to better and consistent outcomes with the use of migratory progenitors when compared to fibronectin adhesion assay-derived progenitors, although a direct comparison between the two cell populations is warranted.

A 16-mm circular osteochondral \"defect\" was created on the central ridge of the recipient patella. The randomly ordered donor Wiberg I or Wiberg II\/III plug was harvested from a homologous location and transplanted into the recipient. The recipient was then nano-CT (computed tomography) scanned, digitally reconstructed, registered to the initial nano-CT scan of the recipient patella, and processed to determine root mean squared circumferential step-off heights as well as surface height deviation. The process was then repeated for the other allograft plug. There was no significant difference in mean step-off height between matched and unmatched Wiberg plugs; however, there was a statistically significant difference in surface height deviation over the whole surface (0.50 mm and 0.64 mm respectively, P = 0.03). This difference of 0.14 mm is not felt to be clinically significant. Tibial width was correlated to patellar width (r = 0.82) and patellar height (r = 0.68).

As it is purely an autologous and homologous approach, it lacks a significant regulatory oversight process and can be clinically adopted without such limitations. The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the current evidence supporting autologous minced cartilage implantation.","232":null,"233":"Knee joint distraction (KJD) is a joint-preserving osteoarthritis treatment that may postpone a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) in younger patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates short- and long-term clinical benefit and tissue structure changes after KJD. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for eligible clinical studies evaluating at least one of the primary parameters: WOMAC, VAS-pain, KOOS, EQ5D, radiographic joint space width or MRI cartilage thickness after KJD. Random effects models were applied on all outcome parameters and outcomes were compared with control groups found in the included studies. Eleven articles reporting on 7 different KJD cohorts with in total 127 patients and 5 control groups with multiple follow-up moments were included, of which 2 were randomized controlled trials. Significant improvements in all primary parameters were found and benefit lasted up to at least 9 years. Overall, outcomes were comparable with control groups, including high tibial osteotomy, although TKA showed better clinical response. Current, still limited, evidence shows KJD causes clear benefit in clinical and structural parameters, both short- and long-term. Longer follow-up with more patients is necessary, to validate outcome and to potentially improve patient selection for this intensive treatment. Thus far, for younger knee osteoarthritis patients, KJD may be an option to consider. ","234":"The knee joint is one of the most frequently injured joints in the body, and the resulting injury may often lead to the presence of a bloody effusion, or hemarthrosis. The acute management of this condition can have long-lasting implications, and may ultimately result in the early onset of osteoarthritis in this population. Heme, a breakdown product of erythrocytes, and associated pro-inflammatory mediators, are known to have deleterious interactions with cartilage and synovium. The presence of blood in a joint following injury can precipitate these effects and accelerate the degenerative changes in the joint. Currently, there is no consensus on the optimal management of a traumatic knee joint injury with a hemarthrosis. Nontraumatic hemarthosis, seen most commonly in hemophilia patients, has a set of established guidelines that does not routinely recommend drainage of the joint. This article presents a rationale for joint aspiration to minimize the harmful effects of blood following traumatic hemarthrosis.","235":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic joint disease characterized by degeneration of articular cartilage and secondary osteogenesis. Cell-based agents, such as mesenchymal stem cells, have turned into the most extensively explored new therapeutic agents for OA. However, evidence-based research is still lacking. We searched public databases up to February 2020 and only included randomized controlled trials. The outcomes included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and serious adverse events (SAEs). A network meta-analysis was also performed in this work. We included 13 studies in the meta-analysis. The effect size showed that cell-based therapy did not significantly reduce the WOMAC score at the 6-month follow-up (standard mean difference [SMD] -3.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.90 to 0.18; P = 0.1928). However, cell-based therapy significantly improved the KOOS at the 12-month follow-up (SMD 0.68; 95% CI 0.07-1.30; P = 0.0288) and relieved pain (SMD -1.05; 95% CI -1.46 to -0.64; P &lt; 0.0001). The findings also indicated that high-dosage adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) may be more advantageous in terms of long-term effects. Cell-based therapy had a better effect on KOOS improvement and pain relief without safety concerns. However, cell-based therapy did not show a benefit in terms of the WOMAC. Allogeneic cells might have advantages compared to controls in the WOMAC and KOOS scores. The long-term effect of high-dose ADMSC treatment for OA is worthy of further study. ","236":"Cartilage formation is stimulated in mixtures of chondrocytes and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) both in vitro and in vivo. During coculture, human MSCs perish. The goal of this study is to elucidate the mechanism by which adipose tissue-derived MSC cell death occurs in the presence of chondrocytes. Human primary chondrocytes were cocultured with human MSCs derived from 3 donors. The cells were cultured in monoculture or coculture (20% chondrocytes and 80% MSCs) in pellets (200,000 cells\/pellet) for 7 days in chondrocyte proliferation media in hypoxia (2% O2). RNA sequencing was performed to assess for differences in gene expression between monocultures or coculture. Immune fluorescence assays were performed to determine the presence of caspase-3, LC3B, and P62. RNA sequencing revealed significant upregulation of &gt;90 genes in the 3 cocultures when compared with monocultures. STRING analysis showed interconnections between &gt;50 of these genes. Remarkably, 75% of these genes play a role in cell death pathways such as apoptosis and autophagy. Immunofluorescence shows a clear upregulation of the autophagic machinery with no substantial activation of the apoptotic pathway. In cocultures of human MSCs with primary chondrocytes, autophagy is involved in the disappearance of MSCs. We propose that this sacrificial cell death may contribute to the trophic effects of MSCs on cartilage formation.

The aim of this systematic review was to produce a comprehensive list of candidate molecular biomarkers for knee OA after the 2013 ESCEO review and discern whether any have been studied in sufficient detail for use in clinical settings. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched between August 2013 and May 2018 using the keywords \"knee osteoarthritis,\" \"osteoarthritis,\" and \"biomarker.\" Studies were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Human studies on knee OA that were published in the English language were included. Excluded were studies on genetic\/imaging\/cellular markers, studies on participants with secondary OA, and publications that were review\/abstract-only. Study quality and bias were assessed. Statistically significant data regarding the relationship between a biomarker and a disease parameter were extracted. A total of 80 studies were included in the final review and 89 statistically significant individual molecular biomarkers were identified. C-telopeptide of type II collagen (CTXII) was shown to predict progression of knee OA in urine and serum in multiple studies. Synovial fluid vascular endothelial growth factor concentration was reported by 2 studies to be predictive of knee OA progression. Despite the clear need for biomarkers of OA, the lack of coordination in current research has led to incompatible results. As such, there is yet to be a suitable biomarker to be used in a clinical setting.

They have limited capacity for intrinsic healing and traditional treatment has been removal of loose fragments. However, case reports of successful healing after fixation indicate that repair of the joint surface is possible. We wanted to evaluate the outcome in a cohort of patients who underwent fixation of acute chondral fractures in the knee. Patients treated with fixation of a chondral fracture in the knee at our institution were invited to participate in a follow-up study. The mechanism of injury, fragment properties and complications were registered. Patients completed KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and Lysholm questionnaires and performed a validated single leg hop test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to assess healing of the defect and the quality of the cartilage. Ten patients with a median age at surgery of 15 years (12-17 years) and median follow-up of 5 years (2-9 years) were assessed. The lesions were located on the patella (n = 7), the trochlea (n = 2), and the lateral femoral condyle (n = 1). Median lesion size was 250 mm2 (1.9-6.0 cm2) All patients were treated within 2 months of injury (4-58 days). All patients returned to preinjury level of sports and MRI showed retained fragments that integrated well with surrounding cartilage at follow-up. Mean Lysholm score at follow-up was 90 (73-100). Fixation of traumatic chondral-only fragments using bioabsorbable implants may result in successful healing in adolescent patients and should be considered a treatment option in acute injuries.

Our goal was to determine if polarized light microscopy (PLM) for collagen organization is useful in identifying early primary OA features in comparison to current standard histopathological methods. Osteochondral specimens from 90 total knee arthroplasty patients with relatively preserved lateral femoral condyle were scored using (1) histological-histochemical grading system (HHGS); (2) Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI); (3) PLM-Changoor system for repair cartilage, scores ranging between 0 (totally disorganized cartilage) and 5 (healthy adult cartilage); and (4) new PLM system for primary OA cartilage with superficial zone PLM (PLM-SZ) and deep zone PLM (PLM-DZ) scores, each ranging between 0 (healthy adult SZ and DZ collagen organization) and 4 (total loss of collagen organization). Serial sections were stained for collagen I and II antibodies. Spearman correlation coefficients (rs) were determined. The associations between: (1) PLM-Changoor and HHGS or OARSI were weak (rs = -0.36) or moderate (rs = -0.56); (2) PLM-SZ and HHGS or OARSI were moderate (rs = 0.46 or rs = 0.53); and (3) PLM-DZ and HHGS or OARSI were poor (rs = 0.31 or rs = 0.21), respectively. Specimens exhibiting early and mild OA (HHGS &lt; 5 and OARSI &lt; 8.6) had PLM-SZ and PLM-DZ scores between 0 and 4 and between 0 and 3, respectively, and indicated new histopathological features not currently considered by HHGS\/OARSI. PLM was effective at identifying early SZ and DZ collagen alterations that were not evident in the traditional scoring systems. Incorporating PLM scores and\/or additional HHGS\/OARSI features can help improve characterization of early primary OA cartilage. ","244":"Objective. Caspases, cysteine proteases traditionally associated with apoptosis and inflammation, have recently been identified as important regulators of autophagy and reported within the growth plate, a cartilaginous part of the developing bone. The aim of this research was to identify novel autophagy-related molecules affected by inhibition of pro-apoptotic caspases in chondrocytes. Design. Chondrocyte micromasses derived from mouse limb buds were treated with pharmacological inhibitors of caspases. Autophagy-related gene expression was examined and possible novel molecules were confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunocytofluorescence. Individual caspases inhibitors were used to identify the effect of specific caspases. Results. Chondrogenesis accompanied by caspase activation and autophagy progression was confirmed in micromass cultures. Expression of several autophagy-associated genes was significantly altered in the caspases inhibitors treated groups with the most prominent decrease for Pik3cg and increase of Tnfsf10. The results showed the specific pro-apoptotic caspases that play a role in these effects. Importantly, use of caspase inhibitors mimicked changes triggered by an autophagy stimulator, rapamycin, linking loss of caspase activity to an increase in autophagy. Conclusion. Caspase inhibition significantly affects regulation of autophagy-related genes in chondrocytes cultures. Detected markers are of importance in diagnostics and thus the data presented here open new perspectives in the field of cartilage development and degradation.","245":null,"246":"The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of intraarticular insulin on the treatment of chondral defects. Twenty-four mature New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups as control (Group 1), microfracture (Group 2), and microfracture and insulin (Group 3). Four-millimeter full-thickness cartilage defects were created to the weight-bearing surface on the medial femoral condyles of each rabbit. In the first group, any additional interventions were not performed. Microfracture was performed on defects in groups 2 and 3. Additionally, 10 IU of insulin glargine was administrated into the knee joints of the third group. Three months after surgery, the knee joints were harvested and cartilage quality was assessed according to Wakitani and ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) scores histopathologically. Insulin injections were performed into the knees of 2 additional rabbits without creating a cartilage defect to evaluate the potential adverse effects of insulin on healthy cartilage (Group 4). The total ICRS and Wakitani scores of the insulin group were found to be significantly lower than the microfracture group but similar to the control group. No negative effects of insulin on healthy cartilage were detected. Intraarticular insulin after surgery has led to a statistically significant decrease in systemic blood sugar levels whereas the decrease observed after administration to intact tissues was not statistically significant. Insulin had a negative influence on the quality of cartilage regeneration and had no effect on healthy cartilage. Intraarticular insulin administration does not cause significant systemic effects in intact tissue.

This study included a cohort of 115 consecutive patients with a cartilage lesion of the knee treated with ACI. Of the patients, 35 had an OCD lesion and 80 a full-thickness cartilage lesion. During a follow-up period from 2 to 13 years all treatment failures were identified. The failure rate between OCD lesions and full-thickness cartilage lesions was compared with Kaplan-Meier analysis. Patient-reported outcome was evaluated 2 years postoperatively with the Lysholm score. During the follow-up 21 out of 115 patients encountered a treatment failure. The failure rate for full-thickness cartilage lesions was 19.1% and for OCD lesions 43.3% over the 10-year follow-up. Patient-reported outcome improved from baseline to 2 years postoperatively. The improvement from baseline was statistically significant, and the Lysholm score improved more than the minimal clinically important difference. The patient-reported outcome showed no difference between lesion types at 2 years. In the presented retrospective study, the failure rate of first-generation ACI was higher in OCD lesions than in large full-thickness cartilage lesions, suggesting that OCD lesions may associate with properties that affect the durability of repair tissue.

From the Osteoarthritis Initiative we selected knees with no radiographic OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade [KL] 0\/1) that developed advanced-stage OA (KL 3\/4; AKOA) within a 4-year timeframe and a comparison group with a more normal rate of OA development (KL 0\/1 to KL 2 in 4 years). MRIs at the beginning of the 4-year timeframe were assessed for cartilage T2 values and structural abnormalities using a modified Whole-Organ Magnetic Resonance Imaging Score (WORMS). Associations of MRI findings with AKOA versus normal OA were assessed using multivariable logistic regression models. A total of 106 AKOA and 168 subjects with normal OA development were included. Mean cartilage T2 values were not significantly associated with AKOA (odds ratio [OR] 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.36). Risk factors for AKOA development included higher meniscus maximum scores (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.11-1.68), presence of meniscal extrusion (OR 6.30; 95% CI 2.57-15.49), presence of root tears (OR 4.64; 95% CI 1.61-13.34), and higher medial tibia cartilage lesion scores (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.19-3.24). We identified meniscal damage, especially meniscal extrusion and meniscal root tears as risk factors for AKOA development. These findings contribute to identifying subjects at risk of AKOA at an early stage when preventative measures targeting modifiable risk factors such as meniscal repair surgery could still be effective.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PRP injections with placebo or other injectable treatments, in any language, on humans, were included. Risk of bias was assessed following the Cochrane guidelines; quality of evidence was graded using the GRADE guidelines. Thirty-four RCTs, including 1403 knees in PRP groups and 1426 in control groups, were selected.

However, superiority of PRP did not reach the minimal clinically important difference for all outcomes, and quality of evidence was low. The effect of platelet concentrates goes beyond its mere placebo effect, and PRP injections provide better results than other injectable options. This benefit increases over time, being not significant at earlier follow-ups but becoming clinically significant after 6 to 12 months. However, although substantial, the improvement remains partial and supported by low level of evidence. This finding urges further research to confirm benefits and identify the best formulation and indications for PRP injections in knee OA.

Primary imaging outcome measures were T2 relaxation time of acetabular and femoral cartilage, average alpha angle, and lateral epiphyseal extension. The cohort consisted of 109 elite male footballers, 49 male controls, and 51 female controls. Elite male footballers had an acetabular cartilage T2 value 4.85 ms greater than male controls (P &lt; 0.001).

Individuals with a closed physis had an acetabular cartilage T2 value 7.86 ms less than individuals with an open physis. Acetabular cartilage T2 values decreased with age in elite footballers. No correlation existed between alpha angle and anterosuperior acetabular cartilage T2 value and no difference in T2 value existed between individuals with and without cam morphology.

The knee articular cartilage samples were obtained from 18 age- and gender-matched donors with 6 each in KBD, OA, and control groups. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, toluidine blue (TB) staining, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were performed to estimate the expression level and localization of aggrecan, along with FAM20B, GalT-II, and EXTL2, which are associated with CS synthesis and modification. Rank-based analyses of variance test was used for the multiple comparisons of discrepancy in the positive staining rate among the 3 groups. In HE and TB staining results, damaged morphology, decreased chondrocyte numbers and proteoglycans were observed in OA and KBD groups compared with the control group. In line with these trends, the positive staining rates of aggrecan were lower in KBD and OA groups than in the control group. Meanwhile, the positive staining rates of CS chain modifying enzymes FAM20B, GalT-II, and EXTL2 decreased in OA and KBD groups. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that altered expression of CS chain modifying enzymes in OA and KBD groups influenced the synthesis procession of CS and could contribute to the damage of cartilage. Further investigation of these enzymes can provide new theoretical and experimental targets for OA and KBD pathogenesis studies.

Main outcomes were self-reported pain and activity scores collected by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and\/or Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) at short term after treatment. Thirteen studies comprising 914 unique patients were included in the analysis. Overall reduction in pain score was observed after treatment (standardized mean difference -0.4059, P = 0.0091), while improvement in the activity score was not significant (standardized mean difference -0.4452, P = 0.0859). Type of control (i.e., placebo or alternative therapies) and time of follow-up resulted as the two major elements influencing the outcomes. Indeed, the restriction of the analysis to placebo-controlled trials demonstrated higher standardized mean differences between treatment and control groups, with lower P value for pain, while statistical significance became evident also for the activity score. On the contrary, no differences were observed pooling only studies comparing pulsed electromagnetic or magnetic fields to alternative treatments. In addition, longer follow-up correlated with lower differences between treated and control patients. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy effectively relieves knee OA symptoms at short term, but it is not superior to other conservative therapies such as physiotherapy.

Equine metacarpophalangeal joints were subjected to simulated physiological loads while (1) replacing synovial fluid with immersion buffers of different electrolyte concentrations and (2) directly degrading cartilage with trypsin. An inverse relationship between ionic strength and EAG coefficient was detected. Compared to native synovial fluid, EAG coefficients increased (P &lt; 0.05) for 5 of 6 electrodes immersed in 0.1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.014 M NaCl), decreased (P &lt; 0.05) for 4 of 6 electrodes in 1X PBS (0.14 M NaCl), and decreased (P &lt; 0.05) for all 6 electrodes in 10X PBS (1.4 M NaCl). This relationship corresponds to similar studies where streaming potentials were directly measured on cartilage. EAG coefficients, obtained after trypsin degradation, were reduced (P &lt; 0.05) in 6 of 8, and 7 of 8 electrodes, during simulated standing and walking, respectively. Trypsin degradation was confirmed by direct cartilage assessments. Streaming potentials, measured by directly contacting cartilage, indicated lower cartilage stiffness (P &lt; 10-5). Unconfined compression data revealed reduced Em, representing proteoglycan matrix stiffness (P = 0.005), no change in Ef, representing collagen network stiffness (P = 0.15), and no change in permeability (P = 0.24). Trypsin depleted proteoglycan as observed by both dimethylmethylene blue assay (P = 0.0005) and safranin-O stained histological sections. These data show that non-invasive EAG detects streaming potentials produced by cartilage during joint compression and has potential to become a diagnostic tool capable of detecting early cartilage degeneration.

Morphological magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for MOCART assessment and T2 mapping was performed 1 week and 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after GelrinC implantation. Evaluation of T2 mapping was based on the assessment of global T2 indices (T2 of the repair tissue [RT] divided by T2 of healthy reference cartilage) and zonal variation.

Furthermore, based on T2 mapping, significant zonal variation of the RT was observed at 24 months (P = 0.039), which did not differ significantly from healthy reference cartilage (P = 0.6). Increasing MOCART scores were observed throughout the follow-up period, indicative of maturation of the cartilage repair. Significant zonal variation of the RT at 24 months might indicate the transformation into hyaline cartilage-like RT.

Chondrocytes were observed into collagen and glycosaminoglycans extracellular matrix filling the repaired tissue. There was no evidence of subchondral bone sclerosis. Untreated CCD showed denudated osteochondral lesions without signs of cartilage repair. Histological analysis showed the absence of tissue formation over the CCD.

A comprehensive search was conducted using Google Scholar and PubMed\/Medline with a specific focus on the growth plate cartilage-subchondral bone interface. All original articles, reviews in journals, and book chapters were considered. Following a review of the overall structural and functional characteristics of the physis, the literature on histological studies of both articular and growth plate chondro-osseous junctions is briefly reviewed. Next the literature on biochemical properties of these interfaces is reviewed, specifically the literature on elemental analyses across the cartilage-subchondral bone junctions. The literature on biomechanical studies of these junctions at the articular and physeal interfaces is also reviewed and compared. Unlike the interface between articular cartilage and bone, growth plate cartilage has 2 chondro-osseous junctions. The reserve zone of the mature growth plate is intimately connected to a plate of subchondral bone on the epiphyseal side. This interface resembles that between the subchondral bone and articular cartilage, although much less is known about its makeup and formation. There is a notably paucity of information available on the structural and mechanical properties of reserve zone-subchondral epiphyseal bone interface.

This study aims to describe biomechanical maturation process of repair tissue after cartilage repair with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) at long-term follow-up. Design. After ACI, 40 patients underwent altogether 60 arthroscopic biomechanical measurements of the repair tissue at various time points during an up to 11-year follow-up period. Of these patients, 30 patients had full-thickness cartilage lesions and 10 had an osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) defect. The mean lesion area was 6.5 cm2 (SD 3.2). A relative indentation stiffness value for each individually measured lesion was calculated as a ratio of repair tissue and surrounding cartilage indentation value to enable interindividual comparison. Results. Repair tissue stiffness improved during approximately 5 years after surgery. Most of the increase in stiffness occurred during the first 2 years. The curvilinear correlation between relative stiffness values and the follow-up time was 0.31 (95% CI 0.07-0.52), P = 0.017. The interindividual variation of the stiffness was high. Lesion properties or demographic factors showed no significant correlation to biomechanical outcome. The overall postoperative average relative stiffness was 0.75 (SD 0.47). Conclusions. Our clinical study describes a biomechanical maturation process of cartilage repair that may continue even longer than expected. A substantial increase in tissue stiffness proceeds for the first two years postoperatively. Minor progression proceeds for even longer. In some repairs, the biomechanical result was equal to native cartilage, suggesting hyaline-type repair. The variation in biomechanical results suggests substantial inconsistency in the structural outcome following ACI.","271":null,"272":"This study aimed to assess the association between synovial fluid (SF) metabolites and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cartilage biochemical composition to identify potential SF biomarkers for detecting the early onset of cartilage degeneration in a rabbit model. Both knees of 12 New Zealand White rabbits were used. The anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) model was performed on right knees, and the sham surgery on left knees. MRI UTE-T2* scanning and SF sample collection were performed on ACLT knees at 4 and 8 weeks postsurgery and on sham surgery knees at 4 weeks postsurgery. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and multivariate statistical analysis were used to distinguish samples in three groups. Pathway and receiver operating characteristic analyses were utilized to identify potential metabolite biomarkers. There were 12 knees in sham surgery models, 11 in ACLT models at 4 weeks postsurgery, and 10 in ACLT models at 8 weeks postsurgery. UTE-T2* values for the lateral tibia cartilage showed significant decreases over the study period. Levels of 103 identified metabolites in SF were markedly different among three groups. Furthermore, 24 metabolites were inversely correlated with UTE-T2* values of the lateral tibia cartilage, while hippuric acid was positively correlated with UTE-T2* values of the lateral tibia cartilage. Among 25 potential markers, N1-acetylspermidine, 2-amino-1,3,4-octadecanetriol, l-phenylalanine, 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, and l-tryptophan were identified as potential biomarkers with high area under the curve values and Pearson correlation coefficients.

Secondary objectives included differences in pathophysiology, surgical complications\/failures, or osteoarthritis development. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and OVID databases were systematically searched for eligible studies reporting on APM outcomes at a minimum of 1 year postoperatively. Studies that did not include BMI categorization were excluded. Meta-analysis was conducted with random-effects modeling where data from at least 2 studies was available. A total of 16 articles were included. Overweight\/obese BMI was associated with worse preoperative Lysholm (mean difference, -6.06 [95% CI, -11.70 to -0.42]) and visual analogue scale pain scores (0.43 [0.07 to 0.79]). Worse postoperative normalized knee-specific patient-reported outcome scores were also associated with obese BMI (-4.57 [-5.33 to -3.81]). There were no significant differences in clinical improvement or osteoarthritis progression among BMI groups. Two studies found higher complication\/failure rates, 3 articles associated medial meniscus posterior root tears, and 1 article found differences in gene transcript expression with increased BMI. Obesity is associated with worse knee function after APM, and patients with elevated BMI have worse preoperative knee pain and function. However, there is no difference in amount of improvement between elevated and normal BMI patients.

We hypothesized that ex vivo impacting of osteochondral autografts results in higher chondrocyte matrix production versus intact osteochondral autograft plugs. This institutional review board-approved study characterizes the effects of impacting osteochondral plugs harvested from the intercondylar notch of 16 patients into a paste, leaving one graft intact as a control. Cell viability\/proliferation, collagen type I\/II, SOX-9, and aggrecan gene expression via qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) were analyzed at 24 and 48 hours. Matrix production and cell morphology were evaluated using histology. Paste samples from patients (mean age 39.7) with moderate (19%) to severe (81%) cartilage lesions displayed 34% and 80% greater cell proliferation compared to plugs at 24 and 48 hours post processing, respectively (P = 0.015 and P = 0.021). qRT-PCR analysis yielded a significant (P = 0.000) increase of aggrecan, SOX-9, collagen type I and II at both 24 and 48 hours. Histological examination displayed cell division throughout paste samples, with accumulation of aggrecan around multiple chondrocyte lacunae. Paste graft preparation resulted in increased mobility of chondrocytes by matrix disruption without loss of cell viability. The impaction procedure stimulated chondrocyte proliferation resulting in a cellular response to reestablish native extracellular matrix. Analysis of gene expression supports a regenerative process of cartilage tissue formation and contradicts long-held beliefs that impaction trauma leads to immediate cell death. This mechanism of action translates into clinical benefit for patients with moderate to severe cartilage damage.

The most severe degeneration on the articular cartilage was most regularly on the patellar fossa. The second most degenerated region varied by age and biomechanical alterations. There were no significant changes in DSS between the sexes within the age groups. No difference was shown between the sexes in the severity or location of degeneration indicating that men and women are likely affected by the same biomechanical changes that spur on osteoarthritis in their eighth decade of life (70s) and later. Lateral femoral degeneration predominates in younger populations. When patients approach their 70s, medial degeneration begins to predominate likely based on an increase in shearing at the knee joint.

The article outlines the historical precedents in the development of orthopedic registries from the earliest tumor registries, then local arthroplasty databases that led ultimately to international collaborations between national arthroplasty and soft tissue registries. The ICRS global cartilage registry was designed from the outset as a GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) compliant, multilingual, multinational cooperative system. It is a web-based user-friendly, live in 11 languages by end 2019, which can be accessed via https:\/\/cartilage.org\/society\/icrs-patient-registry\/. Patients and clinicians enter data by smartphone, tablet, or computer on any knee cartilage regeneration and joint preservation treatment, including the use of focal arthroplasty.

However, it is also prone to degeneration, which is associated with various clinical symptoms and conditions, ranging from disc herniation to back pain to spinal stenosis. Most patients' conditions are managed conservatively but a small proportion progress to having surgery. This may be decompression (to remove tissue such as the disc, bone, or hypertrophic ligaments impinging on nerves) or fusion of the normally mobile intervertebral joint to immobilize it and so reduce pain. These used to involve fairly major surgical procedures, but in the past decade there has been much progress to make the surgery more refined and less invasive, for example using endoscopic approaches. Simultaneously, the research world has been studying and developing tissue engineering and cellular techniques for attempting to regenerate the intervertebral disc, whether simply the central nucleus pulposus or a complete intricate assembly to replicate the native structure of this and the surrounding annulus fibrosus, cartilage endplate, and bone.

To scan a human OA tibial plateau with a cartilage defect, retrieved after total knee arthroplasty, following clinical imaging techniques were used: (1) computed tomography (CT), (2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (3) a 3D scanner. From such a scan, a CAD file was obtained to generate G-code to control 3D bioprinting in situ directly into the tibial plateau lesion. Highest resolution was obtained using the 3D scanner (2.77 times more points\/mm2 than CT), and of the 3 devices tested, only the 3D scanner was able to detect the actual OA defect area. Human chondrocytes included in 3D bioprinted constructs produced extracellular matrix and formed cartilage tissue fragments after 2 weeks of differentiation and high levels of a mature splice version of collagen type II (Col IIA type B), characteristic of native articular cartilage and aggrecan (ACAN). Chondrocytes had a mean viability of 81% in prints after day 5 of differentiation toward cartilage and similar viability was detected in control 3D pellet differentiation of chondrocytes (mean viability 72%).

Knee OA patients were identified from the Optum Clinformatics dataset (January 2006 to June 2016), stratified into hylan G-F 20 and non-hylan G-F 20 HA users. Occurrences of surrogate SALR measures including inflammation\/infection, intra-articular corticosteroid (CS) injections, arthrocentesis\/aspiration, and office visits were evaluated within 3 days of HA use. Risk factors were evaluated using logistic regression. The cohort involved 748,428 HA patients (23.2% in the hylan G-F 20 group). Inflammation\/infection rate was 0.001% for hylan G-F 20 and 0.002% for non-hylan G-F 20 HA groups. Risk of CS injection (any diagnosis) was greater for hylan G-F 20 patients by 28% (P &lt; 0.001).

While the circadian clock is clearly involved in chondrocyte homeostasis in health and disease, it is unclear as to what roles it may play during early chondrogenesis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the rhythmic expression of the core circadian clock was detectable at the earliest stages of chondrocyte differentiation, and if so, whether a synchronized expression pattern of chondrogenic transcription factors and developing cartilage matrix constituents was present during cartilage formation. Following serum shock, embryonic limb bud-derived chondrifying micromass cultures exhibited synchronized temporal expression patterns of core clock genes involved in the molecular circadian clock. We also observed that chondrogenic marker genes followed a circadian oscillatory pattern. Clock synchronization significantly enhanced cartilage matrix production and elevated SOX9, ACAN, and COL2A1 gene expression. The observed chondrogenesis-promoting effect of the serum shock was likely attributable to its synchronizing effect on the molecular clockwork, as co-application of small molecule modulators (longdaysin and KL001) abolished the stimulating effects on extracellular matrix production and chondrogenic marker gene expression. Results from this study suggest that a functional molecular clockwork plays a positive role in tissue homeostasis and histogenesis during early chondrogenesis.

Conditioned medium from cultures and the biologics used in the study were assayed for IL-1RA. The protein footprint of BioCartilage was determined using bottom-up proteomics. Results. BioCartilage supported chondrocyte and MSC attachment within 24 hours, and cell viability was retained in all constructs at 24 and 48 hours. Fibrin glue did not inhibit cell attachment. BMC had the highest concentration of IL-1RA. Proteomics yielded 254 proteins, including collagens, proteoglycans, and several bioactive proteins with known anabolic roles including cartilage oligomeric matrix protein. Conclusions. This study suggests that BioCartilage has the chemical composition and architecture to support cell adherence and migration and to provide bioactive proteins, which together should have biologics advantages in cartilage repair beyond its role as a scaffold.","309":"Objectives. The purpose of this study was to examine whether patients with diagnosed hypertension have an increased risk of graft failure following cartilage repair with either autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) or osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA). We hypothesized that hypertension is related to higher ACI and OCA graft failure. Design. Patients who underwent ACI or OCA transplantation between February 2009 and December 2016 were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were (1) at least 2 years' follow-up, (2) available information related to the living habits (smoking and medication status), and (3) available information related to the presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or hyperlipidemia. To identify potential independent risk factors of graft failure, univariate screening was performed and factors with significance at a level of P &lt; 0.1 were entered in multivariate logistic regression models. Results. A total of 368 patients (209 ACI and 159 OCA) were included into our study. In the ACI group, 61 patients' (29.1%) graft failed. Univariate screening identified older age, female gender, defect size, higher prevalence of hypertension, and smoking as a predictor of graft failure. Following, multivariate logistic regression revealed female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.02, P = 0.048), defect size (OR 1.07, P = 0.035), and hypertension (OR 3.73, P = 0.023) as significant independent risk factors predicting graft failure after ACI. In the OCA group, 29 patients' (18.2%) graft failed and none of the included factors demonstrated to be a potential risk factor for graft failure. Conclusion. Hypertension, defect size, and female gender seem to predict ACI graft failure but not OCA failure.","310":"To develop patient-focused consensus guidelines on the indications for the use of scaffolds to address chondral and osteochondral femoral condyle lesions. The RAND\/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM) was used to develop patient-specific recommendations by combining the best available scientific evidence with the collective judgement of a panel of experts guided by a core panel and multidisciplinary discussers. A list of specific clinical scenarios was produced regarding adult patients with symptomatic lesions without instability, malalignment, or meniscal deficiency. Each scenario underwent discussion and a 2-round vote on a 9-point Likert-type scale (range 1-3 \"inappropriate,\" 4-6 \"uncertain,\" 7-9 \"appropriate\"). Scores were pooled to generate expert recommendations. Scaffold (chondral vs. osteochondral), patient characteristics (age and sport activity level), and lesion characteristics (etiology, size, and the presence of osteoarthritis [OA]) were considered to define 144 scenarios. The use of scaffold-based procedures was considered appropriate in all cases of chondral or osteochondral lesions when joints are not affected by OA, while OA joints presented more controversial results. The analysis of the evaluated factors showed a different weight in influencing treatment appropriateness: the presence of OA influenced 58.3% of the indications, while etiology, size, and age were discriminating factors in 54.2%, 29.2%, and 16.7% of recommendations, respectively. The consensus identified indications still requiring investigation, but also the convergence of the experts in several scenarios defined appropriate or inappropriate, which could support decision making in the daily clinical practice, guiding the use of scaffold-based procedures for the treatment of chondral and osteochondral knee defects.

However, high-level evidence comparing microfracture and spheroid technology ACI is limited. Prospective, phase III clinical trial with patients randomized to ACI (N = 52) or MF (N = 50). Level of evidence: 1, randomized controlled trial. Both procedures followed standard protocols. For ACI 10 to 70 spheroids\/cm2 were administered. Primary outcome measure was the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). This report presents results for 36 months after treatment. Both ACI and MF showed significant improvement over the entire 3-year observation period. For the overall KOOS, noninferiority of ACI (the intended primary goal of the study) was formally confirmed; additionally, for the subscores \"Activities of Daily Living\" and \"Sport and Recreation,\" superiority of ACI over MF was shown at descriptive level. Occurrence of adverse events were not different between both treatments (ACI 77%; MF 74%). Four patients in the MF group required reoperation which was defined as treatment failure. No treatment failure was reported for the ACI group. Patients treated with matrix-associated ACI with spheroid technology showed substantial improvement in various clinical outcomes after 36 months. The advantages of ACI compared with microfracture was underlined by demonstrating noninferiority, in overall KOOS and superiority in the KOOS subscores \"Activities of Daily Living\" and \"Sport and Recreation.\" In the present study, subgroups comparing different age groups and defect sizes showed comparable clinical outcomes.

For all knees (n = 264), single and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine if any patellar instability risk factors affected the odds of having a cartilage lesion. In patients with unilateral symptoms (n = 121), single variable linear regression was used to determine if the presence, size, or ICRS (International Cartilage Regeneration &amp; Joint Preservation Society) grade of cartilage lesions could predict the 12 or 24+ month postoperative BPII 2.0 score. A total of 84.5% of knees had patellofemoral cartilage lesions (88.3% involved the distal-medial patella). Trochlear dysplasia (high grade: odds ratio = 15.7, P &lt; 0.001; low grade: odds ratio = 2.9, P = 0.015) was associated with the presence of a cartilage lesion. The presence, size, and grade of cartilage lesions were not associated with 12 or 24+ month postoperative BPII 2.0 scores. Trochlear dysplasia was a risk factor for the development of patellofemoral cartilage lesions in this patient population. Cartilage lesions most commonly involve the distal-medial patella.

The cohort consisted of 6274 participants of the Mini-Finland Health Survey, who were free from knee OA and insulin-treated diabetes at baseline. Information on the baseline characteristics, including metabolic syndrome components, hypertension, elevated fasting glucose, elevated triglycerides, reduced high-density lipoprotein, and central obesity were collected during a health examination. We drew information on the incidence of clinical knee OA from the national Care Register for Health Care. Of the participants, 459 developed incident knee OA. In our full model, age, gender, body mass index, history of physical workload, smoking history, knee complaint, and previous injury of the knee were entered as potential confounding factors. Having metabolic syndrome at baseline was not associated with an increased risk of incident knee OA. In the full model, the hazard ratio for incident knee OA for those with metabolic syndrome was 0.76 (95% confidence interval [0.56, 1.01]). The number of metabolic syndrome components or any individual component did not predict an increased risk of knee OA. Of the components, elevated plasma fasting glucose was associated with a reduced risk of incident knee OA (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval [0.55, 0.91]). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that metabolic syndrome or its components increase the risk of incident knee OA. In fact, elevated fasting glucose levels seemed to predict a reduced risk.

Clinical evaluation was performed in those not revised and was able to participate. This was a prospective single-center cohort study of HemiCAP patients with 7 to 10 years of clinical and radiographic follow-up. The clinical examination included the Knee Society Score (KSS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) score. The radiographic examination included the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade. Survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and potential risk factors for revision was evaluated by a regression analysis. Of the 62 patients with 64 HemiCAP prostheses, 37 were HemiCAP condyle, 11 HemiCAP PF, and 16 HemiCAP Wave; 27 (42%) were revised-HemiCAP condyle 17 (42%), HemiCAP PF 4 (36%), HemiCAP Wave 6 (37%), and 1 died.

The average reported time of return to play was as low as 4.9 months with AOT, and as high as 11.6 months following ACI. The majority of patients are able to return to play following cartilage restoration procedures in the knee, regardless of surgical procedure utilized. However, while the rate of return to play at the same level was similar to the overall rate of return following AOT, there was a large number of patients unable to return to the same level following Mfx, OCA, and ACI.

There was a weighted 19%, 35%, and 6% rate of reported complications, reoperations, and failures, respectively. Concomitant patellofemoral surgery (51% of patients) mostly did not lead to statistically different postoperative outcomes. Numerous patellofemoral restoration techniques result in significant functional improvement with a low rate of failure.

Preoperatively the age, gender, level of activity, symptoms' duration, Lysholm knee scoring scale (LKSS), Q angle, range of motion (ROM), and quadriceps output torque (QOT) were recorded. The plica was then arthroscopically excised while plica morphological type and cartilage lesions (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS] classification) were registered. The postoperative evaluation was done after 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 3 years, and 10 years. The final assessment after 10 years covered LKSS, ROM, QOT, and was enriched with functional tests: the single leg squat test (SLS), the modified Ober test (MO), and the manual palpation of the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO). The mean LKSS increased from 52 (15-85, SD 16.479) preoperative to 80 (48-100, SD 15.711) at final follow-up examination. A significant negative correlation was found between LKSS and the patients' age. Cartilage lesions higher than ICRS 1 significantly decreased the final LKSS. Results were significantly better in the subgroups with normal outcome of functional tests. Clinical results of arthroscopic plica resection are better in patients without coexisting cartilage lesions. Poor neuromuscular control may contribute to abnormal patella tracking, leading to both medial plica irritation and further cartilage deterioration.

A total of 10 human cadaver knees were used in this study. Medial meniscus and the adjacently surrounding joint capsules were harvested then sectioned both axially and coronally, followed by scanning electron microscopy analysis. The medial meniscus (anterior, middle, posterior) and the adjacent perimeniscal capsules (superior, peripheral) were biomechanically assessed to ascertain the tensile modulus. Among the perimeniscal capsules, the peripherally located capsules were morphologically different from the superiorly located capsules: The peripheral perimeniscal capsule was thicker and showed circumferentially oriented fibers whereas the superior perimeniscal capsule fibers were thinner and arranged in vertical orientation. The peripheral capsule also yielded significantly greater tensile modulus compared with the superior capsule biomechanically. We conclude that depending on its anatomical location, the perimeniscal capsule consists of fibers of varying orientations. This may be important in maintaining the circumferential hoop tension of the meniscus especially in the presence of circumferentially oriented and thick peripheral capsule fibers, which coincidentally have higher tensile modulus.","323":"To compare the histological and immunohistochemical characteristics of matrix-assisted chondrocyte implantation (MACI) grafts between patients with revision surgery and patients with total joint arthroplasty.

A total of 31 biopsies were available, 10 undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and 21 patients undergoing revision surgery. Patients in the clinically failed group were significantly older (46.3 years) than patients in the revision group (36.6 years) (P = 0.007). Histologically, the predominant tissue in both groups was of fibrocartilaginous nature, although a higher percentage of specimens in the revision group contained a hyaline-like repair tissue. The percentages of type I collagen (52.9% and 61.0%) and type II collagen (66.3% and 42.2%) were not significantly different between clinically failed and revised MACI, respectively. The talar dome contained the best and patella the worst repair tissue. Subchondral bone pathology was present in all clinically failed patients and consisted of bone marrow lesions, including edema, necrosis and fibrosis, intralesional osteophyte formation, subchondral bone plate elevation, intralesional osteophyte formation, subchondral bone cyst formation, or combinations thereof. MACI grafts in patients with revision and total joint arthroplasty were predominantly fibrocartilage in repair type, did not differ in composition and were histologically dissimilar to healthy cartilage. Clinically failed cases showed evidence of osteochondral unit failure, rather than merely cartilage repair tissue failure.

Physicians scored all images, with regard to osteophytes, sclerosis, joint space narrowing OARSI grades and KL grade, in 2 modalities: through a plain radiograph (unaided) and a radiograph presented together with the report from the computer assisted detection system (aided). Intraclass correlation between the physicians was calculated for both modalities. Furthermore, physicians' performance was compared with the grading of the OAI study, and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated in both modalities for each of the scored features. Results. Agreement rates for KL grade, sclerosis, and osteophyte OARSI grades, were statistically increased in the aided versus the unaided modality. Readings for joint space narrowing OARSI grade did not show a statistically difference between the 2 modalities. Readers' accuracy and specificity for KL grade &gt;0, KL &gt;1, sclerosis OARSI grade &gt;0, and osteophyte OARSI grade &gt;0 was significantly increased in the aided modality. Reader sensitivity was high in both modalities. Conclusions.

The use of the software also increased accuracy measures as compared with the OAI study, mostly through increases in specificity.","327":"Purpose. To explore the relationship between the death receptor (DR) and the pathological progression of Kashin-Beck disease (KBD). Design. KBD cartilage samples were collected from 15 patients diagnosed according to the \"National Diagnostic Criteria of KBD\" in China. In vitro monolayer chondrocytes were cultured in complete medium. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities in chondrocytes were analyzed using a kit. Nuclear morphology was observed by Hoechst 33258 staining, apoptosis was verified by flow cytometry analysis, and DR molecules were detected using Western blotting and quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results. Early apoptotic rates of KBD and osteoarthritis (OA) chondrocytes were higher than those of normal control (NC) cells. Excessive apoptotic nuclei were observed in OA and KBD cells after Hoechst 33258 staining. Activities of both caspase-3 and caspase-8 were higher in KBD and OA cells than in NC cells. The average DR4 mRNA level in KBD cells was 3.301-fold higher than that in NC cells, Fas-associating protein with death domain (FADD) transcript level in KBD cells was 2.528-fold higher than that in NC cells. Western blot analyses showed that FAS, DR4, DR5, caspase-3, and FADD were upregulated in the KBD and OA groups compared with the NC group. High expression of caspase-8 in KBD compared with NC was verified, whereas cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) in KBD was significantly downregulated. Conclusions. KBD and OA chondrocytes showed obvious FADD-caspase-dependent apoptosis, which is related to the DR pathway. Apoptosis in KBD articular cartilage is mainly related to FAS\/DR4-FADD-caspase signaling, and OA is associated with FAS\/DR4\/DR5-FADD-caspase signaling.","328":null,"329":"The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to report the safety of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IAHA) in patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients with workers compensation treated with ACI in our clinic over 10 years (August 2004 to November 2014). Data were collected on demographics, lesion size and location, number of defects, duration of symptoms, and outcomes. A total of 28 patients with 30 ACI procedures were included in this analysis. Patients had a mean age of 40.0 years, were mostly male, and tended to be overweight (mean body mass index = 31.5 kg\/m2). Most patients were employed in occupations with high physical demand (85.7%) compared with lower physical demand jobs (14.3%). The mean number of lesions per knee = 1.73. Overall, the mean total surface area of the defect was large (12.6 cm2), with large mean individual lesion size of 7.39 cm2. All 28 patients returned to work in some capacity, with a total of 22 (79%) returning to full work, and 6 (21%) returning to modified work. There were no significant differences in the comparison of patients who returned to full versus modified work, in mean age, body mass index, high versus low physical demand occupation, or lesion characteristics (size, chronicity, or location).

The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) Is proteoglycan loss dependent on the amount of collagen damage and does it depend on whether this collagen damage is superficial or internal? (2) Does repeated loading further increase the already enhanced proteoglycan loss in cartilage with collagen damage? Fifty-six bovine osteochondral plugs were equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline for 24 hours, mechanically tested in compression for 8 hours, and kept in phosphate-buffered saline for another 48 hours. The mechanical tests included an overloading step to induce collagen damage, creep steps to determine tissue stiffness, and cyclic loading to induce convection. Proteoglycan release was measured before and after mechanical loading, as well as 48 hours post-loading. Collagen damage was scored histologically. Histology revealed different collagen damage grades after the application of mechanical overloading. After 48 hours in phosphate-buffered saline postloading, proteoglycan loss increased linearly with the amount of total collagen damage and was dependent on the presence but not the amount of internal collagen damage. In samples without collagen damage, repeated loading also resulted in increased proteoglycan loss. However, repeated loading did not further enhance the proteoglycan loss induced by damaged collagen. Proteoglycan loss is enhanced by collagen damage and it depends on the presence of internal collagen damage. Cyclic loading stimulates proteoglycan loss in healthy cartilage but does not lead to additional loss in cartilage with damaged collagen.

Using a flexible water jet instrument to drill holes can improve the reachability of the defect without inducing thermal damage. The aim of this feasibility study is to determine whether water jet drilling is potentially safe compared with conventional microfracture awls by studying side effects and perioperative complications, as well as the quality of cartilage repair tissue. Talar chondral defects with 6-mm diameter were created bilaterally in 6 goats (12 samples). One defect in each goat was treated with microfracture created with conventional awls, the contralateral defect was treated with holes created with 5-second water jet bursts at a pressure of 50 MPa. Postoperative complications were recorded and after 24 weeks analyses were performed using the ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) macroscopic score and modified O'Driscoll histological score. Several practical issues using the water jet in the operating theatre were noted. Water jet drilling resulted in fibrocartilage repair tissue similar to the repair tissue from conventional awls. These results suggest that water jet drilling gives adequate fibrocartilage repair tissue.

Blood samples were taken from 116 subjects with knee osteoarthritis (OA) at a single time point (PRODIGE study) and from 15 healthy subjects under various conditions, including fasting condition, sampling time and season, blood treatment, and type of blood collection tube (COVAR study). Type II collagen-specific biomarker Coll2-1 was directly measured in serum using an immunoassay. There was no significant difference on Coll2-1 values between samples collected at any of the 5 sampling times or at any of the sampling days measured. None of the sampling parameters tested had a significant impact on Coll2-1 value (clotting time, clotting temperature and temperature of blood centrifugation, type of tube). On the contrary, differences were found in between subjects and between subjects with knee OA and healthy subjects. Coll2-1 measurement is not affected by sampling specific conditions, circadian rhythm or seasons but was found elevated in subject with knee OA indicating that Coll2-1 serum variation is not linked to the study environment, but to cartilage degradation in OA.

The objective of this study was to optimize and compare the potential of lentivirus (LV) and adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver transgenes to meniscus cells in both intact meniscus tissue and isolated primary cells in monolayer. Porcine meniscus tissue explants and primary meniscus cells in monolayer were transduced with LV or self-complementary AAV2 (scAAV2) encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). Following transduction, explants were enzymatically digested to isolate meniscus cells, and monolayer cells were trypsinized. Isolated cells were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine percent transduction. LV and scAAV2 showed a high transduction efficiency in monolayer meniscus cells. scAAV2 was most effective at transducing cells within intact meniscus tissue but the efficiency was less than 20%. Outer zone meniscus cells were more readily transduced by both LV and scAAV2 than the inner zone cells. Higher virus titers and higher cell density resulted in improved transduction efficiency. Polybrene was necessary for the highest transduction efficiency with LV, but it reduced scAAV2 transduction. Both LV and scAAV2 efficiently transduce primary meniscus cells but only scAAV2 can modestly transduce cells embedded in meniscus tissue. This work lays the foundation for viral gene transfer to be utilized to deliver bioactive transgenes or gene editing machinery, which can induce long-term and tunable expression of therapeutic proteins from tissue-engineered constructs for meniscus repair and regeneration.

Current pharmacological treatments remain relatively ineffective. This study investigated the efficacy of photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) on cartilage integrity and central pain biomarkers in adult male Wistar rats. We evaluated the cartilage degradation and spinal cord sensitization using the monoiodoacetate (MIA) model of OA following 2 weeks of delayed PBMT treatment (i.e., 15 days post-MIA). Multiple behavioral tests and knee joint histology were used to assess deficits related to OA. Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess chronic pain sensitization in spinal cord dorsal horn regions. Furthermore, we analyzed the principal components related to pain-like behavior and cartilage integrity. MIA induced chronic pain-like behavior with respective cartilage degradation. PBMT had no effects on overall locomotor activity, but positive effects on weight support (P = 0.001; effect size [ES] = 1.01) and mechanical allodynia (P = 0.032; ES = 0.51). Greater optical densitometry of PBMT-treated cartilage was evident in superficial layers (P = 0.020; ES = 1.34), likely reflecting the increase of proteoglycan and chondrocyte contents. In addition, PBMT effects were associated to decreased contribution of spinal glial cells to pain-like behavior (P = 0.001; ES = 0.38). PBMT during the chronic phase of MIA-induced OA promoted cartilage recovery and reduced the progression or maintenance of spinal cord sensitization. Our data suggest a potential role of PBMT in reducing cartilage degradation and long-term central sensitization associated with chronic OA. ","342":"Advances in research have shown that the subchondral bone plays an important role in the propagation of cartilage loss and progression of osteoarthritis (OA), but whether the subchondral bone changes precede or lead to articular cartilage loss remains debatable. In order to elucidate the subchondral bone and cartilage changes that occur in early OA, an experiment using anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) induced posttraumatic OA model of the rat knee was conducted. Forty-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups: the ACLT group and the nonoperated control group. Surgery was conducted on the ACLT group, and subsequently rats from both groups were sacrificed at 1, 2, and 3 weeks postsurgery. Subchondral bone was evaluated using a high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography scanner, while cartilage was histologically evaluated and scored. A significant reduction in the subchondral trabecular bone thickness and spacing was found as early as 1 week postsurgery in ACLT rats compared with the nonoperated control. This was subsequently followed by a reduction in bone mineral density and bone fractional volume at week 2, and finally a decrease in the trabecular number at week 3. These changes occurred together with cartilage degeneration as reflected by an increasing Mankin score over all 3 weeks. Significant changes in subchondral bone occur very early in OA concurrent with surface articular cartilage degenerative change suggest that factors affecting bone remodeling and resorption together with cartilage matrix degradation occur very early in the disease.

Specifically, p21 is downregulated in MRL cells and similar ear hole closure to MRL mice has been observed in p21-\/- mice. However, the direct implications of p21 deletion in endogenous articular cartilage regeneration remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of p21 deletion in the ability of mice to heal full-thickness cartilage defects (FTCDs). C57BL\/6 and p21-\/- (Cdkn1atm1Tyj) mice were subjected to FTCD and assessment of cartilage healing was performed at 1 hour, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-FTCD using a 14-point histological scoring system. X-ray microscopy was used to quantify cartilage healing parameters (e.g., cartilage thickness, surface area\/volume) between C57BL\/6 and p21-\/- mice. Absence of p21 resulted in increased spontaneous articular cartilage regeneration by 3 days post-FTCD. Furthermore, p21-\/- mice presented with increased cartilage thickness at 1 and 2 weeks post-FTCD compared with uninjured controls, returning to baseline by 4 weeks post-FTCD. We report that p21-\/- mice display enhanced articular cartilage regeneration post-FTCD compared with C57BL\/6 mice. Furthermore, cartilage thickness was increased in p21-\/- mice at 1 week post-FTCD compared with uninjured p21-\/- mice and C57BL\/6 mice.

Because of limited availability of cartilage and low chondrocytes yield from cartilage, the need for an improve isolation protocol for maximum yield of viable cells is a key to achieving successful clinical constructs. This study optimizes and compares different protocols for isolation of chondrocytes from cartilage. We employed enzymatic digestion of cartilage using collagenase II and trypsin. The chondrocytes yield, growth kinetics, aggrecan, and collagen type 2 (COL2) expression were evaluated. Collagen type 1 (COL1) mRNA expression was assessed to monitor the possibility of chondrocytes dedifferentiation. Chondrocyte yield per gram of cartilage was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) using collagenase II in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) compared with 0.25% trypsin. The number of chondrocyte yield per gram was higher in cartilage digested with collagenase in HBSS compared with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium\/F12; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Chondrocytes seeded at lower densities had shorter population doubling time compared to those seeded at higher density. Protein and gene expression of chondrocyte phenotype indicates the expression of aggrecan and COL2. The expression of COL1 was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) in passage 3 compared with primary chondrocytes. The mRNA expression of chondrocyte phenotype was similar in primary and passaged one cells. Collagenase in HBSS yield the highest number of viable chondrocytes and the isolated cells expressed chondrocyte phenotype. This protocol can be employed to generate large number of viable chondrocytes, particularly with limited cartilage biopsies.

Ten patients (mean age 29.4 years, range 18-36) suffering from large full-thickness cartilage in the knee were treated with BMAC and PRP from January 2015 to December 2016. In a 1-step procedure autologous BMAC and PRP was seeded onto a collagen scaffold and sutured into the debrided defect. Patients were evaluated by clinical outcome scores (IKDC [International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form], KOOS [Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score], and pain score using the Numeric Rating Scale [NRS]) preoperatively, after 3 months, and after 1 and 2 years. Second-look arthroscopies were performed (n = 7) with biopsies of the repair tissue for histology. All patients had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperatively, after 1 year, and after 2 to 3.5 years with MOCART (magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue) scores evaluating cartilage repair. After 1 year significant improvements were found in IKDC, KOOS symptoms, KOOS ADL (Activities of Daily Living), KOOS QOL (Quality of Life), and pain at activity. At the latest follow-up significant improvements were seen in IKDC, KOOS symptoms, KOOS QOL, pain at rest, and pain at activity. MRI MOCART score for cartilage repair improved significantly from baseline to 1-year follow-up. Histomorphometry of repair tissue demonstrated a mixture of fibrous tissue (58%) and fibrocartilage (40%).

A total of 13 studies reporting 13 prospective trials (9 randomized, 5 nonrandomized) were included (658 total study participants at weighted mean 3.1 years follow-up, range 1-7.5 years). Reporting and methodological quality was moderate according to mean Coleman (59.4 SD 7.6), Delphi (3.0 SD 2.1), and MINORS (Methodological Index For Non-Randomized Studies) scores (20.2 SD 1.6). There was no evidence of small study or reporting bias. Effect sizes were not correlated with reporting quality, financial conflict of interest, sample size, year of publication, or length of follow-up (P &gt; 0.05). Compared to microfracture, MACT had greater improvement in International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC)-subjective and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Pain Subscale Score (KOOS)-pain scores in randomized studies (P &lt; 0.05).

Thirty knees from 15 Japanese white rabbits were divided into the horizontal (horizontal tears) or wrapping (horizontal tears with wrapping treatment) groups. Horizontal tears were created and wrapped with a sheet scaffold containing polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, and polycaprolactone. The meniscus was stained with Safranin-O\/Fast Green and evaluated with modified Pauli scores at 8, 12, and 16 weeks after implantation (n = 5). Cell morphology was determined with hematoxylin and eosin staining. Mature collagen was confirmed with Picrosirius Red staining. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) for inflammation, Ki-67 for proliferation, and type II collagen for regeneration was performed. Medial femoral cartilage was stained with Safranin-O\/Fast Green and evaluated with the Osteoarthritis Research Society International score at 8 and 16 weeks. The wrapping group had significantly better regeneration than the horizontal group, especially at 16 weeks (P &lt; 0.05). Wrapping treatment induced fibrochondrocyte-like cells at 16 weeks. After wrapping treatment, iNOS was overexpressed at 8 weeks, Ki-67 at 8 and 12 weeks, and type II collagen at 16 weeks. Cartilage degeneration in the wrapping group did not progress significantly compared with that in the horizontal group at 16 weeks (P &lt; 0.05).

Ten subjects with T2DM matched for age, sex, and body mass index with 10 nondiabetic controls. A 3D UTE sequence with 6 echo times was acquired using 3T magnetic resonance imaging of the knee. For UTE T2* analysis, the deep cartilage layer was segmented and analyzed in 5 compartments (patella, medial, and lateral femur and tibia). The ankle brachial index (ABI) was obtained in all subjects. Linear regression analyses were used to assess associations of T2DM and UTE T2* relaxation times and the associations of ABI measurements and UTE measurements. Compared with nondiabetic controls, T2DM subjects had significantly lower mean T2*-UTE in the patella (mean difference 4.87 ms; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-8.65; P = 0.015), the lateral tibia (mean difference 2.26 ms; 95% CI 0.06-4.45; P = 0.045), and the lateral femur (mean difference 4.96 ms; 95% CI 0.19-9.73; P = 0.043).

The retention of the PCM has a significant influence on the metabolic activity of the chondrocytes. This study investigated the influence of 2 hydrogels (hyaluronic acid [HA] and agarose) and 2 media compositions (basal and chondrogenic) on the preservation\/maintenance and acceleration of PCM formation over a 21-day time course. Different combinations of chondrocytes, chondrons, and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were studied. Both hydrogels preserved chondrons PCM from day 1 up to 21-day culture regardless of media composition. Type VI collagen immunostaining of the cultured chondrons appeared both dense and homogenous. The presence of MSCs did not influence this outcome. At day 1, type VI collagen was not present around chondrocytes alone or their co-culture with MSCs. In the HA hydrogel, type VI collagen was located within the PCM after 7 days in both mono- and co-cultures. In the agarose hydrogel, collagen VI was located within the PCM at 7 days (co-cultures) and 14 days (monocultures). In both hydrogel systems, chondrogenic media enhanced the production of key extracellular matrix components in both mono- and co-cultures in comparison to basal media (11.5% and 14% more in glycosaminoglycans and type II collagen for chondrocytes samples at day 21 culture samples, respectively). However, the media types did not enhance type VI collagen synthesis. Altogether, a 3D chondrogenic hydrogel environment is the primary condition for maintenance and acceleration of PCM formation. ","354":"Syndecan-4 plays a critical role in cartilage degradation during osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and localization of syndecan-4 in different OA joint tissues. Syndecan-4 mRNA levels were quantified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in human OA primary cells. Syndecan-4 was localized by immunohistochemistry in knee, hip, or shoulder OA bone\/cartilage biopsies. Syndecan-4 was quantified by immunoassay in chondrocytes culture supernatant and cell fraction. Using immunochemistry, syndecan-4 was observed in chondrocytes clusters in the superficial zone of OA knee, but not in OA hip or shoulder cartilage. No significant difference was detected in syndecan-4 expression level in sclerotic compared with nonsclerotic osteoblasts or in inflamed synoviocytes compared to normal\/reactive ones. Differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes from knee, but not from hip cartilage, expressed more syndecan-4 than nonhypertrophic cells. Using an immunoassay for the extracellular domain of syndecan-4, we found 68% of the syndecan-4 in the culture supernatant of OA chondrocytes culture, suggesting that a large majority of the syndecan-4 is shed and released in the extracellular medium. The shedding rate was not affected by hypertrophic differentiation state of the chondrocytes or their joint origin. Even if chondrocytes clusters are seen in OA knee, hip and shoulder cartilage and hypertrophic differentiation appears in knee and hip OA articular chondrocytes, syndecan-4 synthesis only increased in knee. These findings suggest the presence of biochemical difference between articular cartilage according to their location and that syndecan-4 could be a biochemical marker specific for knee OA.

Chondrocytes under 2D culture were subjected to MTT assay, while chondrocytes under 3D culture were processed for paraffin inclusion and stained by periodic acid Schiff (PAS) to evaluate mean chondrocyte diameter and percentages of cells, nucleus, cytoplasm, well-differentiated matrix, and PAS+ areas. The expression of gene transcripts for aggrecan, Sox9, and type II collagen was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. There was no difference between groups by the MTT assay. PAS staining revealed that chondrocytes treated with 0.5% v\/v ethanol had higher percentages of cytoplasm and nuclear areas, but with a reduction in PAS+ matrix area. The mean diameter of chondrocytes was similar between groups. The expression of aggrecan in the group treated with 0.5% v\/v ethanol was lower in comparison to that in the control. In the groups treated with 0.25% v\/v and 0.5% v\/v ethanol, the percentage of differentiated cartilage was lower in comparison with that in the control. The group treated with 0.05% v\/v ethanol was similar to the control in all parameters.

Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies scoring system. Study demographics, surgical technique, imaging findings, patient-reported outcomes, complications, failures, and reoperations were collected. Fourteen studies with 98 patients (100 shoulders) met the inclusion criteria. Patient ages ranged from 7 to 74 years. The nonarthroplasty surgical techniques utilized included microfracture (67 shoulders), osteochondral transplantation (28 shoulders), chondrocyte transplantation (4 shoulders), and internal fixation (1 shoulder). The rates of radiographic union and progression of osteoarthritis ranged between 90% to 100% and 57% to 100%, respectively. Visual analog scores ranged from 0 to 1.9 at final follow-up. Mean postoperative ASES (American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons) shoulder scores ranged from 75.8-100. Mean postoperative CSS (Constant Shoulder Score) scores ranged from 83.3-94. Mean postoperative SSV (Subjective Shoulder Value) ranged from 70% to 99%. Failure and reoperation rates ranged between 0% to 35% and 0% to 30%, respectively, with the most common reoperation being conversion to prosthetic arthroplasty. In this systematic review, nonarthroplasty surgical techniques demonstrated acceptable rates of radiographic healing, improved patient reported outcomes, minimal complications, and low rates of failure or reoperation.

Thus, the aim of this study was to introduce the MOCART 2.0 knee score - an incremental update on the original MOCART score - that incorporates this progression. The volume of cartilage defect filling is now assessed in 25% increments, with hypertrophic filling of up to 150% receiving the same scoring as complete repair. Integration now assesses only the integration to neighboring native cartilage, and the severity of surface irregularities is assessed in reference to cartilage repair length rather than depth. The signal intensity of the repair tissue differentiates normal signal, minor abnormal, or severely abnormal signal alterations. The assessment of the variables \"subchondral lamina,\" \"adhesions,\" and \"synovitis\" was removed and the points were reallocated to the new variable \"bony defect or bony overgrowth.\" The variable \"subchondral bone\" was renamed to \"subchondral changes\" and assesses minor and severe edema-like marrow signal, as well as subchondral cysts or osteonecrosis-like signal. Overall, a MOCART 2.0 knee score ranging from 0 to 100 points may be reached. Four independent readers (two expert readers and two radiology residents with limited experience) assessed the 3 T MRI examinations of 24 patients, who had undergone cartilage repair of a femoral cartilage defect using the new MOCART 2.0 knee score. One of the expert readers and both inexperienced readers performed two readings, separated by a four-week interval. For the inexperienced readers, the first reading was based on the evaluation sheet only. For the second reading, a newly introduced atlas was used as an additional reference. Intrarater and interrater reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and weighted kappa statistics. ICCs were interpreted according to Koo and Li; weighted kappa statistics were interpreted according to the criteria of Landis and Koch. The overall intrarater (ICC = 0.88, P &lt; 0.001) as well as the interrater (ICC = 0.84, P &lt; 0.001) reliability of the expert readers was almost perfect.

This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of the intra-articular injection of atelocollagen for the management of knee pain. Two hundred patients with osteoarthritis, chondromalacia, or other cartilage defects were randomly assigned to receive a 3-mL intra-articular injection of atelocollagen (BioCollagen group) or saline (Placebo group). Clinical improvement was evaluated over a 24-week period using the 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). VAS scores were significantly better in the BioCollagen group as compared with the Placebo group at 24 weeks. More patients in the BioCollagen group reported exceeding 20% and 40% VAS improvements. The WOMAC and SF-36 scores were also significantly improved from baseline after the intra-articular injection of atelocollagen; although, the differences between the BioCollagen and Placebo groups were not significant. There were no unexpected or severe adverse events reported for either group. The results show that an intra-articular injection of atelocollagen effectively alleviates knee pain, as intended.

In parallel assays, the trilineage capability was confirmed by calcium deposition during osteogenesis by alizarin S staining and alkaline phosphatase staining. Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), mRNA levels of ALP, RUNX2, and BGLAP were assessed after 21 days of osteoinduction. Lipid droplets were stained with oil red O and adipogenic differentiation was confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis of PPARG and LPL gene expression. Under conditions promoting the chondrogenic signature in self-assembling constructs, CPs formed an aligned extracellular matrix, positive for glycosaminoglycans and collagen type II, showing developing zonation of birefringent collagen fibers along the cross section of pellets, which reflect the distribution of collagen fibers in hyaline cartilage. Induced osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation confirmed the trilineage potential of CPs.

In order to further investigate the effects of statins in endochondral ossification, this study examined the influence of statins on Indian hedgehog (Ihh), another important component of endochondral ossification, and its related pathways. The chondrocyte cell line ATDC5 was used to investigate changes in cell proliferation, mRNA, and protein expression levels. In addition, an organ culture of a mouse metatarsal bone was performed followed by hematoxylin-eosin staining and fluorescent immunostaining. Results indicated that expression level of Ihh increased with the addition of statins, which activated the Ihh pathway and altered the localization of Ihh. Changes in cholesterol modification may have affected Ihh diffusibility; however, further experiments are necessary. A reactive increase in parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was observed in addition to changes in the Wnt pathway through secreted-related protein 2\/3 and low-density lipoprotein 5\/6. This led to the promotion of cell proliferation, increase of the hypertrophic chondrocyte layer, inhibition of apoptosis, and decrease in mineralization.

Using needle-based introduction of the OCT probe, the articular surface of the TMC joint of 5 cadaver wrists was scanned in different probe positions with matching CT scans to record the intraarticular probe trajectory. Subsequently and based on the acquired CT data, 3-dimensional realignment of the OCT data to the curved intraarticular trajectory was performed for all probe positions. The scanned TMC joints were processed using a cryomicrotome imaging system. Finally, cartilage thickness measurements between OCT and cryomicrotome data were compared. Successful visualization of TMC articular cartilage was performed using OCT. The CT-mediated registration yielded a digital reconstruction of the articular surface on which thickness measurements could be performed. A near-perfect agreement between OCT and cryomicrotome thickness measurements was found (r2 = 0.989).

According to these studies NSAIDs have no detrimental effect on healthy mature chondrocytes; however, these drugs influence chondrocyte differentiation and graft incorporation and therefore may interfere with chondrogenesis and incorporation after transplantation of chondrocytes or osteochondral grafts. The use of NSAIDs, systemic or local, after cartilage repair procedures should be avoided unless a substantial clinical benefit would otherwise be withheld from the patient. More human studies are needed to analyze the effect of NSAIDs on cartilage repair. ","372":"The paediatric knee is prone to pure chondral shear-off lesions due to the developing osteochondral unit. Refixation of the chondral fragment is commonly done using metalwork or absorbable biomaterials. Both fixation methods come with biomaterial-related drawbacks. Earlier work on chondral allografts for cartilage repair in adults has shown successful osteochondral integration when the chondral allograft is treated with multiple incisions and then glued to the subchondral bone using fibrin glue. This is commonly referred to as the \"hedgehog technique.\" This study investigates the feasibility of a modification of the hedgehog technique in autologous cartilage to repair shear-off lesions in children. Three consecutive patients (aged 11, 12, and 14 years) with shear-off chondral fragments of 2, 5, and 8 cm2 were treated using this modified hedgehog technique. The calcified side of the chondral fragments were multiply incised and trimmed obliquely for an interlocking fit in the defect site. Fibrin glue and, if indicated sutures, were applied to fix the fragment to the defect. In 1 patient, an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) repair was also performed. Patients were evaluated clinically and by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) up to 12 months postoperatively. Twelve months after surgery, all patients reported no pain and showed complete return to sport and full range of motion. MRI showed no signs of fragment loosening. The modified hedgehog technique is a feasible treatment option to repair pure chondral shear-off lesions in the paediatric knee. This was the first time this technique was used in autografting. ","373":"Because of poor regenerative capabilities of cartilage, reconstruction of similar rigidity and flexibility is difficult, challenging, and restricted. The aim of the present investigation was to develop cost-effective acellular xenogeneic biomaterial as cartilage substitution. Two novel biometrics have been developed using different chemical processes (Na-deoxycholate + SDS and GndHCl + NaOH) to decellularize caprine (goat) ear cartilage and further extensively characterized before preclinical investigation. Complete cell removal was ascertained by hematoxylin and eosin staining followed by DNA estimation. No adverse effect on extracellular matrix (ECM) was found by quantifying collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAG) content as well as collagen, sGAG and elastin staining. Results showed no drastic changes in ECM structure apart from desired sGAG loss. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed cellular loss and unaltered orientation. Nano-indentation study on cartilage matrices indicated interesting output showing better results among decellularized groups. Increased elastic modulus and hardness indicated better stiffness and more active energy dissipation mechanism due to decellularization. Fluid uptake and retention property remained unchanged after decellularization as analyzed by swelling behavior study. Additionally, acellular materials were confirmed to be nonreactive and nonhemolytic as assessed by in vitro hemocompatibility study. In vivo study (up to 3 months) on rabbits showed no symptoms of graft rejection\/ tissue necrosis, established through postoperative histology and biochemical analyses of tissue explants. With regard to size, shape, biomechanics, source of origin and nonimmunogenic properties, these developed materials can play versatile role in biomedical\/ clinical applications and pave a new insight as alternatives in cartilage reconstruction.","374":"The purpose of this systematic review is to determine (1) current reported treatment options for isolated tibial plateau (TP) cartilage lesions, (2) patient reported outcomes following various treatments, and (3) complication rate and survivorship following various treatments. A literature search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL was conducted adhering to PRISMA guidelines. Patients were included if they had TP cartilage lesions treated with surgery. Lesion characteristics, surgical procedure details, patient reported outcomes, complication, and failure rates were collected. Thirteen studies yielded 205 knees with TP cartilage lesions treated surgically. Ages ranged from 12 to 77 years. Surgical techniques included 138 treated with osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA), 37 treated with osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS), 11 treated with microfracture, 11 treated with an osteochondral scaffold, and 8 treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). The patient-reported outcome measures were heterogeneous, but all reported improvements with the notable exception of one study evaluating microfracture. The rate of complications ranged from 0% to 4.6%. Failure rate ranged from 22% to 46% for OCA and 0% to 16% for OATS. No failures were reported for the additional techniques. Various surgical techniques have been utilized for the treatment of TP cartilage lesions. Patient-reported outcome measures were heterogeneous, but improvements were reported following all surgical treatments except for microfracture, which resulted in decreased scores at mid-term follow-up. The complication rate was low for all techniques described. However, the failure rate was higher following unicondylar OCA for salvage treatment of posttraumatic deformities.

A literature search of PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and CINHAL was performed using PRISMA guidelines. Patients were included if they had bipolar cartilage lesions of the knee treated surgically. Lesion characteristics, surgical technique, patient-reported outcomes, complication rates, failure rates, and survivorship were recorded. Fourteen studies yielded 301 knees treated surgically. Patient age ranged from 15 to 74 years. Surgical techniques included 138 autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), 156 osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA), and 7 osteochondral autograft transfer system (OATS). Seven studies reported a concomitant procedure rate that ranged from 0% to 88%. Eight studies reported that both reciprocal lesions received surgical treatment, while 6 studies did not specify. Lesion size ranged from 1 to 41 cm2. All reported postoperative improvements in patient-reported outcomes, but the measures were very heterogeneous. There were no major complications and the rate of minor complications ranged from 0% to 50%. Survivorship ranged from 40% to 100% for OCA, 76% to 95% for ACI, and 100% for the 1 study evaluating OATS. Bipolar cartilage lesions of the knee typically involve a large surface area and are most commonly treated with ACI or OCA, while OATS may be an option for smaller lesions. Improvements in mid-term patient-reported outcomes were reported for all surgical procedures and they can be performed safely with a low rate of major complications.

To review the added value of SPECT\/CT in the diagnostic algorithm of knee osteoarthritis. Systematic review. A systematic search was carried out in the databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane collaboration. The retrieved articles were screened for relevance on title and abstract. This was followed by a full-text study quality appraisal of the remaining articles. Finally, a total of 9 trials were included. The use of SPECT\/CT might objectify some clinical knee osteoarthritis symptoms. It could correlate with findings on plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, there is some evidence SPECT\/CT gives additional information compared with these imaging modalities; however, superiority is not proven. The uptake on SPECT could predict the intraoperative macroscopic findings. Yet the clinical relevance remains unclear. There is no strong evidence SPECT\/CT should play a role in the diagnosing and decision-making processes of knee osteoarthritis. Yet there is evidence suggesting SPECT\/CT might give additional information in the diagnosing process. More research would be of added value to answer this research question. ","377":"One of the most pressing issues in osteoarthritis (OA) research is the development of disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs), as currently there are no such drugs available. The paucity of suitable DMOADs is mostly due to the lack of approved ideal therapeutic targets necessary for the development of these drugs. However, based on recent discoveries from our laboratory and other independent laboratories, it is indicated that a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase for collagen type II, discoidin domain receptor 2 (DDR2), may be an ideal therapeutic target for the development of DMOADs. In this article, we review the current status of research in understanding roles of DDR2 in the development of OA.","378":"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a global public health problem and a leading cause of morbidity and disability. Due to lack of sensitive and specific tools for early OA diagnosis and predicting prognosis, the availability of new reliable and sensitive biomarkers is a widely appreciated need to identify patients at risk for incident disease or disease progression. Accordingly, our study was conducted to validate the usefulness of disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS5) and follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL1) to achieve this goal. Fifty-four male Wistar rats were randomized into 3 groups; 24 rats were subjected to medial meniscal tear (MMT) surgery on the right knee joint (OA group), 24 rats were subjected to sham surgery (sham group), and 6 healthy rats (negative control group). Six animals from each group were sacrificed every 2 weeks. At each time point, the right knee joint of each animal was visualized radiologically, a blood sample was collected, and cartilage tissues were isolated for histopathological and western blot analysis. We found that the expression levels of ADAMTS5 and FSTL1 significantly increased with OA progression, especially at weeks 4, 6, and 8 after surgery. Notably, the serum levels of ADAMTS5 and FSTL1 showed significant positive correlations with each other and with the studied inflammatory markers. Our findings suggest that ADAMTS5 and FSTL1 can serve as important and informative serological markers of disease activity in OA. However, further research is needed to validate their use for improving the diagnosis and prognosis of OA in humans.

OCD is seen in patients with open growth plates (juvenile OCD [JOCD] and in adults [AOCD] with closed growth plates [adult OCD). The etiology at smaller joints remains as unclear as for the knee. Mechanical factors (throwing activities [capitulum] seem to play an important role. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Thus, imaging techniques are most important for the diagnosis. In low-grade and stable lesions, treatment involves rest and different degrees of immobilization until healing. When surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the OCD stage and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures are favorable while with damaged cartilage, several techniques are used. Techniques such as drilling and microfracturing produce a reparative cartilage while other techniques reconstruct the defect with osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte implantation. There is a tendency toward better results when reconstructive procedures for both the bone and cartilage are used. In addition, comorbidities at the joint have to be treated.

Nonathletes were more likely to smoke (P &lt; 0.001) and had higher BMI (P = 0.005). Duration of symptoms prior to surgery was shorter among athletes (P &lt; 0.001). Grade 4 defects were equally prevalent (P = 0.96) as were multicompartment grade 3-4 lesions (P = 0.12). Mean grade 3-4 defect size was similar in lateral (P = 0.96) and medial compartments (P = 0.82). There was a trend toward larger anterior compartment defects in nonathletes (P = 0.07). Among age-matched athletes and nonathletes with symptomatic cartilage defects who meet demographic criteria for cartilage restoration, nonathletes were more likely to smoke and have a longer duration of symptoms prior to treatment. Athletes tended to present earlier but with similar size defects compared to nonathletes, supporting accelerated treatment of defects in athletes and caution toward allowing continued athletic participation in patients with known cartilage defects.

Flow cytometry and single-cell RT-qPCR (reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction) was used to validate the results of the RNA sequencing data Polyclonal chondrocyte populations from the same donor were differentiated in vitro toward the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. There was considerable variation in gene expression between individual cells, but we found no evidence for separate cell subpopulations based on principal component, hierarchical clustering, and differential gene expression analysis. Most of the cells expressed all the markers defining mesenchymal stem cells, and as polyclonal chondrocyte populations from the same donor were shown to differentiate into osteocytes and adipocytes in vitro, these cells formally qualify as mesenchymal stem cells. In vitro expanded chondrocytes consist of one single population of cells with heterogeneity in gene expression between the cells.

It is considered that intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection may improve the function of synovial joints by recovery of friction-reducing properties of articular environment. Thirty-five patients with knee osteoarthritis (grade II according to the Kellgren-Lawrence system) and 50 asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the study. Patients were analyzed at 3 time points: 1 day before and 2 weeks and 4 weeks after single injection of 1.5% cross-linked hyaluronate. Control subjects were tested once. The vibroarthrographic signals were collected during knee flexion\/extension motion using an accelerator and described by variation of mean square (VMS), mean range (R5), and power spectral density for frequency of 50 to 250 Hz (P1), and 250 to 450 Hz (P2). Patients before viscosupplementation were characterized by about 2-fold higher values of vibroarthrographic parameters than controls. Two weeks after the procedure, the values of R5, P1, and P2 significantly decreased, in comparison to pre-injection. At 4 weeks post-injection, we noted a significant increase in R5, P1, and P2 values, when compared to 2 weeks post-injection. Finally, at 4 weeks post-injection, the level of VMS, R5, and P2 parameters did not differ from values obtained at pre-injection. We showed that viscosupplementation may be effective in providing arthrokinematics improvement, but with a relatively short period of duration. This phenomenon is observed as decreased vibroacoustic emission, which reflects a more smooth movement in the joint.

Hexagon-pored HOI scaffolds were seeded with chondrocytes (cells), and tissue-engineered cartilage biocompatibility, potency, efficacy, and shelf-life in vitro was assessed by morphological, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) analysis. Osteochondral defect was created in the weight-bearing area of medial femoral condyle for in vivo study. Polymerized fibrin was added to every defect of 5 experimental groups. Cartilage repair was analyzed after 6 months using macroscopical (Oswestry Arthroscopy Score [OAS]), histological, and electromechanical quantitative potential (QP) scores. Collagen scaffold (CS) was used as a positive comparator for in vitro and in vivo studies. Type II collagen gene upregulation and protein secretion was maintained up to 8 days in seeded HOI. In vivo analysis revealed improvement in all scaffold treatment groups. For the first time, electromechanical properties of a cellular-based scaffold were analyzed in a preclinical study. Cell addition did not enhance OAS but improved histological and QP scores in HOI groups.

All cartilage samples were collected from human donors, including young group, aged group, and OA group. Primary chondrocytes were isolated and cultured with Sirt1 activator or inhibitor. Sirt1 expression in cartilage tissue and chondrocytes was evaluated, and the deacetylation activity of Sirt1 was determined. The alteration of autophagy activity after upregulating or downregulating Sirt1 was detected. Chondrocytes were treated with autophagy activator and inhibitor, and then the protein level of Sirt1 was examined. The interactions between Sirt1 and autophagy-related proteins Atg7, microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3), and Beclin-1 were determined by using immunoprecipitation. The assay of articular cartilage revealed that the expression of Sirt1 might be age-related: highly expressed in of younger people, and respectively decreased in the elderly people and OA patients. In vitro study was also validated this result. Further study confirmed that higher levels of Sirt1 significantly increased autophagy in aged chondrocytes, while the lower expression of Sirt1 reduced autophagy in young chondrocytes. Of note, the high levels of Sirt1 reduced autophagy in OA chondrocytes. When the chondrocytes were treated with autophagy activator or inhibitor, we found the expression of Sirt1 was not affected. In addition, we found that Sirt1 could interact with Atg7. These results suggest that Sirt1 in human chondrocytes regulates autophagy by interacting with autophagy related Atg7, and Sirt1 may become a more important target in OA treatment.

In contrast, Mexican axolotl salamanders have demonstrated the remarkable ability to spontaneously and completely repair large joint cartilage lesions, a healing process that involves interzone cells in the intraarticular space. Furthermore, interzone tissue transplanted into skeletal defects in the axolotl salamander demonstrates a multi-differentiation potential. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of this repair process remain unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether paracrine mitogenic signals are an important variable in the interaction between interzone cells and the skeletal microenvironment. The paracrine regulation of the proliferation of equine interzone cells was evaluated in an in vitro co-culture system. Cell viability and proliferation were measured in equine fetal interzone cells after exposure to conditioned medium from skeletal and nonskeletal primary cell lines. Steady-state expression was determined for genes encoding 37 putative mitogens secreted by cells that generated the conditioned medium. All experimental groups of conditioned media elicited a mitogenic response in interzone cells. Fetal anlage chondrocytes (P &lt; 0.0001) and dermal fibroblasts (P &lt; 0.0001) conditioned medium showed a significantly higher mitogenic potential compared with interzone cells. Conditioned medium from bone marrow-derived cells elicited a significantly higher proliferative response relative to that from young adult articular chondrocytes (P &lt; 0.0001) or dermal fibroblasts (P &lt; 0.0001).

A full-text review was then used to evaluate details regarding study methodology and reporting on the following variables: primary cartilage repair procedure, and the utilization of concomitant procedures to address additional patient comorbidities, including malalignment, meniscus pathology, and ligamentous instability. Each study was additionally reviewed to document variation in clinical outcomes reporting in patients that had these comorbidities addressed at the time of surgery. All studies reported on the type of primary cartilage repair procedure, with autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) noted in 43% of studies, microfracture (MF) reported in 16.5%, osteochondral allograft (OCA) in 15%, and osteochondral autograft transplant (OAT) in 8.2%. Regarding concomitant pathology, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (24.8%) and meniscus repair (23.3%) were the most commonly addressed patient comorbidities. A total of 56 studies (42.1%) excluded patients with malalignment, meniscus injury, and ligamentous instability.

A total of 80 knee OA patients and 80 healthy controls were recruited. Glypican-3 levels in plasma and synovial fluid were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The severity of knee OA was assessed by radiographic grading according to the Kellgren-Lawrence classification.

High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is associated with chemoattractant and proinflammatory effects in various pathological processes. Here, we investigate the migratory effects of HMGB1 in knee OA and CPCs for the first time. Immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting, and immunocytochemistry were performed to identify HMGB1 and its receptors, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in OA knee tissue, chondrocytes, and CPCs. In situ hybridization for HMGB1 mRNA was performed in CPCs ex vivo. The chemoattractant effects of HMGB1 on CPCs were analyzed in cell migration assays. HMGB1 expression in OA tissue and OA chondrocytes was higher than in healthy specimens and cells. HMGB1, RAGE, and TLR4 were expressed in CPCs and chondrocytes. In situ hybridization revealed HMGB1 mRNA in CPCs after migration into OA knee tissue, and immunohistochemistry confirmed HMGB1 expression at the protein level. Stimulation via HMGB1 significantly increased the migration of CPCs. Our results show the chemoattractant role of HMGB1 in knee OA.

Revision to OCA after prior failed cartilage repair has shown similar clinical outcomes as primary OCA; however, most of the failed procedures were arthroscopic procedures for smaller defects. There is no literature investigating the clinical outcomes after OCA for prior failed autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) for the treatment of large chondral defects of the knee. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine clinical outcomes of patients undergoing revision to OCA after prior failed ACI as compared with a matched cohort of patients undergoing OCA as a primary cartilage repair procedure (primary OCA). In this review of prospectively collected data, we analyzed data from 26 patients with at least 2 years follow-up. Thirteen patients who underwent revision to OCA after prior failed ACI by a single surgeon were compared with a matched group of patients who underwent primary OCA. The patients were matched per age, gender, body mass index, and defect size. Patient-reported outcomes, reoperations, and survival rates were compared between groups. There were no significant differences in patient-reported clinical outcome scores between the groups at final follow-up. Moreover, there was no significant difference in reoperation rates and survival rates between the groups.

For the in vivo experiments, sixteen 10-week-old mice were divided into 2 groups: (1) I-PTH (n = 8)-subcutaneous daily injection of PTH; (2) control group (n = 8)-subcutaneous daily injection of saline solution. Experiments were carried out for 4 weeks. Mice were injected with calcein, alizarin complexone, and cell proliferation marker before euthanasia. For the in vitro experiments, primary chondrocyte cultures from the MCC of eight 10-week-old mice were treated with I-PTH for 14 days. There was a significant increase in bone volume, tissue density, mineral deposition, osteoclastic activity, cell proliferation in the cartilage, and cartilage thickness in the I-PTH-treated mice when compared with the control group. In addition, immunohistochemistry in cartilage revealed that I-PTH administration led to an increase in expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and to a decreased expression of sclerostin, matrix metallopeptidase 13, and aggreganase-1 (ADAM-TS4). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of the I-PTH-treated chondrocytes revealed significantly decreased relative expression of collagen type X (Col10a1), alkaline phosphatase (Alp), and Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) and remarkable increased expression of Sox9, fibroblast growth factor 2 (Fgf2), and proteoglycan 4 (Prg4). I-PTH administration causes anabolic effects at the subchondral region of the mandibular condyle while triggers anabolic and protective effects at the MCC. ","403":"Despite the general awareness that cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) is crucial for endochondral ossification, the role of COX-2 in skeletal development is largely unknown. We hypothesized that inhibition or genetic loss of COX-2 leads to impaired growth plate development and consequently impaired postnatal development of the long bones. Skeletally immature (5 weeks old) B6;129S-Ptgs2tm1Jed\/J wildtype mice were treated for 10 weeks with celecoxib (daily oral administration 10 mg\/kg) or placebo and compared with B6;129S-Ptgs2tm1Jed\/J homozygous knockout mice (n = 12 per group). Fifteen weeks postnatally, no significant difference in growth plate (zone) thickness was found between groups. However, significantly higher proteoglycan content and lower expression levels of collagen type II and X staining in the growth plates of celecoxib-treated mice, and to a lesser extent in COX-2 knockout mice. In addition, a significantly decreased cell number and cell size were observed in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plates of both experimental groups. Micro-computed tomography analysis of the subchondral bone region directly beneath the growth plate showed significantly higher bone density and trabecular thickness, following celecoxib treatment. Despite the detected differences in growth plate extracellular matrix composition and subchondral bone morphology, no difference was found in the length of the tibia in celecoxib-treated mice or COX-2 knockout mice. Genetic loss of COX-2 or treatment with celecoxib did not result in detectable differences in gross murine formation of the tibia or femur. However, there were notable phenotypic features detected in the maturation of the growth plate (hypertrophic zone and subchondral bone) as a result of the celecoxib treatment.

The purpose of this investigation is to develop an accurate and reproducible algorithm for sizing tibial plateau allografts based on recipient radiographs. A cadaveric study was performed in which radiographs of 10 fresh frozen cadaveric knees were compared to measured digital photographs of the disarticulated specimens. By comparing the average distance between standard anatomical landmarks on the radiographs to the gross specimens, a correlation factor was calculated that could be applied to recipient radiograph measurements for more accurate sizing of tibial plateau allografts. In the coronal plane there were no differences between the mean radiographic and mean morphologic measurements of either the medial or lateral tibial plateau. However, in the sagittal plane the anatomic specimens of the medial and lateral plateau were 90% and 80%, respectively, of the measurements made from the lateral radiograph. This cadaveric investigation is the first to propose a sizing algorithm for tibial plateau osteochondral allografts. Based on the results, an anteroposterior radiograph can reliably measure the width of both the medial and lateral tibial plateau without any correction needed. The average morphological lengths of the medial and lateral tibial plateau, on the other hand, were found to be 90% and 80%, respectively, of the radiographically measured lengths. Without correction, this would lead to the implantation of oversized grafts that may contribute to early failure. ","407":"RNA isolation is necessary for the evaluation of gene expression. Due to the nature of its extracellular matrix, RNA isolation from articular hyaline cartilage is difficult and thus the tissue is commonly enzymatically digested in order to extract RNA from the obtained chondrocytes. We hypothesized that the digestion process affects the expression levels of common cartilage-associated genes. Expression of cartilage-associated genes was compared between intact cartilage and digested chondrocytes from weight bearing and non-weight bearing regions of the equine fetlock joint. The gene expression of SOX9, COL1A2, COL2A1, ACAN, and COLX were analyzed. Digested cartilage showed a significant decrease in the expression of COL1A2, COL2A1, and ACAN compared to intact cartilage in both joint regions, and an increase in COLX expression in non-weight bearing cartilage only. Enzymatic digestion of cartilage significantly impacts gene expression profile. We conclude that while RNA isolation from intact cartilage is more technically difficult, determination of gene expression should be conducted on intact cartilage if true representation of the in vivo processes is sought.

The independent relationship between sporting activity or competitive level and cartilage defect location, size, severity, and symptom chronicity were assessed by multivariate regression analysis. Full-thickness defects were present in 24% of competitive athletes and 31% of recreational athletes (P = 0.21). There was a trend toward an independent association with competitive level and high-grade (3 or 4) multicompartment disease (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.99, 95% confidence interval 0.84-18.8; P = 0.08) or isolated anterior compartment defects (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 0.86-4.62, P = 0.10) but not isolated medial or lateral defects.

In our study, BM and BMAC (processed using the Harvest, SmartPrep2 system and reactivated with batroxibin) when combined with BST-CarGel produced a product that had similar clot contraction, macroscopic properties, and histological appearance to standard BSTCarGel mixed with blood. Mononucleated cells from the BMAC were retained within the scaffold and remained viable until clot dissolution in vitro. By combining BST-CarGel with BMAC in the manner described, bone marrow-derived mononucleated cells can be retained within the chondral defect potentially negating the need for microfracture.

A total of 15 bovine patellae were obtained for this study. Paired samples of tissue were collected from the lateral region of each patella. If the patella contained a site of degeneration, a paired tissue set involved taking one sample each from the degenerated site and the intact tissue adjacent to it. Sufficient tissue was collected to facilitate 2 arms of investigation: microstructural imaging and proteome analysis. The microstructural analysis used a bespoke tissue preparation technique imaged with differential interference contrast optical microscopy to assess fibrillar scale destructuring and underlying bone spicule formation. An iTRAQ-based proteome analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify the differential levels of proteins across the intact and degenerated cartilage and further, the results were validated with multiple reaction monitoring assay. In the healthy cartilage pairs, there was no significant variation in protein profiles between 2 adjacent sample sites. In pairs of tissue that contained a sample of GI\/GII tissue, there were both significant microstructural changes as well as the difference in abundance levels of 24 proteins. From the known functions of the 24 proteins, found to be strongly aligned with the specific microstructural changes observed, a unique \"proteins ensemble\" involved in the initiation and progression of early cartilage degeneration is proposed.

Bioinformatic analysis, gene mutation, dual luciferase reporter gene assays and gene expression assays at both the mRNA and protein levels in human chondrocytes were subsequently performed to validate the interaction between miR-497 and the IHH gene. The mRNA expression of miR-497 or the Ihh gene in BMG-ECO rats showed significant differences between the cartilage development stages and between different time points, and the trends in the expression of miR-497 and Ihh were reversed. Bioinformatic and dual luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrated a direct interaction between miR-497 and the IHH gene. Differential mRNA and protein expression profiles of the IHH gene in human chondrocytes after 48 hours of transfection with miR-497 mimics and a negative control indicated that miR-497 inhibited IHH expression.

A total of 171 patients that underwent ACI were included to validate the ORKA-1 as all factors needed for calculation and outcomes were recorded. For Cox regression analysis, 154 patients were included as they completed preoperative Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Tegner, Lysholm, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), and 12-item Shor Form (SF-12) scores. Patient- and lesion-associated parameters were recorded for each patient.

With ACI failure as endpoint, the mean survival was 7.96 years in risk group 1 and 5.4 years in risk group 5. Cox regression analysis identified preoperative KOOS Sport\/Recreation as the only significant predictive factor for ACI failure (P = 0.007). The ORKA-1 is a helpful tool for surgeons to estimate an individual patient's likelihood of ACI survival.

Seventeen patients (18 knees) with unstable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions involving the knee were treated with a hybrid fixation technique in which the salvageable fragment was fixed and osteochondral autograft transplantation system (OATS) was used for the unsalvageable fragment. Thirteen lesions involved the medial femoral condyle, 4 involved the lateral femoral condyle, and 1 involved the patella. Mean patient age was 17 years (range 12-28 years). All lesions were International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grade III or IV. The patients were prospectively followed postoperatively. Outcome measures included the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), and the Tegner activity scale. At mean follow-up of 36 months (range 24-67.2 months), the mean postoperative KOOS scores, given as mean (SD), were as follows: Quality of Life (QoL) 91.1 (17.0), Activities of Daily Living (ADL) 99.5 (1.5), Sport 94.5 (11.2), Pain 97.4 (5.8), and Symptoms 95.9 (6.5). Mean IKDC score was 96.2 (7.0). There was no significant difference between mean preinjury (7.95, SD = 1.1) and mean postoperative (7.45, SD = 1.5) Tegner scores (P = 0.363). The mean Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) score was 87.5 at a mean 7.8 months (range 3-18 months) postoperation. There were no reported complications.

Eleven sheep received 1 intra-articular injection of hyaluronate 3 months after OA induction and another group of 11 received saline. A linear mixed model was used to define the trajectory of shape change in the medial joint compartment. Ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate the association between morphological changes and sclerosis. Three months after meniscal destabilization there were early bipolar chondral lesions in the medial compartment of the knee, as well as osteophytes and bone remodeling. Superficial fissures and cartilage cracks progressed to discrete areas of cartilage thinning and fibrillation on the medial tibial plateau by 6 months that became cartilage erosions by nine months. A linear mixed effect model demonstrated significant change in medial compartment length and width with over time (P &lt; 0.05) for both groups. A significant association between severity of sclerosis and medial compartment morphology was also observed.

However, rats may be a poor aging model for mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) based on laboratory reports of a severe decline in chondrogenesis beyond young adulthood. Such testing has not been conducted with MSCs seeded in a scaffold, which can improve the propensity of MSCs to undergo chondrogenesis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate chondrogenesis of middle-aged rat MSCs encapsulated in agarose. MSCs from 14- to 15-month-old rats were expanded, seeded into agarose, and cultured in chondrogenic medium with or without 5% serum for 15 days. Samples were evaluated for cell viability and cartilaginous extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation. Experiments were repeated using MSCs from 6-week-old rats. During expansion, middle-aged rat MSCs demonstrated a diminishing proliferation rate that was improved ~2-fold in part by transient exposure to chondrogenic medium. In agarose culture in defined medium, middle-aged rat MSCs accumulated ECM to a much greater extent than negative controls. Serum supplementation improved cell survival ~2-fold, and increased ECM accumulation ~3-fold. Histological analysis indicated that defined medium supported chondrogenesis in a subset of cells, while serum-supplementation increased the frequency of chondrogenic cells. In contrast, young rat MSCs experienced robust chondrogenesis in defined medium that was not improved with serum-supplementation. These data demonstrate a previously-unreported propensity of middle-aged rat MSCs to undergo chondrogenesis, and the potential of serum to enhance chondrogenesis of aging MSCs.

Seventy-two subjects with knee OA and 30 control participants were recruited. Circulating and joint fluid Hsp70 values were quantified by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Circulating Hsp70 was markedly higher in knee OA patients compared with that of healthy volunteers (P = 0.01). Correspondingly, synovial fluid Hsp70 was 3-fold greater than paired circulating Hsp70 samples (P &lt; 0.001).

A systematic review of the literature was performed on the PubMed and Cochrane databases on October 2017 by 2 independent authors and included all levels of evidence. This included all English language literature, pertaining specifically to etiopathology of knee OCD with exclusions for review articles and expert opinion. Of 965 identified records, 154 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 86 studies met the inclusion criteria. According to these studies, the etiology of OCD can be of a biological or mechanical origin: 40 articles proposed a biological hypothesis, including genetic causes (27), ossification center deficit (12), and endocrine disorders (9); conversely, 52 articles supported a mechanical hypothesis, including injury\/overuse (18), tibial spine impingement (5), discoid meniscus (16), and biomechanical alterations (20) as the cause of the onset of OCD. The pathogenic processes were investigated by 36 of these articles, with a focus on subchondral bone fracture and ischemia as the ultimate events leading to OCD. Biological and mechanical factors are found to result in subchondral bone remodeling alterations, acting independently or more likely synergically in the progression of knee OCD. The former includes genetic causes, deficit of ossification centers and endocrine disorders; the latter, tibial spine impingement, discoid meniscus, and biomechanical alterations, together with injuries and overuse.

AC plugs (N = 72) were harvested from the patellofemoral groove of juvenile bovine stifle joints, a LWB region, and femoral condyles, a HWB region. Near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) fiber optic spectra were collected from plugs, and indentation tests were performed to determine the short-term and equilibrium moduli, followed by gravimetric water and biochemical analysis. LWB tissues had a significantly greater amount of water determined by NIR and gravimetric assay. The moduli generally increased in tissues from the patellofemoral groove to the condyles, with HWB condyle cartilage having significantly higher moduli. A greater amount of proteoglycan content was also found in HWB tissues, but no differences in collagen content. In addition, NIR-determined water correlated with short-term modulus and proteoglycan content (R = -0.40 and -0.31, respectively), and a multivariate model with NIR data was able to predict short-term modulus within 15% error.

The effects of CCL5 on bovine AF cells in vitro were tested by transwell assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Fibrin gel containing CCL5 was used to treat annulotomized bovine caudal discs cultured under dynamic loading conditions. After 14 days of loading, the samples were collected for histological examination. A pilot animal study was performed using sheep cervical discs to investigate the effect of fibrin gel encapsulated with CCL5 for the treatment of ruptured AF. After 14 weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and the discs were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging before histopathological examination. CCL5 showed a chemotactic effect on AF cells in a dose-dependent manner. AF cells cultured with CCL5 in vitro did not show any change of the gene expression of CCL5 receptors, catabolic and proinflammatory markers. In vitro release study showed that CCL5 exhibited sustained release from the fibrin gel into the culture media; however, in the organ culture study CCL5 did not stimulate homing of AF cells toward the defect sites. The pilot animal study did not show any repair effect of CCL5. CCL5 has a chemotactic effect on AF cells in vitro, but no ex vivo or in vivo regenerative effect when delivered within fibrin gel.

Chondrocyte cultures were transferred to a HBO chamber and exposed to 100% oxygen for 7 consecutive days. Within groups, pressure was varied between 1 and 2 atm and duration of HBO administration was varied among 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Cell counts were performed using the WST-1 assay at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after initiation of HBO treatment to obtain data to plot a growth curve. Gene expression of apoptosis markers PARP and caspase 3, as well as cartilage specific proteins collagen II and COMP, were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The experiments showed that in vitro administration of HBO inhibit chondrocyte growth. When applied compression was increased up to 2 atm, chondrocyte cell count was reduced by half at days 3 and 7 in association with an upregulation of the apoptosis markers PARP and caspase 3 as well as the cartilage specific proteins collagen II and COMP. No significant differences were monitored from varied duration of daily treatment. Chondrocyte growth was inhibited in vitro by treatment of HBO. This inhibitory effect was even increased by elevating the applied pressure, while molecular testing showed reduced chondrocyte growth. Higher levels of HBO inhibited cell growth even more, but up-regulation of apoptosis specific markers and cartilage specific proteins were seen during administration of high oxygen levels. Thus, it has to be evaluated that there is a critical level of hypo-\/hyperoxia required to stimulate or at least maintain chondrocyte cell proliferation. ","488":"Staining with toluidine blue is a well-established procedure for the histological assessment of cartilaginous- and chondrogenic-differentiated tissues. Being a cationic dye, toluidine blue staining visualizes proteoglycans in a tissue because of its high affinity for the sulfate groups in proteoglycans. It is generally accepted that metachromatic staining with toluidine blue represents cartilaginous matrix and that the degree of positive staining corresponds with the amount of proteoglycans. Articular cartilage and pellets of chondrocytes or bone marrow stromal cells were analyzed with a standardized staining procedure for toluidine blue. In the present study, we illustrate why such an assumption is invalid unless a detailed description of the procedure and\/or reference to a detailed published method are provided. This is because the staining specificity and intensity depend, as we have shown, on the pH of the staining solution, the use of dehydration, and on staining time. We can, therefore, suggest a well-controlled standardized protocol for toluidine blue staining, which provides an easy and simple selective staining technique for the assessment of cartilage tissue and proteoglycan development in chondrogenic differentiation. If this procedure is not used, then investigators must provide sufficient technical information concerning the staining protocol to allow an assessment of the validity of the staining results.

A total of 143 elderly primary knee OA patients and 135 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) was performed to evaluate the clinical severity. The radiographic severity was assessed by Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grading. Plasma and synovial fluid (SF) eotaxin-1 levels were explored using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The SF levels of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were also examined. Elevated plasma eotaxin-1 levels were found in knee OA patients compared with healthy controls. Eotaxin-1 levels in SF of knee OA patients with K-L grade 4 were significantly elevated compared with those with K-L grades 2 and 3. Meanwhile, knee OA patients with K-L grade 3 had significantly increased SF levels of eotaxin-1 compared with those with K-L grade 2. Plasma eotaxin-1 levels in different K-L grading did not reach significant difference. Eotaxin-1 levels in SF of knee OA patients were significantly associated with disease severity evaluated by KL grading criteria. In addition, eotaxin-1 levels in SF were positively related to clinical severity illustrated by WOMAC as well as biochemical markers MMP-3 and IL-6. Eotaxin-1 levels in SF instead of plasma, were independently and positively related to the disease severity in elderly knee OA patients.

Our study aims to evaluate the feasibility of T2 mapping for the detection of subtle changes in the intervertebral discs in spines after kyphoplasty. Intervertebral discs were assessed by quantitative MRI (3.0 T) using T2 relaxation time mapping. Region of interest (ROI; 6 per disc) analyses were performed. The ROIs at the anterior and posterior edges were interpreted as annulus fibrosus (AF). The 2 very inner zones were regarded as nucleus pulposus (NP) and the regions in between as intermediate transition zone. We compared T2 relaxation time values of intervertebral discs adjacent to the vertebrae after kyphoplasty with those nonadjacent to vertebrae after kyphoplasty, especially in the NP. The analysis of the ROIs showed that the intervertebral discs of the adjacent vertebral segments are associated with reduced T2 values compared to those that are nonadjacent to the affected vertebrae. This study is to our knowledge the first investigation of intervertebral discs after kyphoplasty by quantitative MRI. Quantitative T2 mapping shows increased degeneration in adjacent intervertebral discs following kyphoplasty. Besides its contribution to a broader knowledge of postoperative changes after kyphoplasty, our findings may help to improve differentiation between healthy and degenerated intervertebral discs using these techniques.

The aim of this study was to examine effects of these various anesthetics on the viability of human chondrocytes. Our hypothesis was that all local anesthetics tested damage human chondrocytes in vitro. Primary human chondrocytes were isolated and cultured from 6 donated human knee joints (mean age of donors 61.2 years). Local anesthetics were added to these cultures. Toxicity analysis was performed by visualization of cell structure using light microscopy. Determination of vital chondrocytes was performed by use of a Casy cell counter. Chondrocytes' cell death was examined by fluorescence microscopy and an XTT ELISA assay. Light microscope and fluorescence microscope data revealed a defect cell structure and increased number of dead cells after addition of 1% or 2% lidocaine and bupivacaine but not ropivacaine. We were able to show an increased level of XTT activity after treatment with bupivacaine, 2% lidocaine or ropivacaine. The count of vital chondrocytes was significantly decreased after treatment with bupivacaine, 1% or 2% lidocaine, and ropivacaine. The data show that treatment with local anesthetics induces cell damage of human chondrocytes in vitro. Ropivacaine seems to be a local anesthetic with the lowest toxic potential on human chondrocytes, a feature that may favor its preference for use in joint injection.

Of 1688 identified records, 55 full-text articles were screened: 27 studies met the inclusion criteria, for a total of 908 knees, and were used for the analysis. No high-level studies were found: 24 articles were case series and 3 case reports, reporting on different treatments summarized in (1) restriction of physical activity, (2) physiokinesitherapy and muscle-strengthening exercises, (3) physical instrumental therapies, (4) limitation of weightbearing, and (5) immobilization. The analysis showed an overall healing rate of 61.4%, with large variability (10.4%-95.8%). A conservative treatment based on restriction of sport and strenuous activities seems a favorable approach, possibly combined with physiokinesitherapy. Negative prognostic factors were also identified: larger lesion size, more severe lesion stages, older age and skeletal maturity, discoid meniscus, and clinical presentation with swelling or locking. The literature on conservative treatments for knee OCD is scarce. Among different non-surgical treatment options, strenuous activity restriction seems a favorable approach, whereas there is no evidence that physical instrumental therapy, immobilization, or weightbearing limitation could be beneficial.

Thus, the mechanisms underlying this disorder, such as specific skeletal tissue DNA methylation patterns, may be evolutionary conserved. However, associations between methylation and OA have not been readily studied in nonhuman animals. Baboons serve as important models of disease and develop OA at rates similar to those in humans. Therefore, this study investigated the associations between methylation and OA in baboons to advance the evolutionary understanding of OA. Trabecular bone and cartilage was collected from the medial condyles of adult female baboon femora, 5 with and 5 without knee OA. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array) was used to identify DNA methylation patterns in these tissues. Approximately 44% of the 450K array probes reliably align to the baboon genome, contain a CpG site of interest, and maintain a wide distribution throughout the genome. Of the 2 filtering methods tested, both identified significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between healthy and OA individuals in cartilage tissues, and some of these patterns overlap with those previously identified in humans. Conversely, no DMPs were found between tissue types or between disease states in bone tissues. Overall, the 450K array can be used to measure genome-wide DNA methylation in baboon tissues and identify significant associations with complex traits. The results of this study indicate that some DNA methylation patterns associated with OA are evolutionarily conserved, while others are not.

Common nonoperative treatment options include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular corticosteroids, and intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid (HA). HA is found intrinsically within the knee joint providing viscoelastic properties to the synovial fluid. HA therapy provides anti-inflammatory relief through a number of different pathways, including the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the published literature on the anti-inflammatory properties of hyaluronic acid in osteoarthritis. Included articles were categorized based on the primary anti-inflammatory responses described within them, by the immediate cell surface receptor protein assessed within the article, or based on the primary theme of the article. Key findings aimed to describe the macromolecules and inflammatory-mediated responses associated with the cell transmembrane receptors. Forty-eight articles were included in this systematic review that focused on the general anti-inflammatory effects of HA in knee OA, mediated through receptor-binding relationships with cluster determinant 44 (CD44), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) and 4 (TLR-4), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and layilin (LAYN) cell surface receptors. Higher molecular weight HA (HMWHA) promotes anti-inflammatory responses, whereas short HA oligosaccharides produce inflammatory reactions.

Fib3-3 was also associated with an increased histological total joint degeneration (r = 0.435) and cartilage degeneration (r = 0.435). Immunostainings demonstrated increased Fib3-3 in the superficial cartilage of animals with high-fat diet and\/or cartilage damage. In the rat groove model combined with high-fat diet-induced metabolic dysregulation an increased Fib3-3 concentration was observed systemically, which is associated with local joint degeneration.

As OA is partially mechanically driven, the relation between these MRI-based parameters and localized mechanical loading during walking was investigated. MR images were acquired in 14 healthy adults and cartilage thickness and T1rho and T2 relaxation times were determined. Experimental gait data was collected and processed using musculoskeletal modeling to identify weight-bearing zones and estimate the contact force impulse during gait. Variation of the cartilage properties (i.e., thickness, T1rho, and T2) over the femoral cartilage was analyzed and compared between the weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing zone of the medial and lateral condyle as well as the trochlea. Medial condyle cartilage thickness was correlated to the contact force impulse ( r = 0.78). Lower T1rho, indicating increased proteoglycan content, was found in the medial weight-bearing zone. T2 was higher in all weight-bearing zones compared with the non-weight-bearing zones, indicating lower relative collagen content.

Design A less adhesive culture surface, non-tissue culture treated surface (NTC), was tested for its suitability for culturing chondrocytes. The cell expansion and the expression of chondrocyte markers were monitored for at least 2 passages on NTC in comparison with conventional tissue culture treated polystyrene surface (TCP). The ability of expanded chondrocytes to form cartilage tissues was evaluated using pellet culturing and subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Results NTC supported bovine chondrocyte proliferation to a clinically relevant expansion requirement within 2 passages. Chondrocyte phenotypes were better maintained when cultured on NTC than on TCP. In vitro pellet culture studies showed that chondrocytes expanded on NTC expressed a higher level of chondrocyte extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the cells expanded on NTC or TCP were implanted subcutaneously as pellets in nude mice for 6 weeks. The recovered pellets showed cartilage-like tissue formation from cells expanded on NTC but not from the cells expanded on TCP.

Regressions were performed to evaluate the relationship between preoperative and postoperative measures and evolution of WOMAC\/good outcome. Results We observed an almost systematic improvement of all parameters for up to 12 months, but especially at the 3-month follow-up. The low number of comorbidities and the absence of postoperative complications were the common determinants of improvement of WOMAC total score after 12 months. Other parameters (background of the joint, preoperative function and length of hospital stay in KA group; place of discharge in HA group) affected the evolution of WOMAC scores. 87.09% of HA and 73.06% of KA patients experienced a good outcome. A small number of comorbidities, a worse preoperative function, a shortened hospital stay (KA only), and an absence of early postoperative complications (HA only) significantly predicted a good outcome.

All studies demonstrated significant improvement in reported clinical outcome scores at follow-up after MFX+ therapy, and 87% of patients reported satisfaction with treatment. The most commonly reported treatment complication was postoperative stiffness (3.9% of patients). Subjective synthesis on randomized controlled trials demonstrated that 2\/2 injectable MFX+ interventions had significantly greater improvements in International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC; P = 0.004) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS; P = 0.012) scores compared with MFX alone, while 2\/2 trials on scaffolding MFX+ adjuvants showed comparable postoperative improvements. Conclusions MFX+ biological adjuvants are safe supplements to marrow stimulation for treating cartilage defects in the adult knee. Early literature is heterogenous and extremely limited in quality. Individual trials report both equivalent and superior clinical outcomes compared with MFX alone, making definitive conclusions on the efficacy of MFX+ difficult without higher quality evidence.","520":"Objective Focal chondral defects alter joint mechanics and cause pain and debilitation. Microfracture is a surgical technique used to treat such defects. This technique involves penetration of subchondral bone to release progenitor cells and growth factors from the marrow to promote cartilage regeneration. Often this results in fibrocartilage formation rather than structured hyaline cartilage. Some reports have suggested use of growth hormone (GH) with microfracture to augment cartilage regeneration. Our objective was to test whether intra-articular (IA) GH in conjunction with microfracture, improves cartilage repair in a rabbit chondral defect model. We hypothesized that GH would exhibit a dose-dependent improvement in regeneration. Design Sixteen New Zealand white rabbits received bilateral femoral chondral defects and standardized microfracture repair. One group of animals ( n = 8) received low-dose GH by IA injection in the left knee, and the other group ( n = 8) received high-dose GH in the same manner. All animals received IA injection of saline in the contralateral knee as control. Serum assays, macroscopic grading, and histological analyses were used to assess any improvements in cartilage repair. Results Peripheral serum GH was not elevated postoperatively ( P = 0.21). There was no improvement in macroscopic grading scores among either of the GH dosages ( P = 0.83). Scoring of safranin-O-stained sections showed no improvement in cartilage regeneration and some evidence of increased bone formation in the GH-treated knees. Conclusions Treatment with either low- or high-dose IA GH does not appear to enhance short-term repair in a rabbit chondral defect model.","521":"Objective The aim of this study was to unravel the mechanisms by which thyroxine affects skeletal growth by evaluating proliferative activity and angiogenic profile of growth cartilage of neonatal and weanling rats. Methods Sixteen adult Wistar rats were equally divided into 2 groups: control and treated with thyroxine during pregnancy and lactation. The weight, measurement of plasma free T4 and thyroids, femurs' histomorphometric analysis, and proliferative activity and angiogenic profile by immunohistochemical or real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in growth cartilage was performed. Data were analyzed using Student's t test. Results The free T4 was significantly higher in the treated rats. However, the height of the follicular epithelium of the thyroid in newborns was significantly lower in the treated group. The excess maternal thyroxine significantly reduced the body weight and length of the femur in the offspring but significantly increased the thickness of trabecular bone and changed the height of the zones of the growth plate. Furthermore, excess maternal thyroxine reduced cell proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the growth cartilage of newborn and 20-day-old rats ( P &lt; 0.05). There was also a reduction in the immunohistochemical expression of Tie2 in the cartilaginous epiphysis of the newborns and FLK-1 in the articular cartilage of 20-day-old rats. No significant difference was observed in Ang2 expression. Conclusions The excess maternal thyroxine during pregnancy and lactation reduced endochondral bone growth in the progeny and reduced the proliferation rate and VEGF, Flk-1, and Tie2 expression in the cartilage of growing rats without altering the mRNA expression of Ang1 and Ang2.","522":null,"523":"Objective Autophagy was reported to be essential for maintaining chondrocyte function, and reduced autophagy leads to osteoarthritis (OA). Previous studies showed involvement of heat shock stress in the control of autophagy in cells. This study sought to investigate the effect of hyperthermia on the expression of autophagy-related proteins in articular cartilage and the progression of naturally occurring OA in Hartley guinea pigs. Design Radiofrequency pulses of 13.56 MHz were applied to the animals' knees for 20 minutes to induce hyperthermia. The knee joints were resected at 8 hours, 24 hours, 72 hours, 7 days, and 6 months after hyperthermia. Serial sections of knees were examined for histopathological changes. The expression levels of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and Beclin1 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results Analysis of the distribution of positive cells showed that, in cases of moderate OA, ULK1 and Beclin1 expression levels were significantly decreased in the superficial zone (SZ) and middle zone (MZ) ( P &lt; 0.01) compared with normal cartilage. Seven days after exposure to radiofrequency waves, expression levels of ULK1 and Beclin1 were augmented in the SZ in animals with mild OA. The severity of cartilage degradation was significantly reduced ( P &lt; 0.01) in the radiofrequency-treated knees versus the untreated knees. Conclusions This study showed that heat stimulation enhanced autophagy in healthy knee chondrocytes and chondrocytes in knees with mild OA. The study also showed that long-term periodic application of hyperthermia suppresses aging-related progression of OA. The activation of autophagy by radiofrequency hyperthermia may be an effective therapeutic approach for osteoarthritis.","524":"Objective Summarize the biologic effects of Supartz FX for knee osteoarthritis (OA), the first worldwide clinically approved intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic acid (HA) product. Design To determine the mechanism of action from preclinical and clinical studies, a literature search was conducted of Supartz FX using academic databases from 1987 to 2016. Articles on Supartz FX that deal with its mechanisms of action were extracted, categorized, and reviewed. Results Supartz FX has 2 potential mechanisms of action: (1) biomechanical: IA Supartz FX directly improves the viscoelasticity and lubrication of synovial fluid; (2) physiologic: IA Supartz FX penetrates synovium and cartilage tissues to reach HA receptors on the surface of synoviocytes and chondrocytes. In synovium, suppression of gene expression in inflammatory mediators results in improved endogenous HA production, improved properties of synovial fluid, and reduction in pain. In cartilage, suppression of gene expression of collagenases and aggrecanases suppresses cartilage degeneration. Conclusion The net results of basic and clinical studies is that IA Supartz FX provides a more favorable biomechanical and functional environment in the knee joint. Hence, it is not only a lubricant but is also physiologically active. These actions may help explain both short- and long-term improvement in pain and function often achieved from IA Supartz FX in knee OA.","525":"The objective of this study was to characterize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and correlate with clinical results in patients who underwent autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) of osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLT). Twenty-four grafts were evaluated at a mean 65.8 months after ACI for OLT. MRI was performed on a 1.5-T GE scanner using multiple sequences. Graft appearance was compared with preoperative MRI and evaluated for 6 criteria: defect fill, surface regularity, signal pattern, bone marrow edema, subchondral plate irregularity, and presence of cystic lesions. Clinical outcome was measured with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) clinical outcome score. Of 24 grafts, 22 (92%) demonstrated &gt;75% defect fill. Eighteen (75%) had a mildly irregular and 6 (25%) had a moderately irregular articular surface. The signal pattern of the repair tissue was heterogenous in 23 (96%); 14 (58%) layered and 9 (38%) mottled. Fourteen grafts (58%) showed decreased amount of bone marrow edema while 4 (17%) had no change and 5 (21%) had an increase in the amount of bone marrow edema. The subchondral bone plate was abnormal in most grafts, with focal defects seen in 10, slight depression in 7, and both in 5. Seven had an increase in cystic lesions while the others had no change, decrease or no cysts seen. Mean postoperative AOFAS score was 87.5 with mean improvement of 39.4. At 66-month mean follow-up, MRI appearance of the ACI grafts show imaging abnormalities but demonstrate good clinical results. While MRI is an important tool in the postoperative assessment of ACI grafts, the various variations from a normal\/nonoperative ankle must be interpreted with caution. ","526":"Objective To investigate the association of cartilage defect severity, as determined by the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) grading with indentation stiffness and T2 relaxation time of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a biomarker for the integrity of articular cartilage. Design Twenty-one patients scheduled for arthroscopic were included in the study. Prior to arthroscopy, subjects underwent quantitative MRI of articular cartilage, namely T2 relaxation time mapping at 1.5 T. Within 2 months, subjects underwent arthroscopy, which also included ICRS grading and measurement of arthroscopic indentation stiffness. Arthroscopic evaluations and T2 mapping at anterior, central, and posterior medial and lateral femoral condyles were correlated using a colocalization scheme. Differences in Young's modulus, as derived by indentation tests, and T2 times between ICRS grades were analyzed using Mann-Whitney's U or Kruskal-Wallis H tests. The correlation between modulus and T2 times was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results Modulus and T2 showed significant topographical variation. In the anterior region of interest (ROI) on the medial condyle the modulus showed a negative association with ICRS grade ( P = 0.040) and the T2 times were longer in ICRS grade 2 compared with grades 0 and 1 ( P = 0.047). Similar, but nonsignificant associations were found in the central ROI on the medial condyle. No significant correlations were observed between the indentation modulus and T2 times. Conclusions Cartilage degeneration is identified both with mechanical indentation and T2 mapping in MRI. However, in this study, indentation stiffness and T2 relaxation time in vivo, were not associated.","527":"Objective Gender is a risk factor in the onset of osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of the study was to investigate gender differences in contact area (CA) and congruity index (CI) in the medial tibiofemoral (MTF) joint in 2 different cohorts, quantified automatically from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Design The CA and CI markers were validated on 2 different data sets from Center for Clinical and Basic Research (CCBR) and Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). The CCBR cohort consisted of 159 subjects and the OAI subcohort consisted of 1,436 subjects. From the MTF joint, the contact area was located and quantified using Euclidean distance transform. Furthermore, the CI was quantified over the contact area by assessing agreement of the first- and second-order general surface features. Then, the gender differences between CA and CI values were evaluated at different stages of radiographic OA. Results Female CAs were significantly higher than male CAs after normalization, male CIs were significantly higher than female CIs after correcting with age and body mass index ( P &lt; 0.05), consistent across the 2 data sets. For the OAI data set, the gender differences were present at all stages of radiographic OA. Conclusion This study demonstrated the gender differences in CA and CI in MTF joints. The higher normalized CA and lower CI values in female knees may be linked with the increased risk of incidence of radiographic OA in females. These differences may help further understand the gender differences and\/or to establish gender specific treatment strategies.","528":null,"529":"Objective. Loss of disc height is commonly associated with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) exercise for the lumbar extensors is recommended to treat CLBP and is suggested such exercise might promote disc healing and regeneration. This study examined a 12-week ILEX intervention on indirect determination of disc height and shrinkage through seated stadiometry, strength, pain, and disability. Design. A quasi-experimental wait-list controlled design was used. Nine participants underwent pretesting (T1), a 12-week control period, retesting (T2), a 12-week intervention period, and finally posttesting (T3). Seated stadiometry, ILEX strength, pain, and disability were measured at each time point. Results. No significant repeated-measures effects for any seated stadiometry variables occurred. Significant improvement across the intervention period (T2 to T3) was found for strength (P &lt;0.0001; effect size [ES] = 2.42). Change in pain was not significant for repeated effects (P = 0.064); however, ES for the intervention period (T2 to T3) was moderate (ES = -0.77). Change in disability was significant between time point T1 and T3 (P = 0.037) and ES for the intervention period (T2 to T3) was large (ES = -0.92). Pain and disability achieved minimal clinically important changes. Conclusions. This is apparently the first study to examine disc change in vivo after exercise in CLBP. Results of the present study, though supporting ILEX resistance training to improve strength, pain, and disability, did not find any effect on spinal height.","530":"Introduction Autologous osteochondral transplantation (AOT) is a treatment for osteochondral lesions with known concerns, including histological degradation of the graft and poor cartilage integration. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) have been described has having the potential to improve results. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PRP and HA on AOT in a rabbit model. Methods Thirty-six rabbits underwent bilateral knee AOT treated with either the biological adjunct (PRP, n = 12; HA, n = 12; PRP + HA, n = 12) or saline (control). PRP and HA were administered as an intra-articular injection. The rabbits were euthanized at 3, 6, or 12 weeks postoperatively. The graft sections were assessed using the modified International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) scoring system. The results from the PRP alone group is from previously published data. Results The mean modified ICRS histological score for the PRP-treated group was higher than its control ( P = 0.002). The mean modified ICRS histological score for the HA-treated group showed no difference compared with its control ( P = 0.142). The mean modified ICRS histological score for the PRP + HA-treated group was higher than its control ( P = 0.006). There was no difference between the mean modified ICRS scores of the PRP- and the PRP + HA-treated grafts ( P = 0.445). Conclusion PRP may decrease graft degradation and improve chondral integration in an animal model. In this model, the addition of HA was not synergistic for the parameters assessed. Basic science, Level V. PRP can be used as an adjunct to AOT, which may decrease graft degeneration and improve clinical outcomes. HA may not influence AOT. ","531":"Bone marrow stimulation procedures initiate repair by fracturing or drilling subchondral bone at base of cartilaginous defect. Earlier studies have shown that defect location and animal age affect cartilage repair outcome, suggesting a strong influence of structural and biological characteristics of subchondral bone. Here, we analyzed comprehensive biological characteristics of bone marrow progenitor cells (BMPCs) in subchondral bone of young and old rabbit condyle and trochlea. We tested the hypothesis that in vitro biological properties of BMPCs are influenced by location, age of donor and method of their isolation. In vitro biological properties, including cell yield, colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-f), surface marker expression, and differentiation potential were determined. Comparisons were carried out between trochlea versus condyle and epiphyseal versus metaphyseal bone using old ( N = 5) and young animal knees ( N = 8) to generate collagenase and explant-derived BMPC cultures. CFU-f, cell yield, expression of stem cell markers, and osteogenic differentiation were significantly superior for younger animals. Trochlear subchondral bone yielded the most progenitors with the highest clonogenic potential and cartilaginous matrix expression. Trochlear collagenase-derived BMPCs had higher clonogenic capacity than explant-derived ones. Epiphyseal cells generated a larger chondrogenic pellet mass than metaphyseal-derived BMPCs. All older pellet cultures and one non-responder young rabbit failed to accumulate glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Taken together, these results suggest that properties intrinsic to subchondral progenitors could significantly influence cartilage repair potential, and could partly explain variability in cartilage repair outcomes using same cartilage repair approach.

A total of 1832 articles were reviewed by 2 independent authors and additional literature found through scanning references of cited articles. Results BMAC has demonstrated promising results in the clinical application for repair of chondral defects as an adjuvant procedure or as an independent management technique. A subcomponent of BMAC, bone marrow derived-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess the ability to differentiate into cells important for osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Modulation of paracrine signaling is perhaps the most important function of BM-MSCs in this setting. In an effort to increase the cellular yield, authors have shown the ability to expand BM-MSCs in culture while maintaining phenotype. Conclusions Translational studies have demonstrated good clinical efficacy of BMAC both concomitant with cartilage restoration procedures, at defined time points after surgery, and as isolated injections. Early clinical data suggests BMAC may help stimulate a more robust hyaline cartilage repair tissue response. Numerous questions remain regarding BMAC usage, including cell source, cell expansion, optimal pathology, and injection timing and quantity.","539":"Background Viscosupplementation (VS) is a symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Although systematic reviews of its repeat use showed favorable benefit\/risk ratio, no study has focused on the indication of retreatment. Methods A task force was created to look at issues regarding retreatment with VS in knee osteoarthritis. An attempt was made to reach consensus on several issues: (1) to define treatment \"success\" and \"failure,\" (2) to determine when to retreat patients successfully treated by a previous VS, (3) to determine how to retreat patients in whom VS failed, (4) to define what to do in case of adverse reaction following previous VS, and (5) to examine the interests of soluble biomarkers to manage retreatment. After debate and review of literature the working group voted on 88 issues. Two \"decision trees\" were built based on the results of the votes. Results In case of failure, the authors draw attention to the need of a rigorous clinical and radiological analysis, and consider evidence-based medicine. When VS was previously successful, retreatment can be considered after recurrence or increase in pain. However, in subjects with high risk of disease progression, in young patients, and in professional sportsmen, retreatment could be considered systematically, because of the probability of hyaluronic acid to slow osteoarthritis progression. Evidence on soluble biomarkers was not considered as enough strong to support their use as decision tools for patient retreatment. Conclusion The decision algorithms are intended to facilitate consideration of the therapeutic options, in patients with knee osteoarthritis previously treated with VS.","540":"Objective To evaluate the presence and localization of folate receptor expressing macrophages in the rat groove model of osteoarthritis and determine the suitability of a new folate conjugate with albumin-binding entity (cm09) for in vivo SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) analysis. Design In male Wistar rats, local cartilage damage was induced in addition to a standard ( n = 10) or high-fat diet ( n = 6). After 12 weeks, 111In labeled folate conjugates were administered, and SPECT\/CT (computed tomography) imaging was performed after 24 hours. Subsequently, osteoarthritis severity and folate receptor expression were assessed using (immuno)-histological sections. Results In vivo SPECT\/CT imaging of the new folate conjugate (cm09) was as useful as a folate conjugate without albumin-binding entity in the groove model of osteoarthritis with less renal accumulation. Induction of cartilage damage on a standard diet resulted in no effect on the amount of folate receptor expressing macrophages compared with the contralateral sham operated joints. In contrast, inducing cartilage damage in the high-fat diet group resulted in 28.4% increase of folate receptor expression as compared with the nondamaged control joints. Folate receptor expressing cells were predominantly present in the synovial lining and in subchondral bone as confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions Folate receptor expression, and thus macrophage activation, can clearly be demonstrated in vivo, in small animal models of osteoarthritis using the new 111In-folate conjugate with specific binding to the folate receptor. Increased macrophage activity only plays a role in the groove model of osteoarthritis when applied in a high-fat diet induced dysmetabolic condition, which is in line with the higher inflammatory state of that specific model.","541":"Introduction Articular cartilage is made up of hyaline tissue embodying chondrocytes, which arise from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and specialized extracellular matrix. Despite possessing resident progenitors in and around the joint primed for chondrogenesis, cartilage has limited intrinsic capacity of repair and cell turnover. Advances in isolation, culture, and characterization of these progenitors have raised the possibility for their use in cell-based cartilage repair. Chondroprogenitors (CPCs) have been classified as MSCs and have been postulated to play a vital role in injury response and are identified by their colony forming ability, proliferative potential, telomere dynamics, multipotency, and expression of stem cell markers. The combined presence of CPCs and chondrocytes within the same tissue compartments and the ability of chondrocytes to dedifferentiate and acquire stemness during culture expansion has obscured our ability to define and provide clear-cut differences between these 2 cell populations. Objective This review aims to evaluate and summarize the available literature on CPCs in terms of their origin, growth kinetics, molecular characteristics, and differential and therapeutic potential with emphasis on their difference from daughter chondrocytes. Design For this systematic review, a comprehensive electronic search was performed on PubMed and Google Scholar using relevant terms such as chondrocytes, chondroprogenitors, and surface marker expression. Results and Conclusion Our comparative analysis shows that there is an ill-defined distinction between CPCs and chondrocytes with respect to their cell surface expression (MSC markers and CPC-specific markers) and differentiation potential. Accumulating evidence indicates that the 2 subpopulations may be distinguished based on their growth kinetics and chondrogenic marker.","542":null,"543":null,"544":null,"545":"Objective The aim of this study was to investigate whether the concentration of the anionic contrast agent ioxaglate, as quantitated by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) using a clinical cone-beam CT (CBCT) instrument, reflects biochemical, histological, and biomechanical characteristics of articular cartilage imaged in an ex vivo, intact human knee joint. Design An osteoarthritic human cadaveric knee joint (91 years old) was injected with ioxaglate (36 mg I\/mL) and imaged using CBCT over 61 hours of ioxaglate diffusion into cartilage. Following imaging, the joint surfaces were excised, rinsed to remove contrast agent, and compressive stiffness (equilibrium and instantaneous compressive moduli) was measured via indentation testing ( n = 17 sites). Each site was sectioned for histology and assessed for glycosaminoglycan content using digital densitometry of Safranin-O stained sections, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy for collagen content, and morphology using both the Mankin and OARSI semiquantitative scoring systems. Water content was determined using mass change after lyophilization. Results CECT attenuation at all imaging time points, including those &lt;1 hour of ioxaglate exposure, correlated significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) with cartilage water and glycosaminoglycan contents, Mankin score, and both equilibrium and instantaneous compressive moduli. Early time points (&lt;30 minutes) also correlated ( P &lt; 0.05) with collagen content and OARSI score. Differences in cartilage quality between intrajoint regions were distinguishable at diffusion equilibrium and after brief ioxaglate exposure. Conclusions CECT with ioxaglate affords biochemical and biomechanical measurements of cartilage health and performance even after short, clinically relevant exposure times, and may be useful in the clinic as a means for detecting early signs of cartilage pathology.","546":"Background Many i n vitro damage models investigate progression of cartilage degradation after a supraphysiologic, compressive impact at the surface and do not model shear-induced damage processes. Models also neglect the response to uninterrupted tribological stress after damage. It was hypothesized that shear-induced removal of the superficial zone would accelerate matrix degradation when damage was followed by continued load and articulation. Methods Bovine cartilage underwent a 5-day test. Shear-damaged samples experienced 2 days of damage induction with articulation against polyethylene and then continued articulation against cartilage (CoC), articulation against metal (MoC), or rest as free-swelling control (FSC). Surface-intact samples were randomized to CoC, MoC, or FSC for the entire 5-day test. Samples were evaluated for chondrocyte viability, GAG (glycosaminoglycan) release (matrix wear surrogate), and histological integrity. Results Shear induction wore away the superficial zone. Damaged samples began continued articulation with collagen matrix disruption and increased cell death compared to intact samples. In spite of the damaged surface, these samples did not exhibit higher GAG release than intact samples articulating against the same counterface ( P = 0.782), contrary to our hypothesis. Differences in GAG release were found to be due to tribological testing against metal ( P = 0.003). Conclusion Shear-induced damage lowers chondrocyte viability and affects extracellular matrix integrity. Continued motion of either cartilage or metal against damaged surfaces did not increase wear compared with intact samples. We conjecture that favorable reorganization of the surface collagen fibers during articulation protected the underlying matrix. This finding suggests a potential window for clinical interventions to slow matrix degradation after traumatic incidents.","547":null,"548":"Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting techniques can be used for the fabrication of personalized, regenerative constructs for tissue repair. The current article provides insight into the potential and opportunities of 3D bioprinting for the fabrication of cartilage regenerative constructs. Although 3D printing is already used in the orthopedic clinic, the shift toward 3D bioprinting has not yet occurred. We believe that this shift will provide an important step forward in the field of cartilage regeneration. Three-dimensional bioprinting techniques allow incorporation of cells and biological cues during the manufacturing process, to generate biologically active implants. The outer shape of the construct can be personalized based on clinical images of the patient's defect. Additionally, by printing with multiple bio-inks, osteochondral or zonally organized constructs can be generated. Relevant mechanical properties can be obtained by hybrid printing with thermoplastic polymers and hydrogels, as well as by the incorporation of electrospun meshes in hydrogels. Finally, bioprinting techniques contribute to the automation of the implant production process, reducing the infection risk. To prompt the shift from nonliving implants toward living 3D bioprinted cartilage constructs in the clinic, some challenges need to be addressed. The bio-inks and required cartilage construct architecture need to be further optimized. The bio-ink and printing process need to meet the sterility requirements for implantation. Finally, standards are essential to ensure a reproducible quality of the 3D printed constructs. Once these challenges are addressed, 3D bioprinted living articular cartilage implants may find their way into daily clinical practice.","549":"Objective To evaluate a biphasic cartilage repair device (CRD) for feasibility of arthroscopic implantation, safety, biocompatibility, and efficacy for long-term repair of large osteochondral defects. Methods The CRD was press-fit into defects (10 mm diameter, 10 mm deep) created in the femoral trochlea of 12 horses. In the contralateral limb, 10 mm diameter full-thickness chondral defects were treated with microfracture (MFX). Radiographs were obtained pre- and postoperatively, and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Repeat arthroscopy was performed at 4 and 12 months. Gross assessment, histology, mechanical testing, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed at 24 months. Results The CRD was easily placed arthroscopically. There was no evidence of joint infection, inflammation, or degeneration. CRD-treated defects had significantly more sclerosis compared to MFX early ( P = 0.0006), but was not different at 24 months. CRD had better arthroscopic scores at 4 months compared to MFX ( P = 0.0069). At 24 months, there was no difference in repair tissue on histology or mechanical testing. Based on MRI, CRD repair tissue had less proteoglycan (deep P = 0.027, superficial P = 0.015) and less organized collagen (deep P = 0.028) compared to MFX. Cartilage surrounding MFX defects had more fissures compared to CRD. Conclusion The repair tissue formed after CRD treatment of a large osteochondral lesion is fibrocartilage similar to that formed in simple chondral defects treated with MFX. The CRD can be easily placed arthroscopically, is safe, and biocompatible for 24 months. The CRD results in improved early arthroscopic repair scores and may limit fissure formation in adjacent cartilage.","550":null,"551":null,"552":"Objective To compare the relative effectiveness of intra-articular N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and hyaluronic acid (HA) on pain, function and cartilage degradation markers in patients with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (OA). Design We prospectively conducted a clinical trial with 20 patients having a diagnosis of Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2-3 knee OA, and randomly allocated to the HA or NAC groups. Groups were matched on age, sex, and body mass index. Injections of 3-mL HA (Hylan G-F 20) or 3-mL NAC (Asist ampoule) were administered as a single shot. Functional status and pain were evaluated before and after injection, using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the visual analogue scale (VAS) scores. Pre- and posttreatment concentrations of serum C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid chondroitin-6-sulfate (C-6S), matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3), cross-linked C-terminal telopeptide of type 2 collagen (CTX-II), total oxidant status (TOS), and total antioxidant concentration (TAC) were obtained. Results WOMAC, VAS scores, and CRP levels were comparable between groups prior to treatment. Both HA and NAC produced comparable reductions in TOS and MMP-3. NAC was more effective in reducing C-6S and CTX-II ( P &lt; 0.05). No effects on TAC were noted. Conclusions NAC is effective in lowering some cartilage degradation markers, with comparable outcomes to HA for pain and function. NAC could provide a cheaper alternative to HA for intra-articular injection treatment of mild to moderate knee OA. Future placebo controlled trials are warranted to evaluate effectiveness in a larger patient population with a wider range of age and OA severity.","553":null,"554":"Hyaline cartilage degenerative pathologies induce morphologic and biomechanical changes resulting in cartilage tissue damage. In pursuit of therapeutic options, electrical and mechanical stimulation have been proposed for improving tissue engineering approaches for cartilage repair. The purpose of this review was to highlight the effect of electrical stimulation and mechanical stimuli in chondrocyte behavior. Different information sources and the MEDLINE database were systematically revised to summarize the different contributions for the past 40 years. It has been shown that electric stimulation may increase cell proliferation and stimulate the synthesis of molecules associated with the extracellular matrix of the articular cartilage, such as collagen type II, aggrecan and glycosaminoglycans, while mechanical loads trigger anabolic and catabolic responses in chondrocytes. The biophysical stimuli can increase cell proliferation and stimulate molecules associated with hyaline cartilage extracellular matrix maintenance. ","555":"In this article, we explored the hypothesis that the long noncoding RNA, Nespas, promotes osteoarthritis (OA) by supporting abnormal lipid metabolism in human chondrocytes. Human articular chondrocytes from osteoarthritis patients were used and expression level of Nespas were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Introduction of Nespas and Nespas-associated genes\/miRNAs were performed by using a lentiviral system. The effect of Nespas on mitochondrial function was determined by staining mitochondria and analyzing mitopotential and mitochondrial genes. Moreover, to identify the responsible molecules in Nespas-induced pathogenesis, profiling of peroxisomal genes and miRNAs were applied and interactome analysis was performed. Highly elevated levels of Nespas and Acyl-CoA synthetase 6 (ACSL6) were observed in OA patients. Both Nespas overexpression and ACSL6 upregulation into human chondrocytes induced typical OA characteristics, such as downregulation of type II collagen; upregulation of type I collagen, metalloproteinase 13, and caspase-1 and -3; and dysfunction of mitochondria and peroxisome. Co-expression of Nespas and ACSL6 siRNA reduced caspase-1 and -3 levels. Moreover, Nespas overexpression significantly suppressed levels of miR-291a-3p, -196a-5p, -23a-3p, -24-3p, and let-7a-5p, and these miRs are known to potentially target ACSL6 according to ingenuity pathway analysis. We also confirmed that these miRs were significantly suppressed in human OA chondrocytes.

EP-104IAR is composed of fluticasone propionate drug crystals coated with heat-treated polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to result in extended release properties. Thirty-two Beagle dogs had an injection of EP-104IAR into the knee joint at 2 different dose levels (0.6 mg and 12 mg). Outcome measures included plasma, synovial fluid, and articular cartilage fluticasone propionate concentrations as well as histological analysis of cartilage and synovium at a variety of time points up to 58 days postdosing. Intra-articular administration of 0.6 and 12 mg EP-104IAR was well tolerated. Early minor abnormalities found on microscopy resolved by the end of the study. There were no quantifiable concentrations of fluticasone propionate in plasma of animals administered 0.6 mg at any of the sampling time points. Highest concentrations in plasma following 12 mg administration occurred 1 day postdose and declined with a half-life of approximately 45 days. Highest concentrations of fluticasone propionate in synovial fluid and cartilage generally occurred 5 days postdose in both dose groups and declined with a half-life of approximately 11 to 14 days. EP-104IAR is capable of providing a safe and prolonged local exposure to a corticosteroid in the synovial joint while minimizing systemic exposure, with peak exposures occurring within a matter of days after dosing before declining in all tissues in a predictable manner.

Methods This is the second step in the validation of T2*. In a previous study, we established a quantitative predictive model for identifying and grading acetabular cartilage damage. In this study, the model was applied to a second cohort of 27 consecutive hips to validate the model. A clinical 3.0-T imaging protocol with T2* mapping was used. Acetabular regions of interest (ROI) were identified on magnetic resonance and graded using the previously established model. Each ROI was then graded in a blinded fashion by arthroscopy. Accurate surgical location of ROIs was facilitated with a 2-dimensional map projection of the acetabulum. A total of 459 ROIs were studied. Results When T2* mapping and arthroscopic assessment were compared, 82% of ROIs were within 1 Beck group (of a total 6 possible) and 32% of ROIs were classified identically. Disease prediction based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.713 and a specificity of 0.804. Model stability evaluation required no significant changes to the predictive model produced in the initial study. Conclusions These results validate that T2* mapping provides statistically comparable information regarding acetabular cartilage when compared to arthroscopy. In contrast to arthroscopy, T2* mapping is quantitative, noninvasive, and can be used in follow-up. Unlike research quantitative magnetic resonance protocols, T2* takes little time and does not require a contrast agent. This may facilitate its use in the clinical sphere.","560":"Full-depth cartilage lesions do not heal and the long-term clinical outcome is uncertain. In the symptomatic middle-aged (35-60 years) patient, treatment with metal implants has been proposed. However, the cartilage health surrounding these implants has not been thoroughly studied. Our objective was to evaluate the health of cartilage opposing and adjacent to metal resurfacing implants. The medial femoral condyle was operated in 9 sheep bilaterally. A metallic resurfacing metallic implant was immediately inserted into an artificially created 7.5 mm defect while on the contralateral knee the defect was left untreated. Euthanasia was performed at 6 months. Six animals, of similar age and study duration, from a previous study were used for comparison in the evaluation of cartilage health adjacent to the implant. Cartilage damage to joint surfaces within the knee, cartilage repair of the defect, and cartilage adjacent to the implant was evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. Six animals available for evaluation of cartilage health within the knee showed a varying degree of cartilage damage with no statistical difference between defects treated with implants or left untreated ( P = 0.51; 95% CI -3.7 to 6.5). The cartilage adjacent to the implant (score 0-14; where 14 indicates no damage) remained healthy in these 6 animals showing promising results (averaged 10.5; range 9-11.5, SD 0.95). Cartilage defects did not heal in any case. Treatment of a critical size focal lesion with a metal implant is a viable alternative treatment. ","561":"The production of extracellular matrix is a necessary component of articular cartilage repair. Gene transfer is a promising method to improve matrix biosynthesis by articular chondrocytes. Gene transfer may employ transgenes encoding regulatory factors that stimulate the production of matrix proteins, or may employ transgenes that encode the proteins themselves. The objective of this study was to determine which of these 2 approaches would be the better choice for further development. We compared these 2 approaches using the transgenes encoding the structural matrix proteins, aggrecan or type II collagen, and the transgene encoding the anabolic factor, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). We transfected adult bovine articular chondrocytes with constructs encoding type II collagen, aggrecan, or IGF-I, and measured the expression of type II collagen ( COL2A1) and aggrecan ( ACAN) from their native genes and from their transgenes. IGF-I gene ( IGF1) transfer increased the expression of the native chondrocyte COL2A1 and ACAN genes 2.4 and 2.9 times control, respectively. COL2A1 gene transfer did not significantly increase COL2A1 transcripts, even when the transgene included the genomic COL2A1 regulatory sequences stimulated by chondrogenic growth factors. In contrast, ACAN gene transfer increased ACAN transcripts up to 3.4 times control levels. IGF1, but not ACAN, gene transfer increased aggrecan protein production. Taken together, these results suggest that the type II collagen and aggrecan production required for articular cartilage repair will be more effectively achieved by genes that encode anabolic regulatory factors than by genes that encode the matrix molecules themselves. ","562":"This article is a review of the current understanding of the etiology, pathogenesis, and how to diagnose and treat knee osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) followed by an analysis of and outcomes of the treatments available. OCD is seen in children and adolescents with open growth plates (juvenile OCD) and adults with closed growth plates (adult OCD). The etiology of OCD lesions remains unclear and is characterized by an aseptic necrosis in the subchondral bone area. Mechanical factors seem to play an important role. Clinical symptoms are unspecific. Thus, imaging techniques are most important. Regarding treatment, a tremendous number of publications exist. Spontaneous healing is expected unless there is an unstable fragment, and treatment involves rest and different degrees of immobilization until healing. Patients with open physes and low-grade lesions have good results with conservative therapy. When surgery is necessary, the procedure depends on the stage and on the state of the cartilage. With intact cartilage, retrograde procedures are favorable. When the cartilage is damaged, several techniques can be used. While techniques such as drilling and microfracturing produce reparative cartilage, other techniques reconstruct the defect with additional osteochondral grafts or cell-based procedures such as chondrocyte transplantation. There is a tendency toward better results when using procedures that reconstruct the bone and the cartilage and there is also a trend toward better long-term results when comorbidities are treated. Severe grades of osteoarthrosis are rare.","563":"The objective of this study was to describe the mechanism of healing of osteochondral defects of the distal femur in the sheep, a commonly used translational model. Information on the healing mechanism be useful to inform the design of tissue engineering devices for joint surface defect repair. A retrospective study was conducted examining 7-mm diameter osteochondral defects made in the distal medial femoral condyle of 40 adult female sheep, comprising control animals from 3 separate structures. The healing of the defects was studied at post mortem at up to 26 weeks. Osteochondral defects of the distal femur of the sheep heal through endochondral ossification as evidenced by chondrocyte hypertrophy and type X collagen expression. Neocartilage is first formed adjacent to damaged cartilage and then streams over the damaged underlying bone before filling the defect from the base upward. No intramembranous ossification or isolated mesenchymal stem cell aggregates were detected in the healing tissue. No osseous hypertrophy was detected in the defects. Osteochondral defects of the medial femoral condyle of the sheep heal via endochondral ossification, with neocartilage first appearing adjacent to damaged cartilage. Unlike the mechanism of healing in fracture repair, neocartilage is eventually formed directly onto damaged bone. There was most variability between animals between 8 and 12 weeks postsurgery. These results should be considered when designing devices to promote defect healing. ","564":"Many in vivo procedures to repair chondral defects use ultraviolet (UV)-photoinitiated in situ polymerization within the cartilage matrix. Chemical species that absorb UV light might reduce the effectiveness of these procedures by acting as light absorption barriers. This study evaluated whether any of the individual native biochemical components in cartilage and synovial fluid interfered with the absorption of light by common scaffolding photosensitizers. UV-visible spectroscopy was performed on each major component of cartilage in solution, on bovine synovial fluid, and on four photosensitizers, riboflavin, Irgacure 2959, quinine, and riboflavin-5'-phosphate. Molar extinction and absorption coefficients were calculated at wavelengths of maximum absorbance and 365 nm. Intact articular cartilage was also examined. The individual major biochemical components of cartilage, Irgacure 2959, and quinine did not exhibit a significant absorption at 365 nm. Riboflavin and riboflavin-5'-phosphate were more effectual light absorbers at 365 nm, compared with the individual native species. Intact cartilage absorbed a significantly greater amount of UV light in comparison with the native species. Our results indicate that none of the individual native species in cartilage will interfere with the absorption of UV light at 365 nm by these commonly used photoinitiators. Intact cartilage slices exhibited significant light absorption at 365 nm, while also having distinct absorbance peaks at wavelengths less than 300 nm. Determining the UV absorptive properties of the biomolecules native to articular cartilage and synovial fluid will aid in optimizing scaffolding procedures to ensure sufficient scaffold polymerization at a minimum UV intensity.

Currently, its diagnosis is mainly based on clinical examination and standard radiography. To date, there is no way to detect the disease at a molecular level, before the appearance of structural changes and symptoms. So an attractive alternative for monitoring OA is the measurement of biochemical markers in blood, urine, or synovial fluid, which could reflect metabolic changes in joint tissue and therefore disease onset and progression. Animal models are relevant to investigate the early stage of OA and metabolic changes occurring in joint tissues. The goal of this narrative review is to summarize the scientific data available in the literature on soluble biomarkers in animal models of OA. Design A literature search was conducted using the PubMed\/Medline and Scopus databases between February 1995 and December 2015. All original articles, systematic and narrative reviews published in French or in English were considered.

The increasingly broad and varied use of HA injections, lack of published clinical guidance, and limited coverage for their use has created the imperative to establish appropriateness criteria. The experts of this workgroup represent rheumatology, orthopedic surgery, physiatry, sports medicine, and nursing clinicians with substantive knowledge of intra-articular HA therapy. This workgroup utilized the results of a systematic review of evidence, expert clinical opinion, and current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines to develop appropriateness criteria for the use of intra-articular HA for knee OA in 17 real-world clinical scenarios. The workgroup scored the appropriateness of treatment of each patient scenario using a 9-point scale to designate a treatment as appropriate (7-9), uncertain (4-6), or inappropriate (1-3). Six scenarios were scored as appropriate, 10 scenarios were scored as uncertain, and 1 scenario was scored as inappropriate. This article can assist clinicians in shared decision-making by providing best practices in considering HA injections for knee OA treatment. Moreover, this AUC article can aid payers and policy makers in determining reimbursement and preauthorization policies and more appropriately managing health care resources.

Previously reported surgical treatment options include marrow stimulation, cell-based treatments, and osteochondral transfer. Minced juvenile allograft cartilage is a novel treatment option that allows for a single stage approach for these lesions. Hypothesis Particulated juvenile allograft cartilage (PJAC) for the treatment of chondral defects of the patella would offer acceptable lesion fill rates, mature over time, and not be associated with any negative biologic effects on the surrounding tissue. Methods A retrospective chart review of prospectively collected data was conducted to identify consecutive patients who were treated with PJAC for a full thickness symptomatic cartilage lesion. Qualitative (fast spin echo) and quantitative (T2 mapping) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was undertaken at the 6-, 12-, and 24-month postoperative mark. Numerous patient, lesion, and graft specific factors were assessed against MRI scores and percent defect fill of the graft. Graft maturation over time was also assessed. Results Forty-five patients total were included in the study. Average age at the time of surgery was 26.5 years (range 13-45 years), average lesion size was 208 mm2 (range 4-500 mm2), and average donor age was 49.5 months (range 3-120 months). Sixty percent of the patients were female, while 93% of all patients underwent a concomitant procedure at the time of the index operation. Six-month MRI findings revealed that no patient-, graft-, or donor-specific factors correlated with MR scores, and 82% of the knees demonstrated good to excellent fill. Twelve-month MRI findings revealed that T2 relaxation times of deep graft demonstrated negative correlation with patient age ( P = 0.049) and donor age ( P = 0.006), the integration zone showed a negative correlation with donor age ( P = 0.026). In all, 85% of patients at 12 months displayed good to moderate fill of the graft. At 24 months, patient age demonstrated negative correlation with average T2 relaxation times of the deep and superficial graft ( P = 0.005; P = 0.0029) and positive correlation with the superficial zone of the adjacent cartilage ( P = 0.001). Donor age showed negative correlation with grayscale score ( P = 0.004) and T2 relaxation times at deep integration zone ( P = 0.018). T2 relaxation times of deep and superficial graft and integration zone improved over time ( P &lt; 0.001) and between each time point.

The purpose of this systematic review was to clarify the morphology of SCB following BMS in preclinical, translational animal models. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed using specific search terms on April 19, 2016 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The morphology of the SCB was assessed using of microcomputed tomography (bone density) and histology (microscopic architecture). Seventeen animal studies with 520 chondral lesions were included. The morphology of SCB did not recover following BMS. Compared with untreated chondral defects, BMS resulted in superior morphology of superficial SCB and cartilage but inferior morphology (specifically bone density, P &lt; 0.05) of the deep SCB. Overall, the use of biological adjuvants during BMS resulted in the superior postoperative morphology of SCB. Alterations in the SCB following BMS were confirmed. Biologics adjuvants may improve the postoperative morphology of both SCB and articular cartilage. Refinements of BMS techniques should incorporate consideration of SCB damage and restoration.

At 1 and 3 weeks, Cingal was significantly better than Monovisc for most endpoints; Cingal and Monovisc were similar from 6 weeks through 26 weeks. A low incidence of related adverse events was reported. Cingal provides immediate and long-term relief of osteoarthritis-related pain, stiffness, and function, significant through 26 weeks compared to saline.

Cell growth and differentiation were evaluated with cell morphological studies and gene expression studies. In vivo-A microfracture rat model was used in this study to evaluate the repair of cartilage and subchondral bone with the contralateral knee serving as the empty control. The treatment groups include (1) empty osteochondral defect, (2) polycaprolactone copolymer-based polyester polyurethane-urea (PSPU-U) caffold short-term degradative profile, and (3) PSPU-U scaffold long-term degradative profile. After placement of the scaffold, the rats were then allowed unrestricted activity as tolerated, and histological analyses were performed at 4, 8, and 16 weeks. The cartilage defect was measured and compared with the contralateral control side. Results In vitro-Long-term scaffolds showed statistically significant higher levels of aggrecan and type II collagen expression compared with short-term scaffolds. In vivo-Within 16 weeks postimplantation, there was new subchondral bone formation in both scaffolds. Short-term scaffolds had a statistically significant increase in defect filling and better qualitative histologic fill compared to control.

After 2 and 4 weeks, the knees were harvested for digital microscopic observation, soft X-ray analysis, histological analysis, and synovial membrane molecular evaluation. Results The 4-week OARSI scores showed that cartilage degeneration was significantly inhibited in the CAJM group as compared with the ACL-T group ( P &lt; 0.001). At 4 weeks, the osteophyte formation had also significantly increased in the ACL-T group ( P &lt; 0.001). These results reflected the microscopic scoring and soft X-ray analysis findings at 4 weeks. Real-time synovial membrane polymerase chain reaction analysis for evaluation of the osteophyte formation-associated factors showed that the mRNA expression of BMP-2 and VEGF in the ACL-T group had significantly increased after 2 weeks.

We have decided to focus on microfracturing, since this seems to be the best documented technique. Interest in evaluation of publication quality has risen in orthopaedic sports medicine recently. Therefore, we think it is necessary to evaluate recent clinical trials being rated for their evidence-based medicine (EBM) quality. We also compared the mean impact factor of the journals publishing the different studies as an indicator of the study's citation and evaluated for a change over the studied time frame. Design To measure the EBM level, we applied the modified Coleman Methodology Score (CMS) introduced by Jakobsen. The impact factor, which is a measurement of the yearly average number of citations of articles recently published in that journal, was evaluated according to self-reported values on the corresponding journal's website. Results We found that the mean CMS has not changed between 2010 and 2014. The mean impact factor has also not changed between 2010 and 2014. The CMS variance was high, pointing to different qualities in the evaluated studies. There is no evidence that microfracturing is superior compared to other cartilage repair procedures.

PolyP research is hindered by the lack of a simple and sensitive quantification method. The aim of this study was to develop a robust method for quantifying the low levels of polyP in mammalian tissue such as cartilage, which is rich in macromolecules that interfere with its determination. Native and in vitro formed tissues were digested with proteinase K to release sequestrated polyP. The tissue digest was loaded on to silica spin columns, followed by elution of bound polyP and various treatments were assessed to minimize non-polyP fluorescence. The eluent was then quantified for polyP content using fluorometry based on DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) fluorescence shift occurring with polyP. Proteinase K pretreatment reduced the inhibitory effect of proteins on polyP recovery. The eluent was contaminated with nucleic acids and glycosaminoglycans, which cause extraneous fluorescence signals. These were then effectively eliminated by nucleases treatment and addition of concentrated Tris buffer. PolyP levels were quantified and recovery ratio determined using samples spiked with a known amount of polyP. This silica spin column method was able to recover at least 80% of initially loaded polyP, and detect as little as 10-10 mol. This sensitive, reproducible, easy to do method of quantifying polyP will be a useful tool for investigation of polyP biology in mammalian cells and tissues.

Methods Lateral sheep meniscal allografts were chemically processed by a multistep method to yield acellular, sterile grafts. The grafts were transplanted into the knee joints of sheep that were treated by lateral meniscectomy. Joints treated by meniscectomy only and untreated joints served as controls. The joints were analyzed morphologically 6 and 26 weeks after surgery by the macroscopical and histological OARSI (Osteoarthritis Research Society International) score. Additionally, the meniscal grafts were biomechanically tested by cyclic indentation. Results Lateral meniscectomy was associated with significant degenerative changes of the articular cartilage of the lateral joint compartment. Transplanted lateral meniscal allografts retained their integrity during the observation period without inducing significant synovitis or foreign body reactions. Cellular repopulation of the grafts was only present on the surface and the periphery of the lateral meniscus, but was still completely lacking in the center of the grafts at week 26. Transplantation of processed meniscal allografts could not prevent degenerative changes of the articular cartilage in the lateral joint compartment. Compared with healthy menisci, the processed grafts were characterized by a significantly reduced dynamic modulus, which did not improve during the observation period of 26 weeks in vivo.

Multiple reports have shown that a high incidence of osteoarthritis is found in football players. Evidence clearly shows that traumatic injury significantly predisposes players for such pathophysiology. Injuries are frequent in amateur as well as professional football players, with knee and ankle accounting for the most severe injuries. Many professional athletes lose playing time due to injuries and many are forced into early retirement. Posttraumatic osteoarthritis is a common finding among ex-football players with numbers well above the normal population. Today's surgical techniques are advanced and capable of restoring the joint to a certain extent. However, a restitution ad integrum is reached only in very rare cases. Professional football players that return to play after serious injuries perform their extremely strenuous activity on morphologically compromised joints. Incomplete rehabilitation and pressure to return to play after an injurious event clearly put the athlete at an even higher risk for joint degeneration. Prevention strategies, improved surgical management, strict rehabilitation, as well as future aspects such as early suppression of inflammation, personalized medicine, and predictive genomics DNA profiling are needed to reduce incidence and improve the health perspectives of football players.","598":null,"599":"The menisci of the knees are semicircular fibrocartilaginous structures consisting of a hydrophilic extracellular matrix containing a network of collagen fibers, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans maintained by a cellular component. The menisci are responsible for more than 50% of load transmission across the knee and increase joint congruity thereby also aiding in fluid film lubrication of the joint. In the United Kingdom, meniscal tears are the most common form of intra-articular knee injury and one of the commonest indications for orthopedic intervention. The management of these injuries is dependent on the location within the meniscus (relative to peripheral blood supply) and the pattern of tear. Removal of meniscus is known to place the knee at increased risk of osteoarthritis; therefore repair of meniscal tears is preferable. However, a significant proportion of tears are irreparable and can only be treated by partial or even complete meniscectomy. More recent studies have shown encouraging results with meniscal replacement in this situation, though further work is required in this area.","600":null,"601":null,"602":null,"603":"Objective Bone marrow stimulation surgeries are frequent in the treatment of cartilage lesions. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) may be performed after failed microfracture surgery. Alterations to subchondral bone as intralesional osteophytes are commonly seen after previous microfracture and removed during ACI. There have been no reports on potential recurrence. Our purpose was to evaluate the incidence of intralesional osteophyte development in 2 cohorts: existing intralesional osteophytes and without intralesional osteophytes at the time of ACI. Study Design We identified 87 patients (157 lesions) with intralesional osteophytes among a cohort of 497 ACI patients. Osteophyte regrowth was analyzed on magnetic resonance imaging and categorized as small or large (less or more than 50% of the cartilage thickness). Twenty patients (24 defects) without intralesional osteophytes at the time of ACI acted as control. Results Osteophyte regrowth was observed in 39.5% of lesions (34.4% of small osteophytes and 5.1% of large osteophytes). In subgroup analyses, regrowth was observed in 45.8% of periosteal-covered defects and in 18.9% of collagen membrane-covered defects. Large osteophyte regrowth occurred in less than 5% in either group. Periosteal defects showed a significantly higher incidence for regrowth of small osteophytes. In the control group, intralesional osteophytes developed in 16.7% of the lesions. Conclusions Even though intralesional osteophytes may regrow after removal during ACI, most of them are small. Small osteophyte regrowth occurs almost twice in periosteum-covered ACI. Large osteophytes occur only in 5% of patients. Intralesional osteophyte formation is not significantly different in preexisting intralesional osteophytes and control groups.","604":"To explore the utilization of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for degenerative cartilage processes and evaluate whether there is sufficient evidence to better define its potential effects.

Twenty-six studies examined PRP administration for knee OA and 3 involved PRP administration for hip OA. The results included 9 prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (8 knee and 1 hip), 4 prospective comparative studies, 14 case series, and 2 retrospective comparative studies. Hyaluronic acid (HA) was used as a control in 11 studies (7 RCTs, 2 prospective comparative studies, and 2 retrospective cohort). Overall, all RCTs reported on improved symptoms compared to baseline scores. Only 2 RCTs-one for knee and one for hip-did not report significant superiority of PRP compared to the control group (HA). Nine out of 11 HA controlled studies showed significant better results in the PRP groups. A trend toward better results for PRP injections in patients with early knee OA and young age was observed; however, lack of uniformity was evident in terms of indications, inclusion criteria, and pathology definitions in the different studies.

Twenty-two patients with OLT were analyzed in this study; 7 were treated with mACI and 15 with mBMAC. Informed consent was obtained from all the patients. Clinical assessments were performed pre-operatively and at 12, 24, and 36 months after surgery using the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS). Histology and immunohistochemistry were used to assess cartilage repair at 24 months. Data were analyzed using non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and Spearman tests. A remarkable improvement in AOFAS score was noticed for both treatments up to 36 months; however, patients treated with mACI reported the best AOFAS score.

However, a comprehensive evaluation of the clinical outcomes of those treatment modalities in OLT has yet to be published. The purpose of this review is to provide an evidence-based overview of clinical outcomes following biologic augmentation to surgical treatments for OLT. A comprehensive literature review was performed. Two commonly used surgical techniques for the treatment of OLT-bone marrow stimulation and osteochondral autograft transfer-are first introduced. The review describes the operative indications, step-by- step operative procedure, clinical outcomes, and concerns associated with each treatment. A review of the currently published basic science and clinical evidence on biologic augmentation in the surgical treatments for OLT, including platelet-rich plasma, concentrated bone marrow aspirate, and scaffold-based therapy follows. Biologic agents and scaffold-based therapies appear to be promising agents, capable of improving both clinical and radiological outcomes in OLT. Nevertheless, variable production methods of these biologic augmentations confound the interpretation of clinical outcomes of cases treated with these agents. Current clinical evidence supports the use of biologic agents in OLT cases. Nonetheless, well-designed clinical trials with patient-specific, validated and objective outcome measurements are warranted to develop standardized clinical guidelines for the use of biologic augmentation for the treatment of OLT in clinical practice. ","610":"The incidence of osteochondral lesions, as well as osteoarthritis of the ankle joint following osteochondritis dissecans and trauma, has been reappraised in recent years. Consequently, an increasing number of surgical interventions using different cartilage repair techniques is performed in the ankle joint, which has resulted in a growing demand for repetitive and objective assessment of cartilage tissue and its repair. While morphological imaging does enable monitoring of macroscopic changes with increasing precision, it fails to provide information about the ultrastructural composition of cartilage. The significance of molecular changes in cartilage matrix composition, however, is increasingly recognized, as it is assumed that macroscopic cartilage degeneration is preceded by a loss in glycosaminoglycans and a disorganization of the collagen network. Recent advances in biochemical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have yielded sequences sensitive to these changes, thus providing invaluable insight into both early cartilage degeneration and maturation of repair tissue, on a molecular level. The aim of this review was to provide a comprehensive overview of these techniques, including water and collagen-sensitive T2\/T2* mapping, as well as glycosaminoglycan-sensitive sequences such as delayed gadolinium-enhanced MRI of cartilage dGEMRIC, and sodium imaging, and describe their applications for the ankle joint.","611":"Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common injuries that affect a wide variety of active patients. The majority of these lesions are associated with ankle sprains and fractures though several nontraumatic etiologies have also been recognized. Patients normally present with a history of prior ankle injury and\/or instability. In addition to standard ankle radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are used to characterize the extent of the lesion and involvement of the subchondral bone. Symptomatic nondisplaced lesions can often be treated conservatively within the pediatric population though this treatment is less successful in adults. Bone marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture have yielded favorable results for the treatment of small (&lt;15 mm) lesions. Osteochondral autograft can be harvested most commonly from the ipsilateral knee and carries the benefit of repairing defects with native hyaline cartilage. Osteochondral allograft transplant is reserved for large cystic lesions that lack subchondral bone integrity. Cell-based repair techniques such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and matrix-associated chondrocyte implantation have been increasingly used in an attempt to repair the lesion with hyaline cartilage though these techniques require adequate subchondral bone. Biological agents such as platelet-rich plasma and bone marrow aspirate have been more recently studied as an adjunct to operative treatment but their use remains theoretical.

We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Cochrane database, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and unpublished data. We included all human randomized controlled trials or observational studies with adverse event (AE) data for SUPARTZ in knee osteoarthritis. Two independent reviewers extracted data and evaluated study quality. Data were analyzed separately for the first and subsequent series of injections. The primary sources for repeated-injection data on SUPARTZ were a postmarket registry (N = 7404), 4 prospective studies (N = 127 total), and a retrospective study (N = 220). None of the sources reported increased frequency or severity of AEs with repeated injections. In the registry, 95% of multiple-injection-series patients who reported an AE did so during the first series. None of the AEs was serious, and most resolved spontaneously without medical intervention. The overall adverse event rate after repeat courses of SUPARTZ was 0.008 (95% confidence interval: 0.001-0.055).

Helium ion microscopy is a novel technology with a long depth of field that is uniquely suited to imaging open 3D collagen networks at multiple scales without obscuring conductive coatings. The objective of this research was to image, at the micro- and nanoscales, the depth-dependent MCC collagen network architecture. MCC was collected from New Zealand white rabbits. Images of MCC zones were acquired using helium ion, transmission electron, and light microscopy. Network fibril and canal diameters were measured. For the first time, the MCC was visualized as a 3D collagen fibril structure at the nanoscale, the length scale of network assembly. Fibril diameters ranged from 7 to 110 nm and varied by zone. The articular surface was composed of a fine mesh that was woven through thin layers of larger fibrils. The fibrous zone was composed of approximately orthogonal lamellae of aligned fibrils. Fibrocyte processes surrounded collagen bundles forming extracellular compartments. The proliferative, mature, and hypertrophic zones were composed of a branched network that was progressively remodeled to accommodate chondrocyte hypertrophy. Osteoid fibrils were woven around osteoblast cytoplasmic processes to create numerous canals similar in size to canaliculi of mature bone.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a porous 3-dimensional scaffold made of cross-linked hyaluronic acid on the expression and synthesis performance of human articular chondrocytes. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes from 5 patients with a mean age of 74 years were passaged twice and cultured within the cross-linked hyaluronic acid scaffolds for 2 weeks. Analyses were performed at 3 different time points. For estimation of cell content within the scaffold, DNA-content (CyQuant cell proliferation assay) was determined. The expression of chondrocyte-specific genes by embedded cells as well as the total amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans produced during the culture period was analyzed in order to characterize the synthesis performance and differentiation status of the cells. Cells showed a homogenous distribution within the scaffold. DNA quantification revealed a reduction of the cell number. This might be attributed to loss of cells from the scaffold during media exchange connected with a stop in cell proliferation. Indeed, the expression of cartilage-specific genes and the production of sulfated glycosaminoglycans were increased and the differentiation index was clearly improved. These results suggest that the attachment of osteoarthritic P2 chondrocytes to the investigated material enhanced the chondrogenic phenotype as well as promoted the retention.

A total of 26 sites from 9 patients undergoing routine shoulder arthroscopy were quantitatively evaluated with a clinical intravascular (40MHz) ultrasound imaging system, using the regular arthroscopy portals. Reflection coefficient (R), integrated reflection coefficient (IRC), apparent integrated backscattering (AIB), and ultrasound roughness index (URI) were calculated, and high-resolution ultrasound images were obtained per site. Each site was visually graded according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) system. \"Ultrasound scores\" corresponding to the ICRS system were determined from the ultrasound images. Magnetic resonance imaging was conducted and cartilage integrity at each site was classified into 5 grades (0 = normal, 4 = severely abnormal) by a radiologist. R and IRC were lower at sites with damaged cartilage surface (P = 0.033 and P = 0.043, respectively) and correlated with arthroscopic ICRS grades (r s = -0.444, P = 0.023 and r s = -0.426, P = 0.03, respectively). Arthroscopic ICRS grades and ultrasound scores were significantly correlated (rs = 0.472, P = 0.015), but no significant correlation was found between magnetic resonance imaging data and other parameters.

We used data recorded by the FLEXX trial and extension trial for secondary analysis of potential prognostic factors. Linear regression was used to examine the predictors of outcomes at 6- and 12-month follow-up visits. Sixty percent of all patients presented with a Kellgren Lawrence (K-L) grade 3.

Retrospective chart review for all skeletally mature patients who presented with unstable femoral condyle OCD lesions of the knee was conducted. All patients underwent open or arthroscopic reduction and internal fixation using headless metal compression screws. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were reviewed with healing defined as radiographic evidence of union of the OCD progeny fragment with the condyle.

Buffer denoted as 1M resulted in no significant difference for cell attachment, confluency, and viability as compared to non-nucleofected controls. Nucleofection in 1M buffer, in the absence of DNA vectors, resulted in increased col2, ki67, ccnd1 mRNA levels, and decreased col1 mRNA levels at 4 days of culture. Flow cytometry revealed that the transfection efficiency of 1M buffer was comparable to that obtained using the Amaxa commercial kit. siRNA designed against lamin A\/C resulted in an average reduction of lamin A and C proteins to 19% and 8% of control levels, respectively. This study identifies a cost-effective, efficient method of nonviral nucleofection of bovine-passaged chondrocytes using known buffer formulations.

Interobserver reliability was measured using an interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The learning curves of 3 observers were evaluated by regression analysis. At each SPI measurement location the degradation level of the tissue was determined by means of the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) score, Mankin score, and sGAG content. The computed ICC was 0.77 (0.70-0.83) indicating good to excellent linear agreement of SPI values among the 3 users. A significant positive linear correlation of the learning index values was observed for 2 of the 3 users. Statistically significant negative correlations between SPI and both ICRS and Mankin scores were observed (r = 0.502, P &lt; 0.001, and r = 0.255, P = 0.02, respectively). No correlation was observed between SPI and sGAG content (r = 0.004, P = 0.973). SPI values may be used as a quantitative means of cartilage evaluation with sufficient reliability among users. Due to the significant learning curve, adequate training should be absolved before routine use of the technique.

However, current imaging modalities do not detect submicrometer damage. Developments in in vivo or arthroscopic techniques, including optical coherence tomography, ultrasonography, bioelectricity including streaming potential measurement, noninvasive electroarthrography, and multiphoton microscopy can detect damage at an earlier time point, but they are limited by a lack of penetration and the ability to assess an entire joint.

The international RCT evaluated repair tissue quantity and quality by 3-dimensional quantitative magnetic resonance imaging as co-primary endpoints at 12 months. At an average of 13 months posttreatment, 21\/41 BST-CarGel and 17\/39 microfracture patients underwent elective second look arthroscopies as a tertiary endpoint, during which ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) macroscopic scoring was carried out, and osteochondral biopsies were collected. Stained histological sections were evaluated by blinded readers using ICRS I and II histological scoring systems. Collagen organization was evaluated using a polarized light microscopy score. BST-CarGel treatment resulted in significantly better ICRS macroscopic scores (P = 0.0002) compared with microfracture alone, indicating better filling, integration, and tissue appearance. Histologically, BST-CarGel resulted in a significant improvement of structural parameters-Surface Architecture (P = 0.007) and Surface\/Superficial Assessment (P = 0.042)-as well as cellular parameters-Cell Viability (P = 0.006) and Cell Distribution (P = 0.032). No histological parameters were significantly better for the microfracture group. BST-CarGel treatment also resulted in a more organized repair tissue with collagen stratification more similar to native hyaline cartilage, as measured by polarized light microscopy scoring (P = 0.0003). Multiple and independent analyses in this biopsy substudy demonstrated that BST-CarGel treatment results in improved structural and cellular characteristics of repair tissue at 1 year posttreatment compared with microfracture alone, supporting previously reported results by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging.

Chondrocyte transplantation therapy is a common treatment for focal cartilage lesions, with both mature and neonatal chondrocytes used as a cell source. Additionally, gene therapy strategies to upregulate growth factors such as IGF-I have been proposed to augment chondrocyte transplantation therapies. Both skeletally mature and neonatal chondrocytes were exposed to either an adeno-associated virus-based plasmid containing the IGF-I gene or exogenous IGF-I. Analysis of IGF-I and glycosaminoglycan production using a 4-parameter dose-response model established a clear connection between the amount of IGF-I produced by cells and their biosynthetic response. Both neonatal and mature chondrocytes showed this relationship, but the sensitivities were quite different, with EC50 of 0.57 ng\/mL for neonatal chondrocytes and EC50 of 8.70 ng\/mL IGF-I for skeletally mature chondrocytes. These data suggest that IGF-I gene therapy may be more effective with younger cell sources. Both cell types were less sensitive to exogenous IGF-I than endogenous IGF-I.

Cell adhesion, incorporation, and viable cell growth were assessed microscopically and following calcein AM\/ethidium homodimer (Live\/Dead) staining. Cell-seeded scaffolds were treated with chondrogenic inducers for 28 days. Extracellular matrix deposition and soluble glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release into the culture medium was measured at day 28 by histology\/immunohistochemistry and dimethylmethylene blue assay, respectively. A greater number of viable MSCs from either source adhered and incorporated into Chondro-Gide than into Alpha Chondro Shield. In both cell scaffolds, this incorporation represented less than 2% of the cells that were seeded. There was a marked proliferation of BM MSCs, but not AT MSCs, in Chondro-Gide. MSCs from both sources underwent chondrogenic differentiation following induction. However, cartilaginous extracellular matrix deposition was most marked in Chondro-Gide seeded with BM MSCs. Soluble GAG secretion increased in chondrogenic versus control conditions. There was no marked difference in GAG secretion by MSCs from either cell source. Chondro-Gide and Alpha Chondro Shield were permissive to the incorporation and chondrogenic differentiation of human BM and AT MSCs.

Critical osteochondral defects were prepared on the femoral groove of skeletally mature Japanese white rabbits. Costal cartilage grafts from a single rib were harvested and sliced into multiple segments (approximately 3-5 mm in length). The defects were left untreated or repaired by performing mosaicplasty using costal cartilage grafts (with or without a longitudinal cut along the middle). At 4 and 12 weeks after transplantation, International Cartilage Repair Society macroscopic and histological grading was performed. The macroscopic score and visual histological score were significantly higher in the repaired groups than in the untreated group at 4 and 12 weeks after surgery. Histological continuous integration between grafted costal cartilage and host bone was observed in both repaired groups.

We demonstrate that full thickness canine chondral and synovial samples exposed to various local anesthetics and corticosteroids exhibit decreased loss of cell viability compared with prior in vitro studies using monolayer culture, due to the protective effects of intact extracellular matrix and cell heterogeneity. Full-thickness cartilage and synovial explants were obtained from canine cadavers and exposed in culture media to the following for 24 hours: 1% lidocaine, 0.5% lidocaine, 0.25% bupivacaine, 0.125% bupvacaine, 0.0625% bupivacaine, betamethasone acetate, methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone acetonide, or culture media only (control). Cell viability was determined on days 1 and 7 of culture using a microscopic live-dead and alamar blue metabolic assays. Complete loss of chondrocyte and synoviocyte viability was noted in the 1% and 0.5% lidocaine group, 0.25% and 0.125% bupivacaine group, betamethasone group, and methylprednisolone groups after 1 and 7 days of culture. Treatment with 0.0625% bupivacaine and triamcinolone demonstrated no decrease in cell viability or metabolism when compared to negative control.

A spring-loaded impactor was used to apply energy-controlled impacts to the articular surfaces of neonatal bovine cartilage. The simultaneous use of a load cell and displacement sensor provided measurements of stress, stress rate, strain, strain rate, and strain energy density. Application of India ink after impact was used to correlate the mechanical inputs during impact with the resulting severity of tissue damage. Additionally, a signal processing method to deconvolve inertial stresses from impact stresses was developed and validated. Impact models fit the data well (root mean square error average ~0.09) and provided a fully characterized impact. Correlation analysis between mechanical inputs and degree of superficial cracking made visible through India ink application provided significant positive correlations for stress and stress rate with degree of surface cracking (R (2) = 0.7398 and R (2) = 0.5262, respectively). Ranges of impact parameters were 7 to 21 MPa, 6 to 40 GPa\/s, 0.16 to 0.38, 87 to 236 s(-1), and 0.3 to 1.1 MJ\/m(3) for stress, stress rate, strain, strain rate, and strain energy density, respectively. Thresholds for damage for all inputs were determined at 13 MPa, 15 GPa\/s, 0.23, 160 s(-1), and 0.59 MJ\/m(3) for this system. This study provided the mechanical basis for use of a portable, sterilizable, and maneuverable impacting device.

There were 6 men and 47 women, with 40 right knees and 31 left knees studied; their mean age at operation was 73.5 years. The ligament, meniscus, degeneration of joint cartilage, and radiographic alignments were examined visually.

The femorotibial angle and tibial plateau-tibial shaft angle were larger if the conditions of the lateral meniscus or the cartilage in the lateral tibial plateau were worse. Based on the results of this study, progression of varus knee osteoarthritis may occur in the following manner: medial knee osteoarthritis starts in the central portion of the medial tibial plateau, and accompanied by medial meniscal extrusion and anterior cruciate ligament rupture, cartilage degeneration expands from the anterior to the posterior in the medial tibial plateau. Bone attrition occurs in the medial tibial plateau, and the femoro-tibial angle and tibial plateau-tibial shaft angle increase. Therefore, the lateral intercondylar eminence injures the cartilage of the lateral femoral condyle in the longitudinal fissure type.

Pain and function were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. Patient satisfaction was assessed. Reoperations following OCA transplantation were captured. Failure was defined as revision OCA or conversion to arthroplasty. Fifty-five patients (61 knees) were included in the analysis. The study consisted of 30 males and 25 females (mean age = 32.9 years; range = 15.7-67.8 years). The most common diagnoses for the OCA transplantation were osteochondritis dissecans (44.3%) and avascular necrosis (31.1%). Pain and function improved preoperatively to postoperatively on all outcome scales (P &lt; 0.01). The majority of patients (86%) were \"extremely satisfied\" or \"satisfied.\" OCA survivorship was 89.5% at 5 years and 74.7% at 10 years.

","661":"Translation of the contact zone in articulating joints is an important component of joint kinematics, yet rarely investigated in a biological context. This study was designed to investigate how sliding contact areas affect cartilage mechanobiology. We hypothesized that higher sliding speeds would lead to increased extracellular matrix mechanical stress and the expression of catabolic genes. A cylindrical Teflon indenter was used to apply 50 or 100 N normal forces at 10, 40, or 70 mm\/s sliding speed. Mechanical parameters were correlated with gene expressions using a multiple linear regression model. In both loading groups there was no significant effect of sliding speed on any of the mechanical parameters (strain, stress, modulus, tangential force). However, an increase in vertical force (from 50 to 100 N) led to a significant increase in extracellular matrix strain and stress. For 100 N, significant correlations between gene expression and mechanical parameters were found for TIMP-3 (r(2) = 0.89), ADAMTS-5 (r(2) = 0.73), and lubricin (r(2) = 0.73). The sliding speeds applied do not have an effect on the mechanical response of the cartilage, this could be explained by a partial attainment of the \"elastic limit\" at and above a sliding speed of 10 mm\/s. Nevertheless, we still found a relationship between sliding speed and gene expression when the tissue was loaded with 100 N normal force. Thus despite the absence of speed-dependent mechanical changes (strain, stress, modulus, tangential force), the sliding speed had an influence on gene expression.

Fourier transform infrared imaging spectroscopy (FT-IRIS) can be used to assess the molecular composition of harvested repair tissue. Furthermore, use of an infrared fiber-optic probe (IFOP) has the potential for translation to a clinical setting to provide molecular information in situ. In the current study, we determined the feasibility of IFOP assessment of cartilage repair tissue in a rabbit model, and assessed correlations with gold-standard histology. Bilateral osteochondral defects were generated in mature white New Zealand rabbits, and IFOP data obtained from defect and adjacent regions at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks postsurgery. Tissues were assessed histologically using the modified O'Driscoll score, by FT-IRIS, and by partial least squares (PLS) modeling of IFOP spectra. The FT-IRIS parameters of collagen content, proteoglycan content, and collagen index correlated significantly with modified O'Driscoll score (P = 0.05, 0.002, and 0.02, respectively), indicative of their sensitivity to tissue healing. Repair tissue IFOP spectra were distinguished from normal tissue IFOP spectra in all samples by PLS analysis. However, the PLS model for prediction of histological score had a high prediction error, which was attributed to the spectral information being acquired from the tissue surface only. The strong correlations between FT-IRIS data and histological score support further development of the IFOP technique for clinical applications, although further studies to optimize data collection from the full sample depths are required.

Early-stage OA has been defined and involves structural changes identified by arthroscopy or radiography. The group argued that before the \"early-stage OA\" there must exist a stage where cellular processes, due to the presence of risk factors, have kicked into action but have not yet resulted in structural changes. The group suggested that this stage could be called \"pre-osteoarthritis\" (pre-OA). The group suggests that defining points of initiation for OA in the knee could be defined, for example, by traumatic episodes or surgical meniscectomy.

The aim of this article is to present five cases of osteochondral lesions in ankle hemophilic arthropathy treated with a regenerative procedure: bone marrow-derived cells transplantation (BMDCT). We report five hemophilic patients (four cases with hemophilia type A; one case with hemophilia type B) who have undergone BMDCT treatment, synovectomy, and arthroscopic debridement, with the use of autologous platelet-rich fibrin, to treat osteochondral lesions in hemophilic ankle arthropathy. The patients, included within this retrospective study, were clinically and radiologically evaluated with serial follow-ups, using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, radiographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The mean preoperative AOFAS score was 35. After a mean follow-up of 2 years, the mean postoperative AOFAS score was 81, which included three patients returning back to sporting activities. The MRI Mocart score demonstrated signs of regeneration of chondral and bony tissue. No progression of joint degeneration was shown radiographically.

Design-unbiased sampling was performed by systematically sectioning the defect perpendicular to the joint surface in parallel planes providing 7 to 10 hematoxylin-eosin stained histological sections. Counting windows were systematically selected and converted into image files (40-50 per defect). The quantification was performed by two-step point counting: (1) calculation of defect volume and (2) quantitative analysis of tissue composition. Step 2 was performed by assigning each point to one of the following categories based on validated and easy distinguishable morphological characteristics: (1) hyaline cartilage (rounded cells in lacunae in hyaline matrix), (2) fibrocartilage (rounded cells in lacunae in fibrous matrix), (3) fibrous tissue (elongated cells in fibrous tissue), (4) bone, (5) scaffold material, and (6) others. The ability to discriminate between the tissue types was determined using conventional or polarized light microscopy, and the interobserver variability was evaluated. We describe the application of the stereological method. In the example, we assessed the defect repair tissue volume to be 4.4 mm(3) (CE = 0.01). The tissue fractions were subsequently evaluated. Polarized light illumination of the slides improved discrimination between hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage and increased the interobserver agreement compared with conventional transmitted light. We have applied a design-unbiased method for quantitative evaluation of cartilage repair, and we propose this algorithm as a natural supplement to existing descriptive semiquantitative scoring systems.

Radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical scores (International Knee Documentation Committee, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, visual analog scale, and Tegner) were collected preoperatively, at 2-year and final follow-up. Five patients of MACI and 6 of the BMAC group underwent second-look arthroscopy; 4 patients of each group consented to a concomitant biopsy. No adverse reactions or postoperative infections were noted. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups (P &gt; 0.05). Both groups showed significant improvement in all scores, from preoperative to final follow-up (P = 0.001), but there was no significant difference in improvement between the 2 groups, except for the IKDC subjective score (P = 0.015), which favored the BMAC group. Deterioration in MACI and improvement in BMAC group scores were noticed, from 2-year to final follow-up, but was nonsignificant. MACI patients with trochlear lesions showed better results than patellar lesions, while location was not a prognostic factor in the BMAC group.

Current animal experiments show that incisions of the deep zone of a cartilage allograft allow acceptable integration for the graft. We performed this clinical study to determine (1) if the multiply incised cartilage graft is surgically applicable for focal cartilage lesions, (2) whether this allograft has a potential to integrate to the repair site, and (3) if patients show clinical improvement. Seven patients with 8 chondral lesions were enrolled into the study. Symptomatic lesions between 2 and 8 cm(2) were accepted. Additional injuries were allowed but were addressed simultaneously. Grafts were tailored to match and the deep zone of the cartilage was multiply incised to augment the basal integration before securing in place. Rigorous postoperative physiotherapy followed. At 12 and 24 months the patients' satisfaction were measured and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 6 patients. Following the implantations no adverse reaction occurred. MRI evaluation postoperatively showed the graft in place in 5 out of 6 patients. In 1 patient, MRI suggested partial delamination at 1 year and graft degeneration at 2 years. Short Form-36 health survey and the Lysholm knee score demonstrated a significant improvement in the first year; however, by 2 years there was a noticeable drop in the scores. Conclusions. Multiply incised pure chondral allograft used for cartilage repair appears to be a relatively safe method.

Microscopic histology scoring criteria were developed to evaluate healing of tears, the cellular response, and the inflammatory response. Gait recovery suggested protective effect of collagen membrane and was supported by macroscopical evaluation where improved tear healing was noted in both treated groups. Histology scoring in CM compared to suture group revealed an increase in tear margins contact, newly formed connective tissue between margins, and cell formations surrounded with new matrix after 3 months yet not maintained after 6 months. In contrast, in the CM+cells group these features were observed after 3 and 6 months.

A qualitative analysis of the sCOMP levels and minutes indicated higher sCOMP levels occurred when the athletes' participation in soccer-related activities was higher. Qualitatively, our findings suggest that as minutes of participation increased, sCOMP levels increased. However, no statistically significant differences were identified.

After 2-week in vitro incubation, seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice for 6 weeks. The neocartilage quality was evaluated histologically; DNA and glycosaminoglycans were quantified. Cell proliferation rates and collagen gene expression profiles were assessed. Clinically sufficient over 500-fold chondrocyte expansion was achieved at passage 3 (P3); cell dedifferentiation was confirmed by the simultaneous COL1A1\/3A1 gene upregulation and COL2A1 downregulation. The chondrogenic phenotype of sheep but not human P3 cells was rescued by addition of cryopreserved P0 chondrocytes. With bFGF supplementation, chondrocytes achieved clinically sufficient expansion at P2; COL2A1 expression was not rescued but COL1A1\/3A1genes were downregulated. Although bFGF failed to rescue COL2A1 expression during chondrocyte expansion in vitro, elastic neocartilage with obvious collagen II expression was observed on porous collagen scaffolds after implantation in mice for 6 weeks.

Cells were labeled with PKH26 and injected into the thigh muscle of severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. After 2 weeks, the muscles were dissected and cryosectioned. Sections were stained with safranin O and labeled for sox9 and collagen type II. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was carried out to determine plasticity for a number of tissue-specific markers. Full-depth chondrocytes acted as a control. Fluorescent PKH26 labeled cells were detected after 2 weeks in all samples analyzed. A cartilage pellet was present after injection of freshly isolated chondrocytes. After injection with clonal and enriched populations of chondroprogenitors, no distinct pellet was detected, but diffuse cartilage nodules were found with regions of safranin O staining and Sox9. Low levels of collagen type II were also detected. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified the presence of the endothelial cell marker PECAM-1 in one clonal cell line, demonstrating phenotypic plasticity into the phenotype of the surrounding host tissues.

The potential for tri-lineage differentiation into chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic phenotypes were analyzed using histological stains, immunocytochemistry, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Colony forming cells were successfully isolated from osteoarthritic cartilage and extensively expanded in monolayer culture. Colony forming efficiencies were consistently below 0.1%. Clonal cell lines were expanded beyond 40 population doublings but disparities were observed in the number of population doublings per day. Clonally derived cell lines also demonstrated in vitro multilineage potential via successful differentiation into chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic lineages. However, variation in the degree of differentiation was observed between these clonal cell lines. A viable pool of cells with stem cell characteristics have been identified within human osteoarthritic cartilage. Variation in the degree of differentiation suggests the possibility of further subpopulations of cells. The identification of this stem cell population highlights the reparative potential of these cells in osteoarthritic cartilage, which could be further exploited to aid the field of regenerative medicine. ","684":"Clinical trials of various procedures, including bone marrow stimulation, mosaicplasty, and autologous chondrocyte implantation, have been explored to treat articular cartilage defects. However, all of them have some demerits. We focused on autologous culture-expanded bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC), which can proliferate without losing their capacity for differentiation. First, we transplanted BMSC into the defective articular cartilage of rabbit and succeeded in regenerating osteochondral tissue. We then applied this transplantation in humans. Our previous reports showed that treatment with BMSC relieves the clinical symptoms of chondral defects in the knee and elbow joint. We investigated the efficacy of BMSC for osteoarthritic knee treated with high tibial osteotomy, by comparing 12 BMSC-transplanted patients with 12 cell-free patients. At 16-month follow-up, although the difference in clinical improvement between both groups was not significant, the arthroscopic and histological grading score was better in the cell-transplanted group. At the over 10-year follow-up, Hospital for Special Surgery knee scores improved to 76 and 73 in the BMSC-transplanted and cell-free groups, respectively, which were better than preoperative scores. Additionally, neither tumors nor infections were observed in all patients, and in the clinical study, we have never observed hypertrophy of repaired tissue, thereby guaranteeing the clinical safety of this therapy. Although we have never observed calcification above the tidemark in rabbit model and human histologically, the repair cartilage was not completely hyaline cartilage. To elucidate the optimum conditions for cell therapy, other stem cells, culture conditions, growth factors, and gene transfection methods should be explored. ","685":null,"686":"Objective. Studies have shown that meniscal repairs have better outcomes over both partial and total meniscectomies. Tissue engineering strategies to repair meniscus tears have been explored using cell sources that involve a donor as well as a period of in vitro cell expansion before use. This study explored cell sources that could be easily harvested and rapidly isolated by enzymatic digestion and cannulated delivery. Methods. Bovine menisci were used to create a bucket handle tear. Cell lines were established from meniscus, synovium, and adipose tissue and fluorescently labeled. At passages P2, P4, and P8, cells were added to the defect from the following experimental groups: cells alone, collagen gel, collagen scaffold, or hyaluronic acid. Menisci constructs were xenografted subcutaneously onto the dorsum of athymic rats and incubated for 3, 6, and 9 weeks, at which time they were retrieved and processed for histology. Results. Meniscal cells were able to repair defects faster and significantly better than adipose or synovium derived cells. Adipose cells were the least effective in comparison. Repair was significantly better at 9 weeks compared with 6 and 3 weeks. Macroscopic examination of menisci that received cell implants showed the thickest tissue in menisci that had collagen implants, and the thinnest fill occurred in menisci treated with cells alone. Histology confirmed no cells or integrative repair in the control specimens. Conclusions. Delivery of cells alone outperformed the additional use of biomaterials. Our results suggest a strategy that would use both meniscus and synovial cells for arthroscopic meniscal repair.

This matrix covers and mechanically stabilizes the clot. There have been an increasing number of studies performed related to the AMIC technique and an update of its use and results is warranted. Using the PubMed database, a literature search was performed using the terms \"AMIC\" or \"Autologous Matrix Induced Chondrogenesis.\" A total of 19 basic science and clinical articles were identified. Ten studies that were published on the use of AMIC for knee chondral defects were identified and the results of 219 patients were analyzed. The improvements in Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective, Lysholm and Tegner scores at 2 years were comparable to the published results from autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and matrix ACI techniques for cartilage repair. Our systematic review of the current state of the AMIC technique suggests that it is a promising 1-stage cartilage repair technique. The short-term clinical outcomes and magnetic resonance imaging results are comparable to other cell-based methods. Further studies with AMIC in randomized studies versus other repair techniques such as ACI are needed in the future. ","689":"Patellofemoral instability is common and affects a predominantly young age group. Chondral injury occurs in up to 95%, and includes osteochondral fractures and loose bodies acutely and secondary degenerative changes in recurrent cases. Biomechanical abnormalities, such as trochlear dysplasia, patella alta, and increased tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove distance, predispose to both recurrent dislocations and patellofemoral arthrosis. In this article, we review the mechanisms of chondral injury in patellofemoral instability, diagnostic modalities, the distribution of lesions seen in acute and episodic dislocation, and treatments for articular cartilage lesions of the patellofemoral joint. Little specific evidence exists for cartilage treatments in patellofemoral instability. In general, the results of reparative and restorative procedures in the patellofemoral joint are inferior to those observed in other compartments of the knee. Given the increased severity of chondral lesions and progression to osteoarthritis seen with recurrent dislocations, careful consideration should be given to early stabilisation in patients with predisposing factors. ","690":"There are several choices of cells to use for cartilage repair. Cells are used as internal or external sources and sometimes in combination. In this article, an analysis of the different cell choices and their use and potential is provided. Embryonic cartilage formation is of importance when finding more about how to be able to perfect cartilage repair. Some suggestions for near future research based on up-to-date knowledge on chondrogenic cells are given to hopefully stimulate more studies on the final goal of cartilage regeneration. ","691":"The cartilage repair potential of bone marrow-derived stem cells has been well described. Harnessing this potential for human articular cartilage repair remains challenging. Accessing bone marrow repair cells through marrow stimulation techniques such as microfracture is readily achieved with generally good but inconsistent results. Animal and human studies show feasibility for ex vivo processing of bone marrow to isolate, concentrate, and culture mesenchymal stem cells. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to show consistent and clinically meaningful improvement using bone marrow cell preparations above what has been achieved with microfracture. Consequently, microfracture continues to be the simplest and most commonly used method to enhance repair of focal articular cartilage defects. Emerging preclinical work in the equine model suggests a role for enhancing marrow-stimulation techniques through the use of natural scaffolds such as autologous platelet enriched fibrin as well as optimization of joint biology through localized gene therapy to support cartilage repair. In contrast to joint replacement where inert materials of known mechanical properties are used, host biology determines the relative success, failure, and durability of cartilage repair. As such, development of personalized strategies to improve the quality and durability of bone marrow cell-based articular cartilage repair represent exciting new areas of inquiry. Continued advances in stem cell biology, scaffold technologies, and methods to delineate and enhance host biology, both systemically and within the joint, hold promise for harnessing the full power of bone marrow cells to facilitate cartilage repair and regeneration. ","692":"Chondrogenic progenitor populations, including mesenchymal stem cells, represent promising cell-based transplantation or tissue engineering therapies for the regeneration of damaged cartilage. Osteoarthritis (OA) predominantly affects the elderly and is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Advancing age is a prominent risk factor that is closely associated with the onset and progression of the disease. Understanding the influence that aging and OA have on chondrogenic progenitor cells is important to determine how these processes affect the cellular mechanisms of the cells and their capacity to differentiate into functional chondrocytes for use in therapeutic applications. Here, we review the effect of age- and OA-related changes on the growth kinetics and differentiation potential of chondrogenic progenitor cell populations. Aging differentially influences the proliferative potential of progenitor cells showing reduced growth rates with increased senescence and apoptotic activity over time, while chondrogenesis appears to be independent of donor age. Cartilage tissue affected by OA shows evidence of progenitor populations with some potential for repair, however reports on the proliferative propensity of mesenchymal stem cells and their chondrogenic potential are contradictory. This is likely attributed to the narrow age ranges of samples assessed and deficits in definitively identifying donors with OA versus healthy patients across a wide scope of advancing ages. Further studies that investigate the mechanistic effects of chondrogenic progenitor populations associated with aging and the progression of OA using clearly defined criteria and age-matched control subject groups are crucial to our understanding of the clinical relevance of these cells for use in cartilage repair therapies. ","693":"Because of its limited healing capacity, treatments for articular cartilage injuries are still challenging. Since the first report by Brittberg, autologous chondrocyte implantation has been extensively studied. Recently, as an alternative for chondrocyte-based therapy, mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy has received considerable research attention because of the relative ease in handling for tissue harvest, and subsequent cell expansion and differentiation. This review summarizes latest development of stem cell therapies in cartilage repair with special attention to scaffold-free approaches. ","694":null,"695":null,"696":"Excessive joint surface loadings, either single (acute impact event) or repetitive (cumulative contact stress), can cause the clinical syndrome of osteoarthritis (OA). Despite advances in treatment of injured joints, the risk of OA following joint injuries has not decreased in the last 50 years. Cumulative excessive articular surface contact stress that leads to OA results from post-traumatic joint incongruity and instability, and joint dysplasia, but also may cause OA in patients without known joint abnormalities. In vitro investigations show that excessive articular cartilage loading triggers release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria, and that these ROS cause chondrocyte death and matrix degradation. Preventing release of ROS or inhibiting their effects preserves chondrocytes and their matrix. Fibronectin fragments released from articular cartilage subjected to excessive loads also stimulate matrix degradation; inhibition of molecular pathways initiated by these fragments prevents this effect. Additionally, injured chondrocytes release alarmins that activate chondroprogentior cells in vitro that propogate and migrate to regions of damaged cartilage. These cells also release chemokines and cytokines that may contribute to inflammation that causes progressive cartilage loss. Distraction and motion of osteoarthritic human ankles can promote joint remodeling, decrease pain and improve joint function in patients with end-stage post-traumatic OA. These advances in understanding of how altering mechanical stresses can lead to remodeling of osteoarthritic joints and how excessive stress causes loss of articular cartilage, including identification of mechanically induced mediators of cartilage loss, provide the basis for new biologic and mechanical approaches to the prevention and treatment of OA.","697":"The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence and distribution of 2 basement membrane (BM) molecules, laminin and collagen type IV, in healthy and degenerative cartilage tissues. Normal and degenerated tissues were obtained from goats and humans, including articular knee cartilage, the intervertebral disc, and meniscus. Normal tissue was also obtained from patella-tibial enthesis in goats. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using anti-laminin and anti-collagen type IV antibodies. Human and goat skin were used as positive controls. The percentage of cells displaying the pericellular presence of the protein was graded semiquantitatively. When present, laminin and collagen type IV were exclusively found in the pericellular matrix, and in a discrete layer on the articulating surface of normal articular cartilage. In normal articular (hyaline) cartilage in the human and goat, the proteins were found co-localized pericellularly. In contrast, in human osteoarthritic articular cartilage, collagen type IV but not laminin was found in the pericellular region. Nonpathological fibrocartilaginous tissues from the goat, including the menisci and the enthesis, were also positive for both laminin and collagen type IV pericellularly. In degenerated fibrocartilage, including intervertebral disc, as in degenerated hyaline cartilage only collagen type IV was found pericellularly around chondrocytes but with less intense staining than in non-degenerated tissue. In calcified cartilage, some cells were positive for laminin but not type IV collagen. We report differences in expression of the BM molecules, laminin and collagen type IV, in normal and degenerative cartilaginous tissues from adult humans and goats. In degenerative tissues laminin is depleted from the pericellular matrix before collagen type IV. The findings may inform future studies of the processes underlying cartilage degeneration and the functional roles of these 2 extracellular matrix proteins, normally associated with BM. ","698":"We hypothesized that implanting cells in a chondral defect at a density more similar to that of the intact cartilage could induce them to synthesize matrix with the features more similar to that of the uninjured one. We compared the implantation of different doses of chondrocytes: 1 million (n = 5), 5 million (n = 5), or 5 million mesenchymal cells (n = 5) in the femoral condyle of 15 sheep. Tissue generated by microfracture at the trochlea, and normal cartilage from a nearby region, processed as the tissues resulting from the implantation, were used as references. Histological and molecular (expression of type I and II collagens and aggrecan) studies were performed. The features of the cartilage generated by implantation of mesenchymal cells and elicited by microfractures were similar and typical of a poor repair of the articular cartilage (presence of fibrocartilage, high expression of type I collagen and a low mRNA levels of type II collagen and aggrecan). Nevertheless, in the samples obtained from tissues generated by implantation of chondrocytes, hyaline-like cartilage, cell organization, low expression rates of type I collagen and high levels of mRNA corresponding to type II collagen and aggrecan were observed. These histological features, show less variability and are more similar to those of the normal cartilage used as control in the case of 5 million cells implantation than when 1 million cells were used. The implantation of autologous chondrocytes in type I\/III collagen membranes at high density could be a promising tool to repair articular cartilage.

Twenty-six 12-week-old male Lewis rats were randomly divided into 2 groups. From day 0 to day 4, the G-CSF group received glycosylated G-CSF, and the control group received phosphate-buffered saline. A 1.5-mm diameter and 1.0-mm deep osteochondral defect was introduced in the patellar groove of the bilateral femur in all rats on day 4. The peripheral blood nucleated cells were counted for 14 days from the first day of injection, the appearance of the cartilage repair was observed histologically and macroscopically for 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after surgery. The number of peripheral blood leukocytes increased 3 days and returned to normal levels 7 days after the first injection. Compared with the control group, the G-CSF group had more fibrous and\/or bony tissue at earlier points in time. The tissue repair rate, which is defined as the percentage of repaired osteochondral defects, was significantly higher in the G-CSF group 4 weeks after surgery. However, there were no significant differences in the cartilage repair rate and the modified Wakitani score between the 2 groups at each time point. The defect filling was significantly better in the G-CSF group in the early phases. Our findings suggest that G-CSF may promote the repair of osteochondral defects by mediating an increase in the number of peripheral blood nucleated cells.

The reference samples were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing proteolysis inhibitors and biomechanically tested before storage for further analyses. Samples of group 1 were biomechanically tested before and after freeze-thawing in PBS in the absence and those of group 2 in the presence of inhibitors. Samples of the group 3 were biomechanically tested in PBS-containing inhibitors, but frozen in 30% dimethyl sulfoxide\/PBS and subsequently tested in PBS supplemented with the inhibitors. Glycosaminoglycan contents of the samples and immersion solutions were analyzed, and proteoglycan structures examined with SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis. Freeze-thawing decreased slightly dynamic moduli in all 3 groups. The glycosaminoglycan contents and proteoglycan structures of the cartilage were similar in all experimental groups. Occasionally, the diffused proteoglycans were partly degraded in group 1. Digital densitometry revealed similar staining intensities for the glycosaminoglycans in all groups. Use of cryopreservant had no marked effect on the glycosaminoglycan loss during freeze-thawing. The freeze-thawed cartilage samples appear suitable for the biochemical and biomechanical studies.

This is the companion report to one previous published on the biological response. We hypothesized that these grafts would integrate with host bone and the articular surface would form fibrocartilage providing an enduring clinical benefit. Three groups (patients\/knees) were studied: OCD without a fragment (n = 12\/13), OCD with a partial fragment (n = 14\/16), and ON (n = 25\/26). Twenty-five of 52 patients were available for clinical follow-up between 12 and 21 years. Electronic medical records provided comparison clinical information. In addition, there were plain film radiographs, MRIs, plus repeat arthroscopy and biopsy on 14 patients. Autogenous bone grafts integrated with the host bone. MRI showed soft tissue covering all the grafts at long-term follow-up. Biopsy showed initial surface fibrocartilage that subsequently converted to fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage at 20 years. OCD patients had better clinical outcomes than ON patients. No OCD patients were asymptomatic at anytime following surgery. Half of the ON patients came to total knee replacement within 10 years. Autogenous bone grafting provides an alternative biological matrix to fill large-volume defects in the knee as a singular solution integrating with host bone and providing an enduring articular cartilage surface. The procedure is best suited for those with OCD. The treatment for large-volume articular defects by this method remains salvage in nature and palliative in outcome.

Twenty-two patients aged between 30 and 60 years who underwent treatment with PEMFs (4-hour treatment per day, duration 45 days) were included. All patients presented with symptomatic early OA with grade 0-2 changes (Kellgren-Lawrence classification) at the pretreatment evaluation.

Early diagnosis of OA-associated cartilage alterations would be beneficial for disease prevention and control, and for the development of disease-modifying treatments. However, early diagnosis is still hampered by a lack of quantifiable readouts in preclinical models. In this study, we have shown the potency of contrast-enhanced nanofocus x-ray computed tomography (CE-nanoCT) to be used for virtual 3-dimensional (3D) histopathology in established mouse models for OA, and we compared with standard histopathology. We showed the equivalence of CE-nanoCT images to histopathology for the modified Mankin scoring of the cartilage structure and quality. Additionally, a limited set of 3D cartilage characteristics measured by CE-nanoCT image analysis in a user-independent and semiautomatic manner, that is, average and maximum of the noncalcified cartilage thickness distribution and loss in glycosaminoglycans, was shown to be predictive for the cartilage quality and structure as can be evaluated by histopathological scoring through the use of an empirical model. We have shown that CE-nanoCT is a tool that allows virtual histopathology and 3D morphological quantification of multitissue systems, such as the chondro-osseous junction. It provides faster and more quantitative data on cartilage structure and quality compared with standard histopathology while eliminating user bias.

The defect was filled with RPMI-1640 medium in group A (control), autologous BMNCs in group B, and autologous BMNCs plus IGF-1 in group C (n = 12). Healing of the defect was assessed by gross, scanning electron microscopic, radiographic, and histological examinations up to 90 days. Gross and scanning electron microscopic examination of the healing site revealed superior gross morphology and surface architecture of the healing tissue in the animals of group C as compared to other groups. Radiographically on day 90, the defect area was not distinguishable from the surrounding area in group C, but a small circular defect area was still evident in groups A and B. The regenerated tissue was mostly hyaline in group C and fibrocartilage in groups A and B. The cells were well organized and showed better deposition of proteoglycans in groups C and B than in group A. It was concluded that implantation of bone-marrow-derived nucleated cells may facilitate the healing of osteochondral defects; however, the combination of BMNCs and IGF-1 induces faster and histologically better healing than the BMNCs alone.

Methylene blue light treatment has been shown to be successful in the literature for viral inactivation of fresh frozen plasma. The purpose of this study was to determine the capacity of methylene blue light treatment to inactivate a panel of clinically relevant viruses inoculated onto osteochondral allografts. Osteochondral grafts recovered from human cadaveric knees were inoculated with one of the following viruses: bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), porcine parvovirus (PPV), and pseudorabies virus (PrV). The samples were processed through a methylene blue light treatment, which consisted of an initial soak in nonilluminated circulating methylene blue at ambient temperature, followed by light exposure with circulating methylene blue at cool temperatures. The final titer was compared with the recovery control for the viral log reduction. HIV-1, BVDV, and PrV were reduced to nondetectable levels while HAV and PPV were reduced by 3.1 and 5.6 logs, respectively. The methylene blue light treatment was effective in reducing (a) enveloped DNA and RNA viruses to nondetectable levels and (b) nonenveloped DNA and RNA viruses of inoculated human osteochondral grafts by 3.1 to 5.6 logs.

Among those patients, 7 were found to have a unique vertical chondral fissure located on the posterior femoral head. A retrospective review of the preoperative history, physical examination, and radiographic findings in addition to the intraoperative findings and surgical procedures performed was carried out for each patient.

Three of the 7 patients in whom these lesions were identified reported an acute event preceding their pain. Of the other 4 patients, 3 were involved in sports that involved vigorous rotational hip movements: golf, tennis, and wrestling. Notably, none of these lesions were identifiable on preoperative 3-T MRI scans. This series reports on a previously undefined femoral head cartilage lesion.

Postinjury xiphoid cartilage was analyzed via 3 well-described independent means of assessing apoptosis in chondrocytes: hematoxylin and eosin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, and activated caspase-3 staining. Injured specimens contained many chondrocytes with evidence of apoptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and the liberation of apoptotic bodies. There was a statistically significant increase in the number of chondrocytes undergoing apoptosis in the injured specimens as compared with the uninjured specimens.

Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to investigate changes in protein and mRNA levels, respectively, during chondrogenesis. Safranin-O staining, immunohistochemistry, and glycoaminoglycan contents were used to assess cartilage matrix deposition. BMSC proliferation was determined by mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and cell counting. Cell cycle profiling was performed by flow cytometry. LRF overexpression effectively inhibited protein and mRNA expression of chondrocyte markers and cartilage matrix deposition during chondrogenesis of BMSC. Endogenous LRF expression was constitutively high in undifferentiated BMSC but remained low in primary articular chondrocytes. Endogenous LRF protein was downregulated in a time-dependent manner during chondrogenesis. BMSCs overexpressing LRF had higher proliferation rates and cell population in the S phase. LRF suppressed p53 expression during chondrogenesis and this might prevent differentiating chondrocytes from entering a quiescent state. Our data showed that LRF is important for stimulating stem cell proliferation and cell cycle progression.

Seven dogs received 4 sequential daily intra-articular blood injections twice in 2 weeks (mimicking 2 acute 4-day joint bleeds). Seven other dogs received the same blood load but in a total of 8 injections intermittently over the 4-week period with at least 1 day in between (mimicking micro-bleeds over the same timespan). Contralateral knees served as controls. Ten weeks after the last injection cartilage matrix turnover and synovial inflammation were evaluated. Only after the acute joint bleeds the release of newly formed and total (resident) cartilage matrix glycosaminoglycans were increased (P = 0.04 and P = 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, in animals with the acute joint bleeds cartilage glycosaminoglycan content was decreased (P = 0.01) and not in animals with micro-bleeds. Mild synovial inflammation was observed in both groups (both P &lt; 0.0001) but was not different between groups. In contrast to micro-bleeds, 2 acute joint bleeds lead to prolonged cartilage damage independent of the level of synovial inflammation.

Specimens were histologically evaluated to assess acute structural damage (articular surface cracking and cartilage crushing) resulting from the impact. Acute histologic structural damage to the cartilage had higher concordance with the high-frequency content measure than with other mechanical impact measures (delivered impact energy, impact maximum stress, and impact maximum stress rate of change). This result suggests that the frequency content of an impact force signal, specifically the proportion of higher-frequency components, can be used as a quick surrogate measure for acute structural cartilage injury. Taking advantage of this relationship could reduce the time and expense of histological processing needed to morphologically assess cartilage damage, especially for purposes of initial screening when evaluating new impaction protocols. ","721":"Although conventional radiography is used to assess osteoarthritis in a clinical setting, it has limitations, including an inability to stage early cartilage degeneration. There is a growing interest in using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging to identify degenerative changes in articular cartilage, including the large multicentered study, the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). There is a demand for suitable image registration and segmentation software to complete this analysis. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the open source software, ImageK, that registers 3 T MRI T2 mapping and double echo steady state (DESS) knee MRI sequences acquired in the OAI protocol. A C++ library, the insight toolkit, was used to develop open source software to register DESS and T2 mapping image MRI sequences using Mattes's Multimodality Mutual information metric. Registration was assessed using three separate methods. A checkerboard layout demonstrated acceptable visual alignment. Fiducial markers placed in cadaveric knees measured a registration error of 0.85 voxels. Measuring the local variation in Mattes's Mutual Information metric in the local area of the registered solution showed precision within 1 pixel. In this group, the registered solution required a transform of 56 voxels in translation and 1 degree of rotation. The software we have developed, ImageK, provides free, open source image analysis software that registers DESS and T2 mapping sequences of knee articular cartilage within 1 voxel accuracy. This image registration software facilitates quantitative MRI analyses of knee articular cartilage. ","722":"To identify factors that are responsible for the phenotypic differences between transient chondrocytes within human osteophytes prone to endochondral ossification and permanent chondrocytes within articular cartilage persisting for decades. Differential gene expression of chondrocytes from human osteophytes or from articular cartilage was detected by cDNA microarray analysis. The expression of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), one of the most impressively differentially expressed genes, was validated by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction as well as immunohistochemistry. The mode of action of PEDF was explored by cell viability assays and by detecting target genes. PEDF mRNA expression was upregulated by 118.5-fold (P = 0.01) in human osteophytic cartilage compared with articular cartilage, which was reflected by strong immunostaining for PEDF in the cartilaginous layer of osteophytes but largely negative staining in articular cartilage. Elevated levels of PEDF in osteophytes were associated with enhanced apoptosis. PEDF increased the expression of the proapoptotic factor FasL and induced cell death in cell culture. Osteochondral progenitor cells were more responsive to PEDF than differentiated articular chondrocytes. The induction of the proapoptotic factor PEDF within the osteophyte cartilage suggests a molecular concept for the transient chondrocyte phenotype that arises from progenitor cells and is prone to terminal differentiation and cell death. ","723":"Describe the local morphological response of the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex to surgical stab incision in the distal femur of foals, with emphasis on the relationship between growth cartilage injury, enchondral ossification, and repair. Nine foals were induced into general anesthesia at the age of 13 to 15 days. Four full-thickness stab incision defects were created in the cartilage on the lateral aspect of the lateral trochlear ridge of the left distal femur. Follow-up examination was carried out from 1 to 49 days postoperatively, including examination of intact bones, sawed slabs, and histological sections. Incision defects filled with cells displaying fibroblast-, chondrocyte-, and osteoblast-like characteristics, potentially validating the rationale behind the drilling of stable juvenile osteochondritis dissecans lesions in children. Incisions induced necrosis within the cartilage on the margins at all depths of the defects. Sharp dissection may therefore be contraindicated in cartilage repair in young individuals. Incisions caused a focal delay in enchondral ossification in 2 foals, apparently related to the orientation of the incision defect relative to the direction of ossification. Defects became progressively surrounded by subchondral bone, in which granulation tissue containing clasts and foci of osteoblast-like cells was observed. Continued enchondral ossification was therefore likely to result in healing of uncomplicated defects to morphologically normal bone. Epiphyseal growth cartilage injury had the potential to exert a negative effect on enchondral ossification. Enchondral ossification exerted a beneficial effect on repair. This relationship warrants consideration in future studies of cartilage injury and repair within the articular-epiphyseal cartilage complex of all species.

Additionally, the clinical and qMRI predictors of TKR were determined. Thirteen TKRs were performed in the population after a 4-year follow-up. More TKRs were performed in the placebo group than in the CS group (69% vs. 31%, P = 0.150, logistic regression). The statistically significant predictors of TKRs were, at baseline, higher WOMAC pain and function scores, presence of bone marrow lesions (BMLs), and higher C-reactive protein levels. Loss of medial cartilage volume and increase in WOMAC pain and function at one-year were also predictors of TKR. Multivariate analyses revealed that baseline presence of BML and higher WOMAC pain score were independent predictors. Time to occurrence of the TKR also favored the CS group versus placebo (log-rank, P = 0.094).

In 33 consecutive arthroscopically evaluated cartilage lesion knees the lesion size was routinely estimated. At the final treatment, a knee arthrotomy was performed, and the lesion was reestimated. The 2 estimates were then compared by paired t test and the area estimated by knee arthrotomy was used as the gold standard. Results. The mean area of the cartilage lesion estimated by arthroscopic surgery was 3.5 cm(2) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.7) whereas in the open surgery the mean area was 3.2 cm(2) (SD = 1.5). The mean difference was 0.3 cm(2), indicating a tendency toward overestimation by the arthroscopic evaluation, but the difference was not significant (P = 0.09). Additional MRI assessment of the area demonstrated a mean area of 2.3 cm(2) (SD = 1.6). This underestimated the size of the lesion by 1.2 cm(2) (SD = 0.8; P = 0.015).

The state of the art of allografts with regard to basic science, procurement and storage methods, immunogenicity, generally accepted indications and contraindications, and the rationale of the allografting procedure have been described. All studies published in PubMed from 2000 to January 2012 addressing fresh osteochondral allograft procedures in the ankle joint were identified, including those that fulfilled the following criteria: (a) level I-IV evidence addressing the areas of interest outlined above; (b) measures of functional, clinical, or imaging outcome; and (c) outcome related to ankle cartilage lesions or ankle arthritis treated by allografts. The analysis showed a progressively increasing number of articles from 2000. The number of selected articles was 14; 9 of those focused on limited dimension allografts (plugs, partial) and 5 on bipolar fresh osteochondral allografts. The evaluation of evidence level showed 14 case series and no randomized studies. Fresh osteochondral allografts are now a versatile and suitable option for the treatment of different degrees of osteochondral disease in the ankle joint and may even be used as total joint replacement. Fresh osteochondral allografts used for total joint replacement are still experimental and might be considered as a salvage procedure in otherwise unsolvable situations. A proper selection of the patients is therefore a key point. Moreover, the patients should be adequately informed about the possible risks, benefits, and alternatives to the allograft procedure. ","728":"The purpose of this systematic review was to compare activity-based outcomes after microfracture, autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), and osteochondral autograft (OAT). Multiple databases were searched with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for level III and higher studies with activity outcomes after microfracture, OAT, osteochondral allograft, and ACI. Activity-based outcomes included the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), the Tegner Score, the Cincinnati Knee scores, the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) subjective knee score, the Marx activity score, and\/or the rate of return-to-sport. Twenty studies were included (1,375 patients). Although results were heterogeneous, significant advantages were seen for ACI and OAT as compared with microfracture in Tegner scores at 1 year (ACI vs. microfracture, P = 0.0016), IKDC scores at 2 years (ACI vs microfracture, P = 0.046), Lysholm scores at 1 year (OAT vs microfracture, P = 0.032), and Marx scores at 2 years (OAT vs microfracture, P &lt; 0.001). The only score or time point to favor microfracture was Lysholm score at 1 year (ACI vs microfracture, P = 0.037). No other standardized outcome measures or time points were significantly different. Several studies demonstrated significantly earlier return to competition with microfracture. Overall reoperation rates were similar, but of reoperations, a higher proportion of those following ACI were unplanned with the majority of performed for graft delamination or hypertrophy. ACI and OAT may have some benefits over microfracture, although return-to-sport is fastest following microfracture. Heterogeneity in technique, outcome measures, and patient populations hampers systematic comparison within the current literature. ","729":"Early osteoarthritis (OA) is increasingly being recognized in patients who wish to remain active while not accepting the limitations of conservative treatment or joint replacement. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the existing evidence for treatment of patients with early OA using articular cartilage repair techniques. A systematic search was performed in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane collaboration. Articles were screened for relevance and appraised for quality. Nine articles of generally low methodological quality (mean Coleman score 58) including a total of 502 patients (mean age range = 36-57 years) could be included. In the reports, both radiological and clinical criteria for early OA were applied. Of all patients included in this review, 75% were treated with autologous chondrocyte implantation. Good short-term clinical outcome up to 9 years was shown. Failure rates varied from 8% to 27.3%. The conversion to total knee arthroplasty rate was 2.5% to 6.5%. Although a (randomized controlled) trial in this patient category with long-term follow-up is needed, the literature suggests autologous chondrocyte implantation could provide good short- to mid-term clinical outcome and delay the need for total knee arthroplasty. The use of standardized criteria for early OA and implementation of (randomized) trials with long-term follow-up may allow for further expansion of the research field in articular cartilage repair to the challenging population with (early) OA. ","730":"Anatomic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is common procedure performed by orthopedic surgeons, particularly in association with sports-related injuries. Whereas traditional reconstruction techniques used a single bundle graft that was typically placed in a non-anatomic position, a renewed interest in anatomy has facilitated the popularization of anatomic reconstruction techniques. Recently, a focus has been placed on individualizing ACL surgery based on each patient's native anatomical characteristics (e.g., insertion site size, notch size, and shape), thereby dictating the ultimate procedure of choice. As subjective outcome measurements have demonstrated varying outcomes with respect to single- versus double-bundle ACL reconstruction, investigators have turned to more objective techniques, such as in vivo kinematics, as a means of evaluating joint motion and cartilage contact mechanics. Further investigation in this area may yield important information with regard to the potential progression to osteoarthritis after ACL reconstruction, including factors affecting or preventing it. ","731":"The goals of this study are to address several questions, the answers to which are key to the understanding and eventually to the prevention of this frequent source of morbidity. These questions include the following: (1) What is the natural history of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) deficiency? (2) How important is the status of the meniscus at the time of reconstruction? (3) Does ACL reconstruction prevent the development of osteoarthritis in the long term? (4) Can we predict which patients will develop osteoarthritis? (5) What can be done? This study addresses the key questions above through the long-term follow-up of a cohort of patients treated with ACL reconstruction by Professor Henri Dejour in Lyon, France, supplemented with a review of the relevant literature. The prevalence of osteoarthritis in ACL-deficient knees is about 40% after 15 years and close to 90% after 25 to 35 years. It remains unclear whether reconstruction of the ACL significantly reduces this risk. The status of the meniscus at the time of ACL reconstruction is a strong predictor of the risk of osteoarthritis: Patients who undergo total meniscectomy are at 2- to 10-fold increased risk of developing osteoarthritis relative to those with intact menisci. Patients showing early evidence of arthritis at short- to medium-term follow-up are at high risk for progression over subsequent years. Numerous emerging techniques may provide tools to more effectively prevent and treat osteoarthritis following ACL injury in the future. Osteoarthritis following ACL injury continues to be a major problem requiring further research. ","732":"Joint injuries are common, especially among young adults aged 18 to 44 years. They are accompanied by a cascade of events that increase the risk of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Therefore, understanding of biological responses that predispose to PTOA should help in determining treatment modalities to delay and\/or prevent the onset and progression of the disease. The vast majority of the literature pointed to chondrocyte death and apoptosis, inflammation and matrix damage\/fragmentation being the earliest events that follow joint trauma. Together these events lead to the development of osteoarthritis-like focal cartilage lesions that if untreated have a tendency to expand and progress to fully developed disease. Currently, the only treatments available for joint trauma are surgical interventions. Experimental biologic approaches involve engineering of cartilage with the use of cells (stem cells or chondrocytes), juvenile or adult cartilage pieces, scaffolds, and various polymeric matrices. The major challenge for all of them is regeneration of normal functional mature hyaline cartilage that can sustain the load, resist compression, and most important, integrate with the host tissue. If the tissue is spontaneously repaired it fails to reproduce original structure and function and thus, may be more susceptible to re-injury. Thus, there is a critical need to develop novel molecular mechanism-based therapeutic approaches to biologic chondral and\/or osteochondral repair. The focus of this review is on the earliest molecular and cellular manifestations of injury that can be grouped based on the following therapeutic options for PTOA: chondroprotection, anti-inflammatory, matrix protection, and matrix remodeling\/matrix synthesis.

ADAMTS-12 is up-regulated during in vitro chondrogenesis and embryonic limb development; however, the regulation of ADAMTS-12 expression in cartilage remains unknown. The transcription factor c-Maf is a member of Maf family of basic ZIP (bZIP) transcription factors. Expression of c-Maf is highest in hypertrophic chondrocytes during embryonic development and postnatal growth. We hypothesize that c-Maf and ADAMTS-12 are co-expressed during chondrocyte differentiation and that c-Maf regulates ADAMTS-12 expression during chondrogenesis. Promoter analysis and species alignments identified potential c-Maf binding sites in the ADAMTS-12 promoter. c-Maf and ADAMTS-12 co-expression was monitored during chondrogenesis of stem cell pellet cultures. Luciferase expression driven by ADAMTS-12 promoter segments was measured in the presence and absence of c-Maf, and synthetic oligonucleotides were used to confirm specific binding of c-Maf to ADAMTS-12 promoter sequences. In vitro chondrogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells revealed co-expression of ADAMTS-12 and c-Maf during differentiation. Truncation and point mutations of the ADAMTS-12 promoter evaluated in reporter assays localized the response to the proximal 315 bp of the ADAMTS-12 promoter, which contained a predicted c-Maf recognition element (MARE) at position -61. Electorphoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that c-Maf directly interacted with the MARE at position -61. These data suggest that c-Maf is involved in chondrocyte differentiation and hypertrophy, at least in part, through the regulation of ADAMTS-12 expression at a newly identified MARE in its proximal promoter.

Primary or passage 3 bovine chondrocytes were seeded in fibrin-polyurethane scaffolds. Constructs were cultured either free-swelling for 2 or 4 weeks, under direct mechanical loading for 2 or 4 weeks, or free swelling for 2 weeks followed by 2 weeks of loading. Samples were collected for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification, mRNA expression of chondrogenic genes, immunohistochemistry, and histology. Mechanical loading generally stimulated GAG synthesis, up-regulated chondrogenic genes, and improved the accumulation of matrix in cell-laden constructs when compared with free-swelling controls. Primary chondrocytes underwent more effective cartilage maturation when compared with passaged chondrocytes. Constructs of primary chondrocytes that were initially free-swelling followed by 2 weeks of mechanical load (delayed) had overall highest GAG with strongest responsiveness to load regarding matrix synthesis. Constructs that experienced the delayed loading regime also demonstrated most favorable chondrogenic gene expression profiles in both primary and third passage cells. Furthermore, most intense matrix staining and immunostaining of collagen type II and aggrecan were visualized in these constructs. Primary chondrocytes were more effective than passage 3 chondrocytes when chondrogenesis was concerned. The most efficient chondrogenesis resulted from primary articular chondrocytes, which were initially free-swelling followed by a standardized loading protocol.

We investigated whether image-guided methods (optically guided and template guided) can improve the outcome of these procedures. Fifteen sheep were operated to create traumatic chondral injuries in each knee. After 4 months, the chondral defect in one knee was repaired using (a) conventional approach, (b) optically guided method, or (c) template-guided method. For both image-guided groups, harvest and delivery sites were preoperatively planned using custom-made software. During optically guided surgery, instrument position and orientation were tracked and superimposed onto the surgical plan. For the template-guided group, plastic templates were manufactured to allow an exact fit between template and the joint anatomy. Cylindrical holes within the template guided surgical tools according to the plan. Three months postsurgery, both knees were harvested and computed tomography scans were used to compare the reconstructed versus the native pre-injury joint surfaces. For each repaired defect, macroscopic (International Cartilage Repair Society [ICRS]) and histological repair (ICRS II) scores were assessed. Three months after repair surgery, both image-guided surgical approaches resulted in significantly better histology scores compared with the conventional approach (improvement by 55%, P &lt; 0.02).

Implant residency and osteochondral repair were assessed at 1 day (N = 1), 3 weeks (N = 2), or 3 months (N = 2) postoperative using fluorescence microscopy, histomorphometry, stereology, and micro-computed tomography. Chitosan implants were retained in 89% of treated Jamshidi holes up to 3 weeks postoperative. At 3 weeks, biopsy sites were variably covered by cartilage flow, and most bone holes contained cartilage flow fragments and heterogeneous granulation tissues with sparse leukocytes, stromal cells, and occasional adipocytes (volume density 1% to 3%). After 3 months of repair, most Jamshidi bone holes were deeper, remodeling at the edges, filled with angiogenic granulation tissue, and lined with variably sized chondrogenic foci fused to bone trabeculae or actively repairing bone plate. The 150-kDa chitosan implant elicited more subchondral cartilage formation compared with 40-kDa chitosan-treated and control defects (P &lt; 0.05, N = 4). Treated defects contained more mineralized repair tissue than control defects at 3 months (P &lt; 0.05, N = 12). Bone plate-induced chondroinduction is an articular cartilage repair mechanism.

The objective of this study was to analyze longitudinal changes in cartilage thickness using detailed change maps and to examine if current methods for subregional analysis are able to capture the underlying cartilage changes. MRI images of 267 knees from 135 participants were acquired at baseline and 21-month follow-up and processed using a fully automatic framework for cartilage segmentation and quantification. The framework provides an anatomical coordinate system that allows for direct comparison across cartilage thickness maps. The reproducibility of this method was evaluated on 37 scan-rescan image pairs. In OA knees, an annualized thickness loss of 3.7% was observed in the medial femoral cartilage plate (MF) whereas subregional measurements varied between -9.0% (loss) and 1.6%. The largest changes were observed in the posterior part of the MF. In the medial tibial cartilage plate (MT), a thickness increase of 0.4% was observed whereas subregional measurements varied between -0.8% (loss) and 1.6%. In addition, notable differences in the patterns of cartilage change were observed between genders. This study indicated that the spatial changes, although highly heterogeneous, showed distinct patterns of cartilage thinning and cartilage thickening in both the MF and the MT.

The cell-seeding procedure whereby the membrane is sutured into the defect has a similar structural repair capacity than traditional ACI techniques. However, when the cell-seeded membrane was glued into the defect, the outcome appeared inferior. These findings indicate that optimizing the goat model and the postoperative recovery does allow preclinical evaluation of ACI-based cartilage implants in a load-bearing setting.

FDA Guidance Documents, FDA Panel Meetings, scientific organization recommendations, and clinicaltrials.gov were reviewed to demonstrate the current thinking of FDA and the scientific community on the regulatory process for cartilage repair therapies. Cartilage repair therapies can receive market approval from FDA as medical devices, drugs, or biologics, and the specific classification of product can affect the nonclinical, clinical, and regulatory strategy to bring the product to market. Recent FDA guidance gives an outline of the required elements to bring a cartilage repair product to market, although these standards are often very general. As a result, companies have to carefully craft their study patient population, comparator group, and clinical endpoint to best showcase their product's attributes. In addition, regulatory strategy and manufacturing process validation need to be considered early in the clinical study process to allow for timely product approval following the completion of clinical study.

","748":"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about how the biochemical properties of collagen change during tissue regeneration following cartilage damage. In the current study, temporal changes in cartilage repair tissue biochemistry were assessed in a rabbit osteochondral defect.  DESIGN: Bilateral full thickness 3mm osteochondral trochlear groove defects were created in 54 adult male skeletally mature New Zealand white rabbits and tissue repair monitored over 16 weeks. Collagen content, cross-links, lysyl hydroxylation, gene expression, histological grading, and FTIR analyses were performed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 weeks.  RESULTS: Defect fill occurred at ~4 weeks post-injury, however, histological grading showed that the repair tissue never became normal, primarily due to the presence of fibrocartilage. Gene expression levels of Col1a1 and Col1a2 were higher in the defect compared to adjacent regions. Collagen content in the repair tissue reached the level of normal cartilage at 6 weeks, but it took 12 weeks for the extent of lysine hydroxylation to return to normal. Divalent immature cross-links markedly increased in the early stages of repair. Though the levels gradually diminished thereafter, they never returned to the normal levels. The mature cross-link, pyridinoline, gradually increased with time and nearly reached normal levels by week 16. Infrared imaging data of protein content paralleled the biochemical data. However, collagen maturity, a parameter previously shown to reflect collagen cross-link ratios in bone, did not correlate with the biochemical determination of cross-links in the repair tissue..

Case series; Level of evidence, IV. ","752":"We investigated the feasibility of delayed computed tomography (CT) arthrography for evaluation of human knee cartilage in vivo. Especially, the diffusion of contrast agent out of the joint space and the optimal time points for imaging were determined. Two patients were imaged using delayed CT arthrography and delayed gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage (dGEMRIC) techniques. Two hours after injection, the concentration of contrast agent in the joint space was still high enough (20% to 24.5% of the initial concentration at 0 minutes) to allow delayed CT arthrography. The half-life of the contrast agent in the joint space varied from 30 to 60 minutes. The contrast agent concentration in patellar and femoral cartilage reached the maximum after 30 and 60 minutes, respectively. According to dGEMRIC, there were no differences between patients. However, in delayed CT arthrography, the penetration of the contrast agent was higher in the osteoarthritic knee cartilage. Contrast agent remained in the joint space long enough to enable delayed CT arthrography of cartilage. After 30 minutes, the normalized contrast agent concentration was higher in the cartilage of the osteoarthritic knee in comparison with the healthy knee. To conclude, delayed CT arthrography exhibited potential for use in the clinical evaluation of cartilage integrity.

Patients who completed initial blinded treatment were allowed to enroll into this extension protocol that permitted retreatment with Gel-200 when eligibility criteria were met. Retreatment was administered with a Gel-200 injection, without knowledge of initial treatment assignment (Gel-200 or PBS). Retreated patients were followed for up to 13 weeks. In the extension phase, durability of response following the first injection was analyzed by time to retreatment eligibility. During separate extension and retreatment phases, responses were assessed by WOMAC pain, stiffness, and physical function subscores, total score, and global assessments of disease activity (patient, physician) as well as safety of Gel-200. In the extension phase, time-to-event analyses through 26 weeks following the initial injection showed statistically significantly longer times to retreatment in patients receiving Gel-200 compared with PBS (P &lt; 0.05). Retreatment with Gel-200, e.g., a second injection, resulted in statistically significant improvements from retreatment baseline in all outcome measures (P &lt; 0.0001). The incidence and type of adverse events after retreatment were comparable to those observed following initial injection of Gel-200 without allergic reactions, including \"pseudosepsis\" or unanticipated treatment-related serious adverse events. These data demonstrate that a single injection of Gel-200 resulted in durable effectiveness through 26 weeks and that repeated treatment with Gel-200 relieved symptomatic osteoarthritis with a favorable safety profile.

The goal of this report is to describe a combined biological and mechanical approach to restore all morphological and functional knee properties. We treated a 50-year-old woman, who was affected by a posttraumatic osteochondral lesion and depression of the lateral tibial plateau with knee valgus deviation. The mechanical axis was corrected with a lateral tibial plateau elevation osteotomy, the damaged joint surface was replaced by a recently developed biomimetic osteochondral scaffold, and a hinged dynamic external fixator was applied to protect the graft and at the same time to allow postoperative joint mobilization. A marked clinical improvement was documented at 12 months and further improved up to 5 years, with pain-free full range of motion and return to previous activities. The MRI evaluation at 12 and 24 months showed that the implant remained in site with a hyaline-like signal and restoration of the articular surface.

Furthermore, a brief discussion of the state of the art of current cell printing procedures mimicking native cartilage is offered in light of their use as future alternatives for cartilage tissue engineering. Inkjet cell printing, controlled deposition cell printing tools, and laser cell printing are cutting-edge techniques in this context. The development of mimetic hydrogels with specific biological properties relevant to articular cartilage native tissue will support the development of improved, functional, and novel engineered tissue for clinical application. ","762":"The articular cartilage of autologous osteochondral grafts is typically different in structure and function from local host cartilage and thereby presents a remodeling challenge. The hypothesis of this study was that properties of the articular cartilage of trochlear autografts and adjacent femoral condyle are associated with the 3-D geometrical match between grafted and contralateral joints at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Autografts were transferred unilaterally from the lateral trochlea (LT) to the medial femoral condyle (MFC) in adult Spanish goats. Operated and contralateral Non-Operated joints were harvested at 6 and 12 months, and analyzed by indentation testing, micro-computed tomography, and histology to compare (1) histological indices of repair, (2) 3-D structure (articular surface deviation, bone-cartilage interface deviation, cartilage thickness), (3) indentation stiffness, and (4) correlations between stiffness and 3-D structure. Cartilage deterioration was present in grafts at 6 months and more severe at 12 months. Cartilage thickness and normalized stiffness of Operated MFC were lower than Non-Operated MFC within the graft and proximal adjacent host regions. Operated MFC articular surfaces were recessed relative to Non-Operated MFC and exhibited lower cartilage stiffness with increasing recession. Sites with large bone-cartilage interface deviations, both proud and recessed, were associated with recessed articular surfaces and low cartilage stiffness. The effectiveness of cartilage repair by osteochondral grafting is associated with the match of 3-D cartilage and bone geometry to the native osteochondral structure.

Such is the case with the isolated form of patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Studies that describe methods for treating such conditions are few, and the results are not too promising. In this article, we present one such case of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis in which we used a new approach combining periosteal transplantation on one side and the autologous matrix-induced chondrogenesis (AMIC) technique on the other side. The patient has improved, measured by the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) from 48 preoperatively to 77 at 1 year postoperatively (mean improvement) and measured by the Lysholm score from 45 preoperatively to 90 at 1 year postoperatively.

Rabbit chondrocytes isolated from articular or auricular chondrocytes were assessed for chondrogenic differentiation potential versus population doubling using different expansion and differentiation conditions. Expansion conditions included serum alone, serum plus basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), and serum plus insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and FGF-2. Differentiation conditions consisted of defined medium with and without bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2). Nonsupplemented chondrocytes showed limited expandability, whereas supplementation with FGF-2 allowed articular chondrocytes to be expanded past 10 population doublings (PDs) and allowed auricular chondrocytes to expand past 15 population doublings. Differentiation, as measured by glycosaminoglycan production in aggregate cultures, was minimal in articular chondrocytes without BMP-2 supplementation and diminished to less than 50% maximal in auricular chondrocytes by PD 20. However, when FGF-2 was used during expansion and BMP-2 used during differentiation, both articular and auricular chondrocytes retained greater than 50% maximal differentiation for more than 25 PDs. The addition of IGF-1 to FGF-2 during expansion decreased chondrogenicity of auricular chondrocytes exposed to BMP-2, whereas for articular chondrocytes, chondrogenic expression increased. These results demonstrate that FGF-2, for expansion, and BMP-2, for differentiation, dramatically increase the functional expansion of auricular and articular chondrocytes and provide a methodology to expand sufficient numbers of chondrocytes for tissue engineering applications.

We aimed to describe the distribution of lubricin in the other articulating structures in the human knee and hip-menisci and labra-and to relate this distribution to the degree of tissue degeneration. Eighteen menisci and 6 labra were obtained from patients with osteoarthritis undergoing total knee and total hip replacements, respectively. Macroscopically intact specimens were fixed in formalin and processed for H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemical evaluation with an antilubricin monoclonal antibody. Lubricin was found in all tissues as a discrete layer on the tissue surface, within the extracellular matrix, and intracellularly, indicating that it plays a role in the tribology of these tissues in human subjects, and can be synthesized by cells within the tissues. While none of the samples displayed macroscopic tears, approximately 40% of the surface of the menisci and 80% of the surface of the labra displayed microscopic fibrillations and slight fraying. There was no effect of the degenerative changes on the distribution of lubricin. Lubricin coats nearly the entirety of the surfaces of menisci and labra, including microfibrillations and tears, with possible implications towards the tribology of the tissues and healing of tissue damage. ","768":"To identify consensus recommendations for the arthroscopic delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant. An invited panel was assembled on November 20 and 21, 2009 as an international advisory board in Zurich, Switzerland, to discuss and identify best practices for the arthroscopic delivery of matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. Arthroscopic matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation is suitable for patients 18 to 55 years of age who have symptomatic, contained chondral lesions of the knee with normal or corrected alignment and stability. This technical note describes consensus recommendations of the international advisory board for the technique of arthroscopic delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant. Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation can be further improved by arthroscopic delivery that does not require special instrumentation. In principle, arthroscopic versus open procedures of delivery of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implant are less invasive and may potentially result in less postoperative pain, less surgical site morbidity, and faster surgical recovery. Long-term studies are needed to confirm these assumptions as well as the efficacy and safety of this arthroscopic approach. ","769":"Safe articular cartilage lesion stabilization is an important early surgical intervention advance toward mitigating articular cartilage disease burden. While short-term chondrocyte viability and chondrosupportive matrix modification have been demonstrated within tissue contiguous to targeted removal of damaged articular cartilage, longer term tissue responses require evaluation to further clarify treatment efficacy. The purpose of this study was to examine surface chondrocyte responses within contiguous tissue after lesion stabilization. Nonablation radiofrequency lesion stabilization of human cartilage explants obtained during knee replacement was performed for surface fibrillation. Time-dependent chondrocyte viability, nuclear morphology and cell distribution, and temporal response kinetics of matrix and chaperone gene transcription indicative of differentiated chondrocyte function were evaluated in samples at intervals to 96 hours after treatment. Subadjacent surface articular cartilage chondrocytes demonstrated continued viability for 96 hours after treatment, a lack of increased nuclear fragmentation or condensation, persistent nucleic acid production during incubation reflecting cellular assembly behavior, and transcriptional up-regulation of matrix and chaperone genes indicative of retained biosynthetic differentiated cell function. The results of this study provide further evidence of treatment efficacy and suggest the possibility to manipulate or induce cellular function, thereby recruiting local chondrocytes to aid lesion recovery. Early surgical intervention may be viewed as a tissue rescue, allowing articular cartilage to continue displaying biological responses appropriate to its function rather than converting to a tissue ultimately governed by the degenerative material property responses of matrix failure. Early intervention may positively impact the late changes and reduce disease burden of damaged articular cartilage.

For procedures in which in vitro-cultured autologous chondrocytes are implanted under a periosteal or synthetic membrane cover, or seeded onto a porous membrane or scaffold, little is known about how the number of cells affects the clinical outcome. Few published clinical studies address the cell seeding density that was employed.

It was hypothesized that the autogenous bone graft would integrate and the portion exposed to the articular surface would form fibrocartilage, which would endure for years. Between September 29, 1987 and August 8, 1994, there were 51 patients treated with autogenous bone grafting for large-volume osteochondral defects. Twenty-five of the 51 patients were available for long-term follow-up up to 21 years. Patient follow-up was accomplished by clinical opportunity and intentional research. Videotapes were available on all index surgeries for review and comparison. All had preoperative and postoperative plain film radiographs. Long-term follow-up included MRI up to 21 years. Second-look arthroscopy and biopsy were obtained on 14 patients between 8 weeks and 20 years. Radiological assessment showed the autogenous bone grafts integrated with the host bone. The grafts retained the physical geometry of the original placement. MRI showed soft tissue covering the grafts in all cases at long-term follow-up. Interval biopsy showed the surface covered with fibrous tissue at 8 weeks and subsequently converted to fibrocartilage with hyaline cartilage at 20 years. Autogenous bone grafting provides a matrix for large osteochondral defects that integrates with the host bone and results in a surface repair of fibrocartilage and hyaline cartilage that can endure for up to 20 years.

To induce knee OA, 35 Japanese White rabbits underwent anterior cruciate ligament transection. Intra-articular injections of 0.3 mL solution of each material were started at 4 weeks postoperatively for a total of 5 weekly injections. Seventy knees were divided into the following groups: AL430 (430 kDa molecular weight UPLE alginate), AL1000 (1,000 kDa), AL1700 (1,700 kDa), HA (hyaluronan), and NS (normal saline). At 9 weeks postoperatively, all knees were assessed macroscopically, histologically, and mechanically. Macroscopically, the UPLE alginate groups exhibited milder cartilage degradation compared to that of the NS and HA groups. Histological findings of the UPLE alginate groups showed an obvious reduction in the severity of OA. The histological scores of Kikuchi et al. were superior in the alginate treatment groups compared to the NS group. The friction coefficient of the AL1000 group was significantly lower than that of the NS and HA groups.

Human cartilage biopsies from OA and control donors were subjected to genome-wide oligonucleotide microarrays. Genes involved in WNT signaling were selected using the BioRetis database, KEGG pathway analysis was searched using DAVID software tools, and cluster analysis was performed using Genesis software. Results from the microarray analysis were verified using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. In order to study the impact of cytokines for the dysregulated WNT signaling, OA and control chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin-1 and analyzed with real-time PCR for their expression of WNT-related genes. Several WNT markers displayed a significantly altered expression in OA compared to normal cartilage. Interestingly, inhibitors of the canonical and planar cell polarity WNT signaling pathways displayed significantly increased expression in OA cartilage, while the Ca(2+)\/WNT signaling pathway was activated. Both real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry verified the microarray results. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that interleukin-1 upregulated expression of important WNT markers. WNT signaling is significantly affected in OA cartilage. The result suggests that both the canonical and planar cell polarity WNT signaling pathways were partly inhibited while the Ca(2+)\/WNT pathway was activated in OA cartilage.

Therefore, other treatment modalities must be combined with microfracture to improve repair tissue quality. In this study, we combined exogenous hyaluronic acid with microfracture. Thirty mature New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups as control, microfracture (MF), and microfracture and hyaluronic acid (MFHA). Four-millimetre full-thickness cartilage defects were created in the medial femoral condyle of each rabbit. Microfracture was performed on defects in the MF and MFHA groups. At 1 week following surgery, 1 mL of saline was injected into the knees of the control and MF groups, whereas 1 mL (15 mg\/mL) hyaluronic acid was injected into the knees of the MFHA group 3 times weekly.

A total of 150 patients who underwent ACI for cartilage defects at the knee were assigned to the present study and asked about their expectations and estimation concerning the ACI procedure. Patients were asked to answer 4 questions of a web-based questionnaire concerning their expectations on clinical outcome and on factors they considered relevant for clinical outcome. A total of 118 (79%) returned questionnaires. Mean patient age was 32.6 years and mean defects size was 4.1 cm(2). A proportion of 70% (n = 83) of patients expected pain-free sports participation as a result of the ACI surgery, including 24 patients who expected to return to high-impact sports without any restrictions. Only 12.7% expected a reduction but persistence of pain during everyday activities. Concerning factors that influence outcome, the majority of the patients (55.1%) considered defect characteristics (i.e., size and location) most important for clinical outcome, whereas only a small proportion of patients considered rehabilitation (7.6%), cell quality (10.2%), or prior surgeries (4.2%) more relevant for final outcome.

","782":"Autologous chondrocyte transplantation has become an established therapy for full-thickness cartilage defects. Cell-seeded collagen matrix-supported autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACT-CS) has been introduced as a modification of conventional ACT, which allows easier handling and is intended to combine the advantages of using a cell suspension (i.e., cell viability and mitotic activity) with the stability and self-containment provided by a matrix of biomaterials. Unlike other techniques and products, this seeding step can be easily applied using a porcine collagen type I\/III membrane and autologous chondrocytes in an operating room setting. Although some suturing is required, this technique provides the distinct advantage of not requiring a water-tight seal of the bilayer membrane, as is required using the classic cell suspension technique. Comparable to other modifications of ACT, the ACT-CS procedure requires a specific surgical technique that focuses on the following important details: (1) accurate debridement of the cartilage defect; (2) preparation of the cells, and seeding and containment of the cells within the transplantation site; and (3) sealing and suturing around the defect. A consensus meeting of leading European orthopedic surgeons specializing in cartilage repair was convened to discuss and standardize the surgical aspects of this technique.

Although recent treatments for damage to articular cartilage have been successful in alleviating symptoms, more durable and complete, long-term articular surface restoration remains the unattained goal. In this article, we look at both new ways to prevent damage to articular surfaces as well as new techniques to recreate biomechanically sound and biochemically true articular surfaces once an athlete injures this surface. This goal should include reproducing hyaline cartilage with a well-integrated and flexible subchondral base and the normal zonal variability in the articular matrix. A number of nonoperative interventions have shown early promise in mitigating cartilage symptoms and in preclinical studies have shown evidence of chondroprotection. These include the use of glucosamine, chondroitin, and other neutraceuticals, viscosupplementation with hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, and pulsed electromagnetic fields. Newer surgical techniques, some already in clinical study, and others on the horizon offer opportunities to improve the surgical restoration of the hyaline matrix often disrupted in athletic injury. These include new scaffolds, single-stage cell techniques, the use of mesenchymal stem cells, and gene therapy. Although many of these treatments are in the preclinical and early clinical study phase, they offer the promise of better options to mitigate the sequelae of athletically induced cartilage.

This can present a clinical dilemma to the physician managing the patient who, despite the presence of radiologically confirmed disease, has few symptoms and wishes to maintain an active lifestyle. We reviewed meta-analyses and systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials about clinical management of knee osteoarthritis with special interest on effect sizes. Numerous management options have undergone the rigor of clinical trials and subsequently have been summarized in meta-analyses and systematic reviews, the results of which offer evidence regarding varying degrees of effect. Based on the available evidence, most summaries and clinical practice guidelines suggest a regimen of patient education, self-management, weight control, and exercise supported by individualized pain management strategies. Other noninvasive or less invasive strategies are available that have varying degrees of effect.

Most soccer-related joint injuries occur in the lower extremities, with 16% to 46% occurring in the knee and 17% to 40% occurring in the ankle. Because of the limited healing capacity of cartilage and other intra-articular soft tissue structures, such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscus, joint injuries often lead to the development of early disabling osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis in soccer players is 5 to 12 times more frequent than in the general population and diagnosed 4 to 5 years earlier. It remains a major cause of disability from this sport. This review focuses on the epidemiology of soccer-related joint injuries and subsequent development of osteoarthritis in the hip, knee, and ankle joints. As well, two different pathways for pathogenesis are described: (1) primary osteoarthritis via direct trauma to the articular cartilage and (2) secondary osteoarthritis that occurs indirectly through injury to the soft tissue structures that subsequently result in articular cartilage degeneration and loss.

Twenty studies describing 1,469 athletes including football players with articular cartilage injury were reviewed. Average return to sport was 79% without a significant difference in return rate or postoperative level of play between cartilage repair techniques. Time to return varied between 7 to 17 months, with the longest time for autologous chondrocyte transplantation (ACI). Advanced sport-specific rehabilitation was able to reduce recovery time. Durability of results was best after ACI, with up to 96% continued sport participation after more than 3 years. Player age, time between injury and treatment, competitive level, defect size, and repair tissue morphology affected the ability to return to play. Sports participation after cartilage repair generally promoted joint restoration and functional recovery. Articular cartilage repair allows for a high rate of return to high-impact sports including football, often at the preinjury competitive level.

These injuries can cause significant disability, result in loss of playing time, and predispose players to osteoarthritis. Osteochondral allografting is an increasingly popular treatment option for osteoarticular lesions in athletes. Osteochondral allografts provide mature, orthotopic hyaline cartilage on an osseous scaffold that serves as an attachment vehicle, which is rapidly replaced via creeping substitution, leading to reliable graft integration that allows for simplified rehabilitation and accelerated return to sport. The indications for meniscal replacement in football players are currently still evolving. Meniscus allografts offer potential functional, analgesic, and chondroprotective benefits in the meniscectomized knee. In the player at the end of his or her professional\/competitive career, meniscal allografts can play a role in averting progression of chondropenia and facilitating knee function and an active lifestyle.

Football players reported 72% good to excellent results with significant overall improvement of knee function and activity scores. Return to football was 83% in competitive players but lower in recreational players. Eighty percent of players returned to the same competitive level after ACI, and 87% to 100% maintained their ability to play sports at 5 years postoperatively. Return to sport was better for younger, competitive players with shorter intervals between injury and ACI. New developments of the surgical technique and postoperative rehabilitation were able to reduce the limitations associated with first-generation ACI including invasiveness, graft hypertrophy, and particularly long postoperative rehabilitation. This allowed for faster return to sports like football without compromising the ability for continued competition over time.

This article provides an overview of the basic science and the current published scientific evidence for articular cartilage repair using the microfracture technique in elite football (soccer) athletes. In addition, the senior author documents his results in a case series of professional football (soccer) players treated with microfracture. Twenty-one professional male soccer players underwent microfracture for knee articular cartilage defects. Nineteen players had isolated cartilage injuries, and 2 players had simultaneous anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Average age of the player was 27 years (range, 18-32 years). Twelve players (57%) had single defects, and 9 (43%) had multiple defects. All players complied with the postoperative rehabilitation program. Twenty players (95%) returned to professional soccer the season following microfracture surgery and continued to play for an average of 5 years (range, 1-13 years). Years of continued play inversely correlated with player age at the time of microfracture (r = -0.41). Articular cartilage repair with the microfracture technique followed by appropriate rehabilitation provides restoration of knee joint function in professional football (soccer) players with a high rate of return to football (soccer) and continued participation under the significant demands of professional football (soccer). Thorough understanding of the technical aspects, rehabilitation, and literature can help to optimize the results of microfracture in the athletic population. ","795":"Soccer players and athletes in high-impact sports are frequently affected by knee injuries. Injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament and menisci are frequently observed in soccer players and may increase the risk of developing an articular cartilage lesion. In high-level athletes, the overall prevalence of knee articular cartilage lesions has been reported to be 36% to 38%. The treatment for athletic patients with articular cartilage lesions is often challenging because of the high demands placed on the repair tissue by impact sports. Cartilage defects in athletes can be treated with microfracture, osteochondral grafting, and autologous chondrocyte implantation. There is increasing scientific evidence for cartilage repair in athletes, with more extensive information available for microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation than for osteochondral grafting. The reported rates and times to return to sport at the preinjury level are variable in recreational players, with the best results seen in younger and high-level athletes. Better return to sport is consistently observed for all repair techniques with early cartilage repair. Besides minimizing sensorimotor deficits and addressing accompanying pathologies, the quality of the repair tissue may be a significant factor for the return to sport.

A repeated-measures reliability study was employed to determine the intraday and interday reliability of sCOMP in a physically active cohort. A total of 23 subjects were recruited to the laboratory on 3 separate occasions for nonfasting serum collection. Subjects had no history of lower extremity surgery and were free from acute injury within the last 3 months. Our results indicate strong reliability for both intraday intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (0.76) and interday ICC (0.74) sCOMP values. Our results demonstrate that following 30 minutes of inactivity, nonfasting serum samples remain stable over the course of 1 day and between 2 consecutive days in a healthy population with no history of lower extremity surgery. Future research studies are needed to further investigate the magnitude of change in this biomarker for patients with acute articular cartilage damage to determine its appropriateness for use in this population and for varying degrees of articular cartilage severity. ","800":"Anecdotal evidence suggests that MRI frequently underestimates the size of cartilage defects when compared with final lesion size after debridement of all degenerated tissue. This has potential implications for the choice of cartilage repair technique since most treatment algorithms are primarily driven by defect size. We conducted an investigation comparing size estimates based on preoperative MRI with final defect size after debridement. Our aim was to provide surgeons with more objective data to assist in predicting true defect size based on MRI scanning. Patients were included in this retrospective study if they had undergone preoperative MRI and open cartilage repair within 12 months to minimize potential confounding by defect progression on MRI. Defect sizes measured after debridement were obtained from surgical notes and compared with MRI size estimates by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled with a median age of 37 years, median number of 1.7 defects, and a total median defect area of 6 cm(2) per knee. Preoperative MRI scanning had predicted a median defect area of 3.6 cm(2). This reflected a difference of 65% (P &lt; 0.001) between MRI and final defect area after debridement when 85% of all individual defects were larger than predicted by preoperative MRI. Our study compared the size of cartilage defects measured by preoperative MRI with surgical measurements after debridement. On average, the final total defect area per knee was 65% larger than estimated preoperatively by MRI. Individual defects were larger than predicted by 47% to 377%, depending on defect location.

The purpose of the present study was to develop a histological grading scheme that comprehensively and quantitatively assesses changes in multiple tissues that are associated with OA of the stifle joint in mice. Two representative midcoronal sections from 158 stifle joints, including naturally occurring and surgically induced OA, were stained with H&amp;E and Safranin-O stains. All slides were evaluated to characterize the changes present. A grading scheme that includes both measurements and semiquantitative scores was developed, and principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to the resulting data from the medial tibial plateaus. A subset of 30 tibial plateaus representing a wide range of severity was then evaluated by 4 observers. Reliability of the results was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Five factors were retained by PCA, accounting for 74% of the total variance. Interobserver and intraobserver reproducibilities for evaluations of articular cartilage and subchondral bone were acceptable. The articular cartilage integrity and chondrocyte viability factor scores were able to distinguish severe OA from normal, minimal, mild, and moderate disease. This newly developed grading scheme and resulting factors characterize a range of joint changes in mouse stifle joints that are associated with OA. Overall, the newly developed scheme is reliable and reproducible, characterizes changes in multiple tissues, and provides comprehensive information regarding a specific site in the stifle joint. ","804":"This case study of 4 patients followed for at least 2 years was conducted to evaluate a cartilage repair procedure that involves transplanting particulated juvenile allograft cartilage. A multicenter, prospective, single-arm, 25-subject case study was designed to evaluate clinical outcomes such as IKDC and KOOS scores as well as the extent and quality of repair with MRI. In addition, there is an option for the transplants to be biopsied at various time points after implantation (up to 5 years). Currently, 25 patients with 1 or 2 chondral lesions on the femoral condyles and trochlea have been enrolled and treated in the prospective study. The first 4 patients have completed an evaluation at 24 months postoperative follow-up. Improvements in clinical outcomes over the preoperative baseline data have been observed. The present report describes, for the first time, clinical intermediate-term results of a novel cartilage repair procedure that involves transplanting particulated juvenile cartilage tissue allograft into prepared cartilage lesions of the femoral condyles and\/or trochlea. Clinical outcome data of 4 patients who have reached the 24-month postimplantation milestone indicate early positive outcomes and suggest that this technique is capable of improving clinical symptoms. MRI data suggest that defect filling is possible and persists to at least 2 years. Continued clinical evaluation of this technique is needed with extended follow-up of all 25 patients in the series. ","805":"Fresh osteochondral allograft transplantation (OCA) is an increasingly available option for patients with damage to the bone-cartilage complex of the distal femur. This study prospectively assesses osseous integration and early clinical results following fresh OCA with single or multiple cylindrical grafts to the femoral condyle. Patients with grade 4 International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) defects of the distal femur were treated with OCA. Outcome measures were collected preoperatively and postoperatively at 6, 12, and 24 months. Computed tomography (CT) scans obtained at 6 months were used to assess degree of osseous incorporation regionally. Thirty-four patients, with a mean age of 34.5 years (range, 15-61), with a mean femoral osteochondral lesion of 5.7 cm(2) (range, 1.5-15.0) due to focal osteoarthritis, osteochondritis dissecans, and avascular necrosis, are reported. Statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) mean improvement in outcome scores at 2 years included Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcomes Score (KOOS) pain, sports and recreation, quality of life, and International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC). CT imaging indicated grafts implanted to direct weightbearing regions had &gt;75% incorporation (20\/26 grafts) compared to &lt;50% incorporation in the indirect weightbearing regions (8\/14 grafts). A greater degree of incorporation and earlier outcome improvement were found after single (n = 23) compared to multiple (n = 11) grafts. CT scans were used to assess osseous incorporation of fresh osteochondral allografts in a cohort that showed significant improvements after 2 years. Single-graft implantation is associated with stable incorporation of a greater percentage of the graft. Lesser incorporation appears more frequently with grafts in posterior indirect weightbearing regions of the condyle and multiple contiguous grafts.

Between 2005 and 2009, 72 patients underwent autologous osteochondral transplantation under the care of the senior author. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 34.19 years (range, 16-85 years). All patients were followed for a minimum of 1 year after surgery. The mean follow-up time was 28.02 months (range, 12-64 months). Patient-reported outcome measures were taken preoperatively and at final follow-up using the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) and Short Form-12 (SF-12) general health questionnaire. Identical questionnaires were used in all instances. The mean FAOS scores improved from 52.67 points preoperatively to 86.19 points postoperatively (range, 71-100 points). The mean SF-12 scores also improved from 59.40 points preoperatively to 88.63 points postoperatively (range, 52-98 points). Three patients reported donor site knee pain after surgery, and one patient required the decompression of a cyst that developed beneath the graft site approximately 2 years after the index procedure. Autologous osteochondral transplantation is a reproducible and primary treatment strategy for large osteochondral lesions of the talus. ","807":"Articular cartilage injuries of the knee and ankle are common, and a number of different methods have been developed in an attempt to improve their repair. Clinically, there are 2 distinct aims of cartilage repair: 1) restoration of joint function and 2) prevention or at least delay of the onset of osteoarthritis. These goals can potentially be achieved through replacement of damaged or lost articular cartilage with tissue capable of functioning under normal physiological environments for an extended period, but limitations of the final repair product have long been recognized and still exist today. Screening of potential procedures for human clinical use is done by preclinical studies using animal models. This article reviews equine chondral defect models that have been recently recognized to have specific advantages for translation into human articular cartilage regeneration. Defect models in the femoropatellar, femorotibial, and tibiotalar joints have been developed. The horse provides the closest approximation to humans in terms of articular cartilage and subchondral bone thickness, and it is possible to selectively leave the entire calcified cartilage layer or completely remove it. The defect on the equine medial femoral condyle emulates medial femoral condylar lesions in humans. Other advantages of the equine model include an ability to use an arthroscope to create lesions and perform second-look arthroscopies, the large lesion size allowing for more tissue for evaluation, and the ability to have controlled exercise and test the ability of the repair to cope with athletic exercise as well as institute rehabilitation regimens. ","808":"This is the first report of successful allograft mosaicplasty treatment of a large osteochondral lesion of the knee caused by a blast fragment sustained during combat operations. The patient was able to return to active duty following rehabilitation. An active-duty infantryman sustained an osteochondral lesion of the medial femoral condyle caused by a metallic fragment of an explosively formed projectile. Initial treatment consisted of removal of the foreign body and primary closure. The patient continued to experience pain, mechanical symptoms, and repeated effusions after initial nonoperative treatment. Allograft mosaicplasty of the lesion utilizing two 18-mm-diameter fresh allograft osteochondral plugs was performed at 6 months post-injury. At 2-year follow-up, the patient remains on active duty with marked improvement in symptoms. Two years postoperatively, his outcome scores are 72 of 100 on the Western Ontario and McMaster University osteoarthritis scoring index (WOMAC) and 60 of 100 on the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). His follow-up x-rays and MRI demonstrate intact articular cartilage and subchondral bone incorporation. Penetrating injuries to joints are commonplace in the battlefield environment. Combat injuries to the knee are frequently associated with articular cartilage injury. While numerous cartilage restoration techniques have been used with success for the treatment of osteochondral injuries to the femoral condyles, no published reports describe the use of allograft mosaicplasty in this location for open, penetrating injuries with focal cartilage loss. This is the first documented use of allograft mosaicplasty for a traumatic osteochondral defect of the medial femoral condyle caused by a metallic projectile. The patient was able to return to active duty following rehabilitation. We demonstrate a high level of functioning is possible following allograft mosaicplasty of a large osteochondral lesion caused by penetrating ballistic trauma. ","809":"Our previous work showed that epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is highly expressed in nucleus pulposus of the human degenerative intervertebral disc. The present study was designed to investigate the role of EMP1 in nucleus pulposus cells in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). Human nucleus pulposus cells derived from degenerative intervertebral discs were cultured. EMP1 expression was knocked down by lentivirus-mediated specific interfering RNA. Cell morphology was observed, and cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cycle were evaluated. Knockdown of EMP1 inhibited cell proliferation, caused cells to shrink, and accelerated the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or addition of cycloheximide but did not evoke apoptosis in normal culture conditions. These findings suggest that EMP1 promoted chondrocyte proliferation, survival, and morphological change of cells during IDD, implying that EMP1 may be a target for biological therapy for IDD.

We prospectively followed up for 2 years 15 patients (mean age, 48 years) who were operated for grade IV cartilage lesions of the knee. Six of the patients had multiple chondral lesions; the average size of the lesions was 9.2 cm(2). All patients underwent a mini-arthrotomy and concomitant transplantation with BMAC covered with the collagen matrix. Coexisting pathologies were treated before or during the same surgery. X-rays and MRI were collected preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years' follow-up. Visual analog scale (VAS), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), Lysholm, Marx, SF-36 (physical\/mental), and Tegner scores were collected preoperatively and at 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up. Four patients gave their consent for second-look arthroscopy and 3 of them for a concomitant biopsy. Patients showed significant improvement in all scores at final follow-up (P &lt; 0.005). Patients presenting single lesions and patients with small lesions showed higher improvement. MRI showed coverage of the lesion with hyaline-like tissue in all patients in accordance with clinical results. Hyaline-like histological findings were also reported for all the specimens analyzed. No adverse reactions or postoperative complications were noted. This study showed that 1-step surgery with BMAC and collagen I\/III matrix could be a viable technique in the treatment of grade IV knee chondral lesions. ","811":"It has remained ambiguous as to whether oral dosing of glucosamine (GlcN) would make its way to the joint and affect changes in the cartilage, particularly the integrity of cartilage and chondrocyte function. The objective of this study was to trace the fate of orally dosed GlcN and determine definitively if GlcN was incorporated into cartilage proteoglycans. Two dogs were treated with (13)C-GlcN-HCl by oral dosing (500 mg\/dog\/d for 2 weeks and 250 mg\/dog\/d for 3 weeks). Cartilage was harvested from the tibial plateau and femoral condyles along with tissue specimens from the liver, spleen, heart, kidney, skin, skeletal muscle, lung, and costal cartilage. Percentages of (13)C and (13)C-GlcN present in each tissue sample were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. In the case of dog 1 (2-week treatment), there was an increase of 2.3% of (13)C present in the articular cartilage compared to the control and an increase of 1.6% of (13)C in dog 2 compared to control. As to be expected, the highest percentage of (13)C in the other tissues tested was found in the liver, and the remaining tissues had percentages of (13)C less than that of articular cartilage. The results are definitive and for the first time provide conclusive evidence that orally given GlcN can make its way through the digestive tract and be used by chondrocytes in joint cartilage, thereby potentially having an effect on the available GlcN for proteoglycan biosynthesis.

The goal of this study was to use a self-aggregating suspension culture model of chondrocytes with mechanical preconditioning. Our model differs from others in that it is based on a scaffold-less, self-aggregating culture model that produces a cartilage tissue analog that has been shown to share many similarities with the natural cartilage phenotype. Owing to the known loaded environment under which chondrocytes function in vivo, we hypothesized that applying force to the suspension culture-derived chondrocyte biomass would improve its cartilage-like characteristics and provide a new model for engineering cartilage tissue analogs. In this study, we used a specialized hydrostatic pressure bioreactor system to apply mechanical forces during the growth phase to improve biochemical and biophysical properties of the biomaterial formed. We demonstrated that using this high-density suspension culture, a biomaterial more consistent with the hyaline cartilage phenotype was produced without any foreign material added. Unpassaged chondrocytes responded to a physiologically relevant hydrostatic load by significantly increasing gene expression of critical cartilage molecule collagen and aggrecan along with other cartilage relevant genes, CD44, perlecan, decorin, COMP, and iNOS. This study describes a self-aggregating bioreactor model without foreign material or scaffold in which chondrocytes form a cartilage tissue analog with many features similar to native cartilage. This study represents a promising scaffold-less, methodological advancement in cartilage tissue engineering with potential translational applications to cartilage repair. ","814":"We tested whether an intra-articular ultrasound (IAUS) method could be used to evaluate cartilage status arthroscopically in human knee joints in vivo. Seven patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery of the knee were enrolled in this study. An ultrasonic examination was conducted using the same portals as in the arthroscopic surgery. A high-frequency (40-MHz) ultrasound transducer (diameter = 1 mm) was directed to the desired location on the articular surface under arthroscopic control. In addition to ultrasound data, an IAUS video and optical video through the arthroscope were recorded. Classification of cartilage injuries according to International Cartilage Repair Society, as conducted by the orthopedic surgeon, provided reference data for comparison with the IAUS. The IAUS method was successful in imaging different characteristics of the articular surfaces (e.g., intact surface, surface fibrillation, and lesions of varying depth). In some cases, also the subchondral bone and abnormal internal cartilage structure were visible in the IAUS images. Specifically, using the IAUS, a local cartilage lesion of 1 patient was found to be deeper than estimated arthroscopically. The IAUS method provided a novel arthroscopic method for quantitative imaging of articular cartilage lesions. The IAUS provided quantitative information about the cartilage integrity and thickness, which are not available in conventional arthroscopy. The present equipment is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for intravascular use and might be transferred to intra-articular use. The invasiveness of the IAUS method might restrict its wider clinical use but combined with arthroscopy, ultrasonic assessment may enlarge the diagnostic potential of arthroscopic surgery.

The majority of patients who undergo routine knee arthroscopy have evidence of a chondral defect. These injuries represent a continuum of pathology from small, asymptomatic lesions to large, disabling defects affecting a major portion of one or more compartments within the knee joint. In comparison to patients with osteoarthritis, individuals with isolated chondral surface damage are often younger, significantly more active, and usually less willing to accept limitations in activities that require higher impact. At the present time, a variety of surgical procedures exist, each with their unique indications. This heterogeneity of treatment options frequently leads to uncertainty regarding which techniques, if any, are most appropriate for patients. The purpose of this review is to describe the workup and discuss the management techniques for cartilage injuries within the adult knee. ","817":"The concept of using gene transfer strategies for cartilage repair originates from the idea of transferring genes encoding therapeutic factors into the repair tissue, resulting in a temporarily and spatially defined delivery of therapeutic molecules to sites of cartilage damage. This review focuses on the potential benefits of using gene therapy approaches for the repair of articular cartilage and meniscal fibrocartilage, including articular cartilage defects resulting from acute trauma, osteochondritis dissecans, osteonecrosis, and osteoarthritis. Possible applications for meniscal repair comprise meniscal lesions, meniscal sutures, and meniscal transplantation. Recent studies in both small and large animal models have demonstrated the applicability of gene-based approaches for cartilage repair. Chondrogenic pathways were stimulated in the repair tissue and in osteoarthritic cartilage using genes for polypeptide growth factors and transcription factors. Although encouraging data have been generated, a successful translation of gene therapy for cartilage repair will require an ongoing combined effort of orthopedic surgeons and of basic scientists. ","818":"The main goal of this study was to compare the secretion products derived from human articular chondrocytes established in either long-term monolayer cultures or in scaffold-free 3-dimensional (3-D) cultures. Stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was applied to investigate quantitatively the differences between proteins secreted from dedifferentiated and redifferentiated chondrocytes. Proteins in cell supernatants were resolved by 1-D gel electrophoresis and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The results from the proteomic analyses were validated by immunoblotting. Additionally, antibody arrays were used to screen culture supernatants for 79 different morphogens. Quantitative SILAC showed that some relevant growth factors such as CTGF or GAS6 were elevated in monolayers, along with proteins characteristic of a dedifferentiated phenotype such as collagen type I and tenascin. In spheroids, data showed overexpression of some cartilage-specific proteins such as aggrecan, together with important matrix regulators such as chitinase-3-like protein and stromelysin-1. Antibody arrays revealed that chondrocytes in monolayer secrete higher levels of leukocyte-activating agents such as MCP-1 and GRO, whereas the spheroid configuration favors the production of cell morphogens such as MCSF and VEGF. Our results show that some classic dedifferentiation and redifferentiation markers are differentially expressed in 2-D or 3-D culture configurations. Other cell\/matrix regulatory molecules are also found to be differentially expressed by chondrocytes in 2-D and 3-D conditions by SILAC and antibody arrays. Our data bring new information for understanding the biology of chondrocytes in general and the process of cartilage tissue reconstruction in particular. ","819":"Cartilage-bone integration is an important functional end point of cartilage repair therapy, but little is known about how to promote integration. We tested the hypothesis that chitosan-stabilized blood clot implant elicits osteoclasts to drilled cartilage defects and promotes repair and cartilage-bone integration. Bilateral trochlear defects in 15 skeletally mature rabbit knees were microdrilled and then treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate (GP)\/blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer and thrombin to accelerate in situ solidification or with thrombin alone. Chitosan clearance, osteoclast density, and osteochondral repair were evaluated at 1, 2, and 8 weeks at the outside, edge, and through the proximal microdrill holes. Chitosan was retained at the top of the drill holes at 1 week as extracellular particles became internalized by granulation tissue cells at 2 weeks and was completely cleared by 8 weeks. Osteoclasts burst-accumulated at microdrill hole edges at 1 week, in new woven bone at the base of the drill holes at 2 weeks, and below endochondral cartilage repair at 8 weeks. Implants elicited 2-fold more osteoclasts relative to controls (P &lt; 0.001), a more complete drill hole bone repair, and improved cartilage-bone integration and histological tissue quality. Treated and control 8-week cartilage repair tissues contained 85% collagen type II. After 8 weeks of repair, subchondral osteoclast density correlated positively with bone-cartilage repair tissue integration (P &lt; 0.0005). Chitosan-GP\/blood implant amplified the acute influx of subchondral osteoclasts through indirect mechanisms, leading to significantly improved repair and cartilage-bone integration without inducing net bone resorption. Osteoclasts are cellular mediators of marrow-derived cartilage repair integration. ","820":"Cartilage repair strategies aim to resurface a lesion with osteochondral tissue resembling native cartilage, but a variety of repair tissues are usually observed. Histology is an important structural outcome that could serve as an interim measure of efficacy in randomized controlled clinical studies. The purpose of this article is to propose guidelines for standardized histoprocessing and unbiased evaluation of animal tissues and human biopsies. Methods were compiled from a literature review, and illustrative data were added. In animal models, treatments are usually administered to acute defects created in healthy tissues, and the entire joint can be analyzed at multiple postoperative time points. In human clinical therapy, treatments are applied to developed lesions, and biopsies are obtained, usually from a subset of patients, at a specific time point. In striving to standardize evaluation of structural endpoints in cartilage repair studies, 5 variables should be controlled: 1) location of biopsy\/sample section, 2) timing of biopsy\/sample recovery, 3) histoprocessing, 4) staining, and 5) blinded evaluation with a proper control group. Histological scores, quantitative histomorphometry of repair tissue thickness, percentage of tissue staining for collagens and glycosaminoglycan, polarized light microscopy for collagen fibril organization, and subchondral bone integration\/structure are all relevant outcome measures that can be collected and used to assess the efficacy of novel therapeutics. Standardized histology methods could improve statistical analyses, help interpret and validate noninvasive imaging outcomes, and permit cross-comparison between studies. Currently, there are no suitable substitutes for histology in evaluating repair tissue quality and cartilaginous character. ","821":"Investigational devices for articular cartilage repair or replacement are considered to be significant risk devices by regulatory bodies. Therefore animal models are needed to provide proof of efficacy and safety prior to clinical testing. The financial commitment and regulatory steps needed to bring a new technology to clinical use can be major obstacles, so the implementation of highly predictive animal models is a pressing issue. Until recently, a reductionist approach using acute chondral defects in immature laboratory species, particularly the rabbit, was considered adequate; however, if successful and timely translation from animal models to regulatory approval and clinical use is the goal, a step-wise development using laboratory animals for screening and early development work followed by larger species such as the goat, sheep and horse for late development and pivotal studies is recommended. Such animals must have fully organized and mature cartilage. Both acute and chronic chondral defects can be used but the later are more like the lesions found in patients and may be more predictive. Quantitative and qualitative outcome measures such as macroscopic appearance, histology, biochemistry, functional imaging, and biomechanical testing of cartilage, provide reliable data to support investment decisions and subsequent applications to regulatory bodies for clinical trials. No one model or species can be considered ideal for pivotal studies, but the larger animal species are recommended for pivotal studies. Larger species such as the horse, goat and pig also allow arthroscopic delivery, and press-fit or sutured implant fixation in thick cartilage as well as second look arthroscopies and biopsy procedures.

Nonsystematic literature search identifying measures addressing pain and function evaluated for validity and psychometric properties in patients with articular cartilage lesions. The knee-specific instruments, titled the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form and the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis and Outcome Score, both fulfill the basic requirements for reliability, validity, and responsiveness in cartilage repair patients. A major difference between them is that the former results in a single score and the latter results in 5 subscores. A single score is preferred for simplicity's sake, whereas subscores allow for evaluation of separate constructs at all levels according to the International Classification of Functioning. Because there is no obvious superiority of either instrument at this time, both outcome measures are recommended for use in cartilage repair. Rescaling of the Lysholm Scoring Scale has been suggested, and confirmatory longitudinal studies are needed prior to recommending this scale for use in cartilage repair. Inclusion of a generic measure is feasible in cartilage repair studies and allows analysis of health-related quality of life and health economic outcomes. The Marx or Tegner Activity Rating Scales are feasible and have been evaluated in patients with knee injuries. However, activity measures require age and sex adjustment, and data are lacking in people with cartilage repair.

A comprehensive literature review was performed of high-level original studies providing information relevant for the design of clinical studies on articular cartilage repair in the knee. Analysis of cartilage repair publications and synopses of ongoing trials were used to identify important criteria for the design, reporting, and interpretation of studies in this field. Current literature reflects the methodological limitations of the scientific evidence available for articular cartilage repair. However, clinical trial databases of ongoing trials document a trend suggesting improved study designs and clinical evaluation methodology. Based on the current scientific information and standards of clinical care, detailed methodological recommendations were developed for the statistical study design, patient recruitment, control group considerations, study endpoint definition, documentation of results, use of validated patient-reported outcome instruments, and inclusion and exclusion criteria for the design and conduct of scientifically sound cartilage repair study protocols. A consensus statement among the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) and contributing authors experienced in clinical trial design and implementation was achieved. High-quality clinical research methodology is critical for the optimal evaluation of current and new cartilage repair technologies. In addition to generally applicable principles for orthopedic study design, specific criteria and considerations apply to cartilage repair studies.

Seventeen cases of talar cartilage defects were assessed with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), a modified Cincinnati score, and a subjective ankle-hindfoot score (AHS) at a mean of 61 (24-135) months after surgery. Nine patients consented to an additional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam, including T2 mapping at 3T. ACT was carried out with a periosteal flap (4 cases) or with a matrix-assisted ACT technique (Hyalograft C; 13 cases). Significant improvement was found in all cases. The AOFAS improved from 50.0 to 87.3, the AHS from 43.8 to 84.1, and the modified Cincinnati score from 2.9 to 6.9. MRI data demonstrated good defect filling, and T2 mapping results indicated that the collagen and water content of the repair tissue was comparable to adjacent cartilage. MACT and ACT in the ankle can provide good and excellent long-term outcome and resulted in repair tissue with T2 properties similar to native cartilage in the majority of cases.

Patient age, body mass index, chondral defect size, and duration of preoperative symptoms were significantly correlated (P &lt; 0.05) with several MRI-based outcomes at 24 months, whereas there were no significant pertinent correlations (P &gt; 0.05) observed between clinical and MRI-based outcomes. The accelerated WB approach was not detrimental to graft development at any stage throughout the postoperative assessment timeline from baseline to 24 months postsurgery and may potentially accelerate patient return to normal function, while reducing postoperative muscle loss, intra-articular adhesions, and associated gait abnormalities. ","828":"We investigated whether surface smoothness of articular cartilage in the medial tibiofemoral compartment quantified from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could be appropriate as a diagnostic marker of osteoarthritis (OA). At baseline, 159 community-based subjects aged 21 to 81 with normal or OA-affected knees were recruited to provide a broad range of OA states. Smoothness was quantified using an automatic framework from low-field MRI in the tibial, femoral, and femoral subcompartments. Diagnostic ability of smoothness was evaluated by comparison with conventional OA markers, specifically cartilage volume from MRI, joint space width (JSW) from radiographs, and pain scores. A total of 140 subjects concluded the 21-month study. Cartilage smoothness provided diagnostic ability in all compartments (P &lt; 0.0001). The diagnostic smoothness markers performed at least similar to JSW and were superior to volume markers (e.g., the AUC for femoral smoothness of 0.80 was higher than the 0.57 for volume, P &lt; 0.0001, and marginally higher than 0.73 for JSW, P = 0.25). The smoothness markers allowed diagnostic detection of pain presence (P &lt; 0.05) and showed some correlation with pain severity (e.g., r = -0.32). The longitudinal change in smoothness was correlated with cartilage loss (r up to 0.60, P &lt; 0.0001 in all compartments). This study demonstrated the potential of cartilage smoothness markers for diagnosis of moderate radiographic OA. Furthermore, correlations between smoothness and pain values and smoothness loss and cartilage loss supported a link to progression of OA. Thereby, smoothness markers may allow detection and monitoring of OA-supplemented currently accepted markers. ","829":"The multipotential nature of stem or progenitor cells apparently makes them the ideal choice for any cell therapy, but this as yet remains to be proven. This study (30 subjects) was designed to compare the potential to repair articular cartilage of chondrocytes taken from different regions in osteoarthritic cartilage with that of mesenchymal stem cells prepared from bone marrow of the same subject. Cartilage biopsies, bone marrow, and blood samples were taken from each of 30 individuals with chronic osteoarthritis (aged 62-85 years) undergoing total knee replacement. The chondrogenic potential of chondrocytes isolated from cartilage biopsies taken from different regions of osteoarthritic cartilage was compared with that of mesenchymal cells by quantitative analysis of several chondrocyte specific markers and an ex vivo cartilage differentiation assay. Cartilage-derived articular chondrocytes are superior to bone marrow-derived cells when compared for their ex vivo chondrogenic potential. Interestingly, there was marked and significant difference in the expression of chondrocytic markers between chondrocytes derived from adjacent, visually distinct regions of the diseased cartilage. When cultured in the presence of a fibroblast growth factor 2 variant, all cell samples from both tissues showed a high degree of chondrogenic potential. Although bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, when supplemented with the appropriate chondrogenic factors, are a suitable source for autologous cartilage implantation, adult chondroprogenitor cells, particularly those from moderately affected regions of the osteoarthritic joints, demonstrate superior chondrogenic potential.

Sox9 and Runx2 are the most often-studied transcriptional regulators of the chondrocyte differentiation process, but the importance of additional factors is also becoming apparent. Mafs are a subfamily of the basic ZIP (bZIP) transcription factor superfamily, which act as key regulators of tissue-specific gene expression and terminal differentiation in many tissues. There is increasing evidence that c-Maf and its splicing variant Lc-Maf play a role in chondrocyte differentiation in a temporal-spatial manner. This review summarizes the functions of c-Maf in chondrocyte differentiation and discusses the possible role of c-Maf in osteoarthritis progression. ","832":"Articular cartilage lesions are a common pathology of the knee joint, and many patients may benefit from cartilage repair surgeries that offer the chance to avoid the development of osteoarthritis or delay its progression. Cartilage repair surgery, no matter the technique, requires a noninvasive, standardized, and high-quality longitudinal method to assess the structure of the repair tissue. This goal is best fulfilled by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The present article provides an overview of the current state of the art of MRI of cartilage repair. In the first 2 sections, preclinical and clinical MRI of cartilage repair tissue are described with a focus on morphological depiction of cartilage and the use of functional (biochemical) MR methodologies for the visualization of the ultrastructure of cartilage repair. In the third section, a short overview is provided on the regulatory issues of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) regarding MR follow-up studies of patients after cartilage repair surgeries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Autologous BM-MSCs were culture expanded, placed on PR-FG intraoperatively, and then transplanted into 5 full-thickness cartilage defects of femoral condyles of 5 patients and covered with an autologous periosteal flap. Patients were evaluated clinically at 6 and 12 mo by the Lysholm and Revised Hospital for Special Surgery Knee (RHSSK) scores and radiographically by x-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at the same time points. Repair tissue in 2 patients was rated arthroscopically after 12 mo using the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Arthroscopic Score. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; level of evidence 4. RESULTS: All patients' symptoms improved over the follow-up period of 12 mo. Average Lysholm and RHSSK scores for all patients showed statistically significant improvement at 6 and 12 mo postoperatively (P &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the 6 and 12 mo postoperative clinical scores (P = 0.18). ICRS arthroscopic scores were 8\/12 and 11\/12 (nearly normal) for the 2 patients who consented to arthroscopy. MRI of 3 patients at 12 mo postoperatively revealed complete defect fill and complete surface congruity with native cartilage, whereas that of 2 patients showed incomplete congruity.

The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the occurrence of bone healing and the time taken to achieve this in patients submitted to medial opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (MOWHTO), comparing platelet-rich plasma with bone marrow aspirate to autologous iliac graft. Twenty-five patients who underwent tibial osteotomy were randomly divided into 2 groups: a control group, which received autologous iliac grafts (14 patients), and a study group, which received a compound of PRP and bone marrow aspirate (11 patients). The bone-healing rates achieved were 100% in the control group and 91% in the study group. There was no difference in the time taken to achieve bone healing between the groups. The use of a combination of PRP and bone marrow aspirate, as a bone substitute, did not demonstrate any advantage over the use of an autologous iliac graft in MOWHTO. ","838":"Knee cartilage defects represent a socioeconomic burden and may cause lifelong disability. Studies have shown that cartilage defects are detected in approximately 60% of knee arthroscopies. In clinical trials, the majority of these patients are excluded. This study investigates whether patients included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) represent a selected group compared to general cartilage patients. Published randomized clinical trials on cartilage repair studies were identified (May 2009) and analyzed to define common inclusion criteria that in turn were applied to all patients submitted to our cartilage repair center during 2008. Patient-administered Lysholm knee score was used to evaluate functional level at referral. In addition, previous surgery and size and localization of cartilage defects were recorded. Common inclusion criteria in the referred patients and patients included in the published RCTs were single femoral condyle lesion, age range 18 to 40 years, and size of lesion range 3.2 to 4.0 cm(2). Six of 137 referred patients matched all the 7 RCTs. Previous cartilage repair and multiple lesions were associated with decreased Lysholm score (P &lt; 0.002). Lysholm score was independent of age, gender, and time of symptoms from the defect. The heterogeneity of the referred cartilage patients and the variation in inclusion criteria in the RCTs may question whether RCTs actually represent the general cartilage patients. The present study suggests that results from published RCTs may not be representative of the gross cartilage population. ","839":"Early surgical intervention for articular cartilage disease is desirable before full-thickness lesions develop. As early intervention treatments are designed, native chondrocyte viability at the treatment site before intervention becomes an important parameter to consider. The purpose of this study is to evaluate native chondrocyte viability in a series of specimens demonstrating the progression of articular cartilage lesions to determine if the chondrocyte viability profile changes during the evolution of articular cartilage disease to the level of surface fibrillation. Osteochondral specimens demonstrating various degrees of articular cartilage damage were obtained from patients undergoing knee total joint replacement. Three groups were created within a patient harvest based on visual and tactile cues commonly encountered during surgical intervention: group 1, visually and tactilely intact surfaces; group 2, visually intact, tactilely soft surfaces; and group 3, surface fibrillation. Confocal laser microscopy was performed following live\/dead cell viability staining. Groups 1 to 3 demonstrated viable chondrocytes in all specimens, even within the fibrillated portions of articular cartilage, with little to no evidence of dead chondrocytes. Chondrocyte viability profile in articular cartilage does not appear to change as disease lesion progresses from normal to surface fibrillation. Fibrillated partial-thickness articular cartilage lesions are a good therapeutic target for early intervention. These lesions retain a high profile of viable chondrocytes and are readily diagnosed by visual and tactile cues during surgery. Early intervention should be based on matrix failure rather than on more aggressive procedures that further corrupt the matrix and contribute to chondrocyte necrosis of contiguous untargeted cartilage.

(2) Can active range of motion (AROM) be used in place of or with CPM? (3) When can individuals safely resume weight bearing (WB) following repair? A search using Medline, SportsDiscus, and CINAHL databases was performed with the following keywords: articular cartilage, AROM, CPM, microfracture, osteochondral allograft, autologous chondrocyte implantation, rehabilitation, weight bearing, and knee. Basic science or clinical outcomes examining the effects of CPM, AROM, or WB on knee articular cartilage healing. Selected articles were rated using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) to determine evidence for clinical application. Sixteen articles met selection criteria: 12 were basic science studies; 4 were clinical studies. Basic science evidence supporting CPM exists. However, few patient-oriented outcomes have been documented resulting in a SORT rating of C. Early WB and AROM received a SORT rating of B based on limited clinical research and patient-oriented outcomes. Basic science evidence supports CPM to maintain ROM, reduce pain, and promote healing. Patient-oriented research is needed to strengthen CPM's recommendation. Limited evidence exists regarding early WB and AROM post cartilage repair. There is insufficient evidence to confidently address when to begin WB for maximum healing. Appropriate basic science and patient-oriented research are needed for rehabilitation protocols to maximize benefits of cartilage repair procedures. ","842":"Osteochondral graft transplantation has garnered significant attention because of its ability to replace the lesion with true hyaline cartilage. However, surgical impaction of the graft to anchor it into the defect site can be traumatic and lead to cell death and cartilage degeneration. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that increasing impulse magnitude during impaction of osteochondral plugs has a direct effect on loss of cell viability. In this controlled laboratory study, the impaction force was kept constant while the impulse was varied. Ninety-six osteochondral plugs were extracted from the trochlea of bovine stifle joints and were randomly assigned into 3 experimental and 1 (nonimpacted) control group. The transferred impulse of the experimental groups reflected the median and the lower and upper quartiles of preceding clinical measurements. Data were obtained at day 0, day 4, and day 8; at each point, cell viability was assessed using the Live\/Dead staining kit and histological assessments were performed to visualize matrix structural changes. After impaction, cartilage samples stayed intact and did not show any histological signs of matrix disruption. As expected, higher impulse magnitudes introduced more cell death; however, this relationship was lost at day 8 after impaction. Impulse magnitude has a direct effect on cell viability of the graft. Because impulse magnitude is mostly governed by the press-fit characteristics of the recipient site, this study aids in the definition of optimal insertion conditions for osteochondral grafts. ","843":"Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy is a promising method for estimating the depth-wise composition of articular cartilage. The aim was to compare the specificity of two earlier introduced, presumably proteoglycan (PG)-specific FTIR parameters (i.e., absorption in the carbohydrate region with and without normalization with Amide I absorption) to estimate the reference PG content of normal and osteoarthritic human articular cartilage. This study is a direct continuation of our earlier studies, from which the presented data are reanalyzed. Earlier, FTIR microspectroscopy, digital densitometry, histological analyses, and polarized light microscopy were conducted in vitro for articular cartilage samples of human patellae (n = 72). In the present study, earlier data were combined and statistically reanalyzed in a depth-wise manner to clarify the specificity of FTIR parameters introduced for the estimation of PG content of articular cartilage. Digital densitometry for Safranin O-stained samples was used to indicate reference PG content. Direct absorption of the carbohydrate region estimated well the PG content in the middle and deep zones of articular cartilage and appeared to be superior compared to carbohydrate values normalized with Amide I absorption. However, in the superficial zone, the specificity of both FTIR-derived PG parameters was limited. Limitations of current FTIR-based PG parameters in the superficial zone of articular cartilage should be recognized and carefully taken into account in future studies using FTIR microspectroscopy for PG content estimation. Further research is needed to improve the specificity of FTIR parameters for the estimation of PG content of articular cartilage.

In transgenic mice with overexpression of Hoxc8 and Hoxd4 during cartilage development, the authors observed severe defects, namely, physical instability of cartilage, accumulation of immature chondrocytes, and decreased maturation to hypertrophy. To define the molecular basis underlying these defects, the authors performed gene expression profiling using the Affymetrix microarray platform. Primary chondrocytes were isolated from Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-transgenic mouse embryo rib cartilage at 18.5 days of gestation. In both cases, differentially expressed genes were identified that have a role in cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. A comparison between the controls for both experimental groups did not reveal significant differences, as expected. However, the repertoires of differentially expressed genes were found not to overlap between Hoxc8- and Hoxd4-transgenic cartilage. This included different Wnt genes, cell cycle, and apoptosis regulators. Overexpression of Hoxc8 and Hoxd4 transcription factors alters transcriptional profiles in chondrocytes at E18.5. The differences in repertoires of altered gene expression between the 2 transgenic conditions suggest that the molecular mechanisms underlying the cartilage defects may be different in both transgenic paradigms, despite apparently similar phenotypes. ","848":"The authors aimed to develop a mechanical model for delivering controlled impact injuries to an articular cartilage surface, with the ability to control peak contact pressure while maintaining a constant rate of loading across all impact levels. A pendulum-style impactor with a direct contact interface was fabricated, based on previously published successful models. This impactor was tested in 2 separate experiments: first with a single analog specimen and next with 15 cadaveric rabbit knee specimens. In both experiments, impacts were performed at 3 pressure levels with multiple repetitions. Peak pressure, rate of pressure application, impulse, and time to peak were evaluated. There was a significant difference between each of the pressure level groups for both the analog and cadaveric experiments. There was no significant difference between the rates of pressure application for the analog specimen and a statistically significant difference only between the highest and lowest pressure level groups for the cadaveric specimen. Previous studies have shown that peak pressure and rate of pressure application are both significant contributors to cartilage injury. Previous models have controlled only peak contact pressure, allowing rate of loading to change as a function of peak contact pressure. This model is the first to control both variables, with a rate of pressure application that is typical of an athletic or traumatic injury in humans. Use of this model will enable researchers to investigate the isolated effects of peak pressure on progressive cartilage injuries.

Both interventions sought to protect the implant for an initial period and then incrementally increase WB. Under the accelerated protocol, patients reached full WB at 8 weeks postsurgery, compared to 11 weeks for the traditional group. Clinical outcomes were assessed presurgery and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months postsurgery.

A significant interaction effect (P &lt; 0.017) existed for pain severity and the 6-minute walk test, with accelerated group patients reporting significantly less severe pain and demonstrating superior 6-minute walk distance over the period. Although there was a significant group effect (P &lt; 0.017) for maximal active knee extension range in favor of the accelerated regime, no further significant differences existed. There was no incidence of graft delamination up to 24 months that resulted directly from the 3-month postoperative rehabilitation program. The accelerated load-bearing approach that reduced the length of time spent ambulating on crutches produced comparable if not superior clinical outcomes up to 24 months postsurgery in the accelerated rehabilitation group, without compromising graft integrity. This accelerated regime is safe and effective and demonstrates a faster return to normal function postsurgery.

If left untreated, isolated cartilage lesions can lead to progressive chondropenia or global cartilage loss over time. A chondropenia curve is described to help predict the outcome of cartilage injury based on different lesion and patient characteristics. Nutriceuticals and chondroprotective agents are being investigated as tools to slow the development of chondropenia. Several operative techniques have been described for articular cartilage repair or replacement and, more recently, cartilage regeneration. Rehabilitation guidelines are being developed to meet the needs of these new techniques. Next-generation techniques are currently evaluated to optimize articular cartilage repair biology and to provide a repair cartilage tissue that can withstand the high mechanical loads experienced by the athlete with consistent long-term durability.

Reliable detection of stage-related characteristics of cartilage disease serves both a therapeutic and prognostic goal. Over the past years, several (pre)clinical diagnostic modalities for cartilage pathologies have been advocated. Each modality focuses on different aspects of the disease. Early diagnosis, before irreversible damage has occurred, opens up the possibility for better treatment and improves the patients' prognosis. This article gives an overview of the diagnostic modalities available for monitoring cartilage pathology and focuses on reliability, clinical value, current status, and possible applications. ","855":"The operative management of focal chondral lesions continues to be problematic for the treating orthopedic surgeon secondary to the limited regenerative capacity of articular cartilage. Although many treatment options are currently available, none fulfills the criteria for an ideal repair solution, including a hyaline repair tissue that completely fills the defect and integrates well with the surrounding normal cartilage. The microfracture technique is an often-utilized, first-line treatment modality for chondral lesions within the knee, resulting in the formation of a fibrocartilaginous repair tissue with inferior biochemical and biomechanical properties compared to normal hyaline cartilage. Although symptomatic improvement has been shown in the short term, concerns about the durability and longevity of the fibrocartilaginous repair have been raised. In response, a number of strategies and techniques for augmentation of the first-generation microfracture procedure have been introduced in an effort to improve repair tissue characteristics and reduce long-term deterioration. Recent experimental approaches utilize modern tissue-engineering technologies including local supplementation of chondrogenic growth factors, hyaluronic acid, or cytokine modulation. Other second-generation microfracture-based techniques use different types of scaffold-guided in situ chondroinduction. The current article presents a comprehensive overview of both the experimental and early clinical results of these developing microfracture augmentation techniques. ","856":"Osteochondral lesions of the talus are common injuries following acute and chronic ankle sprains. Numerous surgical treatment strategies have been employed for treating these lesions; arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation is recognized as the first-line technique to provide fibrocartilage infill of the defect site. While the short- and medium-term outcomes of this technique are good, the long-term outcomes are not yet known. An increasing number of studies, however, show a cause for concern in employing this technique, including declining outcome scores over time. The current authors have therefore developed a treatment strategy based on previously established guidelines in addition to morphological cartilage-sensitive fast spin echo techniques and quantitative T2 mapping magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Accordingly, the authors advocate arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation in lesion sizes up to 8 mm in diameter and osteochondral autograft transplant (OATS) in lesion sizes greater than 8 mm in diameter. In the absence of long-term studies, confining the use of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation to smaller lesions may support prolonged joint life by decreasing the rate at which the fibrocartilage ultimately degenerates over time. Employing the OATS procedure in larger lesions has the advantage of replacing \"like with like.\" The current review examines the role of arthroscopic bone marrow stimulation techniques of the talus. ","857":"Microfracture is a marrow-stimulating technique used in the hip to treat cartilage defects associated with femoro-acetabular impingement, instability, or traumatic hip injury. These defects have a low probability of healing spontaneously and therefore often require surgical intervention. Originally adapted from the knee, microfracture is part of a spectrum of cartilage repair options that include palliative procedures such as debridement and lavage, reparative procedures such as marrow-stimulating techniques (abrasion arthroplasty and microfracture), and restorative procedures such as autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral allograft\/autografts. The basic indications for microfracture of the hip include focal and contained lesions typically less than 4 cm in diameter, full-thickness (Outerbridge grade IV) defects in weightbearing areas, unstable lesions with intact subchondral bone, and focal lesions without evidence of surrounding chondromalacia. Although not extensively studied in the hip, there are some small clinical series with promising early outcomes. Although the widespread use of microfracture in the hip is hindered by difficulties in identifying lesions on preoperative imaging and instrumentation to circumvent the femoral head, this technique continues to gain acceptance as an initial treatment for small, focal cartilage defects. ","858":"The treatment of symptomatic cartilage lesions in the glenohumeral joint presents a significant challenge due to poor healing characteristics. Diagnosis of glenohumeral chondral defects is not always clear, and while current imaging modalities are good, many lesions require arthroscopy to fully appreciate. Arthroplasty remains an effective treatment in low-demand patients; however, younger, higher demand individuals may be treated with less invasive reparative measures. This paper discusses the diagnosis of glenohumeral chondral pathology and presents the technique, rehabilitation, and available outcomes following microfracture in the shoulder.

This study aimed to define the strength and weaknesses of this minimally invasive cartilage repair technique in the athletic population in an effort to optimize indications, functional outcome, and athletic participation after microfracture in the athlete's knee. A systematic analysis of original studies using microfracture in athletes was performed. Functional outcome was assessed by activity outcome scores, ability to return to sports participation, timing of the return to sport, level of postoperative sports activity, and continuation of athletic competition over time. Thirteen studies describing 821 athletes were included in the analysis with an average follow-up of 42 months. Good or excellent results were reported in 67% of athletes with normal International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores in 80% and significant increase of Lysholm scores, Tegner activity scores, and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) sports subscales. Return to sports was achieved in 66% at an average of 8 months after surgery, with return to competition at the preinjury level in 67%. Forty-nine percent of athletes continued to compete without change in level of play, while decreasing function was observed in 42% after 2 to 5 years. Athlete's age, preoperative duration of symptoms, level of play, lesion size, and repair tissue morphology affected sports activity after microfracture. Microfracture improves knee function and frequently allows for return to sports at the preinjury level, but deterioration of athletic function occurs in some patients.

The goal is to restore full function in each patient as quickly as possible by facilitating a healing response without overloading the healing articular cartilage. The purpose of this article is to overview the principles of rehabilitation following microfracture procedures of the knee. ","862":"The therapeutic value of microfracture has been demonstrated in clinical patients. The rationale is that focal penetration of the dense subchondral plate exposes cartilage defects to the benefits of cellular and growth factor influx in addition to improving anchorage of the new tissue to the underlying subchondral bone and, to some extent, the surrounding cartilage. While functional outcomes have been reported, there is a paucity of data on the histological, biochemical, and molecular changes in human patients. This paper reviews 4 basic science studies of microfracture using an equine chondral defect model that gave some insight into possible mechanisms of action and also how the microfracture response could be augmented. In study I, microfracture of full-thickness chondral defects in exercised horses significantly increased the repair tissue volume in the defects at both 4 and 12 months. No adverse effects were seen. In study II, an investigation of the healing of full-thickness chondral defects during the first 8 weeks with or without microfracture demonstrated that microfracture significantly increased type II collagen expression as early as 8 weeks after treatment compared to controls; aggrecan expression was progressively increased during the first 8 weeks but was not significantly enhanced by microfracture. In study III, it was demonstrated that removal of the calcified cartilage layer provided optimal amount and attachment of repair tissue, emphasizing that careful removal of calcified layer is critical during debridement prior to microfracture. Study IV assessed the ability of IL-1ra\/IGF-1 combination gene therapy to further modulate repair of microfractured chondral defects. The repair tissue in gene therapy-treated joints demonstrated increased proteoglycan and type II collagen content compared to microfracture alone.

This technique is cost effective, technically not complicated, has an extremely low rate of associated patient morbidity, and leaves options for further treatment.

A proteolytic activity towards IGFBP-5 has been detected in synovial fluids from human osteoarthritic (OA) joints. The purpose of this study was to determine if protease activity towards IGFBP-5 is present in the rat medial meniscal tear (MMT) model of OA and whether inhibition of this activity would alter disease progression. Sprague-Dawley rats were subject to MMT surgery. Synovial fluid lavages were assessed for the presence of IGFBP-5 proteolytic activity. Treatment animals received intra-articular injections of vehicle or protease inhibitor peptide PB-145. Cartilage lesions were monitored by India ink staining followed by macroscopic measurement of lesion width and depth. The MMT surgery induced a proteolytic activity towards IGFPB-5 that was detectable in joint fluid. This activity was stimulated by calcium and was sensitive to serine protease inhibitors as well as peptide PB-145. Significantly, intra-articular administration of PB-145 after surgery protected cartilage from lesion development. PB-145 treatment also resulted in an increase in cartilage turnover as evidenced by increases in serum levels of procollagen type II C-propeptide (CPII) as well as synovial fluid lavage levels of collagen type II neoepitope (TIINE). IGFBP-5 metabolism is disrupted in the rat MMT model of OA, potentially contributing to cartilage degradation. Inhibition of IGFBP-5 proteolysis protected cartilage from lesion development and enhanced cartilage turnover. These data are consistent with IGFBP-5 playing a positive role in anabolic IGF signaling in cartilage.

Using digital image analysis, the lesions were localized and normalized lesion size was determined for the patellofemoral groove (PFG) and the lateral and medial femoral condyles (LFC, MFC). Samples were classified into patterns using cluster analysis of the lesion size at each compartment. For each pattern, maps showing the extent and frequency of lesions were created. RESULTS: Four main patterns (a-d) were identified (each p&lt;0.001), with the lesion size varying from small (a) to large in distinct regions (b-d). Pattern b had a predominant lesion (23% area) in the MFC, and smaller (&lt;3%) lesions elsewhere. Pattern c had predominant lesions in the LFC (19%) and MFC (10%). Pattern d had a predominant lesion in the PFG (15%) and smaller lesions in the MFC (6%) and LFC (2%). The sub-patterns of a (a1, a2, a3) had relatively small lesions, with similarity between a2 and b, and a3 and d.
