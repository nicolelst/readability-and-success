2":"Esophageal hepatoid adenocarcinomas (HACs) belong to alpha fetoprotein (AFP)-producing adenocarcinomas and are relatively sparse. A 35-year-old man suffering from adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), with negative preoperative studies for metastatic disease, underwent Ivor Lewis esophagectomy. The histologic examination demonstrated a poorly differentiated, IIA (T3N0M0) staged EGJ adenocarcinoma. The patient had been advised not to receive any adjuvant therapy, with the follow-up studies at six months being negative for recurrence. Eleven months postoperatively, he was diagnosed with a bulky mass in the liver's right lobe, accompanied by elevated AFP serum levels. The percutaneous biopsy revealed the presence of HAC, immunohistochemically positive for AFP. The surgical specimen was re-evaluated and was also found immunohistochemically positive for AFP, re-defining the tumor as combined adenocarcinoma and HAC of the EGJ. The patient received two sessions of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the liver mass. However, following the 2nd TACE session, he developed signs of hepatic insufficiency and expired twenty days later. It is crucial to identify the presence of a HAC, as HAC seems to have an aggressive course, with limited therapeutic options as well as therapeutic response. HIPPOKRATIA 2020, 24(3): 138-142. ","3":"Applying customized centiles may improve the accuracy of detecting small for gestational age (SGA) infants; however, the evidence is inconclusive whether adjusted centiles are more sensitive in identifying infants at increased risk of morbidity. We aimed to examine the validity of customized centiles in a Greek cohort and evaluate their performance compared to population-based centiles in predicting infants at risk of increased morbidity. We prospectively recorded the neonatal and maternal characteristics of singleton, low-risk, term infants over a year. Infants were defined as SGA if their birth weight was under the tenth centile, classified both by population-based centiles and customized centiles, adjusted for maternal and innate factors. We performed a comparative analysis utilizing linear regression analysis and calculating the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. Overall 657 infants were identified. Population-based centiles detected 42 (6 %) SGA infants, while customized centiles 80 (12 %). Perinatal morbidity was associated with an odds ratio of 1.02 with customized centiles [95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.04] and with an odds ratio of 1.02 with population-based centiles (95 % CI: 1.02-1.02). In predicting perinatal morbidity, no significant difference was detected between customized centiles [area under the ROC curve 0.773 (95 % CI: 0.699-0.847)] and population-based centiles [area under the ROC curve 0.737 (95 % CI: 0.662-0.813)] (p =0.272). Customized centiles provided increased accuracy in comparison to the population-based centiles in detecting SGA term infants. However, customized centiles had no better impact on predicting a poor perinatal outcome. HIPPOKRATIA 2020, 24(3): 133-137.

This study aimed to investigate adherence to ART among people living with HIV in northern Greece and investigate the factors influencing adherence to ART. A correlational study was performed on a cohort of 112 seropositive individuals (100 men and 12 women) with a mean age of 37.14 years. The simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ) was used to assess adherence. In addition, the perceived available support questionnaire (PAS) for social support assessment was utilized to evaluate the perceived social support. Approximately 60% of patients were found to be nonadherent to ART. Important factors affecting adherence are educational level, social support, and use of substances. The results show that a significant proportion of the cohort of patients investigated from northern Greece does not show adherence to ART. Several factors were identified to be of significant influence, which should be taken into consideration by the Greek healthcare providers. HIPPOKRATIA 2020, 24(3): 114-119. ","7":"Fiscal federalism and fiscal decentralization are distinct policy options in public services in general and healthcare in particular, with possibly opposed effects on equity, effectiveness, and efficiency. However, the pertinent discourse often reflects confusion between the concepts or conflation thereof. This paper performs a narrative review of theoretical literature on decentralization. The study offers clear definitions of the concepts of fiscal federalism and fiscal decentralization and provides an overview of the potential implications of each policy for healthcare systems. The interpretation of the literature identified three different dimensions of decentralization: political, administrative, economic. Economic decentralization can be further implemented through two different policy options: fiscal federalism and fiscal decentralization. Fiscal federalism is the transfer of spending authority of a centrally pooled public health budget to local governments or authorities. Countries like the UK, Cuba, Denmark, and Brazil mostly rely on fiscal federalism mechanisms for healthcare financing. Fiscal decentralization consists of transferring both pooling and spending responsibilities from the central government to local authorities. Contrarily to fiscal federalism, the implementation of fiscal decentralization requires as a precondition the fragmentation of the national pool into many local pools. The restructuring of the pooling system may limit the cross-subsidization effect between high- and low-income groups and areas that a central pool guarantees; thus, severely affecting local equality and equity. With the limited availability of local public resources in poorer regions, the quality of services drops, increasing the disparity gap between areas. Evidence from Italy, Spain, China, and Ivory Coast -countries with a strong fiscal decentralization element in their healthcare services- suggests that fiscal decentralization has positive effects on the infant mortality rate. However, it decreases healthcare resources as well as access to services, fostering spatial inequities. If public resources are and remain adequate, allocation follows equitable criteria, and local communities are involved in the decision-making debate, fiscal federalism -rather than fiscal decentralization- appear to be an adequate policy option to improve the healthcare services and population's health nationwide and achieve health sector economic decentralization.

The inter-mammary sulcus is a rare location for pilonidal sinus abscesses. Our study examined the causes of inter-mammary PSD (IMPSD), which is rarely seen in the literature and our treatment approach. We retrospectively analyzed patients referred to our hospital's general surgery clinic between 2012 and 2018. Twelve patients were operated on for IMPSD during these six years. An excision, including all sinus openings, was planned, and a D-shaped incision was performed. Sinus openings and tracts underlying the skin were excised in toto. Subcutaneous flaps were created to shift the incision from the midline plane to reduce the recurrence rate. The minimum duration for the follow-up was 24 months. Eight patients were suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome. Progesterone and testosterone levels of the patients were normal. Prior studies evaluating PSD and hormone levels of female patients showed no correlation. IMPSD is a disease that should be kept in mind if induration and abscess in the inter-mammary region are present. The risk of recurrence is high if no proper excision is planned.

Patients were assessed using audiometry (measuring the hearing threshold for frequencies of 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000, and 8,000 Hz) and tympanometry. Our research showed that patients with chronic tinnitus predominantly had anxious affective temperament [anxious-cognitive (AnxC): 26.23 %, anxious-somatic (AnxS): 25.6 %). AnxS was dominant in people without hearing loss (46 %) and males (37.39 %). AnxC was dominant in people with a significant hearing loss and females (30.3 %). Both AnxS and AnxC temperaments correlated with hearing loss in the right ear more than in the left one. Our study revealed that anxious temperaments (AnxC and AnxS) were predominant in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus.

This study aims to assess the incidence, risk factors, and impact of incidental parathyroidectomy on this very targeted group of patients. Three hundred and four consecutive cases undergoing total thyroidectomy in a tertiary referral center were prospectively studied. Based on the histopathology report, incidental parathyroidectomy was assessed in relation to postoperative transient\/permanent hypocalcemia. Demographic, clinical, and histological data were analyzed. The overall incidence of unintentional removal of parathyroid glands during total thyroidectomy was 35.5 %. Indicators were the postoperative hypocalcemia, the percent change of parathormone serum levels, and the presence of lymph nodes in the histopathology report. Patients with incidental parathyroidectomy exhibited a higher incidence of transient hypocalcemia and hypoparathyroidism postoperatively. Incidental parathyroidectomy is associated with transient hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy. Even single parathyroid in the histopathology specimen may be sufficient for influencing postoperative PTH levels and calcium.

The understanding of the clinical presentation and outcomes is crucial in order to upgrade management strategies. However, epidemiological data regarding AAD occurrence are scarce in Europe, highlighting the gap of evidence in the existing guidelines. We investigated 197 consecutive patients admitted to our institution from January 2018 to December 2019 with suspicion of type A AAD, conducting a retrospective case series. All demographic characteristics, as well as the outcomes of these patients, were recorded and further analyzed to deliver data on the epidemiology of AAD. A total of 197 patients were admitted to our hospital with a suspected AAD. Forty-one (25.9 %) patients presented with a dilated aortic lumen or with a previously repaired aortic dissection, while 28 patients (14.2 %) were diagnosed with AAD (14 patients with type A AAD, 13 with type B AAD and 1 with intramural hematoma). Among 14 patients with type A AAD, nine patients (64.0 %) were treated surgically, while the rest were managed conservatively due to futile clinical status or inability for immediate transportation to a surgical facility. The most frequent initial symptom was chest pain in 86.0 % of patients, followed by dyspnea in 42.9 %. Post-surgical mortality was 33.0 %, while all patients that were managed conservatively did not survive. D-dimers on arrival were significantly lower among patients who survived compared to those who did not. The incidence of type A AAD in our case series was consistent with the one demonstrated in other international cohorts; however, the mortality in our patient group was higher.

Fifty male patients with large inguinoscrotal hernias underwent this procedure over two years. Twenty-five patients had a transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair with the combined use of a plug and flat mesh, and 25 patients had TAPP repair using a flat mesh only. The novelty of this technique lies in the fact that after complete dissection of the hernia sack, a plug mesh is placed reversely, and its top edge is anchored onto the lower edge of the inguinal ligament with a standard fixation device. Next, a flat mesh is fixated, and the two meshes are sutured together with polypropylene sutures to form one combined mesh. One hernia recurrence was recorded during the follow-up period after the combined use of the plug and flat mesh. One patient developed a scrotal hematoma which was treated conservatively. The laparoscopic repair of large inguinoscrotal hernias with the combined use of a plug and flat mesh is a safe and effective technique with excellent short-term outcomes. It is a simple modification of the standard TAPP procedure. The recurrence rate of large inguinoscrotal hernias is also believed to be reduced. HIPPOKRATIA 2021, 25 (1):38-41.

This prospective comparative study compared the levels of clinically relevant cytokines and peripheral blood counts and major complications in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) with or without a tourniquet during the first postoperative day. Forty-three patients undergoing primary TKA for degenerative osteoarthritis were divided into two groups; 21 patients were operated on using (TG group) and 22 (NTG group) without using a tourniquet. Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1b, interleukin-6, anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, intercellular and vascular adhesion molecules, C-reactive protein, and full blood count were evaluated preoperatively and at one, three, six, and 24 hours postoperatively in both groups. Demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgery duration, osteoarthritis grade, and other preoperative variable values were comparable between groups. The average tourniquet time was 67.8 minutes. The majority of testing variables did not demonstrate significant postoperative differences between groups. However, the mean IL-6 value was non-significantly higher for the TG than the NTG group during the first six postoperative hours. It demonstrated a trend to significance at the end of the first postoperative day. The mean hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were significantly higher for the NTG group at the sixth postoperative hour. The tourniquet use may affect the systemic inflammatory response. Patients undergoing TKA with or without a tourniquet demonstrated a similar systemic inflammatory response. However, reperfusion following approximately 70 minutes of tourniquet ischemia is a safe practice. HIPPOKRATIA 2021, 25 (1):31-37.

Moreover, the differences between these solutions were analyzed by examining their impacts on rat ventricular cardiomyocytes. Eighty renal transplant patients were evaluated retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: Group UW (n =40) used the University of Wisconsin solution, and Group HTK (n =40) used the Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution. Electrocardiograms of the subjects were obtained three times at different periods; during the pre-perfusion, intraoperative kidney reperfusion, and postperfusion phase at the end of the surgery. Any Electrocardiogram or cardiovascular alterations were noted and analyzed. Adult male Wistar rats were used for in vitro experiments. Myocyte contractility, action potentials, and membrane current were recorded in enzymatically isolated ventricular myocytes. Sinus bradycardia was detected in 19 patients of Group UW, while there was short-term asystole in eight patients. However, no cardiac changes were observed in Group HTK patients. In both Groups, reperfusion and postperfusion corrected QT (QTc) intervals were different from pre-perfusion QTc intervals. Group UW patients' reperfusion and postperfusion QTc's values were higher than those of the Group HTK patients. In rat myocytes, prominent asystole episodes were observed at specific concentrations of the UW solution compared to the HTK solution. The UW solution depolarized the resting membrane potential significantly and decreased the peak value of action potential, whereas the HTK solution did not elicit a significant change in those parameters. Accordingly, the UW solution elicited a significant inward current at -70 mV, while the HTK solution activated only a modest current, which may not change the membrane potential. Prolongation of QTc intervals was detected with reperfusion in both groups according to electrocardiography analysis. However, the QTc interval was observed to be longer in cases using the UW solution and required intervention intraoperatively. HIPPOKRATIA 2021, 25 (1):22-30.

The survey consisted of socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude, and perception questions towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Statistical analyses conducted were appropriate according to the type of variable and the research question. We collected a total of 9,309 questionnaires with a completeness rate estimated at 98.3 %. The median knowledge score regarding COVID-19 was 72.7 %, exhibiting variation depending on socio-demographic subgroups. Individuals were better informed about coronavirus modes of transmission (86.4 %). The acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the general population was 25.9 %, while 43 % of participants remained undecided about being vaccinated. A significant part of the respondents experienced a health issue for which they had to visit a hospital, but they did not do so due to the fear of possible infection by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings suggest a moderately high level of knowledge in the Greek population towards COVID-19 at the study time. Educational programs, health actions, and vaccination campaigns are essential for filling knowledge gaps in particular demographic groups, such as the low educated and over 65 years old people.

Sixty participants undergoing breast cancer surgery were randomly assigned to two groups. After anesthesia induction, group S (n =30) received SPB alone, whereas the SPECS group (n =30) received a combination of PECS I and SPB. Pain scores at 0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24 h postoperatively, intra-operative fentanyl consumption, postoperative time to first rescue analgesia, nausea, vomiting, patient satisfaction, and anesthesia-related complications were recorded. Pain scores in the SPECS group were significantly lower than group S throughout the follow-up period (p &lt;0.001). A significant reduction in postoperative rescue morphine consumption (p =0.01, median difference 7 mg, 95 % confidence interval: 5.1-7.9 mg) and intraoperative fentanyl consumption (p =0.01) in the SPECS group compared with group S.

Providing intensive care to a high-risk population with significant mortality and morbidity raises the fundamental conflict between sanctity and quality of life. Potential severe handicap and need for frequent tertiary care inevitably impact the whole family unit and may outweigh the benefit of survival. The aim of this study is to explore and summarize the ethical considerations in neonatal care concerning perivable birth. Eligible studies published on PubMed were included after a systematic search using the PICO methodology. Forty-eight studies were systematically reviewed regarding guidelines, withholding or withdrawing treatment, parental involvement, and principles applied in marginal viability. As periviable birth raises an array of complex ethical and legal concerns, strict guidelines are challenging to implement. Active life-sustaining interventions in neonatology should be balanced against the risk of putting infants through painful and futile procedures and survival with severe sequelae.

It is scarcely reported in children under ten years of age, but it can be debilitating when misdiagnosed. Our purpose was to report the incidence and treatment methods of SCFE that were applied in our institution in children under the age of ten. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with SCFE treated between 2007-2018 and excluded those older than ten years old. During the study period, 46 patients (49 hips) were diagnosed with SCFE, of whom nine patients (11 hips) were children younger than ten years old. The mean age at presentation was 8.25 years. The classification was made according to the Southwick slip angle and stability of the slip. Comorbidities and body mass index (BMI) were registered. There were nine milds, one moderate, and one severe slip. All but one case were stable. All the children were above the 97th percentile BMI for age. Three patients suffered from metabolic disease. In situ Kirschner wire (K-wire) fixation was used in five hips and in situ fixation with a single partially threaded cannulated screw (CS) in six. Only two complications that required intervention were recorded, one K-wire loosening, and one K-wire mechanical failure. The mean follow-up time was 40.1 (range: 10-74) months and included eight of the nine patients. They were monitored for pain, range of motion, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and slip progression. The diagnosis of SCFE should be considered in overweight children under the age of ten, with hip-related clinical manifestations. Treatment in this young group of patients can be demanding. K-wire and partially threaded CS fixation both provide stability and accommodate the femoral head's future growth. The use of K-wire fixation is recommended at a very young age (6-8 years of age). Orthopedic surgeons have to be aware of the increased risk of hardware-related complications when using K-wires that may have to be addressed surgically. HIPPOKRATIA 2019, 23(4): 165-168.

It was also reported that NLR could be used as an independent predictor of septic shock, hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and death in patients with a liver abscess. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of the NLR, which is a cheap and easily calculable marker, to decisions regarding surgical therapy in patients with intestinal obstruction (IO). Ninety-one patients hospitalized with IO were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were two groups: a surgical therapy group and a conservative therapy group. Complete blood count (CBC) parameters and NLR values were statistically evaluated to determine whether there was any difference between the groups. The results obtained from the initial CBC tests were compared between the patients receiving surgical therapy (n =30) and conservative therapy (n =61). There was no statistically significant difference in white blood cell counts between the groups (p =0.225). However, there was a statistically significant difference in NLR values between the patients receiving surgical and conservative therapy (p =0.023). Similar to previous studies investigating other inflammation criteria, we found that high NLR values were statistically significant in favor of the surgical therapy group in determining the need for surgery in ileus cases. The data obtained in our study demonstrate that the NLR measurement contributes to early decision-making concerning surgical therapy in patients with IO at the time of their initial admission to the emergency department.

We aimed to investigate whether there is a correlation between acute kidney injury (AKI) developing in patients monitored in the intensive care unit (ICU) with regards to gender. The current study retrospectively screened the electronic records of patients monitored in the adult ICU between 2015 and 2018. The patients' age, gender, duration of their stay in the ICU, mortality rate, and need for hemodialysis were recorded and analyzed. The diagnosis of AKI was defined according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria. Patients with AKIN stage 2 and stage 3 were accepted as having an AKI. Patients were separated into two groups: those who developed an AKI and those who did not. The patients were classified into age groups: those aged 18-65 years and those older than 65 years. The demographic data and gender distribution of the groups were then compared. Of the patients who developed AKI, the mean age (p =0.0001), the number of days they stayed at the ICU (p =0.006), the mortality rate (p =0.0001), and the need for hemodialysis were significantly higher than the non-AKI group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups with regards to gender distribution (p =0.612). Acute kidney injury was found to be statistically significantly higher in both the male and female groups over 65 years when compared to the group aged 18-65-years (male p =0.004, female p =0.002, respectively). When surveying the complete patient sample, AKI in the ICU was more prevalent in adult males under 65 than their female counterparts. However, there were more incidences of AKI in women over 65 than in men over 65 years. This may be due to structural changes and comorbidities in the kidney due to advanced age, as well as a decrease in estrogen levels. HIPPOKRATIA 2019, 23(3): 126-130.

Citizen preferences for healthcare service utilization, their views on structural reform of the current system, and the profiling of those in favor of PHC are essential in planning a reform that respects citizens' needs. However, data on this topic in the country are scarce. The present study maps citizen preferences for health care reform in the primary care sector in Greece. In March 2017, a sample of 1,002 citizens were surveyed by telephone. The survey was repeated with a different sample of 1,001 persons in October 2017. Both samples were defined via a random multistage selection process using a quota for the municipality of residence, sex, and age. Responders were asked to rate their satisfaction with the existing healthcare system and to rank their preferences as to the most important elements of future structural reform. Barriers to accessing healthcare services and in the implementation of structural reform as well as actual healthcare services utilization were also recorded. A logistic regression model was used to identify sample characteristics independently associated with the most requested reform. Citizens preferred to visit physicians -as outpatients- in their private practices (50.5 % in March and 44 % in October) rather than in public health services (17.8 % and 18 %, respectively). For 86.9 % and 85.6 %, respectively, structural reform of the current health system was considered \"very\" or \"extremely necessary\". The introduction of family physicians in the system was the most requested reform (48 % and 49.4 %, respectively). Citizens in older age groups were more likely to request the implementation of family physicians (25-39 years old: OR: 2.14, 95 % CI: 1.36-3.37; 40-54 years old: OR: 2.89, 95 % CI: 1.85-4.52; 55-64 years old: OR: 3.62, 95 % CI: 2.27-5.78; and over 65 years old: OR: 3.32, 95 % CI: 2.10-5.26).

A careful review of the books of Hippocratic collection was performed, as well as a narrative review of the currently available academic literature, focusing on topics of contemporary theories of liability in malpractice cases, which correspond roughly to the medical malpractice instances identified in Hippocratic collection. The Hippocratic authors touch on some issues which are essential to the contemporary theory of medical error and negligence, which, however, cannot yet unquestionably address these issues. Among others, they refer to errors that contemporarily might be viewed as technical human errors, errors of omission, or errors which were unavoidable in the context of applied ancient Greek medicine as is the case of injuries that are not based on physician's fault, or situations where the diagnosis of the particular disease or causal link between the physician's breach of duty and the damage suffered, was difficult or even impossible. Interestingly, the Hippocratic authors underscore some errors which might not be based on physician's fault. The passages mentioned in this paper, originating from the Hippocratic collection that refer to medical malpractice, imply an awareness of what is currently discussed as medical malpractice.

Thirty composite tibia models were divided into six groups, and a corresponding number of nails from six manufacturers (Citieffe, Braun Aesculap, Orthoselect, Orthofix, Stryker, and Depuy Synthes) was implanted in each group. The maximum number of proximal screws was used for each specimen, and a proximal gap osteotomy was performed. Each bone model was then submitted in dynamic, followed by static loading, and the passive construct stiffness was calculated, representing the specimen's rigidity. Furthermore, for each specimen, the force needed to cause a displacement of more than one millimeter at the fracture site was calculated. Stiffness values of a solid nail with two proximal screws and a cannulated nail with five screws were significantly higher compared to all other groups. On the other hand, a titanium cannulated nail with three screws showed the lowest rigidity. Solid nails provide more rigidity compared to cannulated ones, and the maximum number of proximal screws in all possible directions should be used in order to achieve maximum stability.

The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of two models of gait re-education in post-stroke patients, namely conventional physical therapy and treadmill training. A systematic literature review was performed, taking into account the online databases of Medline (PubMed), Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and clinical trials registries. The following inclusion criteria were applied: studies published from 2008 to 2018, written in English, involving treatment and control groups, investigating conventional physical therapy and treadmill training administered for gait re-education after stroke. Out of 160 articles identified, 23 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed and analyzed. One hundred fifteen projects involving clinical trials were identified; out of these nine reports from the last five years are included in the review. The number of participants in all the studies totaled at 1,772. The participants in all the studies represented both sexes, and their age ranged from 18 to the late 80s, with an average of 60+ years of age. In most cases, the patients examined were at a chronic stage post-stroke, i.e., more than six months following stroke onset. The most frequently applied types of treadmill training included: high-intensity aerobic treadmill training and treadmill training with or without body weight support. Most interventions involved participation in 30- or 60-minute sessions, from three to five times weekly, for the duration of six to 16 weeks. Treadmill training seems to be a valuable and effective method of gait re-education, which can be used at various periods following a stroke, and mainly leads to improvement in walking speed and walking capacity. However, no standard has been defined so far with regard to treadmill-supported recovery of gait function in patients after stroke. We still do not know the optimum duration and frequency of exercise. Further study should investigate long-term effects and the way treadmill training impacts on patients' daily activities.

The aim of the present study was the characterization of the human pharyngeal microbiome of healthy individuals in Greece. We obtained ten pharyngeal specimens from healthy volunteers, Greek resident, with Greek nationality, who were eligible to the selection criteria. The construction of DNA libraries was performed by using two primer sets that amplify selectively the corresponding hypervariable regions of the 16s region in bacteria (V2-V9). The Ion Torrent PGM platform was used for the performance of next-generation sequencing. In the study samples, twelve phyla were identified. The most abundant ones were Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, followed by Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria. Seventy-nine families, 79 genera and 137 species were identified and characterized. Moreover, 17 unique differentially abundant families, 30 unique differentially abundant genera and 24 unique differentially abundant species were identified among healthy subgroups with adjusted p-values &lt;0.05. At the genus level, Moraxella (Proteobacteria) and Gemella (Firmicutes) were detected with a statistical significance in non-smokers, while Bifidobacterium (Actinobacteria), Alloscardovia (Actinobacteria), Dialister (Firmicutes) and Filifactor (Firmicutes) were present mostly in smokers. The URT is colonized by a variety of protective and potentially pathogenic bacteria. This microbiome system is highly diverse and varies significantly between individuals. Geographic location and ethnicity are considered to be a strong determinants and factors affecting the diversity and abundance of the URT microbiome. Although some of the most abundant families are common irrespective of these factors, the dominance patterns are usually different between the study subjects and between the studies from other geographic locations.

MMP-9 was expressed in higher amounts in the wounded tissue in comparison with non-wounded tissue during days one and three (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p =0.028 and p =0.043, respectively). MMP-2 was produced in equal amounts in the wounded and non-wounded tissue at all time-points. Only in the adult wounds at day seven, higher activity was noted compared with non-wounded skin (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p=0.043). RFE, despite its local burning effect, does not interfere with known patterns of MMP regulation. Neonates have lower activity of MMPs than adults. Energy conduction through adjacent non-wounded tissues does not have an impact upon MMP regulation. HIPPOKRATIA 2017, 21(1): 85-92.

Based on cross-sectional area (CSA) calculations, a 14 % atrophy in UREM fibers was revealed; thus forces were evaluated in absolute values and corrected for CSA (specific force) values. A) Addition of H2O2 during activation did not significantly affect force generation in any group or the pool of fibers. Incubation in DTT did not affect the CON fibers but caused a 12 % maximal isometric force decrease in UREM fibers (both in absolute force p =0.024, and specific force, p =0.027). B) Incubation in H2O2 during relaxation lowered subsequent maximal (but not submaximal) isometric forces in the Pool of fibers by 3.5 % (for absolute force p =0.033, for specific force p =0.019) but not in the fiber groups separately. Force generation capacity of CON and UREM fibers is affected by oxidation similarly. However, DTT significantly lowered force in UREM muscle fibers. This may indicate that at baseline UREM muscle could have already been at a more reduced redox state than physiological. This observation warrants further investigation as it could be linked to disease-induced effects. HIPPOKRATIA 2017, 21(1): 3-7.

Major errors were found in 64.6 % of them with almost every death certificate having a minor error. Major error rate did not differ per year (p =0.65). Most commonly encountered major errors were a non-acceptable cause of death (31.2 %) and an incorrect sequencing (16.8 %).

The ability of cultured monocytes to differentiate and produce insulin in vitro is analysed in the present study. Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from healthy donors and cultivated for fourteen days. Growth factors and liraglutide were used to induce pancreatic differentiation in most of the cultures. The growth factors were: monocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, hepatocyte growth factor and epidermal growth factor. The rest of the cultures were cultivated only with nutrient medium and human serum. Insulin levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cellular morphology was observed using optical and electron microscopy. Cell membrane receptors were detected by flow cytometry. Monocytes were able to synthesize and excrete high levels of insulin after seven days in culture. A further increase in the excretion of insulin was observed after fourteen days. Cells were also able to differentiate and synthesize insulin, even if no growth factors were added to the culture medium. Some of the cultures were able to excrete insulin in a glucose-dependent manner. Differentiated monocytes were connected to neighbouring cells with axons and resembled the morphology of mesenchymal, dendritic and myeloid-progenitor cells. Cells retained their mature receptors and simultaneously developed immature receptors on their membrane. Monocytes can acquire morphological properties of multipotent cells when they are cultivated under specific conditions in vitro. Differentiated monocytes are able to synthesize and excrete insulin.

The purpose of this study was to analyze epidemiological data of patients with SUDEP, identify possible risk factors in the population of a tertiary referral center and provide a review of the literature aiming to raise awareness of this phenomenon. Data for this study originate from the records of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics in Nicosia Cyprus. We performed a systematic review of patients with epilepsy who had died between 1997 and 2012 and identified those whose death circumstances met the definition of SUDEP. Information was collected regarding sex, age, type of seizures, anti-epileptic therapies, and circumstances of death. Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional medical ethics committee. Four hundred and forty four new patients were diagnosed with epilepsy among referrals to the epilepsy clinic and were followed to the end of the study period. Seven patients, six males, were identified who met criteria for SUDEP. The average age was 30 years. All patients had had either primary or secondary tonic-clonic seizures. Most were on polypharmacy, and two had Vagus Nerve Stimulation implanted. Most deaths were unwitnessed and nocturnal. The overall incidence rate for SUDEP in this population was 2.13 deaths\/1000 person-years. Overall Cumulative Incidence (or lifetime risk) was calculated at 15.76 SUDEP deaths\/1,000 patients. In our series, SUDEP was primarily a nocturnal and unwitnessed event that affected primarily young males. Among both males and females patients, 36.8% of all deaths were due to SUDEP. The major risk factor identified was the occurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizures signifying that every effort should be made to control this type of seizures.

We also evaluated the mechanism underlying the analgesic effects of apelin-13 by pretreating with Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or ondansetron. Forty male rats were used. The rats were randomly assigned to five groups according to the treatment received: Group I: Control; Group II: Morphine; Group III: Apelin-13; Group IV: Apelin-13+L-NAME; Group V: Apelin-13+Ondansetron. Acute thermal pain was modeled using the hot-plate and the tail-flick tests. During the hot-plate test, i.p. Morphine and apelin-13 administered at zero- and 30 min produced significantly greater analgesic effects compared to the control. When the nitric oxide pathway was inhibited by administration of L-NAME with apelin-13, the analgesic effect continued. When apelin-13 and ondansetron were co-administered, the analgesic effect of apelin-13 disappeared at zero- and 30 min. During the tail-flick test, at 30 min, significantly higher levels of analgesia were observed in both the morphine and apelin group (which did not differ from each other) compared to the control group.

Literature regarding anesthesia and perioperative management of such patients is limited, with no published papers for orthopedic surgery in patients with HHT. An 82-year-old HHT female patient with femoral neck fracture was scheduled for hemiarthroplasty. Computerized tomography scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in the right lung. The nature of surgery in association with AVM presence suggested the use of regional anesthesia (RA) as the optimal choice. Midazolam (2 mg) was administered as premedication. Perioperatively, Levobupivacaine hydrochloride (15 mg) was administered in the subarachnoid space, at the L4-L5 lumbar intervertebral space, using a 29 Gauge needle.

Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of ipsilateral radial and ulnar artery cannulation during the same coronary catheterization procedure. We performed a retrospective analysis of all cardiac catheterizations, from January 2015 until June 2016, with initial radial approach and conversion to ipsilateral ulnar approach. Patients with sheath insertion both in radial and ipsilateral ulnar arteries were further evaluated. Four thousand one hundred and two procedures were performed during the study period, and 3,876 (94.5 %) of them were performed initially through a radial approach. Radial and ipsilateral ulnar catheterization was accomplished in nine patients, resulting in successful catheterization and procedure completion, without any serious complications recorded. Ipsilateral radial and ulnar artery catheterization proved to be feasible and safe, without any serious complications. Hippokratia 2016, 20(3): 249-251. ","290":"This study aims at demonstrating the ability of BLADE sequences to reduce or even eliminate all the image artifacts as well as verifying the significance of using this technique in certain pathological conditions. This study involved fourteen consecutive patients (5 females, 9 males), who routinely underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain examination, between 2010-2014. The applied routine protocol for brain MRI examination included the following sequences: i) T2-weighted (W) fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) axial; ii) T2-W turbo spin echo (TSE) axial; iii) T2*-W axial, iv) T1-W TSE sagittal; v) Diffusion-weighted (DWI) axial; vi) T1-W TSE axial; vii) T1-W TSE axial+contrast. Additionally, the T2-W FLAIR BLADE sequence was added to the protocol in cases of cystic tumors. Two radiologists independently evaluated all the images at two separate settings, which were performed 3 weeks apart. The presence of image artifacts such as motion, flow, chemical shift and Gibbs ringing artifacts, were also evaluated by the radiologists. In the measurements of the cysts, the extent of the divergence by the two MRI techniques (conventional and BLADE) was used by the two radiologists to evaluate the accuracy of the two techniques to determine the size of the cysts. BLADE sequences were found to be more reliable than the conventional ones regarding the estimation of the cyst size. The qualitative analysis showed that the T2 FLAIR BLADE sequences were superior to the conventional T2 FLAIR with statistical significance (p &lt;0.001) in the following fields: i) overall image quality, ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) nulling; iii) contrast between pathology and its surrounding; iv) borders of the pathology; v) motion artifacts; vi) flow artifacts; vii) chemical shift artifacts and viii) Gibbs ringing artifacts. BLADE sequence was found to decrease both flow artifacts in the temporal lobes and motion artifacts from the orbits. Additionally, it was shown to improve flow artifacts and image quality in cystic pathologies such as arachnoid cysts. Hippokratia 2016, 20(3): 244-248.

The aim of this study was to evaluate bone involvement at diagnosis in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia as a predictive factor and to correlate its presence with other demographic, clinical, and laboratory findings. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 97 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed from January 2005 to December 2014. The mean age of patients was 5.7 years, and 83 (85.6 %) of them were diagnosed with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Among the 97 children, 46 (47.4 %) reported bone involvement at the time of diagnosis. Among children with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia 43\/83 (51.8 %) reported bone involvement, while among children with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia only 3\/14 (21.4 %) (p =0.04). Bone involvement was registered more frequently among males (30\/59; 50.8 %) in comparison to females (16\/38; 42.2 %) (p =0.414). The mean white blood cell count at diagnosis was lower among children with bone involvement (109,800\/mm3 vs. 184,700\/mm3) (p =0.092). The mean age of patients with bone involvement was four years, which differs significantly from those without bone involvement (p =0.029). Moreover, children with bone involvement at diagnosis were prednisone \"good responders\" (79.5 %) when compared with those without bone involvement (58.8 %) (p =0.046). Additionally, mean serum phosphate values were higher at diagnosis among children with bone involvement (5.3 mg\/dl vs. 4.8 mg\/dl, p =0.035). The presence of bone involvement at diagnosis is related with immunophenotype of B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lower mean age, lower mean white blood cell count and good prednisone response.

The study population was derived from the HEPNET-Greece, a nationwide cohort study aimed to evaluate the current epidemiological course of viral hepatitis. To account for time-dependent confounding, Cox marginal structural models were used to analyze data. Thirty out of 2,125 eligible patients experienced a clinical event during their follow-up. When comparing treated to untreated individuals, the hazard ratio (HR) for a clinical event was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.16-0.98; p =0.044) in the whole sample, whereas there were indications of a more intense effect in the subgroup of patients with cirrhosis at presentation (HR =0.16, 95% CI: 0.02-1.21; p =0.075).

Mechanical positive pressure ventilation may increase the prevalence of PFO opening in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients; however, the respiratory and hemodynamic determinants of PFO opening have been poorly investigated. Contrast-enhanced transesophageal echocardiogram (ce-TEE) is considered the gold standard for PFO detection. We prospectively performed a multicenter study using ce-TEE in order to determine the respiratory and hemodynamic factors that may lead to PFO opening. One hundred and eight consecutive ICU adult patients under mechanical ventilation from three tertiary care hospitals, were included in the study. A standard multiplane ce-TEE was performed, and the dimensions and function of the right and left ventricle were studied. In each patient, the right ventricle (RV) end-diastolic area, RV end-systolic area, left ventricle (LV) end-diastolic area, and LV ejection fraction were measured using the modified Simpson's rule and the four-chamber view. At least three bubble tests were performed to detect PFO opening. Ventilatory parameters such as tidal volume, plateau pressure, static lung compliance, and positive end-expiratory pressure were recorded during the bubble test. Data for 81 men and 27 women were analyzed. PFO was detected in 27 % of the study population.

The high long-term mortality among patients who underwent CAS seems to be related to the high comorbidity burden, including coronary and peripheral artery disease. However, limited data on very long-term mortality (over four years) and predictors of death are available. We sought to investigate the very long-term survival after CAS and the impact of comorbidities on mortality at follow-up. Data of 194 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who underwent CAS with cerebral protection systems from December 2002 to March 2014 were analyzed. All cause mortality during long-term follow-up was assessed. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to find independent predictors of death. The median age of patients was 66 [interquartile range (IQR): 60-73] years and 78.9 % of patients were male. The median follow-up was 7.6 (IQR: 4.4-10.2) years. The all-cause mortality rate after 30 days, one year, four years, and at maximum follow-up was 0 %, 5.1 %, 17.5 % and 31.4 %, respectively. Out of 61 deaths, 37 (60 %) were cardio-cerebral vascular related deaths, 15 (25 %) non-cardiovascular deaths, and 9 (15 %) due to unknown reasons. Among cardio-cerebral vascular deaths, there were 12 fatal strokes, 18 fatal myocardial infarctions and seven other cardiac related deaths. Non-cardiac deaths were due mainly to cancer (9\/15). Age and diabetes mellitus were independent predictors of all-cause death during long-term follow-up. The mortality rate during short and long-term follow-up after CAS was lower than reported in the literature. Age and diabetes mellitus were independent predictors of all-cause death.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the role of the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and the in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS ) at 3 Tesla magnet in invasive breast cancer and correlate them with the dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and pathologic findings. We retrospectively studied at 3Tesla magnet the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, the detection of choline in the 1H-MRS and the kinetic analyses obtained after DCE in 181 patients with histologically confirmed invasive breast carcinomas. Among these patients, 160 had IDC and 21 ILC. We used the DWI sequence with a b value of 1,000 mm2\/sec for the calculation of the ADC value, the fat-suppressed point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) sequence in order to evaluate the existence of a choline peak in the spectrum and the T1W GRE FAT SAT VIBRANT sequence for the characterization of the kinetic curves. Finally, we correlated the pathologic type of invasive cancer, as well as the type of the kinetic curve with the ADC value and the detectability of choline resonance in the spectrum in each of the 181 patients. The ADC values in the 158 out of 160 IDC patients, ranged from 0.5 x 10-3 to 1.2 x 10-3 mm2\/sec, with 78.1 % having ADC value of 1 x 10-3 mm2\/sec. Regarding the 1H-MRS, in 121 out of 160 IDC patients, choline was found in 72.3 %. The ADC values in the 21 ILC patients also ranged from 0.5 x 10-3 to 1.2 x 10-3 mm2\/sec with 57.1 % having ADC value of 1 x 10-3 mm2\/sec. Regarding the 1H-MRS, in 10 out of 21 ILC patients, detection of choline was positive in 60 % of them. In the 21 ILC patients, the kinetic analysis after the dynamic administration of contrast medium showed type I (persistent) curve in 4.3 %, type II (plateau) curve in 33.3 % and type III (washout) in 52.4 %. In the 158 IDC patients (missing in two cases) type I curve was obtained in 0.63 %, type II in 19.4 % and type III in 80 %. From the correlation analysis of the IDC results using Kruskal-Wallis Test and the non-parametric Kendall's tau-b test, the curve type was positively associated (Kendal tau-b: 0.254, p =0.005) with the presence of choline, while the ADC value was negatively associated (Kendal tau-b: -0.224, p =0.011) with the presence of choline. In the ILC cases, the sample was insufficient for the correlation to become statistically significant. However, the ADC values tended to be lower in IDC patients (78.1 % having ADC value 1 x 10-3 mm2\/sec) compared to ILC (57.1 % having ADC value 1 x 10-3 mm2\/sec). Choline was more commonly detected in the IDC (72.3 %) than ILC (60 %) patients. Our results are consistent with previous findings that both ADC values and choline detection in the spectrum play a significant role in establishing the final diagnosis of malignancy, especially when the kinetic pattern of enhancement is misleading.

We collected data regarding RET genetic screening performed in the Center for Endocrine Surgery in Belgrade during a 20-year-period. The study group included 249 MTC patients who were genetically tested for RET mutations by Sanger's sequencing method. Genetic screening of the study population revealed nine different mutations of the RET gene in 42 carriers. The most common mutation was C634F, and it has been detected in 31 % (13\/42) of individuals, while C618R, L790F, and S904S were present in only 2 % (1\/42) each in the study group.

Dose calculation was performed according to body surface area ratio man\/rabbit, taking into account the median lethal dose LD50. Surgery study in rabbits was done over two days by the same specialist using an adapted protocol. He was not informed before or during surgeries which group the animal belonged to, the order being random with a quasi-uniform distribution. Valid results for a modified iris behavior were obtained from two steps of the procedure (cannula irrigation maneuver and irrigation-aspiration). The iris billowing was graded from 0 to 3, according to severity. The risk of intraoperative iris billowing was higher in rabbits included in tamsulosin group [OR=8.33 (CI 95% 0.63-110.09)], but insignificant statistically compare with control group (p= 0.13). In rabbits treated with finasteride the risk of intraoperative iris billowing is increased compared with those without treatment [OR=11.6 (CI 95% 0.92-147.6)], but insignificant statistically (p= 0.11).

In two sites of the adenoma, solid nests of smaller cells were observed, having small amount of cytoplasm, round nuclei with finely stippled chromatin. Mitoses were abundant. These cells were located in the lamina propria and muscularis mucosa, without disturbing the polyp architecture, and showed immunophenotypic characteristics of neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). The histologic findings set the diagnosis of mixed adenoma and NEC. The patient remains free of recurrence or metastasis by NEC, after two years of follow up.

Five hundred nine patients were included in this retrospective study. We identified patients with T2DM who started insulin therapy from 01\/01\/2002 to 30\/06\/2011, from the Scottish Care Information-Diabetes Collaboration (SCI-DC) database of Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, Scotland. We estimated the duration of diabetes prior to conversion to insulin therapy, the months they spent with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) above 7%, 8% or 9% until starting insulin, HbA1c and body weight (BW) at the time of conversion, at 6 and at 12 months before and after conversion. Patients started insulin therapy after a median period of 6.2 (1-30) years after diagnosis of T2DM. Median HbA1c was 10% (range 7.2-17.9) at the time of conversion, 8.8% (5. 8-16.9) at six months before and 8.3% (5.2-15) at 12 months before conversion, and 8.4% (4.7-14.3) at 6 months and 8.2% (5-14.7) at 12 months after conversion. Body weight (BW) was 86.6 kg (39.6-179.8) at the time of conversion and 91 kg (42.7-196) at 12 months after conversion. Patients spent a median period of 49 (0-325) months with HbA1c &gt;7%, 25 (0-163) months with HbA1c &gt;8% and 10 (0-135) months with HbA1c &gt;9%.

The mother-child cohort in Crete examines a population sample of pregnant women recruited during one year beginning in February 2007. A cohort of 1096 women, with singleton pregnancies, was included in the present analyses. Multivariable Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used. Overall, 48% of the women had a caesarean delivery, with a higher percentage observed in women having their first child (52%). Maternal age was a predictor for caesarean deliveries; type of hospital was associated with the risk for an emergency caesarean, whereas women with lower education were at an increased risk of having a planned caesarean delivery among primiparae. Prior caesarean delivery was by far the strongest predictor (RR=7.68, 95% CI 5.71, 10.33) for a subsequent one among multiparae.

The observed pattern of CPCs mobilization and its association with biomarkers following brain injury in preterm neonates indicate the existence of an endogenous brain regeneration process. Enhancement of this process with exogenous progenitor cell transplantation might be a powerful therapeutic strategy to restore brain damage and improve the neurodevelopmental outcome in premature infants.

Several statins may increase 25(OH)VitD concentration. The effect of other lipid-lowering drugs is unknown. To investigate whether switching to high-dose rosuvastatin, add-on-statin nicotinic acid or add-on-statin fenofibrate would alter 25(OH)VitD levels in patients with mixed dyslipidemia who are already on a conventional statin dose. This is a prespecified analysis of a previously published study. Forty-four patients with mixed dyslipidemia not at treatment goal despite treatment with simvastatin 10-40 mg or atorvastatin 10-20 mg or rosuvastatin 5-10 mg were randomly allocated to switch to rosuvastatin 40 mg (n=17), add-on-statin extended release nicotinic acid (ER-NA)\/laropiprant (LRPT) (1000\/20 mg first four weeks and 2000\/40 mg thereafter) (n=14), or add-on-statin micronized fenofibrate (200 mg) for three months. The endpoint for this analysis was between-group difference in changes in 25(OH)VitD levels. Serum 25(OH)VitD levels did not significantly change in any group. In the switch to the highest dose of rosuvastatin group and the add-on-statin ER-NA\/LRPT group there was an insignificant decrease in 25(OH)VitD levels {-4.7% [from 16.8 (3.2-37) to 16.0 (7.9-51.6)] and -14.8% [from 12.8 (2.0-54.8) to 10.9 (2.4-34)], respectively]}, while in the add-on-statin fenofibrate group there was an insignificant increase [+13% (from 14.5 (1.0-42) to 16.4 (4.4-30.4) ng\/mL)]. No significant difference between groups was found. In patients already on a conventional statin dose, neither switching to high-dose rosuvastatin (40 mg) nor add-on-statin ER-NA\/LRPT or fenofibrate were associated with significant changes in 25(OH)VitD serum levels.

Forty eight hemodialysis patients were administered NAC orally for six months. Hematological, biochemical parameters and levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), malondialdehyde (MDA), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitrogen oxide (NO) were determined prior to and upon completion of the study period. At the end of the study period white blood cells, neutrophil percentage and C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower. Uric acid, albumin and hemoglobin were significantly higher compared to pre-treatment values. Statistically significant increase in NO, and decrease in MDA and ADMA levels were observed. Serum MPO demonstrated a measurable decrease trend, though not significant. It is suggested that treatment with NAC appears to be associated with restoration of important parameters of antioxidant defence and reduction in the levels of mediators of oxidative cellular damage.

In this study, saliva samples from oral cancer patients and healthy individuals were incubated in vitro with ethanol in order to investigate factors which can influence salivary acetaldehyde production. A total of 66 individuals (40 males and 26 females, mean age 52 years) participated in the study. Participants were classified into three groups: Group 1 (oral cancer patients [n = 20]); Group 2 (poor dental health status [n = 25]) and Group 3 (good dental health status [n=21]). Every patient chewed a 1g piece of paraffin chewing gum for 1 minute then saliva samples were collected from all individuals. After in vitro incubation of the samples with ethanol, the levels of salivary acetaldehyde production was measured by head space gas chromatography. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests and Spearman's Correlations analysis were performed for statistical analyses. The salivary acetaldehyde production was significantly higher (p &lt;0.0001) in both group 1 and group 2 when compared to group 3. However, there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2. Poor dental health status, infrequent oral hygiene habits and dental visits, smoking and presence of a dental prosthesis were significant parameters for increased levels of salivary acetaldehyde production from alcohol. The evaluation of salivary acetaldehyde production after in vitro incubation with ethanol may be useful for early detection of oral cancer. According to the results of this study, the significantly higher levels of salivary acetaldehyde production in oral cancer patients and individuals with poor dental health status may suggest a possible link between increased salivary acetaldehyde production and oral cancer. Improved oral hygiene can effectively decrease the level of salivary acetaldehyde production in oral cavity. Hippokratia 2014; 18 (3): 269-274.

This was a retrospective cohort of 118 patients who underwent UAE for treatment of symptomatic fibroids between November 2006 and August 2011. Diagnosis of fibroids in symptomatic patients was established by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and\/or transabdominal ultrasonography (US). Three different embolic agents were used. All patients had at least one follow-up using MRI, at three and\/or 12 months. A non-validated questionnaire was used to report patient satisfaction with regards to symptoms improvement on a yes-or-no basis.

After informed consent, all subjects underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the hip and the lumbar spine (L1 to L4) in order to establish a gold standard diagnosis of osteoporosis and an orthopantomogram (OPG). From the initial subjects, 28 (8.2%) did not meet the inclusion criteria. In the final sample 315 patients were included, of whom 293 were postmenopausal (93.3%) and 22 perimenopausal (6.7%). Based on the DXA examination the sample was divided into three groups: a)normal controls (n=106), b)osteopenics (n=103) and c)osteoporotics (n=106). The MCW index was calculated by three different observers using the Emago image processing software. Inter - rater agreement was considered important since MCW was being tested as a possible screening tool for osteoporosis. Comparisons of MCW values between normal controls, osteopenic and osteoporotic women in our sample showed that these values clearly differentiate between the three groups, especially between normal and osteoporotic subjects. Furthermore, the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed this to hold true in real diagnostic terms, giving a threshold value of 3.24 for differentiating between normal and osteoporotic women. With ROC values ranging between 0.80 and 0.87 we can reasonably assume that the MCW index is a reliable indication of the presence of osteoporosis in a patient. Hippokratia 2014; 18 (3): 251-257.

The purpose of this computational study is to elucidate the relationship between low wall shear stress (WSS) - high site concentration of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and atherosclerotic sites in the normal human aortic arch under physiological flow and mass transport conditions. The numerical simulation couples the flow equations with the transport equation applying realistic boundary conditions at the wall in terms of blood-side concentration. The blood is considered to be non-Newtonian fluid obeying to the power law. Suitable mass transport conditions are specified at the wall. Aortic arch walls are exposed to cholesterolemic environment although the applied mass and flow conditions refer to normal human geometry and normal mass-flow conditions. The luminal surface LDL concentration varies inversely with the WSS. Regions of high LDL luminal surface concentration do not necessarily co-locate to the sites of lowest WSS. Concave sides of the aortic arch exhibit, relatively to the convex sides, elevated concentration of the LDL. The area averaged normalized LDL concentration over the entire normal aortic arch is 1.267. The daughter aortic arch vessels exhibit, relatively to the main aorta, elevated LDL concentrations. The near wall paths of the velocities might be the most important factor for the elevated LDL concentration at areas located either at the vicinity of bifurcations regions or at high curvature regions.

In the Netherlands, voluntary active euthanasia among adults and adolescents has been allowed since 2002, when the so-called Groningen Protocol (GP) was formulated as an extension of the law on extremely premature and severely ill newborns. It is maintained that, at bioethical level, it serves the principle of beneficence. Other European countries do not accept the GP, including Belgium. Admissibility of active euthanasia is a necessary, though inadequate, condition for acceptance of the GP. Greece generally prohibits euthanasia, although the legal doctrine considers some of the forms of euthanasia permissible, but not active or involuntary euthanasia. The wide acceptance of passive newborns euthanasia, especially when the gestational age of the newborns is 22-25 weeks (\"grey zone\"), admissibility of practices within the limits between active and passive euthanasia (e.g., withholding\/withdrawing), of \"indirect active euthanasia\" and abortion of the late fetus, the tendency to accept after-birth-abortion (infanticide) in the bioethical theory, the lower threshold for application of withdrawing in neonatal intensive care units compared with pediatric intensive care units, all the above advocate wider acceptance of the GP. However, the GP paves the way for a wide application of involuntary (or pseudo-voluntary) euthanasia (slippery slope) and contains some ambiguous concepts and requirements (e.g., \"unbearable suffering\"). It is suggested that the approach to the sensitive and controversial ethical dilemmas concerning the severely ill newborns is done not through the GP, but rather, through a combination of virtue bioethics (especially in the countries of the so-called \"Mediterranean bioethical zone\") and of the principles of principlism which is enriched, however, with the \"principle of mutuality\" (enhancement of all values and principles, especially with the principles of \"beneficence\" and \"justice\"), in order to achieve the \"maximal\" bioethical approach, along with the establishment of circumstances and alternatives that minimize or eliminate the relevant bioethical dilemmas and conflicts between the fundamental principles.

Younger age (explained 7.6% of the variation, p=0.04), weaker relationship with religion (4%, p=0.02), less than 15 visits\/year to any physician (7.2%, p=0.001), outpatient status (2.4%, p=0.02), and higher expectations for information were associated with higher possibility to consider suing their physician (7.6%, p=0.002). Patients' desire for disclosure of a medical error (agreement in 82.2%) exceeded their expectations for financial compensation, particularly in less severe cases (agreement in 24.1%). This is the first report on the profile of patients with high potential for malpractice suits as predicted by patients' age, relationship with religion, health-seeking and information-seeking behavior. Respecting patients' need for information during clinical consultations and proceeding to disclosure of medical errors, when they occur, seems to be not only the more patient-centered approach, but also the best way to lessen the likelihood of a claim.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the efficacy of prophylactic selective neck dissection in patients without detectable nodal metastases. A matched case-control study with prospective follow up was conducted in ENT Department of Coltea Clinical Hospital for 86 patients with T1-T2N0 stage carcinoma of the anterior tongue surgically treated between January 2000 and January 2005 with or without concurrent selective supraomohyoid neck dissection (SND). The patients were divided in two groups, comparable in age and sex distribution. Descriptive statistics, risk of recurrences, Kaplan Maier five-year survival curves and the global and specific mortality rates were performed using EpiInfo software. The level of significance was established at p&lt;0.05. After a mean follow-up time of 90.5 months, for all variables considered as outcomes of SND efficacy evaluation, significance differences (p &lt; 0.05) were registered between groups: the frequency of patients who developed neck metastases was lower in the group of subjects who underwent prophylactic selective neck dissection; the all-cause mortality rate at the end of the follow-up period was three times lower in SND study group compared with controls; the specific mortality rate due to regional recurrences was five times lower in test-group compared with controls.

A total of 76 children were circumcised (not for religious purposes) in a period of 6 years using the classic Johnston's technique (50 patients) and a new proposed technique (26 patients). Parents of circumcised children were interviewed three months after the operation. The aesthetic result was scored by both the parents and the patients as bad, acceptable, good or very good. Scores between the two groups were compared. No major complications were encountered. The aesthetic result score between the two groups had a statistically significant difference (Mann Whitney U Test, p&lt;0.0005). Children being circumcised with the new technique and their parents were more satisfied with the aesthetic result three months after the operation. In communities in which religious circumcisions are being performed relatively rare, the aesthetic result of a classic method may seem awkward to the patient and his family. Therefore, circumcision being performed for non religious reasons necessitates an acceptable aesthetic result. Our technique fulfills this prerequisite. Hippokratia 2014; 18 (2):116-119.

The aim of present study is the examination of Health Professionals' knowledge and attitudes towards Umbilical Cord Blood in Greece. The study was conducted from April 25th 2012 to May 7th 2012. The sample consisted of 109 Health Professionals from 3 provincial hospitals and 2 hospitals in Thessaloniki. In order to collect the data, a questionnaire was used. The questionnaire was designed by the researcher and a group of experts to serve the mission of the present study. From the 130 questionnaires sent, 109 were completely answered (response rate 84%). Of those who participated to the research, 23.9% were physicians, 34.9% were midwives, and 34.8% were nurses. As far as the Health Professionals' knowledge on the Umbilical Cord Blood is concerned, only 15.6% of the participants declared to be quite or well informed on the collection methods and the usage of Umbilical Cord Blood. The vast majority of the participants (89%), declared that a well-organized program on a continual training is very essential. 93.5% of the participants declared that in the last 5 years received no or very little training regarding the collection, storing and transplantation of Umbilical Cord Blood. Although according to a relevant research health professionals are considered by the public as the most credible source of information about Umbilical Cord Blood, their level of knowledge on the usage and storing of Umbilical Cord Blood is inadequate.

The patients were all boys, aged 3.5, 9 and 13 years, and the location of the cystic lymphangioma was the scrotum, the inguinal region and the epididymis respectively. Clinical examination and ultrasonography described the lesions as cystic. Surgical excision of the lesions with a testis-sparing approach was performed in all three cases and histopathology set the diagnosis of cystic lymphangiomas. Complementary imaging of the regions adjacent to the excised lesions, excluded any extension or co-existing lesions. Post-operative period was uneventful and during a follow-up period of six months all patients were well with no signs of recurrence. Scrotal and inguinal cystic lymphangiomas are treated with surgical excision with care to preserve the intra-scrotal structures and the structures of the inguinal canal. Complete excision is necessary to prevent recurrence. Complementary imaging of the adjacent regions is necessary to identify any possible extension or co-existing lesions.

Polymerase chain reaction assay confirmed the diagnosis of H1N1 virus infection. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone was suppressed to zero while the levels of free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were increased.

Approximately 3 years after the surgery, she excreted part of a surgical forceps with her stool while she was defecating. In upright direct abdominal radiography, a surgical instrument was observed in the abdomen. The patient was operated to remove the foreign body from the abdomen. The surgical instrument that was taken out had corroded and turned black. It was observed that the material that had dropped out of the anus and the material that was taken out during the operation were parts of the same surgical instrument.

However, her liver and renal functions worsened after admission. On the 6th day after intake of ASA, she was transferred to the intensive care unit, and plasma exchange (PE) and continuous hemodiafiltration were performed. Since her liver function did not recover despite repeated PE, she was transferred to another hospital for LDLT on the 8th day. She underwent LDLT with a portion of the liver donated from her mother on the 11(th) day. After the operation, her renal dysfunction continued.

Greece represents a country with an intermediate prevalence of G4 infections, offering an opportunity to compare treatment outcomes by genotype and to identify potential prognostic factors for sustained virologic response (SVR). All CHC patients from the HepNet.Greece, an ongoing nationwide cohort study on viral hepatitis, with known hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype who received treatment with Peg-IFNa and ribavirin were analyzed. From 4443 patients, 951 (61.7% males, 78.4% Greeks, median age 40.6 years, 10% cirrhosis) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. G4 was found in 125 (13.1%) patients. Genotype distribution was not significantly different between Greeks and immigrants. Patients with G4 had similar odds of SVR compared to G1 but significantly lower compared to G2\/G3. Age, treatment discontinuation, presence of cirrhosis and previous history of HCV-treatment were associated with lower probabilities of SVR. Ethnicity did not affect SVR for all genotypes while response to treatment was similar between Greek and Egyptian patients groups (35.7% vs 40.9%, p=0.660%) with G4 infection. The relation between SVR and genotype did not substantially change after adjustment for age, gender, cirrhosis, treatment interruption and history of HCV-treatment. The findings of this large cohort of CHC patients with a well balanced genotype distribution further supports the idea of considering G4 as a difficult to treat genotype. Further investigation is needed to identify genotype specific prognostic factors. ","447":"We studied whether methylene blue (MB) treatment blunts chest trauma-induced lung injury in rats.

Histopathological analysis showed increased hemorrhage, alveolar wall thickness, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltrates in the EC and LC rats, which decreased upon MB treatment. Immunohistochemical studies revealed that MB reduced activation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the number of active terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. A significant increase was observed in the malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the EC group compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). In addition, a significant decrease was reported in the glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels (p&lt;0.01), but no significant difference was observed in the catalase (CAT) levels among the groups. The MDA level was significantly higher in the LC group compared to the control group, whereas the GSH level was significantly lower compared to the control group.

L-carnitine was administered intraperitoneally to animals of the experimental group for 35 days. Samples of the tongue were processed for electron microscopy. Degeneration of epithelial cells of the rat tongue was shown to begin early in life (5 months) and alterations were shown to accumulate while aging. L-carnitine administration eliminated degenerative changes when administered in the first age group A, while in the older rats the regeneration was only partial for the epithelium (groups B and C).

The aim of this study was to compare the analgesic efficiency of ultrasound (USG)-guided transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with local anesthetic infiltration on a wound site. This study was designed as a prospective randomized trial, and consisted of 70 pregnant women of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I-II. Patients were randomized into Group I (wound site infiltration, n=35) and Group T (TAP block, n=35). Spinal anaesthesia was administered to all patients. In Group I, wound site infiltration was applied by the surgical team. In Group T, a USG-guided bilateral TAP block was applied. Patients' numeric pain scale (NPS) levels at 2, 6, 12 and 24(th) hours, after the operation (NPS0) and during mobilization were assessed. Postoperative complications, time to first analgesic request and patient satisfaction were recorded. The NPS0 values of Group T were found to higher and time to first analgesic request longer than those of Group I. The NPS values of Group I at 2, 6, 12, and 24(th) hours were found to be statistically significantly higher than those of Group T.

Nine spa types were detected; t003 was the predominant (32.1%) one, detected in various wards and throughout the study period, while t037 was recovered only from intensive care unit patients, and only in April 2011, suggestive of an epidemic. Additional rare types were detected for the first time in Greece. Spa typing and random polymorphic DNA analysis gave an insight into the epidemiology of MRSA in a Northern Greece hospital. Concerning the distribution in the hospital, the predominant spa type t003 was present in various wards, and was constantly detected throughout the study period, very suggestive of an epidemic, while other types were detected only in specific wards.

","454":"During preoperative radiotherapy, effective doses of ionizing radiation occasionally cause wound complications after subsequent surgery. This study was designed to determine the effects of intraperitoneally or orally administered N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on anastomotic healing of irradiated rats. Forty Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups containing 10 rats each. A 3 cm long surgical full-thickness midline laparotomy was performed to all groups (Groups 1-4). Group 1 was designed as a control group without radiation therapy and NAC treatment. Groups 2, 3 and 4 received a single abdominal dose of 10 Gy irradiation before laparotomy and groups 3 and 4 received oral and intraperitoneal NAC, respectively. Group comparisons demonstrated that breaking strength was significantly higher in NAC treated rats. A statistically significant difference was determined in terms of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondealdehyde (MDA) and glutation (GSH) values between groups (p&lt;0.001). Nevertheless, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels were found to be similar between groups (p=0.163). Serum GSH and SOD levels were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 when compared to group 2 (p &lt; 0.05). Similarly, there was a significant increase in serum MDA concentration, predicting lipid peroxidation, in group 2 when compared to groups 1, 3 and 4 (p &lt; 0.05). There was not a significant difference between Groups 3 and 4 regarding GSH, MDA, SOD, and AOPP levels. Histopathological analysis revealed that NAC administration, either orally or intraperitoneally, leads to a better incisional healing in terms of inflammation, granulation, collagen deposition, reepithelization and neovascularization. The present study supports the hypothesis that NAC administration alleviates the negative effects of radiotherapy on incisional wound healing by means of reducing oxidative stress markers and improving histologic parameters independent of the route of administration. ","455":"It is known that blood flow properties such as low\/ oscillatory wall shear stress (WSS), high blood viscosity, low blood velocity and high concentration of low density lipoprotein (LDL) macromolecules, are some of the main flow parameters causing atherosclerosis. Limited research has been undertaken on the pulsatile WSS and WSS gradient (WSSG) analysis focusing in the differentiation between the bifurcation itself and the lateral to it walls in a normal left coronary artery (LCA). The results obtained show the flow characteristics and qualify the spatial and temporal distribution of WSS ant its gradient in regions close to the LCA tree flow dividers and in opposite to them areas. A 3D computer generated model of the LCA tree based on averaged human data extracted from angiographies was developed for computational fluid dynamics analysis. Physiological phasic flow velocity is incorporated as entrance boundary condition. The instantaneous min wall shear stress oscillates from 0.45 to 2.84 N\/m(2) at the flow divider and from 0.25 to 1.28 N\/m(2) at the lateral walls of the main bifurcation. However, for the D1-S1 bifurcation (first diagonal-first septal), the instantaneous min wall shear stress oscillates from 0.6 to 3.85 N\/m(2) at the flow divider and from 0.6 to 2.65 N\/m(2) at the lateral walls. Mean wall shear stress, from max systole to max diastole, experiences a 129.0 % increase at the main bifurcation flow divider. The difference between max and min wall shear stress for the flow divider of the main bifurcation, as it is compared with the max wall shear stress over the entire cardiac pulse, attains a maximum value of 81.1 % for the lateral walls and 60.0 % at the peak of diastole. At the D1-S1 bifurcation, the corresponding difference values are 69.0% and 57.0 % for the lateral walls and flow divider, respectively. The mean wall shear stress gradient experiences a 123.0 % increase from max systole to max diastole at the main bifurcation flow divider and 153.0 % at main bifurcation lateral walls. Proximal LCA bifurcation exhibit lower spatial wall shear stress and lower wall shear stress gradient values compared to distal bifurcations. The lateral walls compared to the bifurcation itself are exposed to low WSS and WSSG. With regards to the temporal variation, wall shear stress and its gradient exhibited lower values throughout systole as compared to diastole, suggesting a possible atherogenic effect of both the systolic phase by itself as well as the phasic oscillation of wall shear stress and its gradient from systole to diastole. ","456":"Functional hyposplenism is a condition accompanying many diseases such as sickle cell disease, celiac disease, alcoholic liver disease, hepatic cirrhosis, lymphomas and autoimmune disorders. It is characterised mostly by defective immune responses against infectious agents, especially encapsulated organisms, since the spleen is thought to play an important role in the production and maturation of B-memory lymphocytes and other substances like opsonins, both of which are considered crucial elements of the immune system for fighting infections. It is also associated with thrombocytosis, which might lead to thromboembolic events. Functional hyposplenism is diagnosed by the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies and pitted erythrocytes in the peripheral blood smear, and by nuclear imaging modalities such as spleen scintigraphy with the use of Technetium-99m and\/or spleen scintigraphy with the use of heat-damaged Technetium-99m labeled erythrocytes. Severe infections accompanying functional hyposplenism can lead to the overwhelming post infection syndrome, which can often be fatal. Identifying patients with functional hyposplenism is important because simple measures such as vaccination against common infective microorganisms (e.g. Streptococcus pneumonia, Neisseria meningitides and Haemophilous influenzae) and antibiotic therapy when needed are considered beneficial in diminishing the frequency and gravity of the infections accompanying the syndrome.

Sections were evaluated regarding the content of different muscle fibre types (type I, IIa and IIb), fibre cross-section area and perimeter. Groups were comparable regarding the ratio of different muscle fibre types. Regenerated type I fibres of both HC and LC groups had significant greater mean cross-sectional area and perimeter, compared to SL fibres. No signs of necrosis or inflammation were observed. Type IIa and IIb fibres didn't show significant differences. Regenerated muscles, following local anaesthetic application, showed long-term morphological differences, which could lead to impaired function. Further studies are needed, in order to clarify the underlying cellular mechanisms and the subsequent possible functional impairment. ","470":"The Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) was developed in an attempt to define the basic factors of personality or temperament. We aimed to assess the factor structure and the psychometric properties of its Greek version and to explore its relation to psychopathological symptoms and hostility features. ZKPQ was translated into Greek using back-translation and was administered to 1,462 participants (475 healthy participants, 619 medical patients, 177 psychiatric patients and 191 opiate addicts). Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses were performed. Symptoms Distress Check-List (SCL-90R) and Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnaire (HDHQ) were administered to test criterion validity. Five factors were identified, largely corresponding to the original version's respective factors. Retest reliabilities were acceptable (rli's: 0.79-0.89) and internal consistency was adequate for Neuroticism-Anxiety (0.87), Impulsive Sensation Seeking (0.80), Aggression-Hostility (0.77) and Activity (0.72), and lower for Sociability (0.64). Most components were able to discriminate psychiatric patients and opiate addicts from healthy participants. Opiate addicts exhibited higher rates on Impulsive Sensation Seeking compared to healthy participants. Neuroticism-Anxiety (p&lt;0.001) and Impulsive Sensation Seeking (p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with psychological distress and Aggression-Hostility was the most powerful correlate of Total Hostility (p&lt;0.001), and Neuroticism-Anxiety was the stronger correlate of introverted hostility (p&lt;0.001), further supporting the instrument's concurrent validity. Present findings support the applicability of the Greek version of ZKPQ within the Greek population.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of microalbuminuria in Albanian type 2 diabetes patients and its association with other cardiovascular risk factors. Three hundred and twenty-one patients with type 2 diabetes attending, diabetes centers in Albania were enrolled in this cross-sectional, multicenter study. The subjects, aged 40-70 years, had no known proteinuria or other kidney disease. Pregnant women and patients with acute infections were excluded. Data including waist circumference, duration of diabetes and history of hypertension were obtained by questionnaire. Blood samples were drawn after 12 h overnight fasting to measure glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), serum cholesterol, triglyceride and creatinine. Microalbuminuria was assessed using dipstick kits in early morning urine samples. The prevalence of normoalbuminuria was 56.3%, microalbuminuria 40.8% and macroalbuminuria 2.8%. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p&lt;0.01), HbA1c (p&lt;0.01) and fasting plasma glucose (p&lt;0.001) were significantly higher in microalbuminuric than in normoalbuminuric subjects. Independent risk factors for microalbuminuria were duration of diabetes (OR: 2.785, 95% CI: 1.156-3.759), systolic blood pressure (OR: 2.88, 95% CI: 1.85-6.85) and waist circumference (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 1.01-5.45) in males and poor glycemic control (OR: 4.51, 95% CI: 1.45-13.98), duration of diabetes (OR: 2.568, 95% CI: 1.702-3.778) and waist circumference (OR: 4.87, 95% CI: 1.80-13.11) in females.

Up to date, only one CCHF case has been reported in Greece, while a distinct virus strain (AP92) had been isolated in 1975 from ticks in Imathia prefecture, northern Greece. The aim of the present study was to estimate the CCHF virus (CCHFV) seroprevalence among humans residing in the prefecture of Imathia, and the neighboring prefecture of Pella, and to investigate the risk factors associated with the seropositivity. A total of 277 persons randomly selected from the general population were tested for the presence of CCHFV IgG antibodies. Additional 51 persons belonging in groups with risk for acquisition of CCHFV infection (19 slaughterhouse workers and 32 hunters) were also tested. All participants filled in a questionnaire related to demographics and probable risk factors (e.g. occupation, former tick bite, animal contact). Six of the 277 (2.2%) persons were found to carry CCHFV IgG antibodies: 3 in Imathia and 3 in Pella prefecture, resulting in seroprevalence of 1.7% and 2.9%, respectively. History of tick bite, residence in a hilly territory and increased age were significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity. None of the slaughterers was found IgG-positive, while CCHFV IgG antibodies were detected in a 67-year old hunter who reported agricultural activities and a former tick bite. A relatively low seroprevalence is observed in the area where the AP92 strain has been isolated, with tick bite being significantly associated with CCHFV seropositivity. Further studies in ticks in the area will show whether are they infected by the AP92 strain or other more pathogenic CCHFV strains and at which rate.

This is the first systematic recording of the laryngeal cancer epidemiological data in Northern Greece. During the period 1992-2010 1,638 patients were diagnosed with and treated for malignant head and neck tumors. One thousand one hundred and four cases (67.4%) were malignant laryngeal tumors, 98.4% of which (1,088 cases) were squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Only 16 patients (1.5%) presented with other types of malignancies. The average age of the SCC patients was 62.1 years. Only 35 patients were women (3.2%). More than 60% of the patients were farmers or labor workers, 86.9%, were smokers, 43.2% were consuming alcohol on a daily basis and 36.1% had a positive family history of malignancy. Concerning tumor location, 60.2% were glottic cancers. T staging revealed that 1.2% of the cases were carcinomas in situ, 28% T1 tumors, 19% T2, 32 % T3, and 20% T4. Tumor grading showed that 43% of the cases were G1, 42.1% were G2, and 11.8% were G3.

Clinical and Imaging Presentation: The median age at presentation is 27 years and the most common location are the foot and the ankle. MR imaging typically shows a benign looking, well defined, homogenous mass; on T1-weighted MR images, it is usually homogeneous and isointense or slight hyperintense to muscle, whereas on T2-weighted MR images, it is usually more heterogeneous with variable signal intensity. Pathology: Microscopically, the clear cell appearance is due to the accumulation of glycogen. The cells show no or minimal pleomorphism, and paucity of mitotic figures that is in concordance with the slow-growing behavior of the tumor. Scattered multinucleated giant cells are commonly present; areas of necrosis and melanin pigment may be identified. The reciprocal translocation t(12;22)(q13;q12) is observed in more than 90% of clear cell sarcoma cases. In addition, polysomy of chromosome 8 has been observed as a secondary abnormality in many cases of clear cell sarcoma. The differential diagnosis of clear cell sarcoma should include melanoma, epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, melanotic schwannoma, paraganglioma-like dermal melanocytic tumor, perivascular epithelioid cell neoplasms (PEComas), cellular blue naevus, synovial sarcoma (monophasic type), alveolar soft part sarcoma, paraganglioma, epithelioid sarcoma and carcinomas. Treatment and Prognosis: The treatment of choice for clear cell sarcoma is wide surgical resection. If complete excision is achieved, adjuvant treatments are not unnecessary. Chemotherapy is predominantly employed in patients with metastatic disease. The 5 to 20 year survival of the patients with clear cell sarcoma range from 67% to 10%.

To identify the factors influencing the mortality after hip fractures in the elderly, the effect of rehabilitation and family support in the post-fracture course, and the impact of these fractures on the family of the injured elderly. We conducted an observational study of 218 consecutive patients older than 60 years of age, who underwent surgical management of a unilateral hip fracture at a tertiary hospital of Central Greece, with follow-up contacts at 30 days, 3 months and one year. Demographic characteristics, pre- and post-fracture residential and functional status, assessment of basic activities of daily living (ADL), co-morbidities, type and mechanism of fracture and hospitalization data as well as the modification of activities of the patients' relatives were recorded. Fifteen patients (6.9%) died during hospitalization; thirty-nine (17.9%) died within one year of fracture.

During his transportation from the operation theater, a pathological intertrochanteric fracture of the right hip occured. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a bone lytic lesion located into the great trochanter of the right femur. Open surgical biopsy of the lesion was performed and the histological examination showed primary angiosarcoma of bone. The treatment included radiotherapy (300 cGy per fraction in 13 days) followed by excision of the proximal femur and custom made total hip arthroplasty. The diagnosis was confirmed on the surgical specimen. ","512":"Anaphylactic shock and pulmonary edema are unusual but life-threatening adverse reactions to drugs. We encountered a case of serious anaphylactic shock and acute pulmonary edema caused by a single oral intake of acetazolamide, a frequently used medication by several medical specialties especially in ophthalmology. An 80-year-old female was admitted to our emergency Coronary Unit presenting symptoms and signs of shock with acute pulmonary edema. Patient was hospitalised at the Opthalmological Department with intention to undergo cataract surgery. Approximately, four hours before operation, half a tablet of acetazolamide 250 mg was given, in order to control her pre-operative intraocular pressure. Half an hour later, she complained of nausea, became cyanotic, and suffered acute respiratory failure with characteristic massive pulmonary edema. Ventilatory support was initiated and O2 saturation increased to 89%. She was administered 2 ampoules of intravenously furosemide. The blood chemistry panel was normal, as well as myocardial cytolysis tests. Chest radiograph showed enlarged cardiothoracic index, ill-defined vessels, peribronchial cuffing, alveolar edema. An echocardiogram showed normal atria and ventricles, normal systolic function, and excluded pulmonary hypertension. Furosemide (40 mg\/IV, S: 1x3) and oxygen (8 Lt\/min) were administered for the following 24 hours. Clinical improvement was seen and the O2 saturation was normalized. ECG controls were normal. The patient experienced a full recovery and was discharged 3 days later. The relationship between anaphylactic shock with acute pulmonary edema and acetazolamide seems highly probable in this case, considering the short time between drug assumption and onset of symptoms (about 30 minutes) and the absence of previous diseases to which symptoms could be related. The patient was not previously treated with acetazolamide. Nowadays, the clinical use of acetazolamide is very limited. Its principal uses are in the preoperative treatment of closed angle glaucoma and continuative therapy of open angle glaucoma.

A 76-year old man presented with red to violaceous nodules in the anterior aspect of both tibias. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of PCDLBL-LT. A thorough clinical and laboratory investigation was negative for any systemic involvement. However, computed tomography of the thorax showed mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Both bone marrow aspiration and trephine did not show any evidence of bone marrow infiltration. Initially R-CHOP regimen (rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) achieved a total clearance of the lesions. Nevertheless, five months later patient presented with a relapse and was managed with palliative radiotherapy. The same treatment modality was applied for the second recurrence, as well. PCDLBL-LT affects mostly elderly patients. The consequent age related comorbidities and the frequent relapses require a strict follow up of the patients.

","516":"An increasing number of pregnancies occur in the presence of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), mainly including chronic glomerulonephritis (GN), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and lupus nephritis (LN). The most important factor affecting fetal and maternal prognosis is the degree of renal function at conception. In the majority of patients with mild renal function impairment, and well-controlled blood pressure, pregnancy is usually successful and does not alter the natural course of maternal renal disease. Conversely, fetal outcome and long-term maternal renal function might be seriously threatened by pregnancy in women with moderate or severe renal function impairment. The last few years, advances in our knowledge about the interaction of pregnancy and renal function resulted in the improvement of fetal outcome in patients with chronic renal failure and also in the management of pregnant women with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) maintained on dialysis. However, women with impaired renal function and those on dialysis should be carefully counseled about the risks of pregnancy. ","517":"This study aims to assess at what level healthcare worker satisfaction affects patient satisfaction, as well as which elements of healthcare worker satisfaction affect health service quality and patient satisfaction. Data was collected via questionnaire-based surveys, from 18,642 healthcare workers and 9,283 patients across 50 secondary healthcare institutions in Serbia. Data analysis was based on descriptive statistics, correlations and the I2-distance method. Despite the general belief that healthcare worker satisfaction has a significant impact on patient satisfaction, the research results show that the correlation factor between these two is relatively low. Despite this, the obtained value of correlation cannot be neglected, therefore it can only corroborate the fact that healthcare worker satisfaction does impact patient satisfaction. The results of the study show that the satisfaction of healthcare workers with the time they have to accomplish their assigned tasks has the greatest effect upon patient satisfaction. By understanding the importance of certain elements of healthcare worker satisfaction and its effects on patient satisfaction, it is possible to make decisions about factors that need to be improved in order to raise patient satisfaction to the highest possible level. These research results are significant for the management of health care institutions and responsible state institutions which create policy and strategy for improving the quality of health care services.

Medical records of 551 patients who presented with SLE at hospitals of the region of Thessaloniki between 1989 and 2007 were studied. Patients who developed SLE at or after the age of 50 years were classified as the late onset group, while younger patients served as the early onset group. Data on clinical manifestations and damage accrual at disease onset and at 5 years was obtained and compared between the two groups. In 121 patients, the disease started after the age of 50 years. Elderly patients showed less pronounced female predominance and less often presented with malar rash, nephropathy, fever and lymphadenopathy, while lung involvement, pericarditis and sicca syndrome were more frequent. Damage accrual was similar in both groups. The main causes of damage at 5 years differed, with the elderly exhibiting more cardiovascular damage. They also had a higher incidence of hypertension and osteoporosis at 5 years. Caucasian SLE patients with late onset of the disease present with different clinical manifestations, suggesting that age affects the expression of SLE. Damage accrual at 5 years is similar in the elderly and the younger patients. However, the causes of this damage and the occurrence of other comorbidities follow a different pattern, possibly reflecting the disease process and the effects of aging.

The scope of this short report is to provide relevant epidemiological information, an evaluation of the efficacy of the seasonal vaccine and antiviral drugs. Molecular analysis revealed the close match of A(H1N1) 2009 pandemic and post-pandemic 2010-11 viruses with the vaccine virus. However, a proportion of the influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses that circulated in 2011-12 differed from the vaccine strains, possibly explaining the high hospitalization and fatality rates. There is also a trend of new virus strains to accumulate amino acid changes. Only A(H1N1) viruses resistant to oseltamivir have been detected. Constant epidemiological and molecular surveillance is essential to monitor the efficacy of the vaccine and antiviral drugs and assess the severity of each influenza season.

The aims of the present study were to evaluate the role of RSV in children &gt;2 years old hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and to type the circulating RSV strains. Serum and throat swab samples were taken upon admission from Greek children aged &gt; 2 years, hospitalized with atypical CAP, and when possible, a second serum sample was also taken. RSV IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), while throat swab samples were tested by nested RT-PCR. Additional serological testing was performed to find out probable co-infections. A total of 101 children with atypical CAP were included in the study, aged 2.5-14 years (median 8.25). RSV IgM antibodies were detected in 21 (20.7%) cases, either in the first or\/and in the second serum sample, while RSV genome was detected in 11 out of 15 (73%) IgM-positive patients, which were further tested by PCR. PCR-positive results were obtained up to the 7(th) day of illness. Among the 11 cases, one was of type B, and all the rest were of type A. The median age of the RSV-positive children was 4 years (range 3-13 years). Although RSV was detected in all seasons, the majority of cases (31%) were detected in winter. Co-infection was detected in 3 cases (two with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and one with adenovirus). Apart from the known role of RSV as the most important pathogen causing acute respiratory disease in infants and young children, it is also a significant viral pathogen in older children hospitalized because of CAP. Genetic typing provides further insight into the epidemiology of the disease.

Many topical preparations are used in radiation oncology departments in the skin care. Sucralfate humid gel, a colloidal physical form of the anti-ulcer drug sucralfate, promotes epithelial regeneration and activates cell proliferation. Based on this knowledge, we performed a non-randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of topical sucralfate gel in 30 breast cancer patients receiving postoperative accelerated hypofractionated photon beam therapy. The comparison was performed with 30 patients as historical controls. The acute reaction of the skin was significantly lower in the group receiving the sucralfate gel (p&lt;0.05, Mann Whitney test), while 90% of the patients had no evidence of radiation induced skin toxicity.

Sixty one consecutive women with early stage breast cancer (median age 58 years - interquartile range 22) were included in this study. They all underwent mastectomy followed by 6 cycles of tri-weekly administration of FEC regimen and were free of ocular surface, eyelid and tear film symptomatic disease at baseline. None of them had pre- or coexisting treatment with other chemotherapeutic agent or radiotherapy. Slit lamp examination of the ocular surface, Schirmer test I (without topical anesthesia) and tears Break up Time test (BUT) were performed before the initiation of treatment and immediately after the third therapeutic cycle. From 61 women 39.34% had significant conjunctival hyperemia, 41.0% lid margin abnormalities, 4.92% blepharitis, 6.56% madarosis, 3.28% punctate epithelial keratopathy and 4.92% oedema of the lower punctum mucosal opening after three chemotherapeutic cycles. Mean BUT measures were found lower after the third chemotherapeutic cycle (p=0.001) but mean Schirmer test I values were higher after the third chemotherapeutic cycle (p=0.001). Women on chemotherapy with FEC regimen are more susceptible to develop ocular surface and tear film alterations, within the first three cycles of chemotherapy for breast cancer, and thus, prompt ophthalmological evaluation may be proven beneficial for early diagnosis and management of the induced ocular disease.

","528":"One of the four transmembrane receptors that belong to the erB family, is the HER2\/neu oncoprotein. It forms heterodimers by binding to specific ligands, enhancing cell signaling and assisting in cell growth and differentiation. A variety of human epithelial tumors are characterised by an overexpression and gene amplification of the HER2\/neu oncoprotein. This is the case of breast tumors, in which the receptor's overexpression and its gene have been studied extensively and its overexpression has been associated with unfavorable prognosis. In addition, HER2\/neu plays a major role in understanding the oncogenesis of prostate adenocarcinoma. For this reason, clarifying the HER2\/neu expression is particularly important in androgen independent prostate cancer (PCa), due to the increasing interest in using anti-HER2 targeted therapies for advanced disease treatment. On the other hand, the overexpression of HER2\/neu has been reported to release soluble extracellular domain (ECD) in the serum of PCa patients. For this reason, the present review focuses only on studies referring to Serum HER2\/neu levels in PCa patients. Serum levels of HER2\/neu generally increase with advanced disease state and higher levels have been associated with recurrent or metastatic PCa and a clinically worse outcome. Therefore, it may be concluded that since there is a correlation between increased HER2\/neu levels and a poor prognosis in prostate adenocarcinoma, serum HER2\/neu could be used in clinical practice and follow up of patients with advanced PCa. ","529":"Lithiasis continues to be an important factor in chronic renal disease, since it leads to chronic tubulo-interstitial nephritis, which is estimated to be involved in 15- 30% of cases of end stage chronic renal insufficiency. It is believed that in order for a stone to be formed, a solid phase needs to be first produced from microcrystals (the nucleus), which are formed from salts (and other substances) that are found dissolved in the urine (nucleosis of crystals). Afterwards, the crystals that constitute the core increase in size and link up with each other (incorporation). The main physiochemical factors that participate in the creation of the nucleus are the hypersaturation of urine, the lack of inhibitors of nucleosis and probably the organic substrate. In order for the increase in size and the incorporation of crystals to take place, hypersaturation, the lack of inhibitors, the organic substrate and the epitaxis, during which crystals of a substance are attached to the surface of other crystals of a different chemical structure (e.g. crystals of oxalic calcium onto crystals of uric acid) are needed. Various molecules have been found in urine, which modify to an important degree the adherence of crystals to the surface of epithelial cells. It also seems very likely that certain reactions of renal epithelial cells that follow the uptake of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals are due to oxalate ions, which are released during the process of deconstruction of the intracellular crystals. From here, the crystals migrate in the median tissue, where an inflammatory reaction takes place and finally the crystals are destroyed. Macrophages gather in the crystals of the median tissue. The osteopontin which is related to the crystals acts as a chemotactic factor for the macrophages and therefore is perhaps involved in this process too. The uptake of crystals appears to be subjected to regulating mechanisms, as molecules which regulate the endocytosis of COM crystals, a process that is related to changes in the special components of the cytoskeleton, have been observed. In conclusion, the processes of adherence and of endocytosis promote the detention of crystals in the nephron, whilst intracellular deconstruction is an important factor of defence against the deposition of calcium in the kidney.

Eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody blocking activation of complement C5 is currently used in the treatment of PNH. Recent results demonstrated that eculizumab effectively reduces thrombosis. Description of case. We present a 30-year-old male patient admitted with abdominal and lumbar pain. Thorough investigation revealed severe hemolytic anemia requiring transfusions and hepatosplenomegaly. Imaging findings were compatible with a Budd-Chiari syndrome. Flow cytometry confirmed the PNH diagnosis. Due to refractory ascites he underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal-systemic shunt (TIPS) and eculizumab administration was started. Results. He has already completed three years of eculizumab treatment and he is transfusion independent. There is also a significant reduction in fatigue with improvement in his quality of life. Doppler scans of his TIPS persistently show it to be patent. Conclusions. Classical PNH patients with thrombosis and severe intravascular hemolysis are particularly challenging to manage.

A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 105 lung cancer patients who were admitted to the ICU between January 2008 and January 2011 was performed. Severity of illness on the first day of ICU admission was assessed using the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scoring systems. Associated organ failure was determined according to the Knaus criteria. Eighty four (80%) patients were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, 14 (13.3%) with small cell lung cancer, one patient with mesothelioma, and in the remaining 6 patients, the type of lung cancer could not be determined. Significant factors on admission were APACHE II and SOFA scores, poor performance status and severe comorbidity. During ICU stay, the main risk factors for poor outcome were the long term mechanical ventilation duration, use of vasopressors, more than two organ system failures and septic condition.

VIP seems to have a major role in the homeostasis of the respiratory system, while several studies, including clinical trials, suggest that VIP-inhaled agonists could be used in respiratory therapeutics. In this review, we provide an introduction to the field of VIP research geared to clinical and research pulmonologists. As a neurotransmitter, VIP exerts a potent bronchodilatory and vasodilatory effect and also is supposed to induce the house-keeping mucus secretion by submucosal glands. On the other hand, it has immunomodulatory functions which include humoral immune response suppression, inhibition of vascular and bronchial remodeling and inflammation and attenuation of the cigarette smoke extract-induced apoptotic death of alveolar L2 cells. Recent research on a wide spectrum of lung diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, and sarcoidosis indicates a potential therapeutic role of a VIP agonist. Simultaneously, novel stabilized inhaled VIP agonists and drug delivery systems have been proposed as a promising candidate alternative drug with minimized side effects. These data are supported by the results of certain, limited clinical trials which have already been conducted. Ongoing research continues to clarify the immunomodulatory effects of VIP and to confirm animal findings with human studies.

Description of case: An anomalous palmaris longus muscle was found in the right upper extremity of a 63 year-old male cadaver. The muscle was totally fleshy without a long insertion tendon. Its origin was normal, the belly was rather broad and long, fusiform at the upper half and unipennate at the lower half of the forearm, and it was toggled into a short and thick tendon. At its insertion the tendon was split forming a second thinner tendon. The thick tendon was inserted into the flexor retinaculum and the thinner one into the palmar aponeurosis. The muscle compressed the median nerve although no related symptoms were reported on the cadaver's medical history. This variation is of clinical importance because it may cause carpal tunnel syndrome or difficulties in image interpretation by radiologists. In addition the palmaris longus muscle is an anatomical landmark for operations at the forearm and wrist and its tendon can be used as a graft.

We present results of the first series of patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy managed in our institution with intramyocardial implantation of autologous bone marrow stem cells at the time of coronary artery bypass grafting. The aim is to evaluate feasibility and safety of the procedure in our institution. Nine patients with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass grafting were managed with concurrent intramyocardial autologous bone marrow stem cells injection in pre-defined viable peri-infarct areas that showed poor perfusion and could not be grafted. Detailed mapping of infracted and hibernating myocardial segments was performed in all patients with single photon emission computed tomography segmental analysis. There was no perioperative 30-day mortality. Improvement was evident in left ventricular ejection fraction which was increased significantly from 31.3% preoperatively to 42.4%, 46.6% and 52.5% at 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. Postoperative thallium scintigraphy revealed increased perfusion in myocardial segments corresponding to areas of stem cell injection and a net reduction in the estimated infarct size at 6 and 12 months in 5\/8 (62.5%) patients. Preliminary data from this pilot study show that intramyocardial administration of bone marrow stem cells in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting for ischemic cardiomyopathy is safe and associated with an improvement in left ventricular function and enhanced reperfusion of non-viable myocardial territories.

An input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis was used to measure three indicators, technical, pure technical and scale efficiency indicators. Data was collected from the reports of the web-based facility (ESY.net) which was developed by the General Secretary of Ministry of Health and Social Solidarity. The input variables were the number of physicians, the number of nurses and other personnel, the number of beds and expenditures of every hospital. The output variables were the number of inpatient and outpatient visits. Hospitals were categorized into three size groups. Between the years 2009-2011, all hospitals, especially middle-sized hospitals showed performance improvement on all three indicators. Specific problems were noticed mainly in large-sized hospitals. The technical efficiency of Large-sized hospitals was estimated at 80%, of Middle-sized hospitals at 82% and of Small hospitals-Health Care Centres at 89%. Pure technical and scale efficiency varied between satisfactory levels throughout the study period. Comparing the 2009-2011 data, an improvement of technical efficiency in NHS hospitals has been achieved up to 100%, mainly in the middle-sized hospitals. Specifically, an increase of best practice hospitals has been noted, especially in the middle and small-sized hospitals, when certain units were added the technical efficiency reached over 80%. The consequences of the spending-cuts and the constant reforms appear to have a positive effect on hospitals' efficiency.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of stroboscopy for voice disorders related with benign pathology and apply results in evidence based health care. Prospective study. Tertiary care hospital. Voice Clinic. One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with an initial diagnosis of benign laryngeal disease or dysphonia of no clarified cause (normal laryngoscopy) were examined stroboscopically and studied prospectively until a final diagnosis was reached. Sixty-six men, eighty women and four children met the selection criteria for the study and had adequate follow-up. The initial laryngoscopic diagnosis was compared to the stroboscopic diagnosis. The diagnostic value of stroboscopy was rated at a scale of 0 to 3. A score 3 describes the diagnostic value of stroboscopy in the cases where the stroboscopic examination resulted to a change of the therapeutic modality offered to the patient. For one third of the study's population the diagnostic value of stroboscopy was very significant, since it established the laryngeal pathology responsible for the voice disorder (28.8%) and for a small number of patients it changed the choice of treatment (4.7%). For about one third of the cases (32.2%) stroboscopy offered additional information regarding the cause of dysphonia. The diagnostic value of stroboscopy correlated with the type of laryngeal pathology. Patients expected to benefit from stroboscopic examination are patients with small lesions of the vocal fold edge, dysphonic patients with unremarkable indirect laryngoscopy, and professional voice users.

Patients' demographic variables, comorbid conditions, ICU admission diagnosis, disease severity and outcome were analyzed. In case-patients, time and possible sources of bacteremia, molecular assays, antimicrobial susceptibility and response to therapy were also recorded. During a 9-month period, 30 episodes of B. cenocepacia bacteremia were diagnosed in 21 patients. Median time for a positive blood culture was 9 days after admission. None of the case-patients had respiratory colonization prior to onset of bacteremia. Pathogen was susceptible to meropenem, piperacillin\/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim \/sulphamethoxazole. Surveillance involved environmental and patient\/personnel cultures. All samples were negative for B. cenocepacia. However, extensive assessment revealed lapses in infection control procedures. PFGE molecular typing showed that all isolates were indistinguishable. Prior surgery and septic shock on ICU admission were significantly more frequent among case-patients. These patients needed significantly prolonged mechanical ventilation, central venous catheterization and ICU hospitalization. All patients responded to antimicrobial therapy and the attributed mortality was zero. Complete elimination of the outbreak was achieved only after strict enforcement of infection control policies and ICU disinfection. The outbreak influenced ICU morbidity but it did not affect mortality. Although extensive environmental investigations failed to identify the source of infection, B.cenocepacia disappeared after implementation of control measures. Effective outbreak elimination cannot be limited to offending reservoir removal but needs to extend to efficient infection control practices. ","579":"The number of available liver grafts is not sufficient to meet the current demand. A significant number of patients succumb before they receive a liver graft. However, approximately 10% of marginal livers are considered unsuitable for donation and are discarded. Calculating the primary non-function probability for any given liver graft can be performed using prognostic tools, such as the Donor Risk Index and the Eurotransplant Donor Risk Index. On the other hand, mortality on the waiting list, which is sometimes more than 15% per year of enlistment, directly correlates with its size, the graft supply and the gravity of the potential recipients' clinical condition. Up to 30% of the potential recipients will never receive a graft. The purpose of this invited commentary is to examine whether the literature supports the utilization of the marginal liver grafts that would otherwise be discarded. It appears that there is sufficient evidence in favor of the development of a \"B-list\" for potential liver graft recipients. It should comprise all of the candidates who were definitely removed from the primary waiting list or were never included. The potential \"B-list\" recipients should only be eligible to receive grafts that would otherwise be discarded, i.e., \"B-livers\". Enrollment in a \"B-list\" might not only increase the overall patient survival (enlisted and transplanted combined) but might also improve candidate quality of life by maintaining their hope for a cure.

The development of carbapenem resistance among P. aeruginosa strains is multifactorial. Plasmid or integron-mediated carbapenemases, increased expression of efflux systems, reduced porin expression and increased chromosomal cephalosporinase activity have all been defined as contributory factors. Phenotypic tests and molecular techniques are used for the characterization of the resistance determinants.

We tried to investigate the presence of a variety of coronary anomalies in these patients to determine the prevalence of various types of anomalies and their anatomic variation in a selected population of the European part of Turkey. The potential association between coronary atherosclerosis and congenital coronary anomalies was also investigated. Among these patients, 95 patients were found to have major coronary anomalies that predominantly comprised anomalous aortic origin of coronary arteries. Among the major anomalies, anomalous aortic origin of the left circumflex (LCX) artery from the right sinus of Valsalva or right coronary artery (RCA) was found to be the the most prevalent (46 out of 95 patients) outnumbering the second most common anomaly that was anomalous aortic origin of the RCA (32 out of 95 patients). In the present study, the incidence of major coronary arterial anomaly was found to be 0.74 %. However, only about one third of the patients (31 out of 95, 32.6%) with major anomaly had significant coronary atherosclerotic lesions among whom nine were found to involve the LCX artery with a posterior course. The incidence of congenital coronary anomalies in a selected population of the European part of Turkey is similar to those of other populations. Congenital coronary anomalies generally present as isolated anomalies and are not associated with an increased risk of coronary atherosclerosis in this series.

A total of 632 mothers with an infant aged 0-3 months who presented to our University Hospital volunteered their participation and 598 mothers were included in the study. The study was based on a questionnaire form given to the mothers. Two hundred eighty three (283) mothers swaddled their infants (47.3 %), while 315 mothers did not swaddle (52.7%). The mothers that swaddled their baby cited tradition (\"That's what I learned from my elders\") as the most common reason (38%) for swaddling. The most important reason (32%) for not swaddling was the mothers' belief \"that it would prevent normal development\". In Turkey, the swaddling tends to decrease with the increase of maternal education level and socio-economic situation.The level of Turkish mother's knowledge about beneficial and adverse effect of swaddling were insufficient.We think that the information about properly swaddling should be given to mothers In order to benefit from it's positive effects and at the same time and avoid its adverse effects.

A total of 109 anonymous questionnaires were distributed to non-vascular surgeons in our hospital, inquiring about their smoking attitudes, their smoking cessation advice practices, whether they appreciated the benefits of preoperative smoking cessation, and their knowledge of smoking cessation methods. Eighty questionnaires (from 51 resident doctors and 29 academic staff) were returned (response rate: 73.40%). Of the surgeons, 17.50% were current smokers. Although 40% of the surgeons surveyed believed that preoperative smoking cessation reduces postoperative complications, 31.2% of the surgeons (25\/63) had given smoking cessation advice at least to 1 patient in the last month. Most of the resident doctors (39.2%) advised smoking cessation within a month; prior to surgery however, the academic staff (27.6%) advised cessation immediately before the operation (p=0.038). There was a significant difference between academic sfaff and resident doctors concerning the method to increase a patient's chance of quitting (p=0.045), even among current smokers (p=0.049). The surgeons who participated in the questionnaire were aware that smoking cessation improves outcome, but most of them did not appreciate that providing brief advice, referring to cessation services, or prescribing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) may be of benefit in helping patients to quit. It is necessary to educate surgeons about the scale of the benefit and the efficacy of smoking cessation interventions or to set up systematic frameworks to offer smoking cessation advice to preoperative patients who smoke. ","622":"The influence of factors such as age, sex, life style and smoking on oxidative stress status of the organism remains unclear. There is evidence that dietary intake of antioxidants is thought to enforce the organism ability to counteract free radicals. Administration of synthetic antioxidants as dietary supplements does not seem to have the same beneficial effect as consumption of the same antioxidants as part of food ingredients. This work focuses on the investigation of age and diet effects on oxidative stress and examines the hypotheses of their significant influence. Blood samples of 146 volunteers, were collected and allocated in three age groups. All volunteers completed a questionnaire concerning home and working environmental conditions, special habits and dietary preferences. We implemented a thirty days diet rich in antioxidants in 55 volunteers. Antioxidant activity was estimated before and after the special diet by measuring the influence of serum in oxidation of ABTS by the ferryl myoglobinhydrogen peroxide system. Our findings showed unexpected lower serum total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in younger people (ages 18-35 yrs) 79%, compared to middle aged and elderly individuals and a large increase 62% in serum TAC of all age-groups after the one-month special diet. These results imply that a diet rich in antioxidants based on antioxidant rich food consumption and not on single antioxidants administration, can increase the antioxidant status of the organism and offer better health. The total serum antioxidant status increases with age and this fact should be taken into account when TAC is measured in different diseases.

A vascular 'profile' was obtained for each patient and included measurement of plasma lipids, fundoscopic examination and common carotid artery triplex ultrasonography. All patients had brain MRI to assess for presence of white matter lesions. The two groups formed, with and without white matter lesions, were compared in order to define the association between white matter lesions and vascular disease. Patients without white matter lesions had more frequently corticosteroid induced osteonecrosis. There was no difference in the two groups with respect to intima media thickness and ApoB\/ApoA1 ratio.

In our study we aimed to evaluate retrospectively the indications, safety, efficacy and the spectrum of histopathological findings of percutaneous ultrasound-guided renal (PRB) biopsy during a 7 year period as well as to analyze specific groups of renal patients. A total of 84 renal biopsies were performed in 81 children. Demographic data, clinical symptoms at presentation, indications for renal biopsy, laboratory findings, complications of the procedure and histological diagnosis were obtained from all patients who underwent PRB. The commonest indication for biopsy accounted was steroid resistant, steroid dependent or frequent relapsing idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS). Subcapsular hematoma presented 11% of the patients, but none of them needed blood transfusion. Adequate renal tissue sample was obtained in 97.7% of the renal biopsies. In 80% the histopathology revealed glomerular diseases. The most frequent types of biopsy-proven renal diseases were: focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (15%), IgA nephropathy (13.5%), minimal change disease (10%), various stages of lupus nephritis (8.5%), Henoch-Schonlein nephritis (7.5%), membranous glomerulonephritis (7.5%), mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (6%), post-infectious glomerulonephritis (6%), hemolytic uremic syndrome (5%), tubulointerstitial nephropathies (3.5%), acute tubular necrosis 2.5%. Among the 28 cases of INS, FSGS accounted for 43%. The leading histopathological pattern found in patients with recurrent episodes of gross haematuria was IgAN (84.5%). Among 7 cases of lupus nephritis, the observed histological types were: IV+V in 3\/7, IIIA in 3\/7 (43%) and IIB in 1\/7.

Familial clustering of phenotypes such as end-stage renal disease, albuminuria and kidney disease have been reported in large scale population studies throughout the world demonstrating strong contribution of inherited factors. Recent genome-wide linkage scans identified several chromosomal regions that are likely to contain diabetic nephropathy susceptibility genes, and association analyses have evaluated positional candidate genes under linkage peaks. In this review we have extracted from the literature the most promising candidate genes thought to confer susceptibility to diabetic nephropathy and mapped them to affected pathways by using network-centric analysis.

Food sensitization frequently occurs early in life and is often the first sign of future atopic disease. Therefore, interventions to prevent food allergies and the development of the atopic phenotype are best made early in life. The results of studies regarding the effects of breast-feeding and the prevention of allergy remain inconclusive. Several factors in breast milk either induce or protect against food allergies. Probiotic and prebiotic supplemented whey hydrolysate formulas need further research in order to determine the future of this intervention in the prevention of food allergies. Several dietary manipulations in infancy, such as prolonged breast feeding, maternal avoidance diets during pregnancy and lactation, the use of hypoallergenic formulas, have been proposed as ways of altering the Th1\/Th2 balance in infants, with varying degrees of success. Studies have examined whether food atopy can be prevented by controlling the intake of highly allergenic foods by a high-risk infant from a variety of sources, that is, both direct ingestion and indirect ingestion through the breast milk. The previous studies showed that in high risk infants who are unable to be completely breast fed, there is evidence that prolonged feeding with a hydrolysed formula compared to a cow's milk formula reduces infant and childhood allergy and infant cow's milk allergy ,while other studies reported that an antigen avoidance diet for high risk mothers is unlikely to reduce the atopic diseases in their children substantially, and that such a diet may adversely affect maternal and\/or fetal nutrition.","651":"Treatment of cardiorespiratory system diseases is a procedure that usually demands data collection on terms of the anatomy and the operation of the organs that are under study. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is an alternative approach, in comparison to existing techniques. With EIT electrodes are placed in the perimeter of the human body and images of the estimated organ are reconstructed, using the measurement of its impendence (or resistance) distribution and determining its alteration through time, while at the same time the patient is not exposed to ionizing radiation. Its clinical use presupposes the correct placement of the electrodes over the perimeter of the human body, the rapid data collection and electrical safety. It is a low cost technique and it is implemented near the patient. It is able to determine the distribution of ventilation, blood supply, diffused or localized lung defects, but it can also estimate therapeutic interventions or alteration to assisted ventilation of the neonate. EIT was developed at the beginning of the 1980s, but it has only recently begun to be implemented on neonates, and especially in the study of their respiratory system function. The low rate of image analysis is considered to be a drawback, but it is offset by the potential offered for the estimation of lungs' function (both under normal and pathological conditions), since ventilation and resistance are two quite similar concepts. In this review the most important studies about EIT are mentioned as a method of estimating respiratory distress syndrome in neonates.

Cement extrusion is an extremely rare but potentially disabling complication that may occur despite care to remove all cement following implantation of the prosthesis. Removing a cement fragment, especially when this is firmly fixed to difficult-to-visualise and access parts of the prosthesis, is challenging. We believe the patient we report is the first one where a firmly fixed, sizeable cement extrusion was removed arthroscopically from the posterior aspect of the knee. This was achieved via an anterolateral portal with trans-notch view, combined with a posteromedial portal used both for viewing and instrument insertion.

Local resection (LR) for ampullary tumors has been performed for a century but remains controversial. The use of this procedure for benign conditions is clear, but its place, if any, in the management of ampullary carcinoma is debated. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcomes and analyse the prognostic factors of LR of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater by comparison with PD. A retrospective analysis of 71 patients of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater was conducted at Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from January 1995 to December 2005. We investigated the differences of the baseline characteristics and the intra- and postoperative data of patients who underwent PD and LR. Prognostic factors for recurrence and survival of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater between PD and LR was also analysed. Among the 71 patients of ampullary carcinoma who underwent surgical resection, a PD was performed in 46 (64.8%) patients while a LR was performed in 25 (35.2%) patients. The 30-day mortality rate associated with PD (6.5%) was not different from that with LR (0%; p=0.547) while the morbidity following PD (30.4%) and LR (8.0%) was statistically different (p=0.031). The complications were also significantly higher in the PD group than the LR group (34.8% vs 6.5%; p=0.013). In a univariate Cox regression analysis of survival, there were significant differences in tumor size (p=0.031), TNM (Tumor Node Metastasis) stage (p=0.000), pT (pathologic Tumor) stage (p=0.010), pN (pathologic Node) stage (p=0.000), differentiation (p=0.026), and surgical margin (p=0.031).

According to the method of Kaplan-Meier, the five-year survival rate in the PD group was 53.5% and that in the LR group was 48.0%, no significant differences were found between the two groups in overall survival rates (p=0.540). Compared with the PD, the 5-year survival of patients with the TNM stage-III\/IV who undergoing LR was statistically lower (11.1% vs 38.1%; p=0.040). As expected, the overall survival were signicant differences between the two groups in pT stage-T3\/T4 (47.4% vs 18.2%, p=0.018) and pN stage-N1 (36.8% vs 11.1%, p=0.004), respectively. Tumor recurrence was diagnosed in 10\/43 (23.3%) patients after PD and 12\/25 (48.0%) patients after LR (p=0.035). Logistic regression analysis of recurrence showed that TNM stage-III\/IV (p=0.004), pT stage-T3\/T4 (p=0.034), and pN stage-N1 (p=0.007) were associated with a 2.444, 1.943, and 2.111-fold increased risk of recurrence, respectively. PD is the preferred operation for carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. LR is less mortal and morbid than PD, which is a suitable treatment in patients with a low-risk cancer in stages I\/II or pT1\/T2 N0 with a maximum diameter of 2 cm or less. TNM stage, pT stage, and pN stage remained as independent predictors of survival rates.

Furthermore, these same financial challenges can easily translate into societal hardship. The biomedical and pharmaceutical industries of the U.S. and Europe have been in the midst of severe financial constraints over the last few years, which will worsen in the coming years. A critical factor is a financial crisis that appears to be spreading like wildfire through Europe, with 3 of its oldest members (Greece, Ireland, Portugal) already having enlisted the aid of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to avoid bankruptcy, and with the possibility of others to follow (Italy, Spain). Adding to this the increasing cost of introducing new medications and devices, and conducting clinical research, as well as the tightening regulatory pressures and the drying pharmaceutical pipelines, cost cutting pressures are mounting on pharmaceutical industries and the biomedical sector, whether in academia or in industry. This paper will attempt to highlight some of the problems that clinical research in Europe may be facing, as well as discuss some of the potential solutions. Although this will by no means be an exhaustive analysis, the goal is to show that times of financial hardship, such as the current one, may also provide the impetus for constructive change.

The classification system of choledochal cysts is based on the site of the cyst or dilatation and currently includes 5 major types. The purpose of our study is to describe the imaging findings of a new variant of choledochal cyst. Six patients (4 children and 2 adults, 4 females and 2 males, 3-67 year old) were evaluated by US, CT, CT-cholangiography, MRI, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), because of jaundice, abdominal pain and a palpable mass. A new type of choledochal cyst was demonstrated in all cases. In this new variant apart from the dilatation of the common hepatic and the common bile duct, dilatation of the central portion of the cystic duct was also observed, giving a bicornal configuration to the cyst. The imaging findings of a new variant of choledochal cyst with participation of the cystic duct are described. We propose the classification of this type of choledochal cyst as a new subtype of Todani I cyst, namely Todani ID.

In two of our cases, VMCs caused mild, non-specific abdominal symptoms, including diffuse abdominal pain and discomfort. In the other two cases, in a 60-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man, the clinical presentation was implicative of an infectious hepatic process reminiscent of cholangitis and liver abscesses respectively. In each case the diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography findings showing multiple hyper-intense cystic nodules not communicating with the biliary tree.

Rats in group 3 received gln (0.75 g\/kg) by intraperitoneal administration, before ischemia and before reperfusion. Blood samples and liver tissues were harvested from the rats, and then the rats were sacrificed. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were determined. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT), total oxidative status (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in hepatic tissue were measured. Also liver tissue histopathology was evaluated by light microscopy. The levels of liver enzymes in group 3 were significantly lower than those in the group 2. TAC in liver tissue was significantly higher in group 3 than in group 2. TOS, OSI and MPO in hepatic tissue were significantly lower in group 3 than the group 2.

Parvovirus B19 infects children and adults, often causing erythema infectiosum, polyarthritis, but also aplastic crisis in patients with chronic haemolytic anaemia, rash, fever and fetal hydrops or fetal death. This study aims at the detection of acute parvovirus B19 infections during 2006-2009 in northern Greece on epidemiological and clinical aspect.Material and methods. Specimens were obtained from 63 patients, who addressed to hospitals, suspected for acute parvovirus B19 infection (17 in 2006, 29 in 2007, 10 in 2008 and 7 in 2009). Thirty (47.6%) were children (one day - 15 years old) and 33 (52.4%) were adults (16-65 years old). The infection was shown by PCR in whole blood and\/or pleural fluid and supported by detection of specific IgM antibodies in the patients' blood serum, which was performed by ELISA.Results. Twenty (31.7%) out of the 63 specimens were found to be positive: 3\/17 (17.6 %) in 2006, 16\/29 (55.2 %) in 2007, none in 2008 and 1\/7 (14.3%) in 2009, p=0.0002. Positive children were found 10\/30 (33.3%) and positive adults 10\/33 (30.3%). Specific IgM antibodies were detected in all 20 positive patients. Children developed hematological disorders, mainly types of anemia (6 cases), hydrothorax\/ascites (2 cases), arthritis (1 case), and liver transplant rejection (1 case). Adults were presented with pregnancy complications (2 cases), arthralgia\/arthritis (4 cases), febrile syndromes (3 cases) and atypical rash (1 case).Conclusions. In conclusion, an annual variation in the circulation of parvovirus B19 was noticed, presenting an increase of acute infections in northern Greece during 2007. Regarding serious cases, although children and adults seemed equally affected, differences in clinical manifestations were observed between them, with hematological dysfunctions predominant in childhood.","691":"Several flaps can be dissected from the same or neighboring digits for the reconstruction of relatively large soft tissue digital defects. In a 6-year period, 106 large soft tissue digital defects were reconstructed with the use of flaps in 101 patients. For the reconstruction of 75 fingertip defects 73 neurovascular, island or advancement flaps (42 homodigital, 18 heterodigital, 13 advancement) and 2 thenar flaps were used. The 31 defects of the proximal and middle phalanges were reconstructed with 3 intermetacarpal and 28 cross-finger flaps (17 de-epithelialized and 11 classic for dorsal and palmar defects respectively). All flaps survived. Subjectively, the results were rated as good or excellent in 69 of 73 distal defects reconstructed with neurovascular island or advancement flaps and in 29 of 31 proximal defects treated with cross-finger and intermetacarpal flaps. The mean DASH score was 4.1 and 3.34 for the neurovascular island\/advancement flaps and the cross-finger flaps respectively.

The study included 225 Greek children hospitalized for RTIs during a 15-month period. Throat swab specimens were tested by PCR for the detection of M. pneumoniae, while IgG and IgM antibodies were determined by ELISA and, in certain cases, also by western-blot. In parallel, specimens were tested for the presence of additional respiratory pathogens. M. pneumoniae infection was diagnosed as the only pathogen in 25 (11.1%) cases, being the second (after respiratory syncytial virus- RSV) most often detected pathogen. The proportion of cases with M. pneumoniae infection in age group 8-14 years (23.3%) was significantly higher than that in &lt;3 years age group.

To remain independent and healthy, an important factor to consider is the maintenance of skeletal muscle, as the elderly seem to become prone to a progressive loss of skeletal muscle with aging, termed sarcopenia. Interventions should focus on resistance training and optimal nutrition. Low intensity occlusion training may provide a mode of resistance training more applicable to the elderly, due to the lower loads used. Furthermore, an emphasis must be placed on high quality protein adequately distributed throughout the day to maximize protein synthesis. The use of drug therapy may be of some benefit, but it appears exercise and diet likely plays a more prominent role in the preservation of muscle mass and strength than administration of synthetic hormones.","696":"Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is defined as the sudden death of an infant under one year of age which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene and review of the clinical history. SIDS is one of the leading causes of infant mortality and occurs from the first month, until the first year of life for newborns and infants.The aim of this review was to identify and examine risk factors responsible for causing the sudden infant death and to propose certain measures in order to protect newborns and infants from sudden death. The potential factors that contribute to the occurrence of SIDS include inadequate prenatal care, low birth weight (&lt;2499gr), premature infants, intrauterine growth delay, short interval between pregnancies and maternal substance use (tobacco, alcohol, opiates). Moreover, factors related to infant's sleep environment such as the prone or side sleeping position and thick coverlet increase the risk of sudden death in infants. Also, the combination of risk factors such as that of prone sleeping position and soft bed mattress are linked to a 20-fold increased risk of death. Finally, polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT), viral respiratory infections, long Q-T (responsible for the presence of fatal arrhythmia) are related to the SIDS.Literature review indicates that each individual risk factor contributes to the appearance of SIDS and the establishment of certain protective measures for parents and health professionals has reduced its prevalence. But the precise identification of the SIDS causes and how these contribute to the occurrence of sudden death in neonates and infants, remains a challenge for health professionals.","697":"Hemodialysis (HD) patients are particularly predisposed to infections. It seems that the HD procedure per se as well as disturbances in both innate and adaptive immunity significantly contribute to this susceptibility. Infections are the major cause of morbidity and the second cause of death following cardiovascular events in HD patients. Episodes of bacteremia and pneumonia account for the majority of severe infections in this population. In addition to these bacterial infections another common problem in HD units is the blood transmitted viral infections, particularly infections caused by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and Human immunodeficiency virus. A number of safety concerns exist for limiting the spread of these viral infections among HD patients and the staff of the unit. The aim of the present review is to present in a concise albeit practical form the difficult aspect of infections in HD. For practical reasons the review is separated in two parts. The previous first part covered bacteremia and respiratory infections, while the present second part covers blood transmitted viral infections.","698":"Thyroid fine needle biopsy (FNB) is the procedure of choice for the management of thyroid nodules. Serious complications after FNB are rare, but there is also an underestimation of complication risk because of record, selection and publication biases. Apart from the well-documented post-FNB complications, we hypothesized that there are potential complications following FNB, albeit supported by limited evidence in the literature. According to our hypothesis, there may be five distinct expected rare complications: 1) cyst fluid leakage; 2) anaphylactic reaction; 3) pneumothorax; 4) thromboembolism and 5) needle tract seeding of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or thyroid lymphoma. Cyst fluid leakage and pneumothorax may be of minimal clinical significance. Needle tract seeding of MTC or thyroid lymphoma may not have significant clinical consequences, if someone considers the easiness and effectiveness of surgical removal of needle tract seeding in cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma. On the contrary, anaphylactic reaction or thromboembolism may be life-threatening. The performers of thyroid FNB are hereby encouraged to publish these complications, if they ever occur, because awareness of them could render FNB even safer. ","699":"The introduction of erythropoietin (Epo) in clinical practice, more than two decades ago, altered completely the management of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The successful correction of anemia of CKD has resulted in reduction of associated morbidity and improvement of functionality, exercise tolerance, cognitive function and overall quality of life. Moreover, significant reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has occurred. Recently, large randomized clinical studies suggested that administration of Epo targeting at complete anemia correction is accompanied by significant increase of morbidity and mortality, compared to partial anemia correction. This observation has led to thorough investigation of the mechanisms of Epo actions and the possible contribution of other parameters including iron availability, comorbidities and resistance or hyporesponsiveness to Epo. In this context, it has been proposed that high doses of Epo are likely to exert toxic effects and pleiotropic systemic actions. Recognition of the extra-hematopoietic biologic actions of erythropoietin is a result of the better understanding of its interaction with Epo receptors in several tissues and organ systems, during fetal development as well as in the adult organism. More specifically, antiapoptotic, anti- inflammatory, angiogenetic and cytoprotective effects have been revealed in the kidneys, cardiovascular system, brain and retina. Until future studies are able to clarify the multiple beneficial or unfavorable effects of Epo, it is advisable to remain prudent in its administration, yet optimistic about its possible contribution in a number of pathologic conditions.","700":"Age-related macular degeneration is a major cause of blindness in Europe and the U.S. and a leading cause of significant loss of visual acuity in elderly patients.

AM rates in Greece between 1980 and 2007 were examined in order to investigate the extent to which health care has contributed to the decline in mortality rates in Greece over recent decades and detect possible shortcomings in the Greek healthcare system. Mortality data from the General Secretariat of the National Statistic Service were used. The list of avoidable conditions was the basis of the analysis in which avoidable deaths were classified into conditions amenable to medical care (treatable avoidable mortality) and conditions responsive to health policy (preventable avoidable mortality). Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) was examined separately following relevant studies. Age standardized mortality rates were calculated according to the European Community standard population. A steady decline of the percentage of AM over all-cause mortality was documented (1980-1984:27%; 2000- 2007:22.9%). AM rate fell by 30.5% (1980-1984:217.4\/100,000 population; 2000-2007: 151.1\/100,000). Treatable mortality rate fell by 48.1%, marking the largest contribution to the decline in AM (1980-1984:110.9\/100,000; 2000- 2007:57.5\/100,000). Ischaemic heart disease death rate fell by 13.1% (1980-1984:52.7\/100,000; 2000-2007:45.8\/100,000).

Trends in AM in Greece between 1980-2007 were similar to those of other European countries, with Greece performing particularly well with respect to treatable mortality. Although the decline in AM may also reflect changes in factors that influence mortality, such as disease occurrence, environment and socioeconomic conditions, they are suggestive of the health care system being an important determinant of health improvements in Greece during the recent decades.

First it is a primary regulator of calcium homeostasis. Beyond that, vitamin D and its receptors (VDR) play important role in the immune system, cardiovascular system, reproductive system and insulin resistance. An important aspect of vitamin D pleiotropic effects is the interaction with components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). It was demonstrated that vitamin D-null mice have a sustained elevation of renin expression. The combination of both the AT1 blockers and the vitamin D analogues, leads to a marked amelioration of the molecular and clinical markers of diabetic nephropathy. This combination may protect the kidney through the effects on both the glomerular and the tubulointerstitial compartments. There are different studies that corroborate the renoprotective action of vitamin D in CKD. In fact the renoprotective mechanisms in humans remain to be assessed, but these are realized through reduction of proteinuria, high blood pressure, inflammation as well as hemodynamic effects. An important mechanism is the role of vitamin D as a potent negative endocrine regulator of renin expression. It was shown that low levels of vitamin D represent a novel risk factor for the progression of renal disease but it is not demonstrated yet that vitamin D can prolong the time to end-stage renal disease. This question remains to be answered in other future controlled clinical trials. ","729":"Quality assessment of nutritional information on the internet may prove vital prior to providing public guidance on searching relative information. The most popular web sites on four different topics (\"Mediterranean diet\", \"sports nutrition\", \"nutrition, dysphagia and children\" and \"herbs and common cold\") were assessed with the use of two validated questionnaires (EQIP and DISCERN). Medical categories produced significantly lower total quality scores when compared to \"Mediterranean diet\" and \"sports nutrition\" categories. (F=7.189, P&lt;0.001). Commercial web pages had a significantly lower credibility score compared to institutional and other web page types (H=17.987, P&lt;0.001). Ranking order of each web page was related to its total quality score (P=0.04) but not to its credibility (P=0.241). Monitoring the accuracy, comprehensiveness and consistency of health-related information on the internet is an important public health issue since there are popular web pages that are regarded as of high quality but they do not always provide reliable information. Health professionals and especially dieticians should provide consumer training on how to search for and appraise nutritional information from the internet. ","730":"Vaccination against human papilloma virus (HPV) in childhood is a significant step forward in the reduction of HPV associated morbidity and mortality and a considerable scientific achievement. However, many challenges remain to be overcome if an effective HPV vaccine programme is to be successfully introduced worldwide. The aim of this review is to identify and summarize the new issues concerning HPV vaccination that have emerged since its introduction into clinical practice in school-aged girls. According to the literature, the overall impact of HPV vaccination on cervical cancer is unlikely to be apparent for the next decade. Cost-effectiveness is of particular importance, particularly in developing countries. Determining the age at which the vaccine should be administered, whether to include boys in addition to girls, the costs and the implications for cervical screening are issues that need to be addressed by conducting further research. ","731":"It is generally accepted that the destination of the immune system is not only to discriminate between self and non-self but also to mount responses against non-self. During the last decades, it became evident that weak self-reactivity is a necessary condition for immune homeostasis. Natural self reactivity and the internal image created by autoantibodies, participate greatly to the maintenance of homeostasis. Under conditions of increased or altered antigenic pressure, the homeostatic status is disrupted and the organism becomes vulnerable to the emergence of diseases. \"Immunculus\" is the self-reactive and interconnected entity of the immune system, provided by a complicated network of natural autoantibobies of different specificity, as a mosaic picture. Quantitative changes in each part of the image are related to variations of expression of relative antigens. The immune system takes in account image information from the continuous screening of the antigenic status and compares between presented state and the desired (optimal) one. Substantial and prolonged deviations from the optimal state, triggers the induction of compensatory and reparative processes, aiming to restore molecular and functional homeostasis. So, natural autoimmunity through the ability of natural a-Abs to induce mechanisms of natural and acquired immunity, aims to prevent pathogenic processes and maintain or restore health status. ","732":"","733":"Albeit the considerable progress that has been made both in our understanding of the pathophysiology of acute renal failure (ARF) and in its treatment (continuous renal replacement therapies), the morbidity of this complex syndrome remains unacceptably high. The current review focuses on recent developments concerning the definition of ARF, new strategies for the prevention and pharmacological treatment of specific causes of ARF, dialysis treatment in the intensive care setting and provides an update on critical care issues relevant to the clinical nephrologist.","734":"The knowledge about the exact mechanisms involved in phosphorus homeostasis and the evolution of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease (CKD) has improved during the last years. The discovery of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23) has revolutionized our understanding about the links between mineral metabolism, vitamin D and parathyroid hormone (PTH). FGF23 serum levels increase early in CKD before the increase of serum phosphorus or the decrease of vitamin D and there is parathyroid resistance to FGF23 in advanced CKD. Increased levels of serum phosphorus have been related in epidemiological studies with adverse outcomes in patients with CKD, diabetes, coronary artery disease, or even normal adults. In patients with CKD stage 3 or 4, low phosphorus diets have been related with adverse outcomes due to the risk of malnutrition and there are limited data regarding the role of phosphate binders in these patients. Recent studies suggest that increased serum FGF23 levels are associated with mortality, left ventricular hypertrophy and progression of CKD independently of serum phosphorus levels. There is an ongoing debate about the \"normal\" or \"desirable\" levels of serum phosphorus in CKD and a new role of FGF23 as a marker of the disturbances of mineral metabolism in CKD is emerging.","735":"Hypertension and chronic kidney disease constitute major health problems as they are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Large-scale clinical trials, have emphasized the need of a strict blood pressure and early recognition of kidney disease to reduce the complications. However, the rate of hypertension control seems to be low, the prevalence of hypertension and chronic kidney disease steadily increases, indicating a gap in the management of those patients. This is due either to a poor organization of the health care system or a defective patient-physician communication. This review will try to identify possible errors in the management of hypertensive and renal failure patients in outpatient clinics and to propose ways to improve prevention and control of hypertension and chronic kidney diseases in our population.","736":"Anemia is a common finding in patients with CKD, with a prevalence that increases gradually as eGFR declines. The prevalence of renal anemia depends on the size of the study and the selection of participants. Diabetic status increases the prevalence of anemia in patients with CKD. Anemia in CKD is due primarily to reduced production of erythropoietin in the kidney and secondarily to shortened red cell survival. Erythropoeitin (EPO) is produced by peritubular cells in the kidneys of the adult and in hepatocytes in the fetus. These cells are sensitive to hypoxia that once sensed leads to an increase in EPO production. EPO circulates in the plasma and induces redcell production in the bone marrow after successful binding to erythroid progenitor cells. Apart from EPO, folate, B(12) and iron are needed to assure effective erythropoiesis. Factors that can dysregulate this process include inflammation, uremic toxins, hypothyroidism, hypersplenism and ongoing infection.The investigation of renal anemia requires the assessment of a variety of biological indices. Among them, the complete blood count, the reticulocyte index, B(12), folate, ferritin levels and the saturation of transferrin are the most valuable tools in revealing the cause of renal anemia.","737":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is a common disorder in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is characterized by excessive serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, parathyroid hyperplasia and an imbalance in calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism develops early in the course of CKD and becomes more prominent as kidney function declines.PTH is a major uremic toxin and may be responsible for long-term consequences that include renal osteodystrophy, severe vascular calcifications, alterations in cardiovascular structure and function, immune dysfunction, and anemia. These adverse effects may contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among end-stage renal failure patients.","738":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health problem associated with considerable morbidity and mortality and despite advances in the treatment of end stage renal disease (ESRD) mechanisms to prevent and delay its progression are still being sought. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a pivotal role in many of the pathophysiologic changes that lead to progression of renal disease. Traditionally RAAS was considered as an endocrine system and its principal role was to maintain blood pressure (BP). In recent years local RAAS has been described to operate independently from systemic and local angiotensin II (AngII) in the kidney to contribute in hypertension and kidney damage. The benefits of strict BP control in slowing kidney disease progression have been demonstrated in several clinical trials and the question whether specific agents like angiotensin converting enzyme antagonists (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) provide renoprotective benefits beyond BP lowering is to be answered. Several studies support these agents reduce proteinuria and protect renal function, whereas the opposite is stated by others. According to guidelines, their use is recommended as first line agents in diabetic renal disease and non diabetic renal disease with albuminuria, whereas there is no data to support the same in non diabetic nonalbuminuric renal disease. Dual blockage of RAAS with the combination of ACEIs and ARBs could offer an alternative in strict RAAS blockade, but studies up to now can not prove its safety and the combination is not recommended until ongoing trials will provide new and unarguable results.","739":"In chronic kidney disease patients, bone and mineral abnormalities have a major impact on morbidity and mortality. Hyperphosphatemia has been associated with increased mortality and with the development of cardiovascular calcification, an independent predictor of mortality. Sevelamer, or more precisely 'sevelamer hydrochloride', is a weakly basic anion-exchange resin in the chloride form that was introduced in 1997 for the treatment of the hyperphosphataemia of patients with end-stage renal failure. Sevelamer sequesters phosphate within the gastrointestinal tract, so prevents its absorption and enhances its faecal excretion. Over the succeeding years, large numbers of patients have been treated with sevelamer, and it has fulfilled expectations in helping to control the hyperphosphataemia of end-stage renal failure. Additionally treatment with sevelamer was accompanied with lower incidence of hypercalcemia, decreased incidence of low PTH levels, a 15-31% decrease of LDL-cholesterol both in dialysis and predialysis patients, decreased C-reactive protein, amelioration of hyperuricemia and low fetuin A, decrease of uremic toxins, suggesting an overall anti-inflammatory effect. In incident dialysis patients, treatment with sevelamer has been associated with better survival, while in prevalent patients a clear benefit could only be demonstrated in older patients and in patients treated for more than 2 years. In dialysis patients, the treatment of hyperphospathemia with calcium based compounds, when compared with sevelamer, is associated with more frequent episodes of hypercalcemia, suppression of intact PTH and with progression of coronary calcifications. In the presence of adynamic bone disease, calcium load has a significantly higher impact on aortic calcifications and stiffening. Sevelamer treatment resulted in no statistically significant changes in bone turnover or mineralization compared with calcium carbonate, but bone formation rate increased and trabecular architecture improved only with sevelamer. In conclusion, the treatment of hyperphosphatemia with sevelamer hydrochloride, a noncalcium and non-metal containing phosphate binder, is associated with a beneficial effect on vascular calcification progression, bone disease and most likely with a survival benefit in some hemodialysis patients populations. Sevelamer carbonate is an improved, buffered form of sevelamer hydrochloride developed for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in CKD patients. Sevelamer carbonate formulated as a powder for oral suspension presents a novel, patient- friendly alternative to tablet phosphate binders. Safety and efficacy of sevelamer carbonate powder compared with sevelamer hydrochloride tablets in CKD patients are equivalent, with Sevelamer carbonate having fewer side effects from gastrointestinal tract.","740":"The worldwide incidence of kidney failure is on the rise and treatment is costly. Kidney failure patients require either a kidney transplant or dialysis to maintain life. This review focuses on the economics of alternative dialysis modalities such as haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Important economic factors influencing dialysis modality selection include financing, reimbursement and resource availability. Modality selection is also influenced by employment status, with an association between being employed and PD as the modality choice.In the United States, there were 101,688 incident HD patients and 6,506 incident PD patients in 2007. Due to the fact that the worldwide incidence of kidney failure continues to rise placing USA in the second position right after Taiwan, the accumulated experience from USA could be used as a characteristic prototype for the analysis of the economics related with modality choices and their influence in the quality of life and life expectancy of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients.In the present work we discuss the effect of the expenditure increase in the morbidity and the mortality of patients with end stage renal disease. Data coming from the USA case concerning the economic factors which play a vital role in the sequence of events that leads to the choice between different modalities such as HD and PD, will be used as a distinctive example in our study. The relationship between the modality used and employment status is investigated. The cost effectiveness of alternative modalities is reviewed. Examples of statistical models and simulation approaches, studying the increase of the life expectancy in terms of the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost paid are also presented. Corresponding results originated from different regions of the world are also briefly shown.","741":"Peritoneal dialysis is the most important home dialysis treatment for end stage renal diseases and needs personal involvement, and support from the family . Peritoneal dialysis presented a number of discouraging technical problems and led to the belief that PD was not an appropriate renal replacement therapy, for patients with end stage renal disease. Despite the improvement of the method its rate remain low (11%) worldwide. The factors affecting the choice of PD are multiple and explain the disparity in the use of peritoneal dialysis in different countries and different parts of the same country. Dialysis costs and reimbursement structures are significant in decisions about the rates and modalities of renal replacement therapy. Late referral and the health care system seems to be very important factors that influence the dialysis modality choice. After the initiation of peritoneal dialysis we can see other factors that influence the survival of the method. The rate of peritonitis and the peritoneum function seems to be important issues.","742":"Women with renal disease who conceive and continue pregnancy, are at significant risk for adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Although advances in antenatal and neonatal care continue to improve these outcomes, the risks remain proportionate to the degree of underlying renal dysfunction.The aim of this article, is to examine the impact of varying degrees of renal insufficiency on pregnancy outcome, in women with chronic renal disease and to provide if possible, useful conclusions whether and when, a woman with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), should decide to get pregnant.This article, reviews briefly the normal physiological changes of renal function during pregnancy, and make an attempt to clarify the nature and severity of the risks, in the settings of chronic renal insufficiency and end stage renal disease, including dialysis patients and transplant recipients.","743":"The possible deleterious effect of meet consumption upon deterioration of renal disease was speculated from Lionel Beale as early as 1869. The first attempt to apply a very low protein diet in humans is attributed to Millard Smith who prescribed a diet consisting of 300 mg protein per day in a volunteer medical student for 24 days. Unfortunately, in early 20(th) century, prescribing very low protein diets among patients suffering from renal disease complicated with malnutrition and the medical practice of this era turned to the recommendation of high protein diets because it was believed that protein consumption is coupled with the strength of civilized man. In mid sixties Giordano and Giovanetti introduced low protein diets in the treatment of uremic patients but their efforts did not accepted from the medical community. Meanwhile the evolution of haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and transplantation as effective methods of treating end stage renal disease guided doctors and patients far from privative diets in the era of plenty. The rapidly increasing number of end stage renal disease patients needed substitution of renal function produced a tremendous increase of financial burden upon public health system expenditure and alternative measures of therapy, prevention and delaying chronic kidney disease searched. Unfortunately MDRD study failed to show convincing results of food protein restriction and blood pressure lowering in ameliorating deterioration of renal function and the majority of physicians turned to the practice of early dialysis in an attempt to avoid malnutrition. Despite the increasing knowledge and the appliance of certain guidelines in treating end stage renal disease patients, the morbidity and mortality remain high among this population. The search toward other possible toxic substances showed that phosphorus consumption with diet is another dangerous element exerting its deleterious effect in deteriorating renal function as well as increasing morbidity and mortality. Recently published epidemiological data suggest a very poor outcome of elderly patients, older than 80 years of age, undergoing substitution of renal function by dialysis or peritoneal dialysis and a lot of skepticism arise concerning the beneficial effect of diet and a rigorous effort of rehabilitation of these patients instead of substitution of renal function by either method.","744":"5-fluorouracil is an anti-cancer drug commonly used in oncology practice. Typical side effects are myelosupression, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomatitis. Cardiotoxicity is the other toxicity. Cardiac side effects are ST segment changes, rhythm abnormalities, supraventricular and ventricular dysrhytmias. Pulseless ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation releated with bolus fluorouracil were not detected in the literature. Here we discussed a 46 year-old male patient that has no known cardiac history. After bolus fluorouracil administration, syncope and pulseless ventricular tachycardia developed in this patient. There are a few explanations about the cardiotoxicity of fluorouracil. One of these is the effect on nitric oxide. It causes a reduction in the levels of endothelial NO and this leads coronary vasospasm. Another explanation is protein kinase C mediated vasospasm. In animal studies toxic myocarditis like lesions were detected with fluorouracil infusions. Finally both myocardit and vasospasm may lead cardiac problems like sudden cardiac deaths. Bolus 5-fluorouracil is as cardiotoxic as 5-fluorouracil infusion and we must be careful about the arrhytmia after the bolus administration.","745":"We report a case of a seven-year-old girl who suffered from atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) complicated by septicaemia, central nervous system involvement, and cholangiitis. She remained anuric requiring treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) for a five-month period. In addition to conventional therapeutic measures including fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and blood cells transfusions she also underwent to plasma exchange (PE) treatment. Following a stormy hospitalization period of 17 weeks, the patient finally regained renal function and three years later she remains well on antihypertensive treatment and free of dialysis.","746":"We present a case of an aggressive osteoblastoma involving the posterior acetabular column and the ischium, which is very rare location for the tumor.

A plain radiograph, a CT and MRI examinations were performed. The tumor was radically excised and histologically it proved to be an aggressive osteoblastoma. Although aggressive osteoblastoma is a rare entity it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone tumors. Our purpose is to reveal the radiographic presentation of this rare tumor. ","747":"Breast lymphoma is a rare condition, both as a primary and a metastatic manifestation. The primary form has an incidence ranging from 0.04% to 0.5% of all breast neoplasms, whereas the metastatic form has an incidence of 0.07%. We hereby report a clinical case of a patient who presented with cutaneous non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the left scapulohumeral region treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy (40 Gy total). Three years following radiotherapy, the patient was diagnosed with a left breast infiltrating ductal carcinoma, treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant therapy. The following year, i.e. four years after the initial diagnosis of NHL, two lymphoproliferative relapses occurred: in the left cutaneous scapulohumeral region at the original site of disease, and in the right breast. The aim of this paper is to highlight an uncommon oncologic disorder such as breast lymphoma, highlighting its clinical and radiological manifestations. Some studies reported a possible aetiological role of radiotherapy in the development of breast cancer following treatment of NHL, and in the development of breast cancer following treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, which could potentially explain our findings.","748":"Infantile haemangiomas are common benign tumours that do not require treatment unless they cause significant functional impairment or disfigurement.

Aim of the present study was to investigate the role of patient's age and tumor size in the recurrence rate of patients. Additional aim of the current study was to investigate the possible associations between the size of the tumor and other characteristics. In 1st Department of Otorhinolaryngology of AHEPA University Hospital, from 1992 to 2007, 255 patients with laryngeal carcinoma underwent total laryngectomy. Accurate data regarding the size of the tumor were obtained. Total laryngectomy was the initial treatment in 212 patients, while in the remaining 43 patients was performed as salvage surgery after recurrence. The median tumor size was 2.74 cm (0.8-5.5 cm). There was no significant difference in the median tumor size between the patients who had recurrence (2.87 cm) and the disease free patients (2.69 cm). The median size of glottic tumors (2.47 cm) was smaller than that of supraglottic (2.95 cm) and of subglottic tumors (3.27 cm) (p&lt;0.05). Among the 255 patients, recurrence of the tumor occurred in 73 (28.7%). Statistical analysis of the data showed that the tumor size was affecting the recurrence rate in a different manner, according the stage of the tumor. The recurrence rate in T3 neoplasms was higher in larger tumors than in smaller (13.2% for tumors&lt;2cm, 62% for tumors&gt;4cm), while T4 carcinomas appeared to have the opposite behavior (66.5% for tumors &lt;2cm, 23% for tumors &gt;4cm). The median tumor size in T4 patients that recurred was smaller than in those with no recurrence (2.8 cm Vs 3.3 cm). This behavior was observed in T4 tumors from all sites. Patients who experienced recurrence and had positive neck lymph nodes at the time of the initial diagnosis appeared to have smaller laryngeal tumors (2.7 cm), compared to with the same group of patients with no recurrence (3.5 cm). Supraglottic location and advanced T stage showed a statistically significant impact on disease free survival, based on Cox regression model. Smaller sized tumors in patients with locally advanced laryngeal cancer (T4) or regionally (N+) appear to have more aggressive behavior and higher recurrence rate. Thus, the small tumor size could be regarded as an unfavorable prognostic factor for those laryngeal cancer cases. ","750":"Renal and hepatic dysfunction or injury might be involved by ether based anesthetic and intravenous anesthetic drug or surgical stress. The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of moderate duration low-flow sevoflurane versus total intravenous anesthesia on renal and hepatic functions. Eighty (80) patients between the ages of 25-70 scheduled for elective lumbar disc herniotomy, with an expected operation time of 120-240 min, were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced using remifentanil, propofol and atracurium. Patients were randomly divided into two groups. After intubation, Group S (n=40) received sevoflurane and Group T (n=40) received total intravenous anesthesia with propofol in oxygen and air with a fresh gas flow of 5 L min(?1). Ten minutes after induction the fresh gas flow was decreased to 1L min(?1) in both groups. Serum BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, LDH and 24 hours excretion of glucose, protein, and creatinine in urine were measured preoperatively and the first three postoperative days. Serum BUN at 48 hours, creatinine at 24, 48. hours, and urine glucose at 24, and 48 hours were significantly higher from the preoperative values in Group S (p&lt;0.05). However, serum BUN and creatinin, urine glucose were within the normal range. There were no significant differences in the renal and hepatic function tests between the groups.

The purpose of this study was to examine the alterations of bone mineral metabolism in two groups of children (n=42) according to immunophenotyping (B-cell type, T-cell type) both quantitative (bone mineral density z-scores) and qualitative (serum osteocalcin - OC and carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of human type I collagen - ICTP) during diagnosis (T=0), after the intensified chemotherapy period (T=0.5) and the consolidation period (T=1). According to our results 15 patients had osteopenia and 1 child developed osteoporosis at T=0.5 and 13 patients had osteopenia at T=1. Mean BMD z-score was significantly decreased in both groups during chemotherapy and especially statistically significant decline of T-cell type ALL group compared with B-cell type ALL patients. OC mean level remains in low levels for both groups reaching in plateau during chemotherapy and ICTP level was increased in T-cell type ALL group of patients compared with B-cell type in both periods of chemotherapy.

","759":"Abnormal mass transfer of blood components to the arterial walls initiates atherosclerosis. Understating the role of mass transfer within the arterial walls requires quantitative analysis. The oscillating lipid accumulation in the aortic wall is examined in the normal human aortic arch with shear dependent endothelium properties. A semi-permeable nature of the arterial wall computational model, applied in the normal human aortic arch under unsteady normal flow and mass conditions, is incorporated with hydraulic conductivity and permeability treated as wall shear stress dependent. The coupling of fluid dynamics and solute dynamics at the endothelium was achieved by the Kedem-Katchalsky equation. A typical aortic arch blood flow waveform at resting conditions and lasting 800 msec is applied. With constant values of water infiltration and endothelial permeability the surface vertex average normalized luminal concentration is 4.25 % higher than that at the entrance. With shear dependent values the surface vertex average normalized luminal concentration is 7.3 % higher than at the entrance. The luminal surface concentration at the arterial wall is flow-dependent with local variations due to geometric features. Concave sides of the aortic arch exhibit, relatively to the convex ones, elevated low density lipoprotein at all time steps. The degree of elevation in luminal surface LDL concentration is mostly affected from the water infiltration velocity at the vessel wall. Shear dependent endothelial values must be taken into account whenever fluid and mass flow within the arterial system is incorporated.

It seems that the HD procedure per se as well as disturbances in both innate and adaptive immunity significantly contribute to this susceptibility. Infections are the major cause of morbidity and the second cause of death following cardiovascular events in HD patients. Episodes of bacteremia and pneumonia account for the majority of severe infections in this population. In addition to these bacterial infections another common problem in HD units is the blood transmitted viral infections, particularly infections caused by hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus and Human immunodeficiency virus. A number of safety concerns exist for limiting the spread of these viral infections among HD patients and the staff of the unit. The aim of the present review is to present in a concise albeit practical form the difficult aspect of infections in HD. For practical reasons the review is separated in two parts.

For this concise review, a Medline search of the English language literature between the years 2000 and 2009 was conducted and 33 pertinent publications were selected. Based on the evidence contained in these publications, it is possible that early intervention and treatment of the various cardiovascular risk factors, which initiate and perpetuate the CVDC, could prevent it or arrest its further progress.

Moreover, from the reviewers and the editor's perspective, it is now possible to ensure the (text-content) originality of a scientific article with automated software tools for plagiarism detection. In this paper, we provide a step-bystep demonstration of two categories of tools, namely, statistical analysis and plagiarism detection. The aim is not to come up with a specific tool recommendation, but rather to provide useful guidelines on the proper use and efficiency of either category of tools. In the context of this special issue, this paper offers a useful tutorial to specific problems concerned with scientific writing and review discourse.

Outcomes from a meta-analysis may include a more precise estimate of the effect of treatment or risk factor for disease, or other outcomes, than any individual study contributing to the pooled analysis. The examination of variability or heterogeneity in study results is also a critical outcome. The benefits of meta-analysis include a consolidated and quantitative review of a large, and often complex, sometimes apparently conflicting, body of literature. The specification of the outcome and hypotheses that are tested is critical to the conduct of meta-analyses, as is a sensitive literature search. A failure to identify the majority of existing studies can lead to erroneous conclusions; however, there are methods of examining data to identify the potential for studies to be missing; for example, by the use of funnel plots. Rigorously conducted meta-analyses are useful tools in evidence-based medicine. The need to integrate findings from many studies ensures that meta-analytic research is desirable and the large body of research now generated makes the conduct of this research feasible.","765":"","766":"The purpose of the Materials and Methods section of a scientific manuscript is to provide information in sufficient detail, so that another scientist working in the same field of endeavor is able to repeat the experiments and reproduce the results. Authors are entitled to a justified decision on the publication or not of their work. Thus, reviewers need to assure the authors that they have studied, correctly interpreted and fairly judged their work. This can be done by writing a short introductory paragraph in their critique, mentioning the type of study, the subjects recruited, the time and places the study was conducted, the interventions, the outcome measures and the statistical tests. All these information should be found in the methods section. If the reviewer cannot find these information, he needs not to read the whole article. Reading through the abstract and the methods section, he can reject the article on good grounds. If the methods section is appropriate, then the whole article need to be further reviewed. In this manuscript we shall discuss several critical aspects of the methods and statistics from the reviewer's perspective to provide reviewers the knowledge basis to write the aforementioned introductory paragraph of their critique.","767":"The appraisal of scientific quality is a particularly difficult problem. Editorial boards resort to secondary criteria including crude publication counts, journal prestige, the reputation of authors and institutions, and estimated importance and relevance of the research field, making peer review a controversial rather than a rigorous process. On this background different methods for evaluating research may become required, including citation rates and journal impact factors (IF), which are thought to be more quantitative and objective indicators, directly related to published science. The aim of this review is to go into the two pillars of contemporary medical publishing, that is the peer review process and the IF. Qualified experts' reviewing the publications appears to be the only way for the evaluation of medical publication quality. To improve and standardise the principles, procedures and criteria used in peer review evaluation is of great importance. Standardizing and improving training techniques for peer reviewers, would allow for the magnification of a journal's impact factor. This may be a very important reason that impact factor and peer review need to be analyzed simultaneously. Improving a journal's IF would be difficult without improving peer-review efficiency. Peer-reviewers need to understand the fundamental principles of contemporary medical publishing, that is peer-review and impact factors. The current supplement of the Hippokratia for supporting its seminar for reviewers will help to fulfil some of these scopes.","768":"","769":"","770":null,"771":"Tuberculosis of the testis is a rare disease. Although Ultrasound (US) findings of tuberculous epididymo-orchitis have been well described, there are only few reported cases describing the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MR) findings of this disease. Herein, we describe the US and MR findings in a patient with tuberculous orchitis of the left testis and correlate them with the histopathological findings. In our case, the MR findings differ from previous studies because granulomatous areas in the testis had intermediate to high signal intensity on T2WI, while in all studies granulomatous areas in tuberculous epididymo-orchitis demonstrated invariably low signal intensity.","772":"A lumbar epidural catheter inserted in a 29-year-old woman for labor analgesia. The catheter failed to provide adequate analgesia. Moreover, after labor, it proved difficult to be removed. After computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance impedance (MRI) examination the course of the catheter was visible, the entrapped catheter was dislodged intact, revealing a kinking near its distal tip. Kinking of an epidural catheter leading to entrapment is an unusual complication of epidural catheterization.","773":"Oesophageal cancer with liver metastasis is rare and when diagnosed is usually advanced and surgical management is contraindicated.Method-Results: We report the case of a patient who presented with oesophageal cancer and liver metastasis. The patient received chemotherapy combined with RFA to liver tumour. Subsequently she was subjected to oesophagectomy and liver resection of segment 5 extended into segment 8. Patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy post-operatively and remains disease-free until now, 29 months after operation. Oesophageal cancer with concomitant liver metastasis is a rare and lethal disease. Multimodal management including surgery may offer prolonged survival in highly selected patients.

Haemorrhage in various sites may occur spontaneously or secondary to trauma depending on the severity of the deficiency. Common manifestations include haemarthrosis, epistaxis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and haematuria. Spontaneous haemothorax has rarely been reported both in children and adults1,2. We report the case of a haemophiliac child presenting with spontaneous haemothorax due to the rarity of this clinical presentation in order to raise the awareness among clinicians.","775":"Atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor of the spine is a rare pediatric neoplasm with poor prognosis. We report a case of an atypical teratoid\/rhabdoid tumor of the cervical spine in a 2-months-old infant. The patient presented with rapidly progressing tetraparesis and respiratory failure. Magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal cord revealed an intradural, extramedullary mass occupying the spinal canal on the right at the level of C1-C5. Tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, cytokeratins, S-100 protein, and CD57\/Leu-7 antigen. Despite chemotherapy, the infant presented with progressive neurological deterioration and died 6 months after initial diagnosis. We review the literature on spinal malignant rhabdoid tumor and discuss the pathology, treatment, and outcome of these rare neoplasms.","776":"Pyeloureteritis cystica is a rare situation of the renal pelvis and ureters, characterized by cystical formations of the epithelium.

Though rhabdomyolysis could be life-threatening, it is a rare complication of hypothyroidism, especially when other precipitating factors, such as exercise, alcohol, medications or renal failure, are absent. Nevertheless, hypothyroidism can be an authentic cause of rhabdomyolysis and should always be considered when elevated creatine kinase (CK) and other muscle enzymes concentrations cannot be attributed to any major factor.","778":"There are several reports concerning exercise and rabdomyolysis. There has been no report in the English literature of exercise induced rabdomyolisis from a stationary bike.A 63-year-old female recreational athlete presented to our hospital seeking treatment for lower back, leg pain and stiffness after exercising on a stationary bicycle one day prior. Blood work showed a raised CK of 38,120 U\/L, a myoglobin of 5330 and an AST 495 U\/L with normal urea and electrolytes. Urinalysis remained negative. She was admitted for oral and intravenous hydration and fluid balance monitoringThis is a very rare case of rhabdomyolysis due to exercise. This study highlights the difficulties faced by accident and emergency teams in distinguishing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) from exercise-induced rhabdomyolysis, and reinforces the concept that rhabdomyolysis can occur at any level of exercise intensity.","779":"We report on a patient who developed capsular block syndrome (CBS) in the early postoperative period with marked myopic shift in absence of anterior dislocation of the posterior-chamber intraocular lens (PC\/IOL) and iris diaphragm. Treatment with focal 6-o'-clock Nd: YAG-capsulotomy resulted in complete visual acuity restoration. To the best of our knowledge this is the fist case of early onset CBS with significant myopic shift in absence of anterior PC\/IOL dislocation, which was successfully treated with focal 6-o'-clock Nd: YAG-capsulotomy. The possible underlying pathophysiological mechanism is discussed.","780":"Capsule endoscopy is an effective method of examining the small bowel in patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, suspected inflammatory mucosal diseases and neoplasms. We herein evaluate the diagnostic yield of capsule endoscopy and its effect on clinical management in daily clinical practice. One hundred and one capsule endoscopies performed at the Department of Endoscopy and Motility Unit of G. Gennimatas General Hospital of Thessaloniki from May 2007 to February 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical management following capsule endoscopy findings was evaluated. The most frequent indication was obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (n=56, overt=20). The overall diagnostic yield was 47.5%. The diagnostic yield was 88.9% in patients with overt bleeding who underwent early capsule endoscopy (within 5 days), versus 36.4% in patients who underwent late capsule endoscopy (p=0.028). Moreover, it reached 81.8% in patients with abdominal pain, with\/without diarrhea and abnormal biological markers, versus 8.3% in patients with normal biological markers (p&lt;0.0001). Capsule endoscopy was diagnostic in all patients with symptomatic celiac disease. Adenomas were found in 9 of 14 familial adenomatous polyposis patients. Capsule retention (&gt;72 hours) occurred in two patients. Forty-three of 48 (89.6%) patients with positive capsule endoscopy findings that received intervention or medical treatment had positive clinical outcomes. Capsule endoscopy has an important diagnostic role and contribution in the clinical management during routine clinical practice; however, it remains to be determined which patients are more likely to benefit from this expensive examination. ","781":"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of Kirschner wire fixation after closed reduction of radial metaphyseal fractures with high risk of redisplacement. In this retrospective study 40 cases were studied in two groups. In group 1 (n=20, average age 11.2 years), K-wire fixation was performed after closed reduction. In group 2 (n=20 average age 10.1 years), only plaster immobilization was applied following closed reduction. The compared clinical and radiological parameters were, pain, limb deformitiy, range of motion of the wrist, angulation of the fracture site, radial distal epipihyseal angle and severity of translation. Redisplacement rate was 10% in group 1 and 50% in group 2. This shows, Kirschner wire fixation has a positive effect in the maintanence of the initial reduction (p&lt;0.05). Age, gender, reduction quality had no effect on redisplacement (p&gt;0.05). Concerning the severity of translation, the risk of redisplacement increases in stage 3 (50%- 100%) and stage 4 (&gt;100%) fractures (p&lt;0,05). Concomitant complete ulnar fracture has also redisplacement risk (p&lt;0.05). Redisplacement risk increases when the distance of fracture line to epiphyseal line was between 11-20 mm (p&lt;0.05). There was no significiant difference between two groups after last evaluation based on radiological parameters and clinical results (p&gt;0.05). This study shows that Kirschner wire fixation prevents redisplacement in early follow-up of first three weeks but there is no superiority after 20 months follow-up in distal metaphyseal fractures of children.

The objective of this study is to describe the endoscopic and histopathological findings in children with upper gastrointestinal (UGI) bleeding of non variceal origin. We performed a retrospective study of the medical records of 181 children, aged 1 month to 15.2 years, with non variceal UGI bleeding, who were admitted in our department over the period 1988-2008 and underwent upper GI endoscopy accompanied by histology. Patients were divided in 4 groups according to their age (=0-1 years, = 1-6 years, C=6-12 years, D= 12-16 years). An endoscopically evident bleeding source was detected in only 5% of all patients. Histological examination revealed increased incidence of eosinophilic infiltration in infants, in contrast to all other age groups, where non-specific or H. pylori related inflammation predominated. Peptic ulcer was found in 4.4% of all patients. Although an evident bleeding source was detected in only a small percentage of patients, the accompanying histological examination provided additional information regarding possible underlying diseases and contributed to the subsequent therapeutic management. ","783":"Anemia in school-age children is an important public health problem and available data of its prevalence and existing risk factors are essential for planning preventive strategies. The purpose of the current study was to assess the prevalence of and the risk factors associated with anemia among the school-age children 7-14 years years old in Serbia. In the 2000 National Health Survey, a cross-sectional, multistage cluster survey, performed in 1688 private and refugee campuses households across the territory of Serbia a total of 525 cases were recruited. Socioeconomic, nutritional, physical activities and lifestyle data have been collected and hemoglobin levels were determined. The overall prevalence of anemia was 18% (94\/525) [95% CI 15-21]. Age of 12-14 yrs (odds ratio 3.56 [95% CI 2.17-5.85], p=0.000), male gender (3.22 [1.92-5.42], p=0.000), refugee campuses residence (1.98 [1.22- 3.23], p=0.000), lunch skipping (3.43 [1.40-8.33], p=0.007), defective poultry intake (1.65 [1.01-2.62], p=0.047), lack of fish consumption (1.84 [1.07-3.18], p=0.028), disagreement that sport contributes protecting health (3.80 [2.02-6.95], p=0.000), absence of learning (1.80 [1.12-2.90], p=0.016) and defective book reading in free time (2.18 [1.03-4.61], p=0.04), were independent risk factors of anemia. The frequency of anemia was highest in schoolaged of male gender adolescent males 12-14 years old (46\/105, 44%); in 12-14 years aged participants living in refugee campuses' households (22\/63, 35%); in refugees of 7-14 yrs old male gender (32\/101, 32%); in subjects with defective fish and poultry intake (35\/118, 30%) and in participants who escaped reading and learning as lifestyle practices in free time (53\/204, 26%). Socioeconomic, nutritional, physical and lifestyle risk factors could be considered by introducing preventive strategies of anemia in school-age children in Serbia.

This article was written to highlight any new knowledge related to cerebral visual impairment in childhood.The international literature was searched to describe the type of visual, oculomotor and \/ or visuo-perceptual disturbances and to discuss the prognosis. CVI children show a wide range of visual disturbances. These could be either visual, oculomotor, perceptual or a combination of all. The severity of CVI depends on the time, location and extend of the brain damage.The visual function seems to improve in CVI children, especially in the cortically damaged, mainly due to brain plasticity. The increased survival rate of very premature infants during the last decades has increased the incidence of CVI in childhood. Better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of CVI, early diagnosis and early intervention could lead to a better quality of life of these children.","785":"Backround: Bone formation and remodelling appear as normal developmental or healing processes being inducted by several factors as BMPs, biophysical forces and IGF. A local environment consisted of those factors is created and it is responsible for the changes in the direction bone formation-bone resorption. This exact dynamic property of the bone is evaluated and utilized in the reconstructive surgical treatment of craniofacial deformities. Data with regard to the physiology of the biological process of bone turn over are initially analysed, followed by the applications of these mechanisms in orthognathic surgery, cleft lip and palate surgery and reconstructive surgery of midfacial deformities, including experimental data after a review of the contemporary international bibliography.Results-Conclusion: The growing knowledge of bone physiology will influence future surgery techniques and that is going to lead to greater therapeutic capabilities for our patients. ","786":"Medical humanities is a multidisciplinary field, consisting of humanities (theory of literature and arts, philosophy, ethics, history and theology), social sciences (anthropology, psychology and sociology) and arts (literature, theater, cinema, music and visual arts), integrated in the undergraduate curriculum of Medical schools. The aim of the present study is to discuss medical humanities and support the necessity of introduction of a medical humanities course in the curriculum of Greek medical schools. Through the relevant Pub-Med search as well as taking into account various curricula of medical schools, it is evident that medical education today is characterized by acquisition of knowledge and skills and development of medical values and attitudes. Clinical observation with the recognition of key data and patterns in the collected information, is crucial in the final medical decision, i.e. in the complex process, through which doctors accumulate data, reach conclusions and decide on therapy. All sciences included in medical humanities are important for the high quality education of future doctors. The practice of Medicine is in large an image-related science. The history of anatomy and art are closely related, already from the Renaissance time. Studies have shown that attendance of courses on art critics improves the observational skills of medical students. Literature is the source of information about the nature and source of human emotions and behavior and of narratives of illness, and increases imagination. Philosophy aids in the development of analytical and synthetical thinking. Teaching of history of medicine develops humility and aids in avoiding the repetition of mistakes of the past, and quite often raises research and therapeutic skepticism. The comprehension of medical ethics and professional deontology guides the patient-doctor relationship, as well as the relations between physicians and their colleagues. The Medical Humanities course, which is already integrated in the undergraduate curriculum of many medical schools of Europe, USA and Australia, includes lectures by experts and students presentations on the above-mentioned areas and could be offered, for a semester, during the first years. The aim of Medical Humanities course is the development of imagination and interpretation of data through analytical complex procedures, the development of skills of close observation and careful interpretation of the patient \"language\" and the enhancement of empathy for the patients, as well as the development of the physician-patient relationship and finally the conceptualization\/construction of personal and professional values. ","787":"Micro RNAs are evolutionarily conserved, single stranded molecules of about 22 nucleotides in length and function post-transcriptionally by partial binding (partial complementarity) to the mRNA of genes. Binding of a specific miRNA to its target on an mRNA can inhibit its expression by a variety of mechanisms. Although the most common mechanism is translational repression as a result of miRNA binding to the 3'UTR of an mRNA, mechanisms involving mRNA degradation and destabilization have also been described. Micro RNAs are currently considered as \"master regulators\" of gene expression. Since a single miRNA can bind and consequently regulate the expression of more than 100 different transcripts it has been estimated that miRNAs may be able to regulate up to 30% of the protein-coding genes in the human genome. As a result, miRNAs receive widespread attention on their potential role in complicated biological processes and multifactorial diseases. In this review we are discussing the biogenesis of miRNAs, their mode of action as well as their role in human diseases through genetic variations on their target sites.","788":null,"789":"","790":null,"791":"Ameloblastoma is a common odontogenic tumor of the jaws that comprises 3 variants: conventional (solid), unicystic and peripheral ameloblastomas. Unicystic ameloblastoma (UA) in the maxillary sinus is very rare. With a secondary infection, the clinical features may lead to incorrect diagnosis and treatment. A 19-year-old man was referred for the management of sinusitis and a mass at the right cheek. A few weeks earlier, the patient presented with acute cellulitis at the same area and underwent an incision and drainage in a primary care unit without any appropriate investigation. A radiographic examination revealed a massive lesion in the right maxillary sinus. An unerupted tooth within the lesion was found at the level of the orbital floor. The patient was successfully treated by enucleation of the tumor and curettage. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination, and the definite diagnosis was UA. The patient has been followed-up periodically for 5 years without recurrence. This case report suggests that primary care doctors should pay attention to differential diagnosis of orofacial lesions. It is therefore of great benefit to organize continuing education for general physicians who initially meet oral disease patients as a 'gate keeper'. Errors of clinical diagnosis and management of orofacial lesions would be minimized. Pitfalls of diagnosis and management of UA in the maxillary sinus were briefly reviewed. ","792":"With the exception of the catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), the management of patients with APS has been largely supportive aiming at avoiding a recurrent thrombotic event; it is noteworthy that data concerning therapy targeting the triggering factor (the antiphopsholipid antibodies) are scarce.

The coexisting deformities of the skull, the face, fingers and toes are typical. We report a case of a girl with Weaver syndrome associated with rare bilateral congenital dislocation of the hips associated with congenital hypoplastic talus and subtalar dislocation of her ankle joint. A 3-year old girl was admitted in our department with typical manifestations of Weaver syndrome, associated with congenital dislocation of bilateral hips, hypoplastic talus and subtalar dislocation of her right ankle. She was in pain while standing upright and incapable of independent walking. Both hips were treated operatively with open reduction and bilateral iliac osteotomy. Two years afterwards she had an open reduction of her talus and extraarticular arthrodesis of her subtalar joint in her right ankle. Six years postoperatively after the hip operations and four years after the ankle operation the girl is ambulant with a painless independent and unaided walking with a mild limp and full range of movements in all the operated joints. We suggest that children with Weaver syndrome and disabling musculosceletal deformities, particularly affecting their ability to stand up and walk should be treated early, before bone maturity, in order to achieve the best potential musculoskeletal as well as developmental outcome.

Demographic data were recorded and two specific questionnaires were used, the Adolescent Computer Addiction Test (ACAT) and the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS). Females scored higher than males on insomnia complaints but lower on computer use and addiction. A dosemediated effect of computer use on insomnia complaints was recorded. Computer use had a larger effect size than sex on insomnia complaints. Duration of computer use was longer for those adolescents classified as suffering from insomnia compared to those who were not.

The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and postoperative thromboembolic events in patients undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty. Between September 2004 and June 2006, we studied 172 patients (41 male and 131 female) with mean age 70.2 years (48-85). Total plasma homocysteine as well as other thrombophilic agents (proteinC, protein S, Antithrombin III, Lupus anticoagulants, APC-Resistance) were measured preoperatively. Duplex sonography was performed twice postoperatively, on the 7(th) day (+\/-2) and on the 42th day (+\/- 2). Spiral CT was performed when pulmonary embolism was suspected. Four patients developed deep venous thrombosis from which two developed pulmonary embolism. Only one of these four patients had high levels of total plasma homocysteine. Total plasma homocysteine does not seem to affect the development of deep venous thrombosis in patients undergoing total knee or hip arthroplasty and receive low molecular weight heparine.

This prospective, clinical study aimed to gauge the long-term effectiveness of microdiscectomy followed by PDN implantation in relieving pain and improving functional status in patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar disc disease and herniation. Ten patients with a) at least 6 months low back pain and\/or sciatica resistant to conservative treatment and b) radiologically documented degenerative lumbar disc disease and herniation have been selected. Follow-up at 6 weeks, 3, 12, 48, and 96 months postoperatively included physical examination, radiological investigation (plain and dynamic radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging), and self-completion of outcome scales (visual analogue, Oswestry, and Prolo functional status). Short Form-36 version 2 Health Survey patient profile at 96 months completed the image of health related quality of life. Patients' mean follow-up was 100.6 months. Significant improvements in Oswestry, Prolo, and VAS scores were documented (p: 0.004 in all scales at 48 months). Generic health status was rated within the average lumbar disease population (46.36.8 for physical component summary and 45.29.6 for mental component summary). Lumbar spine range of motion (20.211.8 at 96 months) was restricted in relation to normal, but maintained considerable mobility. Treated disc height increased postoperatively (p:0.002) and its maintenance could also be documented in all cases. Disc height at the level above did not show any significant modification. All postoperative MRI showed a non-clinically significant high signal of end-plate on T2 sequences. Clinically relevant complications included one case of pulmonary thrombosis and one case of device extrusion, which was subsequently explanted. After implantation, most patients continue to enjoy significant pain relief, a considerable amount of mobility is conserved and the disease specific functional outcome is excellent and remains for long, although it could not be supported that the generic health related quality of life is that of the general population.

The screening for prostate cancer allows early diagnosis of prostate malignancy before the individual presents with symptoms. The early stage of the disease is easier to manage by different therapeutic modalities. The aim of this review is to evaluate the reasons and facts for enthusiasm and positive approach towards the clinical decision about whether to screen or not male patients for early detection of prostate cancer. We performed a computerized MEDLINE search followed by a manual bibliographic review of cross-references. These reports were analyzed and the important findings were summarized. We analyzed the methods and schedule of screening, as well as advantages and disadvantages of the prostate cancer screening. There were more than a hundred studies on prostate cancer screening performed but only a few are eligible for a decisive conclusion concerning the prostate cancer screening issue. We reviewed the screening methods, the schedule of screening, the advantages and disadvantages of prostate cancer screening. The role for prostate cancer screening is not established yet. Definite proof of screening should be assumed as a decrease in the death rate of that cancer due to screening activity. ","802":"The importance of the bone microenvironment to the pathophysiology and morbidity associated with prostate cancer bone metastasis is becoming increasingly apparent. Significant alterations take place in the microenvironment of bone, which disturb the normal coupling that exists between bone resorption and bone formation. Consequently, a better understanding of the mechanisms that interact at the molecular level will definitely result in more effective therapy for patients with this devastating complication of prostatic carcinoma. This review will discuss the diagnostic and predictive implications of various collagenous and non-collagenous bone markers, along with the novel markers of osteoclastogenesis and other matrix enzymes such as metalloproteinases and growth factors responsible for the complex biochemical mechanisms that upregulate bone resorption\/formation during the development of metastasis. Further prospective studies are needed to determine whether any of these markers measured longitudinally in prostate cancer patients without bone scan evidence of skeletal disease will ultimately predict those patients who will develop bone metastases from their malignancy. Nonetheless, from the clinical point of view it is important to know that these novel markers carry the potential to provide meaningful information for daily practice by using upper normal reference values as cut-offs for identifying patients with an increased risk of developing progressive bone disease or skeletal related events.","803":"Purinergic signaling is a crucial component of disease whose pathophysiological basis is now well established. This review focuses on P2X(7), a unique bifunctional purinoreceptor that either opens a non selective cation channel or forms a large, cytolytic pore depending on agonist application and leading to membrane blebbing and to cell death either by necrosis or apoptosis.Activation of P2X(7) receptor has been shown to stimulate the release of multiple proinflammatory cytokines by activated macrophages, with the IL-1b to be the most extensively studied among them. These findings were verified by the use of knockout P2X(7) ((-\/-)) mice.Update information coming from all fields of research implicate this receptor at the very heart of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, depression, Alzheimer disease, and to kidney damage, in renal fibrosis and experimental nephritis.Clinical studies are currently underway with the newly developed selective antagonists for P2X(7) receptor, the results of which are eagerly anticipated.

The cysts presented as soft tissue masses in 8 patients, whereas in one, the cyst was an incidental finding on a CT scan performed for investigation of a lung problem. All hydatid cysts were confined into muscles, without affecting the bone. The location was the thigh region in 6 patients (quadriceps in 4, biceps in 2), the popliteal fossa (gastrocnemius) in one, the humerus (triceps branchii) in one and the shoulder (infraspinatus) in one patient. MRI showed multi-vesicular cysts in all patients. Indirect hemagglutination serological test was positive in 6 out of 9 cases. En block surgical excision of the cysts was undertaken in all patients. Two patients received antihelminthic chemotherapy preoperatively. Histopathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis. No recurrence occurred during the follow-up period (1-8 years). Skeletal muscle echinococcosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of limb masses, especially in endemic countries. A meticulous history taking and MRI imaging are essential, while pericystectomy is an effective method of treatment.","811":"Background - Aims: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) can cause a series of neuropsychiatric symptoms, whereas the currently approved treatment for this disease often induces similar symptoms as well. The aim of the present study was to compare Greek CHC patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with that of healthy controls, to identify any possible relationships between HRQoL and demographic and laboratory parameters and to study the fluctuation of HRQoL during therapy and follow-up. Ninty nine patients with CHC and 91 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. ALT, viral load, HCV genotype, fibrosis stage by liver biopsy and BMI, were determined at baseline. All patients completed the SF-36 quality of life questionnaire, which was self-administered, before treatment. They were treated with pegylated interferon alpha2-a or alpha-2b and ribavirin for 24 or 48 weeks and evaluated in the middle of therapy, at the end and six months after treatment cessation. SF-36 questionnaire was also completed in each evaluation. Patients' HRQoL was found to be below that of healthy controls in all SF-36 scales before treatment. There was a significant negative association between history of drug abuse and general health and a positive association between age and mental health. Multivariate analysis revealed that history of drug abuse seemed to play a significant role in bodily pain and general health of patients, as well as age did in vitality and mental health. The course of patients' HRQoL showed that in the middle of treatment values in all SF-36 scales were below those of baseline and they returned to pretreatment levels at the end of therapy. However, at the end of the six month follow-up period, an improvement in almost all scales compared to baseline was noted. Our results showed that a) Greek CHC patients' HRQoL was worse than that of healthy individuals and fluctuated significantly during treatment b) A history of drug abuse and age can independently affect HRQoL c) During treatment values of HRQoL are worsened possibly due to interferon-a treatment and d) In the long-term treatment results in improvement of HRQoL. ","812":"The repair of recurrent inguinal hernias after prosthetic mesh repair is usually diffucult due to considerable technical challenge and complications. There is also a greater risk of developing further recurrence. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of preperitoneal repair (open posterior approach) for recurrent inguinal hernias after Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty. We performed a prospective clinical study in 44 patients having recurrent inguinal hernias the period 2002- 2008. Preperitoneal repair was performed on all patients who have had Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty previously. The age, gender, operating time, hospital stay, postoperative complication rates and recurrence rates of patients were evaluated. There were no serious intraoperative complications. There were 36 men and 9 women in the study, whose average age was 38.45 (25-68) years. The average operative time and hospital stay were 44.56 (30-120) min and 1.6 (1-3) days, respectively. Complications included 4.5 % seromas, 4.5 % hematomas and urinary retention in 9.09 % patients. Follow-up to date is 1-90 months (range, median 40 months). We concluded that the preperitoneal repair (open posterior approach) in recurrent inguinal hernias after Lichtenstein tension-free hernioplasty is a safe and efficient method with low complication and rerecurrence rates. ","813":"Hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) occurs in 3% to 11% of all liver transplantations. Some authors have reported good outcomes with early thrombectomy. To investgate the impact of re-vascularization on graft survival. A total of 566 primary, cadaveric, single organ, adult liver transplants were performed. Hepatic arterial Doppler was performed routinely and patients with abnormal findings during the first two post-operative weeks were reexplored. Abnormal findings after this time-point were verified by non-invasive angiogram. The 47 patients that were diagnosed with arterial thrombosis, either intra-operatively or by angiogram, were divided into three groups. No further action was taken for group A, thrombectomy alone was performed for group B1, thrombectomy and anastomotic revision was employed for group B2. Arterial thrombosis was diagnosed in 47 (8.3%) patients. Mean patient survival was 42, 62 and 98 months for groups A, B1 and B2 respectively (p: 0.0629). Mean graft survival was 24, 29 and 60 months for groups A, B1 and B2 respectively (p: 0.3386). Re-transplant incidence was 8.7%, 40% and 28.6% for groups A, B1, and B2 respectively (p: 0.035). Early diagnosis of HAT by surveillance Doppler may lead to improved recipient survival secondary to earlier re-transplantation and not because of successful graft re-vascularization. ","814":"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a useful bronchoscopic technique. Studies in \"normal\" children are limited. To provide data on BAL reference values from Greek children and compare BAL cellular and noncellular components in children with inflammatory and non-inflammatory lung diseases. Seventy two children, aged 2.5 months to 16 years, underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy and BAL. Patients were divided in two groups whether lung inflammation was absent or present. Differential cytology, flow cytometry for lymphocyte subsets and cytokine and chemokine measurements were performed on BAL fluid. Alveolar macrophages were the predominant cellular population in normal children. Patients with inflammatory pneumonopathies had significantly more neutrophils. There was no difference in lymphocyte subpopulations. Values of CD4+\/CD8+ ratio in BAL was similar to that reported in adults. Levels of IL-8 and TNF- alpha were significantly higher in children with inflammatory lung diseases. This study provides the first data on BAL of \"normal\" Greek children. BAL from patients with pulmonary inflammation was characterised by neutrophilia. Finally, we propose that measurement of IL-8 and TNF-a levels in BAL could help in early identification of inflammation in the tracheobronchial tree. ","815":"Hyperhomocysteimemia is a cardiovascular risk factor even among children. Supplementation of oral folic acid may reduce homocysteine levels to normal. However, data is limited at this point for healthy children and adolescents. Five hundre and twenty four children participated in the study; Twenty six of them were found to be hyperho mocysteinemic(&gt;95(th) percentile for age). Twenty of them received 5 mg of folic acid twice per week for two consecutive months while the other six received a diet rich in dietary folate. Serum homocysteine levels were statistically significantly decreased from 13.1 (10-24.2 micromol\/L ) to 7.7 (4.9- 15.2 micromol\/L), p&lt;0.001. Serum folate levels were significantly rose from 4.3 (3-20 ng\/mL) to 16.8 (7-20 ng\/mL), p&lt;0.001. On the contrary, no important changes were observed in the above parameters in children to whom a diet rich in folic acid was recommended. Homocysteine levels were found to be positively associated with age (r=0.314, p&lt;0.001), BMI (r=0.192, p&lt;0.001), WC (r = 0.215, p&lt;0.001), simple sugars (r= 0.182, p&lt;0.001 ) and negatively associated with folic acid (r = -0.331, p&lt;0.001), vitamin B12 (r = -0.214, p&lt;0.001) and dietary folic acid (r= -0.228, p=0.003). Oral folic acid 5 mg twice per week may efficiently reduce serum homocysteine levels and increase serum folic acid levels in healthy children with increased homocysteine levels (&gt;95(th) percentile for age). Hyperhomocysteinemia in childhood may be a predictive factor of cardiovascular disease. In addition, these results may offer more help to health practioners in order to establish more prospective studies to elucidate the relationship between homocysteine, folic acid and heart disease in children. ","816":"GFR estimation is of major importance in everyday clinical practice. Usually it is done using one of the many eGFR equations available. In this study we compared in our population four widespread eGFR equations and our own empirical eGFR, with creatinine clearance calculated through a timed urine collection. We collected laboratory data of 907 patients from our clinic and outpatient department through a ten-year period and statistically compared the eGFR results between them and with the timed urine collection creatinine clearances. All eGFR equations gave acceptable approximations to the timed urine collection creatinine clearances. However, in different subpopulations some equations did better than others, without any clear advantage of any equation overall. Surprisingly, our empirical equation named DAF also gave acceptable approximations regardless of age, weight and sex of the patient. In our population our empirical eGFR method (DAF) gave satisfactory results regarding the monitoring of renal function, compared with four other eGFR methods. We suggest that it could provide a very fast and easy to use means of eGFR calculation. ","817":"The benefits of improved interdisciplinary collaboration in the health care section are well documented in the literature, including fewer errors and shorter delays and thus enhanced effectiveness and maximised patient safety. Given that the first step in improving teamwork involves uncovering individual team member's attitudes, this study was planned to investigate the level of collaboration, as part of organizational culture in the environment of ICU in Hippokratio Hospital. Considering as team all the medical and nursing stuff necessary for the integraded care of the ICU-patient, all the ICU personnel was included in the study, as well as that of other cooperating clinical departments and labs of Hippokratio hospital. For the purpose of the study a questionnaire was adopted and was given to 250 individuals, 196 of which responded (response rate 78.4%). Responders, in general, valued teamwork as crucial for the performance of ICU. However, the study revealed a relative low consensus regarding the level of teamwork within each unit and inadequate collaboration between certain departments and ICU. Interestingly enough, most of the responders were willing to share responsibility but unwilling to share decision making or accept questioning of their actions. Finally, low consensus was also observed regarding the composition of the team, some responders (mostly clinicians) undervaluing the contribution of labs. Certain differences were detected across departments, as well as between physicians and nurses, the statistical significance of which is indicated. Although the benefits of teamwork are well understood, realization of effective cooperation seems to be yet too far from our interdisciplinary practice. Teaching of teamwork skills and team concepts should become part of our medical or nursing education and training, if we should want to achieve a substantial improvement of quality of healthcare services, especially in high risk areas such as the ICUs. ","818":"Sepsis and septic shock are great challenges for the doctors who treat critically ill patients. A big part of the scientific community is performing researches about the pathophysiology and treatment of this clinical problem. The endothelium has a very significant role in the alterations that sepsis causes especially to the circulatory system. The disorders of the normal function of the endothelium include derangement of the vascular tone, increase of endothelium permeability, activation of the endothelial cells, production of various regulators and disorders of coagulation. Nitric oxide is the modulator that mediates the action of most vasodilators. The overproduction of nitric oxide during sepsis is possibly the most important cause of the vasopressor-resistant hypotension which characterizes septic shock. The levels of natriuretic peptides are also increased. These peptides act through several ways on the circulatory system both peripherally and directly on the myocardium. Endothelin, vasopressin, adrenomedullin and prostacyclin are vasoactive substances that have their own role in the regulation of the circulatory system during sepsis.","819":"Hypothyroidism is divided in primary, caused by failure of thyroid function and secondary (central) due to the failure of adequate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the pituitary gland or thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Secondary hypothyroidism can be differentiated in pituitary and hypothalamic by the use of TRH test. In some cases, failure of hormone action in peripheral tissues can be recognized. Primary hypothyroidism may be clinical, where free T(4) (FT(4)) is decreased and TSH is increased or subclinical where FT(4) is normal and TSH is increased. In secondary hypothyroidism FT(4) is decreased and TSH is normal or decreased. Primary hypothyroidism is most commonly caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, less common causes being radioiodine treatment and thyroidectomy. Salt iodination, which is performed routinely in many countries, may increase the incidence of overt hypothyroidism. The incidence of clinical hypothyroidism is 0.5-1.9% in women and &lt;1% in men and of subclinical 3-13.6% in women and 0.7-5.7% in men. It is important to differentiate between clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism as in clinical symptoms are serious, even coma may occur, while in subclinical symptoms are less and may even be absent. Subclinical hypothyroidism may be transformed to clinical and as recent research has shown it may have various consequences, such as hyperlipidemia and increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease, even heart failure, somatic and neuromuscular symptoms, reproductive and other consequences. The administration of novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of neoplastic diseases may induce hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is treated by the administration of thyroxine and the prognosis is excellent.","820":"Multiple myeloma is a haematologic malignancy caused by clonal expansion of malignant plasma cells and associated with bone disease and hypercalcaemia. Myeloma cells are in close proximity to sites of active bone resorption and the interactions between those cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, are crucial not only for the bone distraction but for the proliferation of bone marrow cells as well. Recent studies have revealed that numerous regulating factors of osteoblast and osteoclast activity interfere with the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma's bone disease and that the understanding of the pathophysiological pathways involved is the first step towards discovering novel potential therapeutic approaches.","821":"Gabapentin (GP) and pregabalin (PB) are structurally related compounds and their predominant mechanism of action is the inhibition of calcium currents via high-voltage-activated channels containing the a2d-1 subunit. A2delta ligands are approved for the treatment of pain of diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia in adults and as adjunctive therapy of partial seizures in children. Recently, pregabalin has been approved for treatment of anxiety disorders in Europe. Besides their already approved indications both drugs are promising treatment options for a number of different serious and debilitating diseases, as fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain of spinal cord injury, hot flushes, and essential tremor. In the present review, the unique mechanism of action of the above drugs is critically analyzed and evidence for their future use is provided. Gabapentin and pregabalin can be treatment options for these disorders, however, a clear comparison between the two drugs can not be performed, since there is no direct comparison study. The most common side effects are dizziness and somnolence which are also the most frequent reasons for withdrawal. Recommendations for future studies should include assessment of ideal titration period for GP and PB to reduce incidence of somnolence and dizziness and increase tolerability, cost-effectiveness and dose-response analysis of PB and GP and direct comparison of the two drugs.","822":"","823":"","824":"Hamartomas of the spleen (splenomas) are very rare benign tumors composed of an aberrant mixture of normal splenic elements. Herein we present a unique case of a symptomatic non-palpable splenoma in a 64-year-old female patient presented with anemia and thrombocytopenia and we describe imaging findings in ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a relatively small splenic hamartoma (35 mm at histopathology) associated with thrombocytopenia and anemia that resolved completely several months after splenectomy.","825":"Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most frequent type of panniculitis in childhood. Although frequently idiopathic, it may be associated with a wide variety of conditions ranging from infections, to sarcoidosis, to collagen vascular diseases to drugs. We present an 8-year-old boy who developed EN during the course of febrile gastroenteritis due to salmonella enteritidis. He received intravenous ampicillin 150 mg\/kg\/day divided in equal doses every six hours for 10 days. The skin lesions gradually disappeared, and he recovered fully without sequelae. Salmonellosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of EN in children with gastrointestinal symptoms, and stool cultures should be performed when indicated. ","826":"Laser in Situ Keratomileusis (LASIK) is the most common surgical procedure for the correction of refractive deviations. LASIK has been ongoing lately in our country, exclusively in private settings. This is the reason for which our clinic has no experience with LASIK procedure and complications following it. We are presenting a case of a 23 year-old female with traumatic flap displacement on the left eye, 5 years after the original LASIK operation. She was presented to our clinic on the 6th posttraumatic day. The patient was immediately operated and the flap repositioned. The case we present, is the only one treated to our clinic with such a vision-threatening complication of LASIK procedure.","827":"Marfan Syndrome occurs in 8 to 10 per 100,000 of population\/year. Ocular features of this syndrome have been extensively reported. We report two patients in the same family with miscellaneous complications of this syndrome. Two sisters with Marfan Syndrome were examined in our clinic. They revealed severe ocular complications as bilateral spontaneous complete posterior lens dislocation, total rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, and secondary glaucoma. Combined surgical and conservative treatment was applied to both cases with relative successful results. They were also referred to cardiologist for further evaluation and management. Ocular complications commonly occur in Marfan's Syndrome. Total rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, secondary glaucoma, etc. These findings require prompt and aggressive treatment to minimize visual loss in these patients. ","828":"Gitelman syndrome is an inherited renal tubular disorder characterized by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. It is distinguished from other hypokalemic tubulopathies, such as Bartter syndrome, by the presence of both hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria. We report a case of Gitelman syndrome in a 10-year-old girl who presented for examination of persistent unexplained hypokalemia. She had no severe clinical symptoms but she had typical laboratory findings including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and normocalcemic hypocalciuria. Molecular analysis revealed a mutation in the exon 21 of the SLC12A3 gene which encodes the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride co-transporter expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (a guanine to adenosine substitution at nucleotide 2538). She was treated with oral potassium and magnesium supplements. This is the first report of genetically established diagnosis in Greece. Gitelman syndrome should be considered as a cause of persistent hypokalemia and genetic analysis might be a useful tool to confirm the diagnosis.","829":"Inherent property of the motoneurons of the peripheral nervous system is their ability to recover, at least in part, upon injury. To this end different factors are expressed and are thought to play important role in the regeneration processes. These factors are diverse, and range from transcription factors and chemokines, to molecules of the extracellular matrix. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a protein with diverse actions controlling cell growth and proliferation. In the extracellular matrix it is found bound to decorin a proteoglycan involved in cell adhesion and cell signaling. In the present study we investigate the expression of TGF-beta and decorin at different time points, in the regenerating sciatic nerve of a seven day old rat, having suffered nerve crush injury, over a period of one month. To achieve this, we evoked injury to male Wistar rats by exposing and applying pressure to the sciatic nerve using watchmaker's forceps. After that at 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, one week, and one month intervals we investigated the gene expression of decorin using RT-PCR, and followed the expression of TGF-beta molecule by immunohistochemistry in frozen sections of the L4-L5 region of the rat spinal cord. We report that both decorin mRNA and TGF- protein exhibit a concerted, biphasic expression after 12 hours and one month having the animal suffered the nerve crush. Our data reveal a biphasic modulation of TGF-beta protein and decorin mRNA expression at lumbar segment of the spinal cord of animals having suffered unilateral sciatic nerve crush. We postulate that their concerted expression both at an early and a late phase after the nerve injury is of importance and can be part of a repair or neuroprotective mechanism as yet unclarified. ","830":"Respiratory function decline in association with sleep breathing abnormalities in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients are fully recognized as crucial manifestations in the natural course of the disease, severely affecting the prognosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the respiratory function at daytime and during sleep in a population of ALS patients and investigate the necessity of sleep study performance for the appropriate management of the disease. Twenty eight (10 male, 18 female) unselected patients with ALS, were evaluated in terms with their functional status by means of the ALS Functional Scale (ALSFSC). Baseline anthropometric measurements, pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gases analysis were performed, as well as evaluation of patients' perception of dyspnoea. A polysomnography was performed using a multichannel ambulatory recording. Nineteen patients had sleep disordered breathing with an RDI (Respiratory Disorder Index)&gt;5\/h (from 5.6\/h to 83\/h) and 10 patients had an RDI&gt;15\/h. All patients had impaired functional capacity by the ALSFSC and 11 patients (39.3%) reported mild to moderate dyspnoea. FVC was below 80% predictive value in 22 patients and in 8 patients hypoxaemia (PaO2&lt;80 mmHg) and in 12 patients hypercapnia (PaCO2&gt;40 mmHg) was present. There was no correlation found between spirometric values, maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures and sleep study parameters. There was a significant correlation between PaCO2 and RDI (r=0.498, p&lt;0.01), and PaO2 with nocturnal hypoxaemia (average SpO2, r=0.436,p&lt;0.05). Sleep-breathing abnormality is common in ALS patients even in the absence of documented respiratory failure. Clinical evaluation and respiratory function tests alone may not be sufficient to predict sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and nocturnal breathing assessment should be included in the evaluation of respiratory function. ","831":"Platelet indices are potentially useful markers for the early diagnosis of thromboembolic diseases. An increase in both mean platelet volume (MPV) and platelet distribution width (PDW) due to platelet activation, resulting from platelet swelling and pseudopodia formation was hypothesized. Platelet indices (MPV and PDW) in three groups of persons, using impedance and optical technology were measured. The first group consisted of patients with established platelet activation and healthy control subjects. The second study group included pregnant women in different trimesters of pregnancy. The effect of storage time on MPV and PDW in blood samples of a third group of randomly chosen patients was also assessed. There was a significant increase in MPV (P&lt;0.001) and PDW (P&lt;0.001) in patients with confirmed platelet activation compared to healthy control subjects. Only PDW showed a significant increase from the first to the third trimester of pregnancy (P=0.009). Temporal changes of MPV and PDW over storage time revealed a significant increase in MPV (P&lt;0.001), in contrast to a significant decrease in PDW (P&lt;0.05). MPV and PDW are simple platelet indices, which increase during platelet activation. PDW is a more specific marker of platelet activation, since it does not increase during simple platelet swelling. ","832":"An inflamed painful joint is one of the most common indications for the patient to be referred to a rheumatologist or an orthopedician. In relation to the aetiology, the therapeutic approach might be systemic, local or a combination of them in some cases, always with the thought of balancing risk with benefit for the patient. In all cases, independently of the cause, the goal of therapy is to improve the quality of life through the reduction of pain, improvement of mobility and preservation of function. Nuclear Medicine has to offer Radiosynoviorthesis, an effective alternative procedure for treating inflamed small joints. Various radionuclides are available for radiosynoviorthesis. Their selection depends on the size of the joint to be treated. Small joints are mainly treated with [169Er] erbium under a fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance, usually with a simultaneous instillation of a corticoid. Candidates for radiosynoviorthesis should have been under a six-month systemic treatment without encouraging results or should have undergone at least one unsuccessful intra-articular injection of a long acting glucocorticoid. Since 1973, when [169Er] erbium was firstly suggested as a therapeutic agent for radiosynoviorthesis of the finger joints, there has been quite enough experience in its' application. It has been found to be cost effective in providing long term relief of pain and deformity of the inflamed joints in comparison to other therapeutic approaches. Additionally, there is no radiation risk and can be performed on an out patient basis. Therefore it can stand as an effective alternative procedure for treating early stages of chronic synovitis in RA (rheumatoid arthritis) patients, with minor damage of the cartilage and the adjacent bones, and for synovitis secondary to inflammatory arthropathies.","833":"The aim of this review was to provide of the current knowledge in pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of spondylolysis based on the authors' experience and the pertinent medical literature. Spondylolysis represents a weakness or stress fracture in one of the bony bridges that connect the upper with the lower facet joints of the vertebra. It is the most common cause of low back pain in young athletes. One-half of all paediatric and adolescent back pain in athletic patients is related to various disturbances in the posterior elements including spondylolysis. The most common clinical presentation of spondylolysis is low back pain. This is aggravated by activity and is frequently accompanied by minimal or no physical findings. A pars stress fracture or early spondylolysis are common and a misdiagnosis is often made. Plain radiography with posteroanterior (P-A), lateral and oblique views have proved very useful in the initial diagnostics of low back pain, but imaging studies such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are more sensitive in the establishment of the diagnosis. Several treatment options are available. Surgical treatment is indicated only for symptomatic cases when conservative methods fail. The fact that early and multiple imaging studies may have a role in the diagnosis of pars lesions and the selection of the optimal treatment approaches is also highlighted.","834":"Systems biology based on integrative computational analysis and high technology is in a position to construct networks, to study the interactions between molecular components and to develop models of cardiac function and anatomy. Clinical cardiology gets an integrated picture of parameters that are addressed to ventricular and vessel mechanics, cardiac metabolism and electrical activation. The achievement of clinical objectives is based on the interaction between modern technology and clinical phenotype. In this review the need for more sophisticated realization of the structure and function of the cardiovascular system is emphasized while the incorporation of the systems biology concept in predicting clinical phenotypes is a promising strategy that optimize diagnosis and treatment in cardiovascular disease.","835":"The death rate from cardiovascular disease for dialysis patients is much higher than the general population, regardless of age. Observational data indicate that there is a close inter-relationship between progressive renal dysfunction in patients with chronic kidney disease cardiovascular disease and mortality. Continuously evidence indicates that deficiencies in vitamin D receptor activation represents one of key players in adversely affecting cardiovascular health, as well as inducing to secondary hyperparathyroidism in chromic kidney disease patients. Vitamin D receptors are widely expressed throughout the body and modulations of vitamin D levels results in correlative regulatory effects on mineral metabolism homeostasis, cardiovascular disease, and vascular calcification. The management of SHPT has developed enormously in recent years and different drug classes are available to treat this disease. Potentially, selective VDR activators not only reduce serum parathyroid hormone levels minimizing the risk of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia, but also may improve patient health, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.","836":"","837":"","838":"","839":"Acute exacerbations of respiratory diseases are a common cause of hospitalization among infants and children. To assess the epidemiological characteristics of asthma, bronchiolitis and croup among hospitalized children in Thessaloniki, from 1990 to 2003 included. Data from the patient registry with discharge diagnosis \"asthma\", \"bronchiolitis\" and \"croup\" were analyzed retrospectively, in five Paediatric Departments of Thessaloniki. Age and sex of the patients, as well as the month of admission were taken into consideration. A total of 8762 admissions of children (aged 3 months-14 years) with the diagnosis of asthma, \"bronchiolitis\" and \"croup\", were identified. Sex distribution was 65.86% males (64.86% bronchiolitis, 65.26% asthma and 70.31% croup). Asthma admissions decreased by 53.65%, croup admissions decreased by 4.73%, while bronchiolitis admissions increased by 25.03%, during the study period. A clear seasonal variation was found in all the three diseases, with the lowest incidence during summer months. Moreover there were two peaks for asthma (one during spring and a second during autumn), one peak for bronchiolitis (during winter early spring) and one peak for croup (during autumn). Paediatric asthma and croup admissions have declined during the last 14 years, in contrast with bronchiolitis admissions, which showed an increased tendency. More frequent use of inhaled steroids and induction of asthma education programs may have contributed to decreasing asthma admission rates. ","840":"The aim of our study was to assess the coagulation factors as endothelial dysfunction markers and prospectively their association with thrombotic episodes in chronic hemodialysis patients. Fifty-four randomly selected patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD), 34 men and 20 women were included in this study. Their mean age was 56 years and the mean hemodialysis duration was 53.0861.92 months. The variations of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombomodulin (TM) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were studied. The above-mentioned parameters were measured before and after HD session. Low molecular weight heparin (tinzaparin) was administered to all patients during hemodialysis. The results were compared with those obtained from 20 healthy volunteer-controls, age and sex matched. After the initial assessment, all patients were followed for a period of 15 months. Two patients experienced one hemorrhagic event each, regarding the upper and\/or the lower gastrointestinal tract. Twenty patients showed at least one thrombotic episode. Eleven patients presented fistula thrombosis, four angina pectoris incidents and five thrombosis of the lower limbs. The rest of the patients did not experience any clinical symptomatology that could be attributed to coagulation disorders. Parameter differences between patients and controls were statistically significant (p&lt;0.005 for TFPI and p&lt;0.001 for TM and vWF) and were improved after hemodialysis session. The age and the elevated levels of the vWF were found to be significantly different (p&lt;0.03 and p&lt;0.02 respectively) between the groups of patients who experienced or not thrombotic episodes. Coagulation factors TFPI, TM, and vWF are increased in hemodialysis patients and the clinical disorders are mainly thrombotic episodes. The age of patients and the elevated levels of vWF are associated with the thrombotic incidents. Hemodialysis contributes in the improvement of these coagulation factors, which could be considered as biological risk markers of endothelial dysfunction in chronic HD patients. ","841":"As already documented, a high prostate specific antigen in men with normal size of prostate gland is more likely to be associated with an aggressive cancer as compared to others with the same prostate specific antigen and a large gland size. In this retrospective study we tested the association between Prostate Specific Antigen Density (PSAD) and tumor aggressiveness in patients with clinically localized Prostate Cancer (PCa) surgically treated by radical prostatectomy. We evaluated data from patients records in a cohort of 72 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between January 2000 and June 2007. PSAD was calculated as ratio between the preoperative total prostatic specific antigen (PSA) in nanograms per milliliter with the prostate weight (PW) of prostatectomized specimen in grams or prostate volume measured with ultrasound (US). The patients were stratified into four PSAD categories: 0.1-0.15, 0.16- 0.20, 0.21-0.5 and greater than 0.51 ng\/ml\/gr. Parameters that were included into analysis were: PSA, measurement of the prostate volume by ultrasound (preoperatively) and prostate weight, pathological tumor stage, Gleason sum, Gleason grade, metastatic lymph nodes, seminal vesicle involvement and organ confine disease (postoperatively). Worsening of the clinicopathological properties was defined as aggressiveness. There was a significant correlation between US-PSAD and PW-PSAD (p&lt;0.001). In US-PSAD categories the statistic tests found significant correlation with the primary tumor (R=0.303, p&lt;0.01), metastatic lymph nodes (R=0.331, p&lt;0.01), and the organ confine disease (R=0.296, p&lt;0.05). The PW-PSAD categories correlated significantly with the pathologic findings from other parameters. Hence, a statistically significant correlation was found with Gleason sum (R=0.246, p&lt;0.05), Gleason grade (R=0.234, p&lt;0.05), primary tumor (R=0.285, p&lt;0.05), metastatic lymph node (R=0.287, p&lt;0.05) and organ confine disease (R=0.303, p&lt;0.01). Prostate specific antigen density measurement is useful tool for the assessment of the degree of aggressiveness in clinically localized prostate cancer, and further investigation regarding its possible use as a prediction marker is justified. ","842":"Today, millions of children use computers on a daily basis. Extensive viewing of the computer screen can lead to eye discomfort, fatigue, blurred vision and headaches, dry eyes and other symptoms of eyestrain. These symptoms may be caused by poor lighting, glare, an improper work station set-up, vision problems of which the person was not previously aware, or a combination of these factors. Children can experience many of the same symptoms related to computer use as adults. However, some unique aspects of how children use computers may make them more susceptible than adults to the development of these problems. In this study, the most common eye symptoms related to computer use in childhood, the possible causes and ways to avoid them are reviewed.","843":"Tubulointerstitial renal fibrosis, characterized as a progressive detrimental connective tissue deposition on the kidney parenchyma, appears to be a harmful process leading inevitably to renal function deterioration, independently of the primary renal disease which causes the original kidney injury. Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of tubular epithelial cells which are transformed to mesenchymal fibroblasts migrating to adjacent interstitial parenchyma constitutes the principal mechanism of renal fibrosis along with local and circulating cells. Proteinuria as well as hypoxia is included among the main mechanisms of EMT stimulation. TGFbeta-1 through the SMAD pathway is considered as the main modulator regulating the EMT molecular mechanism, probably in cooperation with hypoxia inducible factors. Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF) and Bone Morphogenetic Factor-7 (BMF-7) are inhibitory to EMT molecules which could prevent in experimental and clinical level the catastrophic process of interstitial fibrosis. Interesting data emerge indicating that HGF and BMF-7 administration prevents the peritoneal fibrosis of mesothelial cells.","844":"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a syndrome involving defects in primary cellular control mechanisms that result in the expression of chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism. This syndrome has been for many years one of the most controversial entities in gynecological endocrinology. Polycystic ovary syndrome has been proven to be a familial condition. Although the role of genetic factors in PCOS is strongly supported, the genes that are involved in the etiology of the syndrome have not been fully investigated until now, as well as the environmental contribution in their expression. The heterogeneity of the syndrome entertains the mystery around this condition which concerns thousands of infertile women worldwide. Some genes have shown altered expression suggesting that the genetic abnormality in PCOS affects signal transduction pathways controlling steroidogenesis, steroid hormones action, gonadotrophin action and regulation, insulin action and secretion, energy homeostasis, chronic inflammation and others. The present review of the contemporary literature constitutes an effort to present all the trends in the current research for the etiology of polycystic ovary syndrome.","845":"Cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C is the leading indication for liver transplantation in Europe, United States and Japan. Reinfection after liver transplantation is universal and chronic liver disease develops in at least 70% of patients at 3 years, with an accelerated course compared to the nontransplant setting. These facts underscore the need for a better understanding of hepatitis C infection and the various treatment modalities. This paper attempts a brief review of the scope of the disease, as well as the different treatment modalities, with special emphasis given to orthotopic liver transplantation.","846":"The improvement in the field of kidney transplantation, during the last decades, has brought kindey transplantation to the top of patient preference as the best kidney replacement therapy. The use of marginal kidney grafts, which are highly immunogenic has become common practice because of lack of kidney donors. Inflammatory activity in the kidneys after brain death is an ongoing phenomenon. The inappropriate treatment of brain dead donor may result to primary non function (PNF) of the graft, delayed graft function (DGF) or to long term graft dysfunction and shortened graft survival. Therefore correct handling of the brain dead donor is of paramount importance. The impact of various pharmacologic agents (catecholamines, glucocorticoids, carbamylated recombinant human erythropoietin, recombinant soluble P-selectin glycoprotein ligant, heme oxygenase-1, carbon monoxide, and mycophenolate mofetil) on the immunogenicity of brain dead donor kidneys is discussed.","847":"The diabetic foot continues to be a major cause of morbidity, posing a global threat. Substantial progress has been now accomplished in the treatment of foot lesions, but further improvement is required. Treatment options may be classified into established measures (revascularisation, casting and debridement) and new modalities. All therapeutic measures should be provided by specialised dedicated multidisciplinary foot clinics. In particular, the diabetic foot is a huge challenge for Greece. There is a dramatic need to increase the number of engaged foot care teams and their resources throughout the country. It is also desirable to continue education of both physicians and general diabetic population on the magnitude of the problem and on the suitable preventative measures. At the same time, more data on the prevalence and clinical manifestations of the diabetic foot in Greece should be carefully collected. Finally, additional research should investigate feasible ways of implementing current knowledge in everyday clinical practice.","848":"","849":"Pseudallescheria boydii is a saprophytic fungus frequently isolated from agricultural soil and polluted water. Disseminated and invasive infections with this organism are seen primarily in the immunocompromised host. We present an unusual case of invasive P. boydii infection in an immunocompetent patient admitted to our hospital with clinical, laboratory and ECG findings of a possible acute myocardiac infarction. Six hours after admission without treatment with thrombolytic agents she presented with a right hemiparesis and loss of consciousness; a CT scan showed a cerebral hemorrhage. She was treated with dexamethasone i.v. 32 mg per day. She was not incubated. Two blood cultures taken the 15th and 16th day of hospitalization, respectively, revealed a filamentous fungus which was identified by CBS as P. boydii. The pathologic examination of one nodule showed hyphae of fungi. Despite the administration of amphotericin B the patient died one week later.","850":"Primary cytomegalovirus infection is rare among immunocompetent hosts. We present a case of acute cytomegalovirus infection in a young immunocompetent female with pulmonary and hepatic involvement, admitted to our department due to severe exertional dyspnea. Patient's symptoms were completely atypical. Ganciclovir was administered succeeding complete clinical and laboratory signs's resolution.","851":"Right sided heart thrombi may develop within the right heart chambers or they may be peripheral venous clots that on their way to the lungs, accidentally lodge in a patent foramen ovale, tricuspid chordae or Chiaris network. Type A thrombi have a worm-like shape and are extremely mobile. These pleomorphic thrombi are mainly localized in the right atrium, frequently move back and forth through the tricuspid orifice and may cause cardiovascular collapse when entrapment occurs. Type B thrombi attach to the atrial or ventricular wall indicating that they are probably of local origin. We describe the case of a middle age man (48 years old) with no cardiovascular history and a massive pulmonary embolism where transthoracic echocardiography revealed many type A thrombi in both right atrium and ventricle. He presented with acute dyspnea, diaphoresis and hemodynamical instability. He was treated with thrombolysis and after three hours was greatly improved and the thrombi were disappeared. After ten days of hospitalization he was discharged. Thrombi were originated in the popliteal region of the inferior vena cava of both legs and were totally treated.","852":"Spontaneous haemorrhage is a well known complication of oral anticoagulation therapy. Various sites of bleeding have been reported in the literature, most commonly being the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system and central nervous system. Spontaneous haematoma is rarely reported to involve the upper aerodigestive tract, being potentially a life threatening condition. We report a case of a 67 year-old female patient who developed spontaneous hematoma of the upper aerodigestive tract as a consequence of a rare interaction between acenocoumarol and clindamycin. Reversal of anticoagulation, careful observation, and when necessary prompt intervention to secure the airway are the main aspects of management. We highlight the need for a thorough evaluation of patients who develop new painful or other symptoms while being on anticoagulation therapy. Clinicians should be highly alerted as these could potentially be manifestations of haemorrhagic complications.","853":"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis in the world, and currently is known to be an important cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD). Hypertension, proteinuria more than 1 g\/d, and the presence of severe lesions on initial renal biopsy such as crescents and interstitial fibrosis are the most significant predictive factors for progression to ESRD. Despite its prevalence and clinical importance, there is no consensus for the treatment of patients with risk factors for a worse prognosis. Our aim is to describe here a case of crescentic IgAN, and to emphasize the effect of immunosuppressive treatment.","854":"To present our experience with unexpected findings during hernia surgery, either unusual hernial contents or pathologic entities, like neoplastic masses, masquerading as a hernia. We studied retrospectively 856 patients with inguinal hernia who were admitted to our surgical department over a 9-year period. In addition, our study included patients complaining of inguinal protrusion, even without a definitive diagnosis of inguinal hernia upon admission. Five patients presented with unusual hernial contents. Three of them had a vermiform appendix in their sac. Acute appendicitis (Amyands hernia) was found in only one case. One patient had epiploic appendagitis related with a groin hernia. Moreover, an adult woman was diagnosed with ovarian and tubal inguinal hernia. Finally, we report a case of a massive extratesticular intrascrotal lipoma, initially misdiagnosed as a scrotal hernia. a hernia surgeon may encounter unexpected intraoperative findings. It is important to be prepared to detect them and apply the appropriate treatment. ","855":"The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of a DNA repair protocol in improving genetic testing in compromised samples, frequently encountered in Forensic Medicine. In order to stretch the experiment conditions to the limits, as far as quality of samples and DNA is concerned, we tried the repair protocol on ten ancient human teeth obtained from an equal number of skeletons from a burial site in Lerna, Middle Helladic Greece (2100-1700 BC). For these samples, sex was previously determined morphologically, serving as a reference to compare our molecular data with. The samples were analysed using the DNA amelogenin sex test assay prior and after DNA polymerase repair. For every individual, two molecular sex determinations were obtained by visualising PCR products on an agarose gel. DNA repair enabled genetic testing in these samples. Successful amplification of the amelogenin gene was obtained only from the repaired DNA in eight out of ten samples. Prior to the repair treatment, none of these samples yielded any PCR products, thus attesting to the authenticity of the amplified sequence. The concordance between morphological and molecular analysis was in reasonable agreement (71%). These results reveal the impact of the repair process in studying single copy genes from low quality DNA. This protocol could facilitate molecular analysis in compromised samples, encountered in forensic medicine, as well as enable genetic studies in ancient remnants. ","856":"Renal stones, urinary tract infections (UTI) and gross hematuria (GH) are the most important renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). They are not only common, but are also frequent cause of morbidity, influencing renal dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of these manifestations in our patients with ADPKD and their impact on renal function. One hundred eighty ADPKD patients were included in the study. Subjects were studied for the presence of UTI, gross hematuria frequency and responsible factors of nephrolithiasis. Survival times were calculated as the time to renal replacement therapy or time of serum creatinine value up to 10 mg\/dl. Kaplan-Meier product-limit survival curves were constructed, and log rank test was used to compare the survival curves. Kidney stones were present in 76\/180 (42% of pts). The stones were composed of urate (47%) calcium oxalate (39%), and other compounds 14%. UTI was observed in 60% (108 patients). Patients treated with urinary disinfectants had a significant lower frequency of urinary infection (p&lt;0.001) and hematuria (p&lt;0.001) after one year than untreated patients. Gross hematuria was present in 113 patients (63%). In 43 patients hematuria was diagnosed before age 30 (38%), while in 70 patients it was diagnosed after age 30 (62%). UTI is frequent in our ADPKD patients. The correct treatment of UTI decreases its frequency and has beneficial role in the rate of progression to renal failure in ADPKD patients. Patients with recurrent episodes of gross hematuria may be at risk for more severe renal disease. ","857":"A retrospective review of patients with malignant neoplasms of the hypopharynx treated with combined surgery and radiotherapy is presented to highlight the results of treatment and the factors of treatment success for this malignant disease. Between 1995 and 2004 at the University ORL Clinic Nis 89 patients with malignant neoplasms of hypopharynx (85 males, 4 females, and age ranging from 44 to 77 years) were treated. In the 89 patients (stage I, n=4; stage II, n=3; stage III, n=34; stage IV, n=48), the sites of origin were pyriform sinus (n=75), postcrycoid (n=8), posterior pharyngeal wall (n=3) and superior hypopharynx (n=3). Laryngeal preservation surgery was achieved in 11.2% of patients, while 88.8% had laryngectomy with partial or total pharyngectomy. Pyriform sinus was the most common site of origin of hypopharyngeal carcinoma in 84.3%. Totally 93% of patients had neck metastases, and tumors extended beyond the hypopharynx in 41.6% of patients. TNM stage was highly significant parameter of outcome. Five year survival was 100% for stage I, 66.6% for stage II, 53.9% for stage III, and 33.3% for stage IV. Residual disease (5.6%) and recurrent disease (2.2%) were low. Postoperative fistula developed in 16.8% of patients, and in 60% it was closed successfully using local flaps, while in 40% pectoralis flap was needed. Localization of disease was also an important factor of survival. Retrocrycoid carcinoma resulted in very poor survival rate (12.5%), high residual disease, lymph node metastasis, and pharyngocutaneous fistula formation. Localization and TNM stage are highly significant factors for clinical course, treatment, and outcome of hypopharyngeal carcinoma. ","858":"Open tibial fractures in adults have been extensively studied. In children, however, only a small number of case series provide data on management and outcome of these injuries. It is not clear whether open tibial fractures in children 'behave' in a similar fashion to those in adults, and clear guidelines regarding their management do not exist. Primary wound closure after irrigation does not increase infection rates in low grade open tibial fractures. Cast is an effective method for fracture stabilization in stable fractures. External fixation is usually used in patients with significant soft tissue injury, and elastic intramedullary nailing is an alternative. Age over 10 years and open fracture grade III appear to be significant prognostic factors. Complication rates are not unremarkable and long-term studies are required to investigate their consequences. Children over 10 years should probably be managed as adults. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different fracture management methods.","859":"Dysphagia is a symptom so common and diverse that is often considered as a disease in its own right. Its severity can range from a trivial problem to a lethal condition. It can seriously compromise the quality of life of affected patients, therefore management should be prompt. The implications of dysphagia in healthcare costs are immense. Assessment of dysphagic patients is based on a comprehensive history and thorough examination. In the present review we discuss physiology, aetiology, diagnosis and management emphasizing the role of a multidisciplinary team approach. We also focus on the role of fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing which revolutionized over recent years the assessment of the dysphagic patient.","860":"Cardiovascular manifestations are very common in patients with end stage renal disease and those undergoing dialysis treatment. One of the factors, causing cardiovascular disorders due to mineral metabolism disturbances in uremia is the appearance of cardiovascular calcification. The precise mechanism of the mineral metabolism disturbances acting through the existing metabolic acidosis in chronic renal failure is not yet clarified. The influence of acidosis is a complex one, acting as a stimulator of the solubility of Ca-P deposits, a suppressor of parathyroid secretion, an inhibitor of some osteogenic enzymes, a blocker of formation of bone matrix, a modulator of the up-regulation of Pit-1 and finally as a blocker of phosphate uptake by the arterial smooth muscle cells.","861":"The 2009 flu outbreak in humans, known as \"swine influenza\" or H1N1 influenza A, refers to influenza A due to a new H1N1 strain called swine-origin influenza virus A (S-OIV). The new swine flu virus is actually a genetic mixture of two strains, both found in swine, of unknown origin. S-OIV can be transmitted from human to human and causes the normal symptoms of influenza. Prevention of swine influenza spread among humans includes use of standard infection control measures against influenza and constitutes the main scope of World Health Organization. For the treatment of S-OIV influenza oseltamivir and zanamivir are effective in most cases. Prophylaxis against this new flu strain is expected through a new vaccine, which is not available yet. Worldwide extension of S-OIV is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and indicates that response actions against S-OIV must be aggressive.","862":"","863":"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a neurobehavioral disorder characterized mainly by neonatal hypotonia, dysmorphic features, hypogonadism, mental retardation and behavioral problems. The PWS has not been associated with renal complications. We report the case of an infant with Prader-Willi syndrome due to loss of the paternal copy of chromosome 15q11.2-13, who presented with severe proteinuria and microscopic hematuria. Renal biopsy revealed mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The early onset of the primary MPGN in this infant make us consider a possible association between the deficiency of the paternally expressed genes from the 15q11-q13 region and the renal disease.","864":"Angioedema due to use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is a rare side-effect but is seen more often because of the increase in the use of these drugs due to their effectiveness and good tolerance in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure. Other types of angioedema, which should be included in the differential diagnosis, are the hereditary type, which results from deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor and the allergic angioedema. Angioedema is a potentially life-threatening condition when it is located to the mucosal and submucosal layers of the upper airway. Some times an angioedema case can be very severe, resistant to the usual treatment and even rarely fatal. The last eight months, six patients with angioedema due to ACEIs (5 cases) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (1 case), were examined and hospitalized at our department. We describe the case of a 65 year old woman with severe migratory angioedema of the tongue, the floor of the mouth and the oropharynx, which was rather resistant to the usual treatment.","865":"A 46-year-old white woman with lesions on the lower lip, perioral area and in the soft tissues of the oral cavity (gingivae and palate) was examined. The clinical signs were recorded, and incisional biopsies from the oral lesions were taken. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis was established by the histopathological evidence of typical non-caseating granulomas from tissue biopsy, supported by serum ACE- 57.9 U\/L, blood calcium 16.83 mEq\/L and 24-hrs urine calcium 600 mg). Oral lesions may be the first or the only sign of sarcoidosis in an otherwise healthy patient.","866":"We report the case of a 17-year-old girl with toxic adenoma scheduled for surgery right lobectomy and isthmectomy of thyroid gland. During the examination before surgery, patient was diagnosed for the first time as having with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. In the operating room, after the induction of anesthesia, the electrocardiogram showed wide QRS complex tachycardia with a rate of 180 beats\/min, which was diagnosed as paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The patient was treated immediately with antiarrhythmic drugs: adenosine iv three times (at doses of 6 mg, 12 mg, 12 mg bolus) and esmolol iv twice (at doses 28.5 mg). This approach resulted in disappearance of the delta wave and tachycardia for the whole surgery period. In this case report we discuss the role of induction of anesthesia and presence of toxic adenoma in a patient with WPW.","867":"In a 34 year-old woman complaining of right upper quadrant pain and having mildly elevated total bilirubin, the imaging investigation revealed a liver lesion with characteristics of focal nodular hyperplasia, measuring 3.8 cm, at the confluence of the hepatic veins. The mass was obstructing the left and middle hepatic veins and nearly obstructing the right hepatic vein. Dilation of the splenic vein with development of retropancreatic varices, splenomegaly and free abdominal fluid were also present. The patient underwent an uncomplicated left hemihepatectomy. Patients postoperative total bilirubin was normalized. Tomographic imaging three months after the liver resection revealed resolution of all the Budd-Chiari radiographic signs. This is a report of a case where a hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia, despite its benign nature, required extensive and urgent surgical intervention due to its location and potential dangers secondary to the development of portal hypertension.","868":"To describe the tomographic findings of a case of myopic traction maculopathy using Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) and present the results of its surgical intervention. Observational case report and review of the literature. A 61-year-old male with metamorphopsia was examined clinically and with the use of SD-OCT. The diagnosis of myopic traction maculopathy was made. The patient underwent pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the vitreomacular adhesions, the epiretinal and the internal limiting membrane. Visual acuity increased by two Snellen lines, metamorphopsia disappeared, macular morphology was improved and myopic traction maculopathy was resolved. Imaging with SD-OCT is capable of documentation and measurement of the early stages of myopic traction maculopathy. Moreover, vitrectomy was beneficial for the visual and anatomic outcome of the patient. ","869":"Common Rules for Aviation Safety had been developed under the aegis of the Joint Aviation Authorities in the 1990s. In 2002 the Basic Regulation 1592\/2002 was the founding document of a new entity, the European Aviation Safety Agency. Areas of activity were Certification and Maintenance of aircraft. On 18 March the new Basic Regulation 216\/2008, repealing the original Basic Regulation was published and applicable from 08 April on. The included Essential Requirements extended the competencies of EASA inter alia to Pilot Licensing and Flight Operations. The future aeromedical requirements will be included as Annex II in another Implementing Regulation on Personnel Licensing. The detailed provisions will be published as guidance material. The proposals for these provisions have been published on 05 June 2008 as NPA 2008- 17c. After public consultation, processing of comments and final adoption the new proposals may be applicable form the second half of 2009 on. A transition period of four year will apply. Whereas the provisions are based on Joint Aviation Requirement-Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) 3, a new Light Aircraft Pilot Licence (LAPL) project and the details of the associated medical certification regarding general practitioners will be something new in aviation medicine. This paper consists of 6 sections. The introduction outlines the idea of international aviation safety. The second section describes the development of the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), the first step to common rules for aviation safety in Europe. The third section encompasses a major change as next step: the foundation of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the development of its rules. In the following section provides an outline of the new medical requirements. Section five emphasizes the new concept of a Leisure Pilot Licence. The last section gives an outlook on ongoing rulemaking activities and the opportunities of the public to participate in them.","870":"The assessment of the postoperative outcome following laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy using anterior and posterior mesh. In the study were included one hundred and ten women (mean age 62 years with range from 34 to 78) who had laparoscopic sarcoplexy the period 2001-2005. They were contacted and completed postal questionnaires more than one year after surgery and had a follow up in the uro-gynaecology clinic. The median follow up was 21 months. Eighty-three of them (75.4%) answered the postal questionnaire. Good satisfaction was defined as complete disappearance of all genito-urinary symptoms. Moderate satisfaction was defined as a partial disappearance of symptoms, or de novo less annoying symptoms. Dissatisfaction was defined as no change in symptoms, and \/or de novo important symptoms. The overall rate of good satisfaction was 74.7% (62\/83), moderate satisfaction 15.6% (13\/83), and only 9.6% (8\/83) were not satisfied. There was no statistical difference among the six different groups (sacrocolpopexy only, plus TVT, plus TVT and hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy and previous hysterectomy, sacrocolpopexy and TVT with previous hysterectomy), concerning the pre and post operative clinical signs and post operative symptoms. There was a statistically significant difference (p=0.038) regarding dissatisfaction and prolapse relapse between the group that had a previous total hysterectomy combining sacrocolpopexy with TVT and all other groups. The most frequent post operative symptoms were stress incontinence, dysuria and constipation. No severe complications and mesh erosion were observed, despite the two cases of mesh detachment. Laparoscopic double synthetic mesh sacrocolpopexy seems to be a safe and effective treatment of genitourinary prolapse, with good overall long term outcomes and benefits of the minimal access approach. The presence of the remaining cervix after subtotal hysterectomy, seems to enhance the results of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy.. Further randomised studies are needed to confirm our results and to compare this method to open and\/or vaginal approach. ","871":"To present our experience from the use of three-dimensional (3D) spiral computed tomography (CT) reconstructions for the detection of endotracheal and tracheostomy tube-related complications. The CT-scans of thirteen patients who were subjected to spiral computed tomography for the evaluation of possible tracheal complications due to the use of endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes were retrospectively studied. In each case, a spiral scan of the airways from the larynx to the main bronchi was performed. Axial images were reconstructed with the use of the following three-dimensional visualization methods: volume rendering (VR), tissue transition projection (TTP), shaded surface display (SSD) and virtual endoscopy (VE). Detected complications were subdivided into acute and late, according to the time of appearance (during presence of tracheal tube or after its removal, respectively). Six patients showed acute complications (wrong placement of the tube with compression of tracheal wall in three cases, perforation of tracheal wall in two cases, tracheal stenosis in one case). Seven patients showed late complications (tracheal stenosis in all cases). Three-dimensional reformatted images contributed significantly to the detection of both acute complications (position of tube in relation to tracheal wall), and late complications (number, position, length and degree of stenoses), providing a non-invasive evaluation of the outer tracheal wall and tracheal lumen. Three-dimensional spiral CT reconstructions are a valuable adjunct of transverse images for the evaluation of trachea in cases of suspected tracheal tube-related complications. ","872":"Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Multiple Daily insulin Injections (MDI) are both strategies aiming to achieve a tight glycemic and metabolic control. However, the choice between them remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of MDI (three or more injections daily) with CSII on glycemic control in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and assess satisfaction from treatment in the CSII group. Seventeen patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus on CSII (previously on MDI) and 17 patients on MDI, matched for age, gender, BMI and duration of diabetes, were retrospectively studied. Glucosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), frequency of hypoglycaemias (assessed as self reported episodes), BMI and total units of insulin per day were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months in both groups. CSII group completed a questionnaire concerning motive for treatment selection, advantages, deficiencies and inconvenience at the end of the study. Satisfaction from treatment was assessed with a scale from 0 to10. CSII group had more hypoglycaemic episodes at baseline than MDI group (16.2+\/-2.8 vs 2.8+\/-1.3, p&lt;0,001). HbA1c (8.4+\/-0.5 before vs 7.3+\/-0.4 after, p&lt;0.05) and total hypoglycaemic episodes per month (16.2+\/-2.8 before vs 8.7+\/-2.3 after, p&lt;0.05) significantly decreased in CSII group 6 months after baseline. On the contrary, total hypoglycaemic episodes per month were increased in MDI group (2.8+\/-1.3 before vs 10.8 +\/-2,6 after, p&lt;0.05) in order to maintain HbA1c levels. No significant differences were observed in BMI in both groups. Total insulin demands were reduced in the CSII group (49.4+\/-3.3 before vs 39.0+\/-4.6 after, p&lt;0.05) and remained unchanged in MDI group. None of the patients discontinued CSII therapy, while overall satisfaction rate in this group was high. The main motive for CSII selection was frequent hypoglycaemic episodes and glucose fluctuations (10\/17). The majority of patients expressed their wish for incorporating glucose trend indicator and\/or continuous glucose measurement into pump and reducing pump size (15\/17). Most commonly stated advantage was improved flexibility, followed by greater freedom and decreased sense of physical restrictions (10\/17). Inconvenience mainly derived from alarm malfunction and catheter or needle occlusion and was reported from a minority of patients (4\/17). CSII group reported more hypoglycaemias than MDI group at baseline but 6 months later had significantly less hypoglycaemic events, while on the contrary, MDI group 6 months after baseline had more frequent and more severe hypoglycaemias. Although baseline hypoglycaemias are not equal between the two groups, we can assume that CSII group achieved less hypoglycaemic events along with significant reduction in HbA1c while utilising less insulin units. ","873":"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the commonest endocrinopathy among women of reproductive age with an estimated prevalence of about 10%. Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, endometrial cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer are some of the most important emerging issues regarding syndromes influence in womens future well being. The aim of this review is to provide clear and up to date information, based on clinical evidence, in order to advise clinicians about the late consequences of the syndrome.","874":"Awareness during surgery is a very serious problem for the anesthetist and the patient as well. Such incidents are the cause for 2% of the legal claims against anesthetists while patients with intraoperative awareness experience describe it as the worst thing they have ever suffered from. Pain, anxiety and inability to react due to muscle paralysis often lead to the situation called posttraumatic stress disorder which demands psychiatric support. The fact that there are patients who report intraoperative experience, even several days after surgery, raises questions about the way the anesthetic drugs interfere with the mechanisms of memory and consciousness while, in bibliography, there are studies proving that even deeply anesthetized patients can be influenced by auditory stimuli without being able to recall them. Intraoperative monitoring of the anesthesia depth is important for the prevention of this problem. From all the available devices only the Bispectral Index Monitoring (BIS) has been proven to be effective for this purpose but the high cost per person and the low specificity in preventing awareness episodes do not allow its everyday use. The surgeon and especially the anesthesiologist must be aware of the risk factors, the prevention measures and the actions that must be taken after an awareness incident in order to minimize the unfortunate complications for both the patient and the doctors.","875":"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are extracellular enzymes that are important in many physiologic and pathologic processes. Their activity is regulated mainly by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). MMPs expression is related with the classical cardiovascular risk factors as well as with inflammation. They play a central role in atherosclerosis, plaque formation, platelet aggregation, acute coronary syndrome, restenosis, aortic aneurysms and peripheral vascular disease. Many studies have shown that commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications, glitazones and statins may influence MMPs activity. The aim of the review is to present literature data on the role of MMPs and their inhibitors in cardiovascular disease.","876":"","877":"The elasticity of a given arterial segment of the aorta and of big elastic arteries is not constant but depends on its distending pressure. As distending pressure increases, there is greater recruitment of inelastic collagen fibers and thereby a reduction in elasticity. It also depends on structural changes in the medial layer of the elastic arteries (mainly aorta and major arterial conduits), and is largely the result of progressive elastic fibre degeneration.Aortic Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV), is the most robust marker of arterial stiffness, however additional useful information can also be provided by the Central Augmentation Index (AIx C), and pulse pressure. The presence of systemic inflammation in cardiovascular disease and in particular in essential hypertension affects arterial stiffness and increases PWV. Some pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions may improve arterial stiffness and thereby decrease PWV.","878":"The pairing of the kisspeptins (KP) with the KISS1 (GPR54) receptor has received growing attention since the description of the receptor as a molecular switch for puberty. The role of KP and its receptor, GPR54, in puberty is the most exciting finding made in the field of reproductive biology since the discovery of Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) in 1970s. A significant body of evidence across several species now suggests that KISS1 (GPR54) activation is a critical point in the commencement of puberty, although further investigation is required to characterize the interaction between KP and GnRH cascade. Given such pivotal roles of kisspeptins and GPR54 as gatekeepers of reproductive function, and the proven ability of sex steroids to physiologically regulate this system, it is plausible that environmental compounds with ability to interfere oestrogen and\/or androgen signaling (agonists or antagonists) may target the hypothalamic kiss-1\/GPR54 system, thereby inducing functional alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Synthetic agonists targeting KISS1 (GPR54) may represent novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism in some affected individuals. The diverse multifunctional nature of the KP is beginning to unravel. The unexpected role of these peptides in puberty has raised a number of important questions that remain to be answered.","879":"","880":"Primary synovial osteochondromatosis is an unusual condition, which generally involves otherwise normal joints. Joints commonly affected in descending order of frequency are knee, hip, glenohumeral joint, elbow and ankle, though any articulation may be involved. Synovial osteochondromatosis has been also encountered in tendon sheaths and periarticular bursa. We report a case with the clinical findings, radiographic features, surgical and histological data of primary subacromial-subdeltoid bursa synovitis. X-ray radiographs of the right glenohumeral joint as well as CT and MRI of the right shoulder zone were performed. A soft tissue mass around the lateral margin of the proximal humerus without evidence of any calcification\/ossification or erosion of the adjacent cortex was detected on both X-Rays and CT images. Multiple nodules of almost equal size appeared that were isointense on T1-weighted spin-echo images and slightly hyperintense on T2 weighted spin-echo images compared with the signal intensity of the surrounding skeletal muscles. The main differential diagnosis was pigmented villonodular synovitis, rheumatoid arthritis with rice bodies and secondary synovial osteochondromatosis. Based on the results of all modalities the diagnosis of primary synovial chondromatosis of subdeltoid\/ subacromial bursa was concluded.","881":"Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare and ominous disease manifested in the peripartum period of women with complications concerning different organic systems. We describe a case of peripartum cardiomyopathy which was complicated with acute permanent unilateral blindness, further documented embolic retinal artery occlusion as a consequence of PPCM. This is a quite unusual event with PPCM, since to our knowledge there is no previously reported case with PPCM as the sole associated factor. The purpose of our paper is to emphasize that thromboembolism of the central retinal artery, seems to be compatible with peripartum cardiomyopathy and that, peripartum blindness, may be attributed to the cardiomyopathy diagnosis.","882":"Epignathus is extremely rare form of teratoid tumor arising from the palate or pharynx in the region of basisphenoid (Rathke's pouch), filling the buccal cavity and protruding from the mouth. This tumor usually causes death in neonatal life because of its location and because surgical removal is often impossible. Prenatal sonographic diagnosis is important for genetic counseling, obstetric management and in some cases neonatal surgery. We present a case of epignathus originating from the hard palate in a female child delivered at gestational week 33 by caesarian section due to increasing hydramniosis.","883":"An 80 years old male patient was admitted in our hospital with massive haematomas in the left forearm, chest and abdominal wall accompanied by intense back pain symptoms. Laboratory evaluation showed anemia, mild thrombocytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase levels and normal concentrations of all the other biochemical parameters. Study of the coagulation status demonstrated prolonged thrombin time (TT), low fibrinogen levels--0.98 g\/l while plasminogen, antithrombin III (AT III) and protein C levels were found to be within normal range. Computed tomography scans of the head, chest and abdomen showed an enlarged infiltrative prostate, osteolytic bone lesions in vertebras L5-S1 and a large haematoma of the abdominal wall as the only pathologic findings. Very high levels of the prostate specific antigen indicated the possible existence of a prostate carcinoma with metastases to the vertebral column that resulted in elevated alkaline phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase levels. There were no signs of liver involvement and impaired hepatic synthetic function. Based on the results of the laboratory tests we concluded that the cause of the bleeding disorder in our patient was an acquired hypofibrinogenemia, which is a very rare paraneoplastic phenomenon. The patient was treated with daily transfusions of cryoprecipitate with no long-term improvement. Then the specific anti-tumor therapy (ciproteron acetate) was initiated, and two weeks later, fibrinogen concentration and TT returned to normal values.","884":"Spondylodiscitis is a known and serious complication of spinal surgery. A rare case of a late and remote thoracis spondrylitis due to methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus following cervical surgery is presented. A 50 year-old-male was treated for cervical degenerative disease via a combined anterior and posterior cervical approach (discectomy with fusion and laminectomy). Three years later a cervical epidural abscess was formed which was treated successfully conservatively. After 18 months he developed spondylitis of the second thoracic vertebra. The patient was further treated surgically via a dorsolateral extracavitary thoracic approach. Laboratory analysis revealed Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) spondylitis sensitive to linezolid. Inflammation markers declined and clinical symptoms ameliorated. At 12-month follow-up the patient did not show any evidence of recurrence of the infection. A high rate of suspicion must be maintained in patients presenting with signs of spinal infection and neurological impairment even many years after the initial operation. Optimal investigation and outcome require close clinical monitoring and a well coordinated multidisciplinary approach. ","885":"Childhood obesity represents a rising threat in southern Europe. It is widely accepted that childhood obesity is an important risk factor for the appearance of obesity in adulthood. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of obesity in school aged children living in one of the poorest districts of Europe, as well as to estimate the association between the frequency of obesity observed in these children and their parents. We examined and calculated the body mass index (BMI) in 107 children aged 12.2+\/-0.78 years. BMI was adjusted for age and sex and it was correlated with children parents' weight status. Obesity was diagnosed in 16% of the children. The relationship between children's and their parents weight status was very strong. In 40% of the obese parents, their children were found to be obese also (p&lt;0.001). In the present study a strong relationship between children weight status and their parents' weight status was confirmed. Additionally, this correlation was proven at a district with very low house income. Knowing that it is easier to prevent obesity, rather than to cure it, our aim should be, when a child is brought to the doctor, independently of the cause, to assess both the child as well as its parents' weight status. ","886":"The rate of operative vaginal delivery has remained stable the last decade, however the rate of vacuum has increased against forceps application. Different maternal and neonatal outcomes have been proposed by many reports. The aim of the present study is to compare the short term maternal and neonatal outcomes between vacuum and forceps delivery. We conducted a medical record review of live born singleton, vacuum and forceps-deliveries. Maternal and delivery characteristics were recorded. Maternal and neonatal outcomes were also assessed. Out of 7098 deliveries, 374 were instrument assisted, 324 were conducted by vacuum (86.7%) and 50 by forceps (13.3%). The incidence of 3rd degree lacerations and periurethral hematomas was similar between vacuum and forceps (3.4% vs. 2% and 0.3% vs 0% respectively), while perineal hematomas were more common in forceps compared with vacuum application (2% vs 0.3% respectively), albeit not significantly. The rate of neonates with Apgar scores&lt;or=at 1 min was significantly higher after forceps compared with vacuum delivery (18% vs 5.2% respectively, p=0.0003). The same observation was made concerning the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions (38% vs 11% respectively, p=0.0001). The rate of neonatal trauma and respiratory distress syndrome did not differ significantly between the two groups. Results of the present study indicate that both modes of instrumental vaginal delivery are safe with respect to maternal morbidity and neonatal trauma. However, forceps application increases the risk of neonatal compromise consequently necessitating their admission in the NICU. ","887":"To compare the efficacy of oral and intravenous administration of iron supplements for treating postpartum anemia. One hundred and four anemic postpartum women were studied prospectively. The criteria for the diagnosis of anemia were Hb&lt;8 gr\/dl and ferritine&lt;10 microg\/dl. They were randomised into two groups. Group A consisted of 78 women who received i.v. a total amount of 300 mg iron sucrose in three days. Group B consisted of 26 women, who received orally 800 mg iron proteinsuccinylate daily for four weeks. At the end of the study, in group A the increase of Hb mean level was 4.6 gr\/dl and of ferritin mean level was 105 mg\/L. In group B the increase in hemoglobin mean level was 2.3 gr\/dl and ferritin mean level was 68 mg\/L. There was significant difference in the increase of hemoglobin level (p=0.0001) and also in the increase in ferritin level (p=0.0004) between the two groups. Intravenous administration of iron sucrose seems to be safe and it helps postpartum women to recover early from anemia. ","888":"Popliteal artery entrapment is an uncommon clinical entity that occurs due to compression of the popliteal artery by adjacent muscle and tendinous structures. Early diagnosis should be established through a combined approach of careful physical examination and history-taking, duplex ultrasonography, and CT angiography. We have studied retrospectively 16 patients of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome, 9 men and 7 women. All patients were scanned with a scanner Picker PQ 5000 after bolus injection of nonionic contrast medium and they all underwent a two-part examination first, with the knee in a neutral position, and, second, with the knee hyperextended. At the second phase of the examination 3 patients showed normal findings, 10 patients have shown mild stenosis of the popliteal artery or more severe stenosis due to compression, 2 patients have exhibited bilateral stenosis and 1 patient has also showed popliteal venous compression. CT angiography images and three-dimensional images are useful not only for depiction of the arterial changes but also identification of the abnormal anatomic structures responsible for the entrapment. ","889":"Enzymes play a crucial role in the progression of colorectal cancer and the development of metastases. They facilitate malignant cell invasion through the degradation of the extracellular matrix, the rupture of the basement membrane and the derangement of cell-cell adhesion. Furthermore, they promote tumour cell migration and support the evolution of metastatic lesions in the liver and other organs, through multiple molecular mechanisms, including growth factor release and angiogenesis. Urokinase plasminogen activator system, matrix metalloproteinases, heparanase and autocrine motility factor constitute important enzymatic complexes which assist colorectal cancer growth, with potential clinical applications in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.","890":"Tuberculosis is still a major health problem in industrialized countries due to specific socioeconomic factors and there is the growing need of new rapid and accurate diagnostic methods, in order to achieve higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods of microscopic sputum examination and culture. Such methods, recently introduced, are nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests, used directly on clinical specimens and blood tests (QuantiFERON-TB, T-SPOT.TB test), measuring the IFN-gamma released by stimulated T cells. Furthermore, new drugs for the disease need to be developed, aiming to better treatment results and to prevention of Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR) cases. Critical aspects in the management of drug resistance cases should be the careful choices of drugs combination, the close follow up of the patients alongside with the patients adherence to therapy. The role of national and international tuberculosis programs is invaluable in TB control and therapy, as well as the collaboration of all the health system departments. However, most of the clinical problems that may arise are addressed by the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care-ISTC and these guidelines should be taken into consideration, at least until future research provides more promising diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for control of the disease.","891":"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathologic entity increasingly recognized as a major health burden in developed countries. It includes a spectrum of liver damage ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, and rarely, progression to cirrhosis. Recent studies emphasize the role of insulin resistance, oxidative stress and subsequent lipid peroxidation, proinflammatory cytokines, adipokines and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development and progression of NAFLD. Furthermore, accumulating evidence supports an association between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome. Although the data are mainly epidemiological, the pathogenesis of NAFLD and metabolic syndrome seems to have common pathophysiological mechanisms, with focus on insulin resistance as a key factor. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathophysiology and diagnosis of both NAFLD and metabolic syndrome and the findings that strongly support the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a possible component in the cluster of metabolic syndrome.","892":"Two types of transplants are offered to patients with complicated insulin dependent diabetes mellitus: a) whole pancreas transplantation, b) pancreatic islet transplantation. A total of 29000 whole pancreas transplantations and 1500 islet transplantations have been performed worldwide until today. Patient survival for whole pancreas recipients is 85% five years after transplantation, whereas very few islet studies focus on patient survival. Graft survival for whole pancreas recipients is 90%, 70% and 45%, at one, five and ten years after transplantation respectively. On the other hand, only 44% of islet recipients are still insulin free, one year after engraftment. If the definition of a successful islet transplantation is not insulin independence but production of C-peptide, then 80% of the same islet recipients have a functioning graft by the end of the first post-transplant year. It is a known fact that whole pancreas transplantation has significant complications. The most common complications after whole organ transplantation include technical failures, acute rejection and CMV infection, whereas islet transplantation is associated with portal vein thrombosis, bleeding, emergency exploratory laparotomy, liver steatosis and rapamune-induced mouth ulcers. The cumulative cost of a whole organ transplantation is about ?40,000. On the other hand, the cumulative cost of a pancreatic islet transplant is estimated to be higher than ?120,000. Whole organ transplantation halts the late complications of diabetes, namely vasculopathy, retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy. Although similar claims are made for islet transplantation, its impact on long-term diabetic complications is possible but not proven. Currently, in North America, lean young donors are utilized for whole organ transplants, whereas overweight or older donors are utilized for islet transplants. In conclusion, although islet transplantation is an extremely promising therapy and probably the way of the future, whole organ transplant is still the gold standard according to evidence-based medicine.","893":"We describe a case of a young farmer from Central Macedonia, Greece suffering of a mild back pain more than one year. His medical history included hypercholesterolaemia (IIa type) and two episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax of unknown origin two and three years ago respectively. A full imaging survey revealed a single osteolytic lesion at the seventh thoracic vertebra. A CT guided needle biopsy was performed. Diagnosis based on clinical, imaging and histological findings was monostotic fibrous dysplasia of the thoracic spine. We discuss the clinical features and treatment of this non neoplastic condition which may simulate bone osteolytic tumor. Furthermore a possible correlation of concomitant conditions existing in our patient such as the metabolic disorder of hypercholesterolaemia and especially the history of spontaneous pneumothorax episodes with fibrous dysplasia within the spectrum of connective tissue disorder is discussed.","894":"Alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS) is a rare form of soft tissue sarcoma and is most often seen in adolescents and young adults. Surgical excision of the primary tumor and pulmonary metastases has resulted in prolonged survival in some patients while the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy has been disputed. An 11- year-old boy with ASPS which presented with a markedly vascular tumor in the left thigh, and multiple bilateral pulmonary metastases 8 months after diagnosis is described. The patient has remained disease-free for over 5 years since the initial diagnosis.","895":"Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common problem all over the world, which attacks mainly pregnant women, infants and children. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of IDA in children 12-24 months old in a specific area of Thessalia, located in the central part of Greece, and to identify the environmental risk factors associated with it. In the first part of this cross-sectional and case-control study, the hemoglobin (Hb) levels of 938 children were estimated by a mobile photometer analyzer. In the second part of the study, children with Hb&lt;11 gr\/dl were compared with matched random selected controls in hematological, anthropometric and environmental parameters. The estimated laboratory values were Hb, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, zinc protoporphyrin, serum iron, serum ferritin, transferring saturation, total iron binding capacity and Hb electrophoresis. Finally 75 children (34 boys, 41 girls, mean age 17.51+\/-3.5 months), who were found with IDA, constituted the case group while 75 healthy children constituted the control group. The prevalence of IDA in the region was 7.99%. At the same time, a number of children with stigma of bthalassaemia (2.13%) was discovered, something that had escaped identification. There were no differences due to the method of determination (mobile or laboratory) in the values of Hb between the two groups. Significant differences were recorded (p&lt;0.001) in all hematological and anthropometric parameters except for head circumference. Regarding environmental factors, significant differences were found in the following parameters: ratio rooms\/number of family members (p=0.01), number of family members (p=0.01), number of children in the family (p&lt;0.001), birth rate (p&lt;0.001), education and profession of the parents (p&lt;0.001), source of drinking water and sewage system (p&lt;0.001), duration of breast feeding (p&lt;0.001), milk consumption by the child during the period of the reported research (p&lt;0.001), child's health status according to the mother (p&lt;0.001), and frequency of seeking pediatric care (p=0.02). Although the prevalence of IDA in this area of Greece is similar to the one observed in the rest of the developed world, it still consists a public health problem. The mobile method for Hb estimation should be introduced in Greece since its reliability to detect IDA has been, once more, confirmed. The application of simple questionnaires for the detection of the environmental IDA risk factors could help in the prognosis and prevention of anemia. Further improvement of the IDA status in Greece could be achieved through the dissemination of information about iron rich foods, the amelioration of environmental conditions and the application of reliable, easy to use and cheap methods for Hb estimation. ","896":"The diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis is determined through histological material from biopsy of different parenchymal organs, which have high diagnostic and informative value, but hide a high risk of bleeding because of the accumulation of amyloid in the vessels' wall. The main methods are kidney, liver, gastro-intestinal tract biopsy and aspiration of subcutaneous fatty tissue. The sensitivity of trans-dermal core kidney biopsy (KB) is close to 100%. The rectal biopsy is positive in 73% of cases, the biopsy of bone marrow in bout 50% and the one of gingival mucosa in 40-46 % of cases. The biopsy of subcutaneous fatty tissue (BSFT) is a new, highly sensitive method with sensitivity 73% and specificity 90%, so that it can be used as a screening test in patients without any clinical symptom or organ dysfunction. One hundred fifteen patients, 59 male and 56 female with an average age 49.7+\/-15.93 years were included in the study divided in two groups. The first group consisted of patients with kidney biopsy proved amyloidosis compared to biopsy findings from other parenchymal organs. The second group consisted of patients suspected having amyloidosis who underwent biopsies from various tissues or organs except kidney biopsy because there was contraindication. One hundred fifteen biopsies of subcutaneous fatty tissue (SFT) were performed for the diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. In order to compare the data from the BSFT to the other known and practiced till the moment methods BSFT was performed in 54 patients with proved amyloidosis by KB. In 51\/54 the positive result for amyloid was confirmed. A comparison of the data in a sample of 20 patients, 11 female and 9 male, in 18\/20 patients the result from BSFT is positive (90%). In coloring with Congo red are typed with KMnO4 19\/54 patients, 12 female and 7 male, with average age 48.12 (SD +\/-13.21). In 14\/19 the amyloidosis was typed as AA (74.2%) and 5\/19 non-AA, probably AL (25.8%). To reveal the meaning of so called screening-biopsy of subcutaneous fatty tissue for excluding accompanying amyloidosis in patients with significant proteinuria and\/or uremia, dysglobulinemia, laboratory constellations for nephritic syndrome in immune nephropathies and chronic infections (Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, purulent infections) with contraindications for kidney biopsy 61 screening BSFT were performed, accumulation of amyloid was defined in 37. In all of the patients the result was verified also by biopsies of rectal, gingival and stomach mucosa. The purposeful searching and proving of amyloid in subcutaneous fatty tissue of the abdominal wall is a new, highly sensitive method. The receiving of richer material from SFT in the method \"biopsy\" in stead of \"aspiration\", makes it more reliable for proving amyloid in the case that it exists. The method is enough informative for proving not only amyloidosis AL, but also for amyloidosis AA, in treating with KMnO4. The biopsy of SFT in combination with biopsies from other mucosa can prove the accumulation of amyloid in contraindications for performing KB. ","897":"The purpose of this study was to detect and enumerate T cells secreting type 1 and 2 cytokines in the peripheral blood of patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and in healthy controls. The study group consisted of 80 OLP patients and 80 healthy individuals. Cytokine secreting T cells were detected using ELISPOT assay. There was a statistically significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in the number of IFN- and IL-12 secreting cells in the peripheral blood of patients with OLP compared to the controls. No statistical difference was observed in the number of IL-2 and TNF-a secreting cells between OLP patients and controls (p&gt;0.05). Also there was no significant difference in the numbers of IFN-gamma, IL-12, IL-2 and TNF-a secreting cells between reticular and erosive forms of OLP (p&gt;0.05). As regards type 2 cytokines, the number of IL-5 and IL-10 secreting cells was significantly decreased in OLP patients compared to the healthy control group (p&lt;0.05). No statistical difference was observed in the number of IL-6 secreting cells between OLP patients and control group (p&gt;0.05). Similarly, no statistical difference was observed in the number of IL-4 secreting cells between OLP patients and controls (p&gt;0.05). No significant difference was also found in the numbers of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-6 secreting cells between reticular and erosive OLP group. These data suggest decreased type 1 and type 2 cytokine production (except IL-4) in OLP patients. ","898":"Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) has been recognized as an entity, affecting cardiovascular, pulmonary, and cerebral function, while it is often complicated with sepsis. Goal of the study was the evaluation of brain oxygenation during ACS alone and in combination with endotoxinemia. Sixteen pigs, undergone intra-abdominal hypertension, were allocated to receive intravenous administration of either saline or endotoxin. Pigs were evaluated regarding brain tissue oxygenation (PbrO2), systemic oxygenation (PaO2) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Statistical analysis revealed significant reduction of PbrO2 over time for sepsis group, after endotoxin administration. Regarding differences between groups, sepsis group experienced lower PbrO2 values, compared to saline group, only after endotoxin administration. Both groups experienced reduction in arterial oxygenation, with greater pertubations seen after sepsis induction. Regarding rCBF, septic pigs showed greater flow values, while ACS alone did not influence rCBF. ACS has no deleterious effects in cerebral oxygenation and flow, provided systemic oxygenation and CPP are maintained above normal value. Combined sepsis-ACS lead to perturbations in cerebral oxygenation, in conjunction with greater rCBF values. The latter could be ascribed to abnormalities in oxygen extraction. ","899":"Microalbuminuria was originally established as a predictor of renal failure and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus as well as in general population. The aim of our study is to assess the relationship between microalbuminuria and the other risk factors in diabetics and their prevalence. Sixty five patients, 22 men and 43 women with mean age 58.6+\/-10.09, with type 2 diabetes, were hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine in the University Hospital Center \"Mother Teresa\" in Tirana, Albania, between March 2007 and February 2008. These patients with a mean duration of diabetes 6.09+\/-5.41 were divided in two groups: with (Group A: 24 patients) and without (Group B: 41 patients) microalbuminuria and each group was evaluated for left ventricular mass index (LVMI), body mass index (BMI), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), lipid profile and intima media thickness (IMT). The prevalence of microalbuminuria in our study was 32.3%. The prevalence of microalbuminuria in males was 37.5 and in females 62.5%. The microalbuminuric patients were older ( 59.71+\/-9.87 vs 57.07+\/-10.32) and had a longer duration of diabetes (7.74+\/-5.74 vs 4.45+\/-5.08) compared with normoalbuminuric patients (p=0.01). The Group A had significantly higher LVMI compared with Group B ( p=0.02). The prevalence of obesity (BMI&gt;30 kg\/m2) in our sample was 44.6%. In Group A the mean BMI (30.13+\/-4.98) was significantly higher compared with Group B (28.00+\/-3.72, p=0.04). Diabetic retinopathy was more frequent in Group A compared with Group B ( 33.3% vs 14.6%, p=0.05). The mean value of IMT was higher in Group A compared with Group B (1.28+\/-0.35 vs 1.09+\/-0.28, p=0.03). In patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria LVMI, IMT, BMI, duration of diabetes was significantly higher compared with patients with type 2 diabetes and normoalbuminuria. ","900":"In recent years patients with respiratory diseases use various devices, which help the removal of mucus from the airways and the improvement of pulmonary function. The aim of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of the current devices of respiratory physiotherapy, as it comes from the review of literature. The current devices of physiotherapy for patients with respiratory diseases, are presented as an alternative therapy method or a supplemental therapy and they can motivate patients to apply therapy by themselves. These devices seem to increase patients' compliance to daily treatment, because they present many benefits, as independent application, full control of therapy and easy use. These devices are the Positive Expiratory Pressure, the High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation, the Oral High Frequency Oscillation, the Intrapulmonary Percussive Ventilation, the Incentive Spirometry the Flutter and the Acapella and the Cornet. Current devices seem to be effective in terms of mucus expectoration and pulmonary function improvement, as it is shown by published studies. The choice of the suitable device for each patient is a challenge for the physiotherapist in order to achieve better compliance in daily treatment. More controlled studies are needed due to the fact that the number of published studies is limited.","901":"The members of the S100 protein family are multifunctional proteins with a regulatory role in a variety of cellular processes. They exert their actions usually through calcium binding, although Zn2+ and Cu2+ have also been shown to regulate their biological activity. The most studied member, protein S100B, exhibits neurotrophic (at physiologic concentration) or neurotoxic (at higher concentration) activity and its immunohistochemical expression or serum levels have been determined in various clinical disorders. S100B has been well documented as a marker of astrocytic activation mediating its effects via interaction with receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). We herein provide a wide range of information concerning their clinical application in traumatic brain injuries, Alzheimer disease, subarachnoid haemorrhage and other neurologic disorders, malignant melanoma and several other neoplasms (as S100B has been shown to down-regulate p53), as well as inflammatory diseases. Also its use on predicting neurologic outcome after resuscitation for cardiac arrest or in intrauterine growth retardation newborns is discussed.","902":"Inflight medical emergencies occur at a rate of 20 to 100 per million passengers, with a death rate of 0.1 to 1 per million. Cardiac, neurologic, and respiratory complaints comprise the more serious emergencies, as defined by aircraft diversion or use of ground-based medical assistance. In this paper, we review changes seen in the resting electrocardiogram in normal individuals exposed to high altitude, alongside important implications for patients with heart diseases in high altitude exposures and the possible effects of high altitude to permanent cardiac pacemakers. Arrhythmias in pilots and public safety are revisited together with the guidelines of the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) in Europe. The situation of Military flights is also discussed. Physicians ought to become knowledgeable about the specific medical job standards for their patients when asked to render opinions regarding fitness to fly. A database must be established to obtain prospective data that defines the risk of accidents in patients who are or were being treated for arrhythmias. Current guidelines could then be updated and revised as appropriate.","903":"The traditional scientific approach of investigating the role of a variable on a living organism is to remove it or the ability of the organism to sense it. Gravity is no exception. Access to space has made it possible for us to begin the exploration of how gravity has influenced our evolution, our genetic make-up and our physiology. Identifying the thresholds at which each body system perceives, how much, how often, how long the gravity stimulus is needed and in which direction should it be presented for maximum effectiveness, is fundamental knowledge required for using artificial gravity as a therapeutic or maintenance countermeasure treatment in exploration missions. Here on earth, although surrounded by gravity we are negligent in using gravity as it was intended, to maintain the level of health that is appropriate to living in 1G. These, changes in lifestyle or pathologies caused by various types of injury can benefit as well from artificial gravity in much the same way as we are now considering for astronauts in space.","904":"For long term habitation in space and for living on Moon and Mars, many questions still need to be resolved. Such habitation questions include prevention of and rehabilitation from negative effects of weightlessness that are, in many instances, comparable to problems of aging people on Earth as well as of patients during and recovery from long term stays in bed. Therefore the DLR Institute of Aerospace Medicine has designed a concept for a research facility that will make it possible to join space research directly with terrestrial applications. From a strategic point of view, one major emphasis of :envihab is to form a closely interrelated network of scientists and the industry and the public. The project has been in the planning phase for several years. After an international architectural contest, the winning concept was selected in 2007 by a Jury with ESA participation.","905":"Thousands of people work and perform everyday in high altitude environment, either as pilots, or shift workers, or mountaineers.The problem is that most of the accidents in this environment have been attributed to human error. The objective of this study was to assess complex cognitive performance as it interacts with respiratory insufficiency at altitudes of 8000 feet and identify the potential effect of hypoxia on safe performance. Twenty subjects participated in the study, divided in two groups: Group I with mild asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and Group II with normal respiratory function. Altitude was simulated at 8000 ft. using gas mixtures. Individuals with mild COPD experienced notable hypoxemia with significant performance decrements and increased number of errors at cabin altitude, compared to normal subjects, whereas their blood pressure significantly increased. ","906":"Human factors centered aviation accident analyses report that skill based errors are known to be cause of 80% of all accidents, decision making related errors 30% and perceptual errors 6%1. In-flight decision making error is a long time recognized major avenue leading to incidents and accidents. Through the past three decades, tremendous and costly efforts have been developed to attempt to clarify causation, roles and responsibility as well as to elaborate various preventative and curative countermeasures blending state of the art biomedical, technological advances and psychophysiological training strategies. In-flight related statistics have not been shown significantly changed and a significant number of issues remain not yet resolved. Fine Postural System and its corollary, Postural Deficiency Syndrome (PDS), both defined in the 1980's, are respectively neurophysiological and medical diagnostic models that reflect central neural sensory-motor and cognitive controls regulatory status. They are successfully used in complex neurotraumatology and related rehabilitation for over two decades. Analysis of clinical data taken over a ten-year period from acute and chronic post-traumatic PDS patients shows a strong correlation between symptoms commonly exhibited before, along side, or even after error, and sensory-motor or PDS related symptoms. Examples are given on how PDS related central sensory-motor control dysfunction can be correctly identified and monitored via a neurophysiological ocular-vestibular-postural monitoring system. The data presented provides strong evidence that a specific biomedical assessment methodology can lead to a better understanding of in-flight adaptive neurophysiological, cognitive and perceptual dysfunctional status that could induce in flight-errors. How relevant human factors can be identified and leveraged to maintain optimal performance will be addressed.","907":"The past years saw a transition of competencies from the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) to the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which was founded in 2003, based on EU Regulation 1592\/02. EASA started its work in the fields of Airworthiness and will soon its competencies inter alia to Flight Operations and Flight Crew Licensing, the latter including the requirements for aeromedical assessment. The appropriate new EU Regulation will most probably be published in April. It includes the Essential Requirements for Licensing and aeromedical certification. A proposal for a new Commission Regulation promulgates the Implementing Rules for Personnel Licensing, detailing--inter alia--the Medical Requirements (Annex II to the Regulation). The specific rules, numeric standards are published as Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM). The provisions are based on JAR-FCL 3 and have been transposed to the format choosen by EASA by a small working group of aeromedical experts (FCL.001). Comments received by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) prompted the agencys statement that the JAR-FCL 3 requirements for private pilots were excessive and too demanding and that a better regulation in General Aviation had to be developed. Another working group (MDM.032), including one aeromedical specialist, was tasked to draft a set of lighter requirements for non-complex aircraft used in non-commercial operations. In this context a much lighter form of aeromedical assessment - involving self-declaration by the pilot and general practitioners as asessors - has been proposed.","908":"European aviation is moving into an exciting phase now, the administrative structure is changing. Aviation rules and aviation medicine will get a new structure as well. The nature of air traffic required an international scope in rulemaking--especially in such a confined continent as Europe with 41 countries, about 380 Million inhabitants and 317 billion person kilometres flown each year. For economic reasons it became necessary to develop common standards for certification of aircraft in the beginning of the 1970ies, maintenance followed later on. The Cyprus arrangement of 01 July 1990 created the JAA (Joint Aviation Authorities). Joint Aviation Requirements were drafted to replace existing national provisions and have been implemented from the end of the 1990s. The areas of air operations and pilot licensing have been covered as well. The latter comprises of aviation medicine as well. The implementation of JAR-FCL 3, which covers the medical requirements for pilots, started from 1999 on in the several JAA member states. A detailed overview about development and structure of JAA, tools for harmonisation, rulemaking and amendment of requirements, medical standards, review procedures for contentious or marginal cases is described. Shortcomings were the fact that implementation was left to the discretion of the member states and that JAA had no executive power. This resulted in differences in safety and the EU commission concluded that aviation safety had to be regulated by the EU commission. After adoption of EU regulation 1592\/2002 in 2002 common and binding requirements were to be drafted and a European aviation agency to be founded. EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) started its work in September 2003. Finally it will take over the role of JAA completely. Whereas Certification and Maintenance were in the focus first, Flight Operations and Licensing are going to be covered as well in the near future. Essential Requirements have been drafted, outlining - inter alia - the scope of Licensing and of aeromedical aspects. However, the legislative process will most probably last at least until the end of 2007. Implementing Rules - being based on existing JAR-FCLs will be drafted soon and are going to be implemented as soon as EASA is operative for Licensing. JAR-FCL 3 will be the basis for the Implementing Rules concerning aeromedical fitness. An overview about the structure of the Agency, rulemaking procedures, philosophy of medical provisions and the transition from JAA to EASA is described.","909":"To evaluate the clinical and audiometric characteristics of noise by an one-engine Cessna (1300-1750 RPM), by ultra light aircrafts and different types of air modeling products which induce hearing loss in air modeling members of Aviation club of Larissa in Greece. During the past 2 years members in the aviation club were referred for clinical and audiological examination in the ENT Department of hearing and speech and underwent a personal interview with a specific questionnaire. No one of the examined members was using individual protection systems during aviation activities. From all members examined, a 30% had an audiogram with a slope in high frequencies, not attributed to presbyacousis and had experienced at least one symptom associated with hearing disturbance. Air modeling members in aviation club that are exposed to noise during aviation activities without protection are at high risk of noise induced hearing loss. ","910":"After the realization of the International Space Station, human exploratory missions to Moon or Mars, i.e. beyond low Earth orbit, are widely considered as the next logical step of peaceful cooperation in space on a global scale. Besides the human desire to extend the window of habitability, human exploratory missions are driven by several aspects of science, technology, culture and economy. Mars is currently considered as a major target in the search for life beyond the Earth. Understanding the history of water on Mars appears to be one of the clues to the puzzle on the probability of life on Mars. On Earth microorganisms have flourished for more than 3.5 Ga and have developed strategies to cope with so-called extreme conditions (e.g., hot vents, permafrost, subsurface regions, rocks or salt crystals). Therefore, in search for life on Mars, microorganisms are the most likely candidates for a putative biota on Mars and the search for morphological or chemical signatures of life or its relics is one of the primary and most exciting goals of Mars exploration. The presence of humans on the surface of Mars will substantially increase this research potential, e.g., by supporting deep subsurface drilling and by allowing intellectual collection and sophisticated in situ analysis of samples of astrobiological interest. On the other hand, such long-duration missions beyond LEO will add a new dimension to human space flight, concerning the distance of travel, the radiation environment, the gravity levels, the duration of the mission, and the level of confinement and isolation the crew will be exposed to. This will raise the significance of several health issues, above all radiation protection, gravity related effects as well as psychological issues. Furthermore, the import of internal and external microorganisms inevitably accompanying any human mission to Mars, or brought purposely to Mars as part of a bioregenerative life support system needs careful consideration with regard to planetary protection issues. Therefore, before planning any human exploratory mission, the critical issues concerning human health and wellbeing as well as protection of Mars in its pristine condition need to be investigated.","911":"Severe and prolonged unmitigated SAS and SMS related symptoms have been thoroughly described in Astronauts during adaptation periods for orbital flight and post orbital flight. It has recently been shown that there is a strong correlation between these symptoms most often suffered by astronauts to that of the symptoms of patients suffering from Postural Deficiency Syndrome (PDS) on Earth that have been successfully assessed, diagnosed and treated. International peer-reviewed literature identifies PDS as a trauma induced medical condition which originates from central neural dysregulation of sensory-motor and cognitive controls; these dysfunctions can be accurately identified, measured, and monitored via a specific ocular-vestibular-postural monitoring system along with relevant clinical data. This higher level of understanding is necessary in order to reach the next stage of success for humans living and working in Space. Central sensory-motor and cognitive controls dysfunction underlie symptoms that can adversely impact and reflect alteration of eye-hand coordination, fine tuned dexterity, body positioning in space, space projection and trajectory control, perception of environment\/obstacles, orientation in space and time, sensory motor and cognitive aspects of decision making, sensory-motor\/cognitive error proneness. All of these factors are necessary for Astronaut's mission capabilities, while both carrying out operations in Space and performing the tasks required during and after re-entry. The objective of this paper is to elucidate how PDS related medical conditions are currently assessed, identified and monitored, and how these methodologies and technologies translate into a potential for better understanding of astronauts' potential incapacitation during space flight operations.","912":"In a recent review on bed rest studies of the past 20 years, it was concluded that head-down bed rest has proved its usefulness as a reliable simulation model for most physiological effects of spaceflight. Much of this research has been conducted to find countermeasures against the negative effects, which are associated with gravitational unloading. There have been partial successes in the prevention of, for example muscle wasting, cardio-vascular deconditioning, adverse metabolic changes, and bone demineralization. Reviews refer to bone-related measurements of the U.S. and Russian space programmes, as well as data from bed rest analogues, and conclude that in spite of the wealth of knowledge obtained thus far, many questions remain regarding bone loss, bone recovery, and the factors affecting these skeletal processes. Bed rest research has also direct relevance for medical science on Earth. Valuable data on physiology and early reversible pathological changes that are associated with a sedentary lifestyle on Earth can be obtained. A good example is the conclusion from a metabolic protocol implemented during the 2001\/2002 90-day ESA\/CNES\/NASDA male bed rest study. The results of that experiment on fatty acid oxidation suggest that Mediterranean diets should be recommended in recumbent patients. Some other unexpected results obtained during the ESA\/NASA\/CNES\/CSA 60-day female bed rest study WISE-2005 may well prompt the development of a treatment for certain cardiac diseases. A nutritional supplement that was designed to alleviate skeletal muscle atrophy turned out to preserve cardiac muscle mass. In order to optimise bed rest research, a systematic and standardised approach will be beneficial. During the last years, serious efforts have been made towards such standardisation on an international level. It is expected that results from future studies, combined with in-flight validation, will provide the answers to many biomedical problems that currently limit safe long-duration human space exploration beyond lower earth orbit.","913":"The recent engagement of Brazil in the construction and utilization of the International Space Station has motivated several Brazilian research institutions and universities to establish study centers related to Space Sciences. The Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) is no exception. The University initiated in 1993 the first degree course training students to operate commercial aircraft in South America (the School of Aeronautical Sciences. A further step was the decision to build the first Brazilian laboratory dedicated to the conduct of experiments in ground-based microgravity simulation. Established in 1998, the Microgravity Laboratory, which was located in the Instituto de Pesquisas Cientificas e Tecnologicas (IPCT), was supported by the Schools of Medicine, Aeronautical Sciences and Electrical Engineering\/Biomedical Engineering. At the end of 2006, the Microgravity Laboratory became a Center and was transferred to the School of Engineering. The principal activities of the Microgravity Centre are the development of research projects related to human physiology before, during and after ground-based microgravity simulation and parabolic flights, to aviation medicine in the 21st century and to aerospace biomedical engineering. The history of Brazilian, and why not say worldwide, space science should unquestionably go through PUCRS. As time passes, the pioneering spirit of our University in the aerospace area has become undeniable. This is due to the group of professionals, students, technicians and staff in general that have once worked or are still working in the Center of Microgravity, a group of faculty and students that excel in their undeniable technical-scientific qualifications. ","914":"Currently, paper-based and\/or electronic together with telecommunications links to Earth-based physicians are used to assist astronaut crews perform diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions during space travel. However, these have limitations, especially during long duration missions in which telecommunications to earth-based physicians can be delayed. We describe an experimental technology called GuideView in which clinical guidelines are presented in a structured, interactive, multi-modal format and, in each step, clinical instructions are provided simultaneously in voice, text, pictures video or animations. An example application of the system to diagnosis and treatment of space Decompression Sickness is presented. Astronauts performing space walks from the International Space Station are at risk for decompression sickness because the atmospheric pressure of the Extra-vehicular Activity space- suit is significantly less that that of the interior of the Station.","915":"The appeal of online education and distance learning as an educational alternative is ever increasing. To support and accommodate the over-specialized knowledge available by different experts, information technology can be employed to develop virtual distributed pools of autonomous specialized educational modules and provide the mechanisms for retrieving and sharing them. New educational standards such as SCORM and Healthcare LOM enhance this process of sharing by offering qualities like interoperability, accessibility, and reusability, so that learning material remains credible, up-to-date and tracks changes and developments of medical techniques and standards through time. Given that only a few e-learning courses exist in aerospace medicine the material of which may be exchanged among teachers, the aim of this paper is to illustrate the procedure of creating a SCORM compliant course that incorporates notions of recent advances in social web technologies. The course is in accordance with main educational and technological details and is specific to pulmonary disorders in aerospace medicine. As new educational trends place much emphasis in continuing medical education, the expansion of a general practitioner's knowledge in topics such as aviation and aerospace pulmonary disorders for crew and passengers becomes a societal requirement.","916":"Biomedical signal monitoring can counteract the risk of human operator error due to inattention or fatigue in safetycritical and restrictive environments, such as in aviation, space, automobile and heavy industrial machinery operation. Real-time biomedical data acquisition is changing through advances in microelectronics fabrication, bio-MEMS and power micro-generators. Such data acquisition and processing systems are becoming increasingly miniaturised, flexible and pervasive, while data is being collected from inside the human body as well as around it. In this paper we review two related research projects exploiting this technological convergence, discuss its implications and suggest future innovation prospects through further similar cross-disciplinary synergies.","917":"\"Man must rise above Earth to the top of the atmosphere and beyond, for only then will he fully understand the world in which he lives\"-Socrates (469-399 BC). The basic driving rationales for human space flight (HSF) are rooted in age-old and persisting dreams. Fascination with the idea of people going into the sky for adventures in other worlds goes back to ancient myths. This paper sheds light onto criticisms of HSF programs, by revisiting their scientific grounds and associated benefits, along with the different types of emerging commercial enterprise. Research from space has lead to a wealth of commercial and societal applications on Earth, building up the case for the so-called \"Space Applications Market\".","918":"","919":"High-pressure injection injuries are rare injuries, characterized by a small puncture wound that is often underestimated by physicians and patients. The injected substance leads to extensive tissue damage and sometimes to loss of the limb. To underline the severity of these injuries and to alert physicians to recognize them and treat them appropriately. Eight patients with injection injuries from lubricants (6) or solvents (2) were treated in a University Orthopaedic Department in a 5-year period. In all patients the mild initial symptoms were aggravated over the next 4-6 hours leading to a severe compartment syndrome of the hand. Five patients were referred with a mean delay of 3.8 days and 3 were treated immediately; all with debridement and compartment release. The total number of procedures per patient was 2 to 5. In 3 patients a heterodigital flap was necessary whereas in one the second ray was amputated. Results were excellent in 5 cases and good in 3. In injection injuries, prompt diagnosis and immediate aggressive surgical intervention are necessary to save the patients' digit\/limb. Patients should be informed about the severity of their injury, its potential complications and the multiple surgical procedures that may be required for a satisfactory functional result. ","920":"The interaction between chronic heart failure, chronic kidney insufficiency and anemia, form a vicious cycle, termed as the cardio-renal anemia syndrome. The interaction between these three conditions causes deterioration of the cardiac and renal function and increases anemia. Each of the three can cause or be caused by the others.We herein analyze and speculate the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of this new syndrome highlighting the main points of interest that seem to expand upon more than one specialty. The cardio-renal anemia syndrome is emerging in the area of clinical investigation with progressively elevated significance. Additionaly we report the data related to anemia treatment as part of therapeutic perspective concerning the management of patients manifesting the profile of this syndrome.","921":"Zygomycosis is an invasive mycotic disease caused by fungi of the class Zygomycetes. Infections caused by zygomycetes, are known for their difficulty of diagnosis and treatment. Cunninghamella bertholletiae (Cb), is a saprobic fungus commonly found in the soil of temperate climates. Pulmonary infections caused by Cb are being identified with increasing frequency among patients on immunosuppressive therapy, and these infections usually have a fatal outcome. We present a rare case of pulmonary zygomycosis caused by Cb in a 10 year old male child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In spite of intensive antifungal chemotherapy (iv liposomal amphotericin B 7 mg\/Kg once daily) following clinical diagnosis, he died of pulmonary failure.","922":"The results of Primary Prevention programs, aiming at the decrease of melanoma incidence, were less encouraging than those of Secondary prevention which aims at an early diagnosis of malignant melanoma. Australia was the country with the best results obtained in both Prevention strategies, especially in avoiding intense, though intermittent, UV exposure. The success of these programs encouraged health authorities to initiate their application to other disorders. New sunscreens containing substances correcting the UV-damaged DNA may offer a promising result in the decades to come. However, so far no one epidemiological study has proved the prevention of malignant melanoma with the use of sun protecting agents. A meta-analysis verified the connection between melanoma and solarium use. The protective role of vitamin D in the development of prostate, breast and colon cancer was shown in a meta-analysis. The authors, however, suggest that fair-skinned persons should take oral supplementation of vitamin D, instead of exposing themselves to the sun. The Hellenic Society of Dermatology and Venereology published the results of 5-year-prevention programs in Greece. Their favorable results in the early diagnosis of melanoma justify an intense continuation of these efforts.","923":"We report a case of an isolated double gastric rupture, resulted from blunt abdominal trauma, that we successfully repaired by primary closure. A 18-month-old girl injured in a motor vehicle accident was admitted to our hospital where the plain X-ray and the CT findings revealed the presence of free abdominal air. An immediate performed exploratory laparotomy disclosed two full-thickness ruptures of the stomach (on the greater curvature and the posterior wall). The ruptures were closed primarily by a two-layer closure. Twenty-four hours post-operatively the patient developed delayed shock as a result of chemical peritonitis. On the 8th postoperative day the girl developed septic shock and gastrorrhagia. She underwent a gastroscopy which revealed stress-ulcer, and was treated conservatively in the children intensive care unit of our hospital. She was discharged home on 20th postoperative day. At 3-month follow up, she was doing well with normal growth and eating a regular regimen about her age. Gastric rupture following blunt abdominal trauma is rare, with a reported incidence of 0.02-1.7%. The morbidity and mortality are directly related to the number of associated injuries, the delay in diagnosis and the development of intraabdominal sepsis. In this paper we emphasise the need for early diagnosis and the aggressive surgical treatment as a key to decreasing the mortality and morbidity from this relatively rare injury, especially in this age group of children.","924":"The choice of optimal revascularization strategy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is becoming more challenging lately, due to recent advances in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). On one hand, drug-eluting stents (DES) have emerged as a solution to the problem of restenosis after balloon angioplasty or bare-metal stent implantation, which was responsible for a higher rate of events (mainly repeat revascularization) in relation to CABG. On the other hand, off-pump bypass techniques and minimally invasive grafting of the left anterior descending artery appear to be safe and efficacious alternatives to traditional, on-pump CABG. Available literature includes studies outdated by current technologies, leaving the dilemma of best revascularization strategy unanswered in the general CAD population, but also in high-risk groups, such as diabetics and patients with chronic kidney disease. A number of ongoing trials, especially designed for this purpose, are set to end the debate, providing headto- head comparisons between DES-assisted PCI and contemporary bypass surgery.","925":"Nowadays maternal age of pregnant women has increased in most developed countries. The rate of women above 35 years old constitutes about 15% of pregnancies. The aim of our study is to prove that by first trimester screening, the number of women who have indication for invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure is significantly reduced. This prospective study lasted two years from 02\/2005 to 02\/2007. The participants to our study were 531 pregnant women with a mean maternal age of 30 years (19-42). We used the first trimester screening test for Down's syndrome. The biochemical blood test of free b-hCG (beta human chorionic gonadotropin) and PAPP-A (pregnancy associated plasma protein A) and the measurement of nuchal translucency were performed between 11-13 weeks +6 days (mean gestational age 12 weeks +2 days). In our study group, 69 women (12%) were 35 years old or more. The risk estimate for Down syndrome was 1 in 300 or more in 14 (2%) cases. In all these 14 cases we offered CVS (chorionic villus sampling) or amniocentesis. It is a fact that although the risk of any individual 36 years old is higher, most abnormalities (approximately 70%) occur in the low risk population. With the first trimester screening the sensitivity of detecting DOWN syndrome reaches 90%. Our study confirms that by first trimester screening, the number of women who have indication for invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure is significantly reduced. As a result the cost for prenatal diagnosis of the population and also the risk of iatrogenic missed miscarriages is also reduced. Finally, this screening method gives the advantage of early diagnosis. ","926":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of CT guided adrenal biopsy in patients with equivocal MR chemical shift imaging findings. Fifty seven patients, 32 with history of malignancy and 25 without history of malignancy, 30 men and 27 women (33-82 years, mean age:58.8 years), with equivocal findings in chemical shift MR imaging, were subjected to CT guided percutaneous adrenal biopsy. From the 57 lesions that were sent for histopathological evaluation, 31 proved to be metastases (54.4%), 20 adenomas (35.1%), 3 cortical carcinomas (5.3%), 1 benign pheochromocytoma (1.8%) and 2 samples were non diagnostic(3.5%). In oncology patients metastases were found in 28\/32 of the patients (87.5%) and adenomas in 3\/32 (9.4%), while in patients without history of malignancy, metastases were found in 3\/25 of the patients (12%) and adenomas in 17\/25 (68%). CT guided percutaneous adrenal biopsy is a safe and accurate method for a definite diagnosis of adrenal lesions. Since most adrenal lesions are benign, dedicated adrenal imaging is necessary for choosing which of them have to be further evaluated by biopsy. Chemical shift adrenal imaging alone seems to be a reliable method and can be used alternatively to CT enhancement washout technique for selecting which lesions are suspicious of malignancy and have to be investigated with biopsy, especially in cases where iodine contrast media is contraindicated. ","927":"Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal failure. Chronic renal failure is associated with insulin resistance and, in advanced renal failure, decreased insulin degradation. Both of these abnormalities are partially reversed with the institution of dialysis. Except for diet with protein restriction, patients with diabetes should be preferably treated with insulin. The management of the patients with hyperglycemia and chronic renal failure calls for close collaboration between the diabetologist and the nephrologists. This collaboration is very important so that the patient will not be confused and will not lose confidence to the doctors. Furthermore good glycemic control in these patients seems to reduce microvascular and macrovascular complications.","928":"Clinical manifestations of Q fever infection are fever, productive cough, decrease in exercise tolerance and chills. Cardiovascular involvement is well recognized and usually presents as endocarditis and infection of an aneurysm or vascular graft. Myocarditis has only rarely been described as a manifestation of acute Q fever infection. In this report we describe a case of a young adult who presented with angina-like symptoms and ECG and biochemical markers indicative of acute coronary syndrome. The diagnosis of myocarditis was ultimately made based on the results of a normal coronary angiography and increased anti-Coxiella burnetii antibody titer. The patient has not developed dilated cardiomyopathy after two years of follow up.","929":"Brain arachnoid cysts are fluid collections of developmental origin. They are commonly detected incidentally in patients imaged for unrelated symptoms. A 15-year-old healthy boy with a recent history of head trauma experienced headache that gradually worsened over the course of 10 days. He underwent CT and MRI brain scans which revealed the presence of subdural haematoma caused by the rupture of a middle cranial fossa arachnoid cyst. This was accompanied by intracystic haemorrhage. The subdural haematoma was removed, while communication of the cyst with the basal cisterns was also performed. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful. The annual haemorrhage risk for the patients with middle cranial fossa cysts remains very low. However, when haemorrhage occurs, in most occasions it can be effectively managed only with haematoma evacuation. ","930":"In this paper we present a model to evaluate the effect of certain majors socioeconomic factors (such as alcohol and fat consumption, cigarettes smoking, unemployment rate as a proxy for uncertainty which results frustration, number of passenger cars as a proxy for physical exercise and per capita GDP as a proxy for nutrition quality), to the ischemic mortality rate. Since the existing research works on this field, suffer from the proper model testing, we analytically present all the tests necessary to justify the reliability of the result obtained. For this purpose, after specifying and estimating the model, we applied the specification error test, the linearity, multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity tests, the autocorrelation and stability tests and the ARCH effect test. Finally, we present the aggregate effect of the above socioeconomic factors. In brief, we found that an increase of cigarettes smoked, of fat and alcohol consumption and the number of passenger cars will result to a relevant increase regarding mortality. The latter one is also affected by the changes in unemployment rate. On the other hand, an increase of personal disposable income may negatively affect mortality, by almost the same portion.","931":null,"932":"A 43 year old female patient presented for recurrent bacterial lower respiratory infections. A research for immunodeficiency status revealed total hypogammaglobulinemia, reduced IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 subclass levels, and low number of B lymphocytes (CD19+). Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) 11.2 category was diagnosed according to recent criteria of primary immunodeficiencies (PID). Further immunological study consisting of genetic polymorphism of genes relating to differentiation, activation and function of B cells (ICOS, BAFF receptor BCMA and TACI) was performed, which did not reveal any related mutations. T cell parameters and Th1\/Th2 cytokine network did not show any disturbances. It is postulated that probable endstage B cell differentiation defects should be investigated. The patient receives IVIGs replacement thereafter and the rate and severity of infections have significantly improved.","933":"Hemodialysis (HD) patients are exposed to persistent inflammatory state. Erythropoietin resistance is known to be strongly associated with chronic inflammation. Aim of the study was to analyze the effect of elevated inflammatory markers on hemoglobin levels and rhEPO requirements in stable patients of our hemodialysis center. The study population consisted of 42 patients, 19F\/23M, mean age 54.5+\/-12.0 years. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), hemoglobin (Hb), ferritin and left ventricular mass index (LVMi) were recorded. Group 1 consisted of 10 patients with Hb&lt;or=10 g\/dl, mean 8.3+\/-1.2 g\/dl and Group 2, of 10 patients with Hb&gt;or=10 g\/dl, mean 12.6+\/-1.91 g\/dl. None of these 20 patients had been previously treated with rhEPO. Group 3 consisted of 22 patients with mean Hb 10.1+\/-1.5 g\/dl after treatment with rhEPO. Group 1 patients had significantly higher IL-6 concentrations than Group 2 (5.21+\/-3.94 vs 3.03+\/-3.64, p&lt;0.03). Group 3, treated with rhEPO had IL-6 concentrations significantly lower compared to Group 1 (1.15+\/-3.81 vs 3.03+\/-3.64, p&lt;0.05). HD pts in Group 1 presented significantly higher CRP concentrations compated to pts of Group 2 and 3 (23.1+\/-9.1 vs 7.02+\/-8.7 and 7.89+\/-9.6 respectively, p&lt;0.05). A negative correlation was demonstrated between IL-6 and Hb level (r: 0.33 p&lt;0.05). A better management of anemia might improve inflammatory state and survival in this population. ","934":"Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the developed world, due to formation of distant metastases. The liver is a primary target organ of metastatic lesions, which substantially influence the morbidity of the disease. Prompt diagnosis of colorectal liver metastases leads to early treatment, which favours a better prognosis. Consequently, the diagnostic process has shifted from traditional clinical and biochemical procedures to technologically advanced imaging modalities, such as CT, MRI, FDG-PET and PET-CT. However, the only current curative therapeutic approach is the surgical resection of metastases, using the new methods of tissue excision and haemostasis. New therapeutic modalities like cryo- or radiofrequency ablation and portal vein embolisation as well as pharmaceutical innovations such as hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy, isolated hepatic perfusion and contemporary chemotherapeutic regimens have emerged. While still under evaluation, they present promise for the future treatment of unresectable liver metastases.","935":"The association of ovarian malignancy with dermatomyositis (DM) is well established from previous reports, while the relationship with polymyositis (PM) is rare. We report a case of a 50 years old nulliparous woman who developed clear cell ovarian cancer four years after the PM diagnosis. The patient presented with deep lower abdominal pain and distension. CA-125 was elevated and the preoperative MRI showed pelvic tumor occupying the Douglas pouch. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a gross mass of clear cell ovarian carcinoma. Physicians must be alert of the possibility of malignancy in patients with a previous diagnosis of polymyositis. ","936":"","937":"The aim of this study was, a) to investigate the effect of mild oxidative stress on glycolytic flux and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) binding in erythrocytes from patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and b) to examine whether the modulation of GAPDH-binding to the red cell membrane leads to changes in glycolytic flux. The rate of lactate production in intact erythrocytes and the GAPDH\/actin ratio in erythrocyte ghost membranes were measured before and after treating cells with t-butyl hydroperoxide or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in 13 ADPKD patients and 12 controls. t-bytyl hydro-peroxide had a significant effect on both lactate production and GAPDH\/actin ratio in healthy subjects, but it had essentially no effect on ADPKD patients in which both parameters already resembled those of the peroxide-treated controls. NEM treatment after 300 sec had a very significant effect on both lactate production and GAPDH\/actin ratio in both patient and control cells. However, after 10 sec the effect on GAPDH\/actin ratio was only significant in the erythrocytes of ADPKD patients. In every experiment glycolytic lactate production correlated negatively with membrane-bound GAPDH\/actin ratio. We conclude that glycolytic flux and GAPDH binding in erythrocytes from ADPKD patients respond abnormally to both a mild oxidative stress and brief exposure to NEM. ","938":"It has been reported that racial and ethnic (genetic make up), as well as socioeconomic differences may affect the results of kidney transplantation. Socioeconomic factors are quite difficult to differentiate from genetic factors. It is not surprising that a group with poorer access to health care, less private insurance and less income does less well with serious medical problems. The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of kidney transplantations in Greek (G) and Albanian (A) patients. Twenty nine transplanted patients of Albanian ancestry were matched with 29 Greek patients retrospectively. Their mean age was 34 (G) and 31 (A) years, there were 21 men and 8 women in each group (G, A) and they received 26 kidneys from living related donors and 3 kidneys from cadaveric donors respectively. Arterial blood pressure (ABP), body weight (BW), serum creatinine, serum total protein and albumin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, 24 hour proteinuria were measured on 7th, 15th postoperative day, 1st , 3rd , 6th month and 1st year after transplant. BMI was calculated before and 1 year after transplantation and acute rejection episodes were recorded too. Methylprednizolone (MP), cyclosporine (CsA) dose \/kg BW were calculated at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12 months after transplant. Cumulative patient and graft survival at 1 and 5 years were calculated too. Patient survival at 1 and 5 years was 100% \/ 93.1% and 100% \/93.1% respectively (p: NS). Graft survival at 1 and 5 years was 100% \/ 93.10% and 93.75% \/ 86.45% respectively (p: NS). BW (but not BMI) and total cholesterol levels in Greek patients were higher compared to those of Albanian patients during the 1st post transplant year (p: 0.044 and p: 0.021 respectively). MP dose in A patients was higher during the first year (p: 0.05). Patients and graft survival do not present difference between G and A patients. There is significant difference on cholesterol profile between G and A patients. A larger number of transplants are possibly needed to allow us to draw firm conclusions. ","939":"Available evidence does allow an interpretation of periodontitis as being a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. There is now a convincing body of evidence that mechanism of atherosclerosis has a major inflammatory component and it is much more than the simple accumulation of lipids on the vascular walls. Studies have shown that certain other mild bacterial infections consist a major risk factor for stroke in young and middle aged patients. Several possible mechanisms could explain the observed association between infection and infraction. The evidence supports the premise that periodontitis leads to systemic exposure to oral bacteria and that the resulting production of inflammatory mediators is capable of initiating or supporting mechanisms associated to development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Studies in patients with pathologic concentrations of anti-cardiolipin and anti-phosphorylcholine antibodies demonstrated increased pocket depth and attachment loss, compared to patients with normal levels of the above antibodies. These antibodies could be associated to increased risk for stroke and atherosclerosis in patients with periodontitis. As we become more familiar to the association between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease it is likely that in the future periodontal disease may be added to the list of the factors which are used to assess patients' risk profile for coronary heart disease and stroke.","940":"The synchronous and consecutive (metachronous) development of two or more primary adenocarcinomas accounts for 3 to 5% of cases of colorectal cancer. Aim of this study is to review our experience in the management of patients with synchronous and metachronous lesions, and reach conclusions regarding their optimal diagnosis, treatment and follow-up. Between 1987 and 2004, 12 patients (seven men and five women, mean age 67.5 years, range 47-83 years) with synchronous (three patients) and metachronous (nine patients) lesions were treated, comprising 4.3% of all patients submitted to surgery for colorectal cancer. The diagnosis lag for metachronous lesions ranged from 1.5 to 14 years. All three patients with synchronous cancers had two lesions. Staging colonoscopy and abdominal CT was conducted in 10 patients while the remaining two underwent only abdominal CT due to their critical condition at presentation. Surgery had curative intent in 10 patients and palliative in two. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 21 days (10-49 days). The postoperative mortality was zero. Patients survival after curative procedures was 80% for the first year, 60% for the third and 50% for the fifth year. After palliative surgery, survival was 50% for the first year, and zero for the third. Patients with colorectal cancer must be followed up regularly after surgery. Follow up aims at early diagnosis and treatment of metachronous lesions that can appear many years after diagnosis of the primary lesion. Preoperative colonoscopy is an invaluable diagnostic (biopsy) and staging (exclusion of synchronous lesions, localization of the primary) modality, dictating the surgical approach. Additionally, it contributes to cancer prevention allowing the discovery and removal of small polyps before their transformation. ","941":"To culturally adapt the diabetes- specific quality of life (QOL) instrument PedsQL 3.0 Diabetes Module (DM) and the generic QOL instrument PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales (GCS) to the population of Greek diabetic children. Also, to evaluate QOL in youths with type 1 diabetes, compare it with that of healthy youths, and identify relationships between QOL and metabolic control and intensity of treatment. Eighty nine (89) children and adolescents with type I diabetes and 89 without diabetes, all with their parents (2-18 years of age, diabetes duration&gt;6 months) completed the Greek GCS. Those with diabetes also completed the Greek DM. Cronbach alpha coefficient of child and parent report of both instruments, in general approached 0.70, indicating their internal consistency reliability. Both instruments demonstrated positive intercorrelations with their total scores and subscales of DM demonstrated positive intercorrelations with total score of the generic instrument, supporting the validity of both instruments for the evaluation of QOL of Greek diabetic children. No statistically important differences were found among patient and parent report of diabetes and control group in both instruments. Exception was \"Social functioning\" in which children with diabetes reported better QOL. Growing age, female gender, large BMI, poor metabolic control and intensity of treatment did not influence QOL of children with diabetes. Greek PedsQL GCS and DM have sufficient acceptability, reliability and validity so as to be used for the purposes of a comparative study. Youth with diabetes reported similar QOL with non-diabetic youth of the same age and socioeconomic status. ","942":"Scarlet fever is a streptococcal infection with a good prognosis. Complications are well described. Hepatitis is a rare complication. We describe a 6-year old boy with scarlet fever, jaundice and elevated liver transaminases.","943":"Iron overload and inflammation might participate in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in community. The improvement of insulin resistance in hemodialysis (HD) patients is frequently seen after correction of anemia. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of recobinant humam erythropoietin (Epo) treatment on insulin resistance in non-diabetic HD patients. We investigated the effects of 6 months-duration treatment with Epo on insulin resistance and inflammatory parameters in 16 (6 male\/10 female) patients on maintenance HD with renal anemia (hemoglobin concentration &lt;\/=105 g\/l). The control group consisted of 15 patients on HD with renal anemia, without Epo treatment. Further clinical and laboratory variables were observed: fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, albumin, iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT), ferritin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6. Independent predictors for changes of calculated insulin resistance index by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) were identified by multivariate linear regression analysis. A significant reduction of insulin levels and therefore significant lowering of HOMA-IR was registered in Epo treated group. It was observed improvement of anemia [Hb 93.90+\/-17.34 g\/L vs. 116.40+\/-21.03 g\/L, p: 0.01; Hct 0.28 (0.24-0.31) vs. 0.33% (0.31-0.37), p: 0.01] as well as a trend toward iron stores decrease [ferritin 466.45 (174.40-886.90) vs. 279 microg\/L (137.00-648.50), p: 0.06]. A significant decrease of TNF-alpha [2.30 pg\/ml (1.48-2.95) vs. 1.65 pg\/ml (0.11-1.96), p: 0.01] and IL6 levels [8.32 pg\/ml (2.31-9.83) vs. 2.60 pg\/ml (2.00-3.05), p: 0.01] was presented. After adjustment for confounding variables (age, sex, and Kt\/v), a model consisting of BMI, ferittin, and TNF alpha accounted for 96% of the variance in HOMA-IR in Epo treated patients. The present study demonstrated that Epo treatment could participate in reducing insulin resistance through iron stores reduction and improvement of chronic inflammation in patients on maintenance HD. ","944":"Although toxoplasmosis is considered harmless for a non-pregnant woman, it is potentially harmful during pregnancy, especially at first trimester. The aim of this study is to increase our alertness and monitoring in case of toxoplasmosis during pregnancy, given that when diagnosed it can be effectively treated.We present a case of a healthy 26 years old adult woman, found with toxoplasmosis during the 13th week of pregnancy. The role of frequent maternal and fetus immunological tests, PCR-tests of the amniotic fluid and ultrasound screening of the fetus throughout pregnancy was of great value. The patient was treated with spiramycin (1 grx3) from the 16th week of pregnancy. The patient was subjected to cesarean delivery at the 36th week of pregnancy due to preterm contractions and history of previous cesarean delivery. The newborn was a healthy girl with a birth weight of 2880 gr. A two-year follow up of the baby revealed no medical condition. Maternal infections are a serious medical condition during pregnancy. Toxoplasmosis when diagnosed on time and treated properly can lead to healthy offspring.","945":"At the current stage, the criteria for making the diagnosis of SLE (ARA, 1982) include only two neuropsychiatric manifestations: seizures and psychoses. In view of the need for early detection of the lesions of the nervous system, we set ourselves to the task of developing an approach for making the diagnosis of NPSLE (neuropsychiatric SLE) on the basis of criteria with high sensitivity and specificity. In view of determining the type and incidence of the lesions of the nervous system (NS), clinical, laboratory, and instrumental examinations were performed within the period from 1998 to 2006 in 225 patients with SLE. Depending on the specific features of the clinical course, these patients were divided into three groups: with clinically manifested lesions of NS; without clinically manifested lesions of NS; and with incomplete SLE. The results from the performed examinations showed a high percentage (64.44%) of neuropsychiatric lesions in the patients with SLE. According our results, NPSLE diagnosis should be made in the presence of at least one indicator from the first group of criteria (seizures, psychosis, cerebrovascular event, lesion of cranial nerves, motor disturbances, quantitative alterations of consciousness) and at least two indicators from the second group of criteria (cognitive dysfunction, headache due to lupus, peripheral neuropathy, MRI changes, EEG changes, ENMG changes, positive aRPA, positive aPL) after ruling out other causes (except for SLE) for their occurrence. ","946":"The paper introduces \"Glottal Disturbogram\" as a new tool for the discrimination, evaluation and representation of glottal disturbances which may be met in pathological voicing or singing. The \"Glottal Disturbogram's\" principles and related features also suit similar applications such as the acoustics of some families of musical instruments. Disturbogram's computational and display characteristics are presented with the use of both synthetic glottal patterns and real signals obtained from subjects with voice disorders. Results show that Disturbogram may efficiently discriminate and quantify perturbation types, offering a valuable tool in clinical or laboratory investigation of both voice disorders and normal voicing types.","947":"The target of the current prospective study was to assess the effectiveness of the polypropylene tapes in preventing recurrence of cystocele formation when placed underneath the bladder base. Twenty-two Caucasian women, predominantly postmemopausal with marked descent of the anterior, middle and\/or posterior pelvic segment, participated in the study. Vaginal reconstructive surgery including anterior colporrhaphy and Kelly placation, posterior colpoperineorrhaphy and\/or hysterectomy, was undertaken in all subjects. The polypropylene tape was placed not under the midurethra, as often performed in stress urine incontinence (SUI) cases, but underneath the bladder base as an adjunct to the anterior colporrhaphy sutures. The postoperative follow up lasted 2 years and was carried out every 4 months. The assessment of the anatomic result included evaluation of the operated sites and the position of the tapes inserted on clinical grounds and after perineal sonography. Urodynamic assessment was performed in the presence of urinary incontinence. In all patients the postoperative correction of the anterior vaginal wall was sufficient, 14 subjects did not present genitourinary symptoms and therefore were considered as cured; three patients were designated as improved because despite sufficient anatomic correction of the anterior vaginal segment they reported urinary incontinence symptoms. Retropubic haematoma occurred in 1 patient, transient urge incontinence in 1, transient stress incontinence in 1, and persistent stress incontinence also in 1. There was no erosion of the tape noticed. Mean residual urine was 30 ml, mean bladder base distance to the inferior edge of the symphysis pubis was 1.2 cm and the mean total vaginal length was 7 cm. Despite the relative short follow up period and the limited number of patients enrolled, we conclude from our study that the use of polypropylene tapes as an adjunct for fortification of the anterior pelvic segment could provide an option in preventing recurrence of cystocele formation. ","948":"Metabolic syndrome is a disorder characterized by abdominal obesity, hypertension, increased triglycerides, decreased HDL cholesterol and increased blood glucose. Accumulating evidence strongly indicates that insulin resistance and an increased amount of abdominal fat are the pathogenic factors for the characteristics of metabolic syndrome. The metabolic syndrome is characterized by an increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Studies indicate that sleep apnea may be a manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. It has also been suggested that the metabolic syndrome or \"syndrome X\" should also comprise obstructive sleep apnea and should then be called syndrome \"Z\". It appears that obstructive sleep apnea and the metabolic syndrome are characterized by the same pathophysiologic environment, which increases the risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. The increased amount of visceral fat and the accompanying insulin resistance seem to be the main characteristics responsible for the development of obstructive sleep apnea and the metabolic syndrome.","949":"Alport syndrome (AS) is the most common hereditary nephritis often associated with extrarenal manifestations. It was first described by Alport on 1927. There is a primary disorder in collagen type IV which is the main component of the basement membranes. Alport syndrome is more frequently inherited as an X-linked and less commonly as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive trait. We describe the case of a 3-year-old boy with the X-linked variant of AS. The diagnosis was at first speculated from the child's detailed family history and was finally confirmed by a skin biopsy. Skin biopsy is an efficient and less invasive method for the X-linked variant of the AS diagnosis.","950":"It is presented herein a case of a family, four members of which suffer from hereditary bisalbuminemia. The abnormality was initially detected in a 29-year old male, by serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), during the investigation for possible multiple sclerosis. SPE also revealed the presence of a double albumin band in sera of the patient's sister, father and grandmother, almost confirming the inherited (genetic) form of bisalbuminemia. Possible causes related with the acquired form of bisalbuminemia were excluded for all examined individuals. SPE was performed by both automatic capillary zone electrophoresis and agaroze gel electrophoresis. All tested samples were immunofixated with special antisera, in order to exclude the presence of monoclonal fractions. Total albumin, total proteins and immunoglobulins varied in normal ranges. The relative mobility of the albumin variant was determined by a simple mixing experiment, which gave evidence of the fast-type form of inherited bisalbuminemia. This is the first report of hereditary bisalbuminemia in Greece.","951":"Contrast media administration during diagnostic and invasive procedures in high risk patients for nephrotoxicity is a common problem in clinical practice. The mechanisms involved in renal function impairment after contrast media administration are not precisely known but are intensively investigated, and new data have emerged in the literature lately. We present the case of a 72-year old male patient with diabetic nephropathy to whom a new generation iso-osmolar contrast medium (iodixanol) was administered during intravenous pyelography. Due to the contrast agent administration, the patient developed irreversible acute renal failure and became dialysis-dependent. This case suggests that even new generation contrast media (including iodixanol) may be severely nephrotoxic, when administered to high risk patients. Additionally we review the complex mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of contrast media nephrotoxicity.","952":"Ischaemic diabetic foot ulcers pose a significant problem which is associated with a high likelihood of amputation. With the advent of endovascular surgery, the management of lower limb arterial lesions in the diabetic population has become more appealing.

This article reviews the modern endovascular management of the diabetic foot.","953":"Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow Rate (PNIFR) is a clinical trial that has been instituted in clinical practice in order to determine the extent of nasal airway patency and it is used to assess the degree of nasal obstruction. This study attempts to provide tables referring to normal values of PNIFR in children and adolescents. Three thousand one hundred and seventy pupils aged between 5-18 years, were selected to enter the study. Children with acute or chronic upper airway obstruction, such as acute obstructive pulmonary disease or allergic rhinitis and children below the 3rd percentile for weight and\/or height were excluded from the study. All children that took part in the study were subjected to PNIFR measurements by using a portable Youlten Peak Flow meter. A continuous increase of PNIFR values for boys and girls in relation to age increase was recorded. PNIFR values were higher in boys compared to girls and this difference was statistically significant until the age of 12. Normal ranges for PNIFR standards are of great importance for the study of nasal patency, evaluation of the degree of nasal obstruction and application of treatment. This is the first time that a detailed description of PNIFR standards becomes available for the Greek population of children and adolescents.

This is a retrospective review of case notes of all pregnant women undergone amniocentesis in our department during the period 2002-2005. Two main operators performed the procedure, using 22 gauze needle usually and 20 gauze should longer needle was needed. Sevendy three patients undergone amniocentesis. The reasons for having this procedure were: increased risk for Down syndrome in 68% (50\/73), maternal request in 24% (18\/73), suspicious ultrasound findings in 4% (3\/73) and family history in 3% (2\/73). Maternal age ranged from 20 to 45 years and the gestation time that amniocentesis was performed was 15 to 23 weeks. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and culture were used in order to obtain karyotype results. In 92% (67\/73) of cases one needle pass was needed. FISH and culture were performed in 96% (70\/73) of cases, FISH only in 3% (2\/73) and culture only in 1% (1\/73). The chromosome results were normal in 93% (68\/73) of cases, Down's syndrome in 4% (3\/73) and Edwards syndrome in 3% (2\/73). The outcome of pregnancies was: live births in 89% (65\/73), stillbirths at 32 weeks and 35 weeks in 3% (2\/73), miscarriages in 1% (1\/73 at 19 weeks, 3 weeks after the amniocentesis), terminations in 7% (5\/73, due to chromosomal abnormalities). Sixty one women delivered at term (84%) and 6 women (8%) delivered preterm. The post amniocentesis rate of miscarriage is calculated at 1% in our centre. FISH analysis can relieve stress of couples by reducing the waiting time for results. ","955":"Diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension are two common diseases that often coexist. Patients with diabetes have much higher rate of hypertension than that in general population. The co-existence of these disorders appears to accelerate microvascular and macrovascular complications and greatly increases the cardiovascular risk, risk of stroke and end stage renal disease. Arterial hypertension is clearly related to nephropathy in subjects with type 1 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes insulin resistance seems to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Several well designed randomized controlled trials have provided evidence that patients with diabetes will benefit from a more aggressive treatment of hypertension. This benefit is seen at blood pressure level&lt;130\/80 mmHg. Moreover, most diabetic patients with hypertension require combination therapy to achieve optimal blood pressure goals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-adrenoreceptor blockers and calcium- channel blockers are all effective antihypertensive agents in type 2 diabetes mellitus and no comparative trial showed the superiority of any particular class in either lowering blood pressure or reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. On the basis of experimental arguments and clinical observations that have shown their apparent superiority in slowing diabetic nephropathy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers are preferred as the first choice alone or in combination with diuretics. Second choice should be long-acting calcium-channel blockers or cardioselective beta blockers. Clinicians should be aware of the need for aggressive treatment of hypertension and spend more time in order to provide maximal benefit to the treatment of diabetes mellitus and hypertension.","956":"Certain disorders may be falsely diagnosed as stroke. We examined the efficacy of the diagnostic protocol that is followed in our stroke unit and was designed in order to early differentiate more efficiently between stroke and conditions that mimic it. METHODS-PATIENTS: Three hundred sixty-two elderly patients (196 male, 166 female with average age 74.56 years), who were hospitalized at our stroke center between January of 2005 and June of 2007 and diagnosed at admission as stroke patients, were retrospectively studied in order to investigate if the final diagnosis agreed with the initial diagnosis of stroke on admission.Our diagnostic protocol included medical history of the patient, assessment of state of consciousness, blood pressure, electrocardiogram, complete blood cell count (hematocrit\/hemoglobin, leukocytes, platelets), clotting mechanism (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time), glucose, electrolytes (Na, K, Ca), renal (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine) and liver function (SGOT, SGPT), as well as imaging methods like chest X-Ray and brain CT scan. In 95% of patients, the final diagnosis agreed with the initial diagnosis of stroke at admission. According to final diagnosis, 344 (95%) of them had stroke -either hemorrhagic or ischemic-, while from the rest 18 (5%), 12 (66.7%) were found to have metastatic neoplasm of brain, 3 (18.7%) had primal tumour of brain, whereas 3 (18.7%) suffered from other diseases (respiratory infection, meningoencephalitis, thyrotoxicosis). The principal symptoms of the conditions that mimicked a stroke were: aphasic disturbances (27.3%), dizziness\/fainting (27.3%), headache\/diplopia (11.1%), dysarthria (11.1%), hiccup and\/or swallow disturbances (5.6%). Our diagnostic protocol seems to ensure a high degree of differential diagnosis between stroke and conditions that mimic it.

One month later she came back because of a palpable-painful abdominal mass and abdominal distention. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound examination demonstrated a demarkated fluid collection in the lower abdomen and pelvis. The cyst was drained percutaneously and the culture disclosed candida albicans which was treated with fluconasole. Two months later, the girl was admitted again with the same symptoms. An investigative laparotomy was undergone and the cyst was drained again. Fluid cultures were negative. CT abdomen examination six months later was negative for cyst relapse. In conclusion, intraperitoneal pseudocyst is a serious complication of CAPD. Surgical intervention may be preferable to percutaneous drainage.","959":"Diabetes mellitus is associated with a variety of musculoskeletal disorders. The prevalence of connective tissue disorders in these patients has increased in the recent years affecting significantly their quality of life. We conducted a pilot study including 208 sequentially selected patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus regularly followed-up at the Diabetes Center of the Hippokration University Hospital. Among the diabetic patients who were screened according to the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire for musculoskeletal symptoms and findings, 82.6% were found to exhibit musculoskeletal abnormalities, mainly of the degenerative, noninflammatory type. Musculoskeletal disorders are a common finding among patients with type 2 diabetes. Obesity and accumulation of abnormally glycosylated byproducts have been proposed as potential pathogenetic mediators of these connective tissue abnormalities. Of particular interest is, however, the common association of osteoarthritis, involving even non-weight bearing joints in patients with type 2 diabetes, indicating a common pathophysiologic mechanism connecting these two clinical conditions. ","960":"OBJECTIVE-METHODS: Adamantiades-Behcet disease (ABD) is a multi-systemic vasculitis of unknown origin, with a characteristic geographic distribution, that affects vessels of all kinds and sizes and is characterized by recurrent mucosal, skin and ocular lesions. In the present study, a series of 36 patients from Northern Greece is analyzed retrospectively in regard to the epidemiological, clinical and immunological parameters. All patients had recurrent oral ulcerations (36\/36, 100%), while 23\/36 (63.9%) experienced genital ulcerations and 22\/36 (61.1%) developed ocular disease. Skin manifestations were observed in 23\/36 patients (63.9%) and pathergy test was found positive in 14\/36 patients (38.9%). Other manifestations included central nervous system involvement, recurrent genitourinary inflammations, arthralgias and superficial thrombophlebitis. Laboratory findings were not specific, partly reflecting the severity of inflammation. Ocular disease was more often observed in HLA-B51 (+) patients (20\/31, 64.5%) than in HLA-B51 (-) patients. Standard of care (SOC) treatment consisted of cyclosporine A, azathioprine, methylprednisolone and aspirin, whereas refractory disease was treated with intravenous pulses of methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. Occasionally, anti-TNF agents (infliximab) were applied to treat refractory ocular disease. The findings of the present study come in agreement with those reported for other Mediterranean series. HLA-B51 seems to predispose to more severe disease, while early therapeutic intervention is beneficial for these patients. ","961":"Since total homocysteine (Hcy) is markedly elevated in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), it has been presented as potential factor contributing to the high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in CRF. The aim of the study was to examine the significance of elevated Hcy and other cardiovascular risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with CRF. Fifty six patients 16-M, 40-F, average age 58+\/-14.55, creatinine clearance 39.19+\/-10.11 ml\/min were examined. In addition, 20 control healthy subjects were examined. The association of Hcy levels and classic risk factors for atherosclerosis with common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was examined. B-mode ultrasound measurement of carotid IMT was performed in 56 hypertensive pts with CRF (glomerular filtration rate&gt;20 ml\/min and &lt;90 ml\/min), 44 hypertensive pts with normal renal function and 20 healthy volunteers. The mean duration of hypertension was 145.12 years. IMT in all examined hypertensive pts was increased above normal clinical value and significantly higher then in healthy controls (0.75+\/-0.006\/0.60+\/-0.1, p&lt;0.001). The carotid IMT was similar between hypertensive pts with CRF and hypertensive pts with normal renal function (0.74+\/-0.1\/0.76 +\/-0.1, p&gt;0.05). Significant predictors for IMT were age (r=0.358, p&lt;0.04), duration of hypertension (r=0.395, p=0.023), diabetes duration (r=0.343, p&lt;0.02), as well as duration of CRF (r=0.324, p&lt;0.006). There was a negative correlation between IMT and glomerular filtration rate assessed by creatinine clearance (r=-0.303, p&lt;0.003). Renal function, described by creatinine clearance was the strongest determinant for Hcy levels (r=-0.332, p&lt;0.008). Increased IMT was estimated in pts with CRF compared to healthy controls (0.74+\/-0.10 vs 0.59+\/-0.10, p&lt;0.001). We found association between Hcy and carotid IMT ( r=0.344, p&lt;0.015). No consistent association was found between IMT and other specific for CRF cardiovascular risk factors. The study suggests that patients with mild renal failure have increased IMT of the common carotid artery and that elevated plasma Hcy level in CRF is associated with carotid intima- media thickening. ","962":"The aim of the present study is the comparison of the results of the appliance of two methods of respiratory physiotherapy; the active cycle of breathing techniques in drainage positions and the conventional physiotherapy, regarding their effects on mucociliary clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. Thirty-five children teenagers and adults with cystic fibrosis, 8-20 years of age, with mean Schwachman score 78,49 took part in the research. All patients had regular physiotherapeutic control and applied systematically physiotherapy. The same children received two methods of respiratory physiotherapy in a 3-month random order, when they came at the outpatients' department of the hospital for their regular check-up. The comparison of the results of the two methods did not show statistical significant difference in sputum quantity, whereas statistical significant difference was noticed in sputum quality after the application of active cycle of breathing techniques. The application of the active cycle of breathing techniques contributes effectively in the sputum expectoration from the peripheral bronchopulmonary segments and enhances the mucociliary clearance in children with cystic fibrosis. ","963":"A non-invasive method for evaluation of high-turnover and low-turnover bone diseases is the measurement of certain important serum bone markers such as osteocalcin, procolagen-I-propeptide, dioxypiridinoline, hydroxyproline and alkaline phosphatase. Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) in pre-dialysis and dialysis patients, is manifested in 3 forms: high-turnover ROD, related to secondary hyperparathyroidism; low-turnover ROD and mixed ROD. Serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), osteocalcin (OC), procolagen-I-propeptide (PIPC) and dioxypiridinoline (DYP) were measured in 20 patients on hemodialysis (HD) and 20 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) to assess the prevalence of ROD type in the HD and CAPD groups. We found lower mean levels of all bone markers in CAPD patients, (iPTH: 219+\/-235 vs. 428+\/-285 pg\/ml; p&lt;0.01; OC 10.2+\/-7.5 vs. 21.3+\/-7.2 ng\/ml; p&lt;0.01; PIPC 111+\/-57.3 vs. 218+\/-62.4 ng\/ml; p&lt;0.01; DYP 7.3+\/-6.4 vs. 55.2+\/-23.3nm\/l; p&lt;0.001; AP 164+\/-66 vs. 325+\/-188 U\/l; p&lt;0.01) and lower than normal in 11 of them and higher than normal PTH, AP and some of the other serum markers (PICP; DYP) in 14 HD patients. The lower levels of the investigated serum bone markers in CAPD patients suggest that low-turnover ROD prevails in these patients than in HD pts. ","964":"Although intravenous drug users (IVDUs) comprise the majority of patients with chronic hepatitis C, most of them are excluded from treatment because of concerns about adherence to treatment and side effects. In this study we retrospectively evaluated safety, compliance to treatment and efficacy of treatment in IVDUs with HCV infection in 163 former IVDUs with chronic hepatitis C, who were not in methadone substitution and were attending our clinics the period 1997-2004. All subjects were HCVRNA (+), had ALT levels&gt;x1.5 UNL and were treated for their HCV infection. Treatment consisted of three different regimens: IFN-alpha monotherapy (39.8%), IFN-alpha\/ribavirin combination therapy (30.1%) and pegylated IFN-alpha\/ribavirin combination therapy. Eighty seven over 163 patients (53.3%) discontinued treatment early due to drug abuse relapse (62%), side effects (32.1%, 10% psychiatric) and 5,7% for other reasons. Eighty precent of those who discontinued treatment had pre-treatment drug abstinence&lt;or=9 months. Seventy over 76 patients who completed therapy had an end-of-treatment virologic response (ETR, 92%). Fifty four over 76 patients showed sustained virologic response (SVR, 71.05%). ETR and SVR were significantly higher in both combination therapies compared to IFN-alpha monotherapy. The most prevalent HCV genotype was 3 (65%) and mild histological lesions were detected in the majority of subjects. Our findings show that treatment for chronic hepatitis C was reasonably safe and sufficiently effective in our group of non methadone-substituted IVDUs, despite the fact that more than half of them discontinued treatment early and many relapsed to drug abuse. We suggest that the optimal duration of pretreatment abstinence from drug abuse should be &gt;\/= 9 months.

However, there is still a need for more objective and quantitative methods for its diagnosis and stratification. The present study explores the effectiveness of signal analysis methodologies as the means to increase the effectiveness of spirometry in diagnosing and stratifying COPD. Since expiratory flow at the mouth results from converging airflows, it is possible to use signal analysis to identify changes in the characteristics of airflow along the respiratory tree. This was achieved by non-invasively identifying alterations in the frequency spectrum of the Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) curve of 108 patients (49 men and 59 women, 12-75 yrs of age) presenting with (a) clinically and spirometrically normal respiratory profile, (b) COPD, (c) restrictive lung disease and (d) interstitial fibrosis. Fundamental to the study design was the notion that the characteristics of the expiratory output of the respiratory system are determined by the bronchial tree and the upper respiratory tract. A number of quantitative measures for the power spectrum of the FEF curve were identified, which permit the definition of specific rules and allow for the accurate classification of, at least, the basic types of respiratory disease. (a) It is for the first time that airflow resonances are identified in the sub-audible (&lt;20 Hz) range of the power spectrum of the FEF curve. (b) COPD patients present with FEF curves which have different power spectral characteristics from those of healthy individuals (p&lt;0.01), at frequencies lower than 3.66 Hz. (c) In COPD, in restrictive lung disease and in interstitial fibrosis, the lower resonant frequencies of the spectrum of the FEF curve predominate. ","966":"Hearing loss can significantly impair patient's quality of life, affecting communicative behavior, emotional and social function. This study assesses the impact of hearing aids on the quality of life of patients in a rural area and its correlation with socio-economic factors. Thirty patients (18 male, 12 female), with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss of variable etiology, using hearing aid for at least five years, were enrolled in this study. Mean age of subjects was 74 years. This study used the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) to quantify the changes in quality of life. Patients were divided in above and below criterion group. The criterion used was the median of the air contraction threshold improvement. The binaural use and the type of hearing aids were recorded and correlated with the type of social security service of patients. Eighty per cent of patients reported significant benefit from the hearing aid use. The majority of patients (90%) used one hearing aid (mean GBI total score 35) and only 10% had binaural hearing aid (mean GBI total score 45). The majority of patients used analog hearing aid (56.5%) while 43.5% used digital hearing aid. Interestingly, it was found that patients did not attend appointments for hearing aids maintenance with a mean follow up of 2.5 years. This study demonstrates a trend of better quality of life for patients with bilateral hearing loss and binaural hearing aid use. The type of hearing aid is related to the funding from their social security service. Therefore more patients are using analog hearing aids, as they are less expensive than the digital hearing aids. ","967":"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remain challenging to the clinician in terms of diagnosis and management. The diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion in first ruling out other disorders that can also cause peripheral blood\/bone marrow cell dysplasia and cytopenias. Recent studies implicate extensive apoptosis as the explanation of the paradoxical observation of marrow hyperplasia, but peripheral blood cytopenia. The clonal nature of MDS places it also at continual risk for transformation to acute leukemia. Predicting overall survival as well as the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) transformation has been improved by the development of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Management of MDS can now be based on the patients respective prognostic subgrouping. Low-risk patients should be considered for hematopoietic growth factor singly or in combination, while high-risk patients should be offered AML-induction therapy or novel therapeutic agents. Common complications are neutropenias with recurrent infections and red cell transfusion dependence. Future advances upon understanding the molecular details of the MDS clone should ultimately improve the care of patients with MDS.","968":"Aging is a universal and progressive physiological phenomenon clinically characterized by degenerative changes in both the structure and the functional capacity of organs and tissues. In general, geriatric patients are more sensitive to anesthetic agents. Less medication is usually required to achieve a desired clinical effect, and drug effect is often prolonged. The most important outcome and overall objective of perioperative care of geriatric population, is to speed recovery and avoid functional decline. An important principle must be kept in mind when dealing with an elderly patient: Aging involves a progressive loss of functional reserve in all organ systems, to variable extent. Compensation for age-related changes is usually adequate, but limitation of physiological reserve is evident during times of stress such as the perioperative period.","969":"Patients with chronic kidney disease progress to end stage renal disease and about 86% are diagnosed hypertensives. Hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease which is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. Pre and post-dialysis blood pressure values of &lt;140\/90 mmHg are recommended as the optimal blood pressure. The extra-cellular volume (ECV) expansion is the main pathophysiological determinant of hypertension in dialysis patients. The efforts should be made to correctly estimate and achieve the patients dry body weigh and to limit dietary sodium intake. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are recommended as first choice drugs. Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers have been associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality and give their protective effects in patients at high risk. Antihypertensive drug therapies can effectively reduce blood pressure and are needed by the vast majority of hemodialysis patients.","970":"The role of leptin in humans is not yet precisely established. Nevertheless there is increasing evidence revealing that this molecule is involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis as an independent risk factor. From another point of view, however, leptin is already related to known traditional risk factors for accelerated atherogenesis, like obesity. We herein provide the experimental and clinical data concerning the association between leptin and atherosclerotic disease. Vascular stiffness and calcification, immune response regulation, fibrinolysis, and oxidative stress, are the main fields to be investigated in relation to leptin in the present study. Additionally the description of the main characteristics of leptin and its receptors is included in the introduction of this article, whereas in the end the main clinical data suggesting that this molecule represents an interesting risk factor for atherosclerotic disease are provided.","971":"It concerns an unusual injury which is the result of a violent hyperextension or abduction of the pollex and even less frequently by direct injury. To increase our sensitivity and observation regarding thumb's injuries, because it is possible a fracture of the sesamoid not to be diagnosed. We present a case of an adult man, 35 years old, who suffered a violent hyperextension of the right pollex. The contribution of digital X-ray examination, which demonstrated a fracture of the ulnar sesamoid of the pollex was very important. The fracture was treated with fixation with elastic bandages for two weeks. Follow up of the patient six weeks and six months after the injury, demonstrated a total recovery of the function of the pollex and callousness of the fracture, respectively. Fracture of sesamoid bones of the thumb is a rare injury, not usually diagnosed, but it has good prognosis when treated properly. ","972":"Gitelman's syndrome (GS) is a heritable renal disorder characterized by hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia and hypocalciuria, and is distinct from Bartter's syndrome (BS). As compared to those with BS, patients with GS present at an older age, and they have a milder clinical picture, normal or slightly decreased concentrating urine ability, reduced urinary excretion of calcium, and permanently decreased serum magnesium level. GS is caused by defective NaCl transport in the distal convoluted tubule, and is linked to the gene encoding the thiazide sensitive Na-Cl-cotransporter located on chromosome 16q. Patients with BS, on the other hand, have mutations in the transporters in the thick ascending loop of Henle (NKCC2, ROMK, and C1C-Kb). Treatment of GS consists of magnesium salt replacement. Long term prognosis in terms of maintaining growth, preserving renal function and life expectancy is excellent.","973":"To investigate if pepsin is detected, with an activity assay, in the saliva of patients with a clinical diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) and can therefore be used as a diagnostic marker of laryngopharyngeal reflux. Pilot, prospective study. Adult participants with a clinical diagnosis of LPR collected whole saliva samples on regular intervals for a day, and upon experiencing symptoms attributed to LPR. Patients were selected on the basis of presence of severe symptoms and laryngoscopic findings of laryngopharyngeal reflux and symptoms of gastroesopharyngeal reflux. They reported voice disorders, dysphagia, throat clearing, excessive secretions, breathing difficulties, cough, globus sensation and throat pain. Control participants reported the absence of pharyngeal and laryngeal symptoms and of symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Saliva samples were assayed with fibrinogen on an agarose gel plate. The detection of pepsin was based on the presence of peptic activity which was qualitatively evaluated. The control participants had negative assays. No saliva samples from the LPR patients, collected at regular sampling, tested positive for pepsin. All the samples collected at the presence of symptoms and following regurgitation episodes tested negative for pepsin. Saliva samples pH ranged from 7 to 8. Pepsin was not detected, with an activity assay, in the saliva of patients with a clinical diagnosis of LPR. A concentration method might be more sensitive although saliva and swallowing physiology renders the detection of pepsin in the saliva difficult. ","974":"T-cell zeta-chain downregulation is common in various types of cancer and it is proposed as a mechanism of cancer immunosubversion. L-arginine consumption by arginase rich suppressor myeloid cells has been incriminated. The effect of L-arginine supplementation on chemically induced carcinogenesis and tumor growth in mice was evaluated. Eight-week old female BALB-c mice were used. Ten mice were injected i.m. with 0.6 mg methylcholanthrene (MCA) once. Ten mice were injected with MCA once and were receiving L-arginine supplementation (5% in animal drinking water) continuously during the study. Mice with cancer were sacrificed 12 weeks after. From the 10 MCA injected mice 6 developed sarcoma. From the 10 MCA injected mice that were receiving L-arginine supplementation 7 developed sarcoma. L-arginine supplementation did not affect MCA induced carcinogenesis (p=1.0, Fisher's exact test). The weight of tumors was not different between the tumors derived from mice that were or were not receiving L-arginine supplementation (1088.3+\/-590.2 mg vs. 969.6+\/-608.1 mg respectively, p=0.729, unpaired t-test). L-arginine supplementation does not affect chemically induced carcinogenesis and tumor growth in BALB-c mice. Although zeta-chain downregulation could be a mechanism of cancer immunosubversion there are enough other cancer immunosubversion mechanisms that were not overwhelmed by L-arginine supplementation. Additionally, except cancer immunosubversion, cancer immunoselection is another, possibly more significant, mechanism of tumor escape from immunosurveillance. ","975":"Mind-body interactions have been well recognized and are extendedly studied in the medical literature. There is evidence that the mind and body communicate with each other in a multidirectional flow of information by means of hormones, neurotransmitters\/neuropeptides, cytokines, and semaphorines. There are consistent and convincing reports of links between stress and disease onset and progression, e.g. asthma. Growing evidence in the field of psychoneuroimmunology contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms by which stressful events affect physical health. The psychoneuroendocrine system can influence the immune response and thereby the capacity of the organism to cope with illness, and the immune system can have an impact on neuroendocrine function. Such cross-talk among systems is dependent upon feedback loops working to maintain homeostatic equilibrium. The immune system is capable of producing factors, which serve to integrate immune-neuroendocrine circuits with immunoregulatory and metabolic consequences for the organism. The interaction of the immune, nervous and endocrine system may drive an individual to a well recognized biological hypersensitivity and the creation of allergic symptoms (allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, etc), followed by distinct behavioural patterns characterized as affective hypersensitivity. Semeiometry is a proper tool for large scale investigation of the psychological profile of patients with allergic rhinitis. Statistical analysis of semeiometry questionnaires processed by Greek adult patients in Crete island during 2005, showed that there is relation between occupation and allergy. Housewives, public services employees and private employees appear to be allergic in significantly higher percentage than others. With semeiometry we can find evidence of the bi-directional immunoendocrine--nervous system interactions in patients with allergic rhinitis.","976":"Rhabdomyolysis constitutes a common cause of acute renal failure and presents paramount interest. A large variety of causes with different pathogenetic mechanisms can involve skeletal muscles resulting in rhabdomyolysis with or without acute renal failure. Crush syndrome, one of the most common causes of rhabdomyolysis presents increased clinical interest, particularly in areas often involved by earthquakes, such as Greece and Turkey. Drug abusers are another sensitive group of young patients prone to rhabdomyolysis, which attracts the clinical interest of a variety of medical specialties. We herein review the evidence extracted from updated literature concerning the data related to pathogenetic mechanisms and pathophysiology as well as the management of this interesting syndrome.","977":"The present review article regarding the kinin system-bradykinin is dealing with the biological effects of the abovementioned entity mediated by specific B1 and B2 receptors as well as with its clinical implications known nowadays. The activation of the kinin system-bradykinin is particularly important in blood pressure regulation and in inflammatory reactions, through bradykinin ability to elevate vascular permeability and to cause vasodilatation in some arteries and veins. Recent data on bradykinin formation and release, synergy with ligands, receptors for bradykinin as well as on bradykinin participation in the mitogenesis process, are given in detail. Therapeutic potentials and future applications in many clinical situations including respiratory allergic reactions, septic shock, hypertension and its treatment, hypotensive transfusion reactions, heart diseases, pancreatitis, hereditary and acquired angioedema, Alzheimer disease and liver cirrhosis with ascites, are discussed in brief. Its role as a neuromediator, regulator of several vascular and renal functions, and its participation in signaling pathways, is also discussed in some detail.","978":"The gender identity of a person is the final result of genetic, hormonal and morphologic sex. Over a long period sex determination, and, specifically, male sex determination, has been correlated to the presence of the Y chromosome, which in turn has been the karyotype signal of the testes. However, research has provided data to convince that this theory is only part of the truth. In addition to the Y chromosome, a multitude of other genes influence sex determination and are able to cause male to female sex-reversal and vice versa. It is of great interest that these genes are located in more than one autosomal chromosomes or even in the X chromosome. It has become obvious that sex determination, according to the genetic sex, is a complicated matter that not only requires the presence of Y chromosome. This fact triggered extensive research of the Y chromosome and led to great insight into its structure, origin, evolution and eventual fate in humans.","979":"The ultimate goal of antihypertensive therapy is cardiovascular risk reduction. As lowering blood pressure per se reduces risk for myocardial infarction only by 20%-25%, it is obvious that a better protection is needed. An optimal strategy to reduce risk in hypertensives may include lifestyle modification, promotion of adherence to therapy, early and aggressive target levels achievement by appropriate drug choice. Clinical trial data suggest that RAAS blockers can reduce the risk at least partly independently of BP lowering. In addition, as hypertension is associated with a constellation of other risk factors, the global risk reduction is nowadays going to become the gold standard in therapy. The most common and important coexisting risk factor is hypercholesterolemia. This is not simply a co-existence but there is an independent and causal relationship between lipids and hypertension and there is a physiologic rationale and evidence for statins use especially in patients with complicated hypertension or in patients with more than two risk factors. So, whilst blood pressure lowering is undoubtedly beneficial, we have to focus on the global cardiovascular risk. We must go beyond blood pressure and the most effective way to go \"beyond BP\" is to add a statin.","980":"Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological mechanism, characterized by specific morphological and biochemical changes such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, protein cleavage, DNA breakdown and phagocytosis. Apoptosis is a significant contributor to the morphologic and functional development of multicellular organisms. It is also involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases including degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, cancer and immune system dysfunction. There are many factors, mainly proteins, which are involved in the activation, regulation and execution of related events. A fairly detailed outline of apoptotic mechanisms has also started to emerge and to be verified. In this short, focused mini-review, we attempt to outline current evidence regarding the mechanisms and the regulation of apoptosis.","981":"Microalbuminuria (defined as urinary albumin excretion of 30-300 mg\/day, or 20-200 microg\/min) is an earlier sign of vascular damage. It is a marker of general vascular dysfunction and nowadays is considered a predictor of worse outcomes for both kidney and heart patients. There is a significant correlation between blood pressure and microalbuminuria. Even high normal blood pressure is associated with significant higher frequency of microalbuminuria and this way may be a biomarker of increased cardiovascular risk. Microalbuminuria could be taken also, as an indicator of insulin resistance and of the increased renal and cardiovascular risk associated with metabolic syndrome. Renal involvement is a pivotal development in diabetes and microalbuminuria is generally the first clinical sign of renal dysfunction in diabetics. It is demonstrated that cardiovascular and renal risk is elevated even in the high normal range of microalbuminuria (below 30 mg\/day). There is no doubt that therapies that prevent or delay the development of microalbuminuria and all measures that reduce it, may help to prevent or delay end organ damage.","982":"Varicocele is among the most common causes of male infertility. It is also one of the most controversial issues in the field of Andrology, especially regarding why, when and to whom varicocelectomy should be applied. Many experts believe that the surgical repair of varicocele should be applied only in a meticulously selected group of infertile men, although there are no generally accepted criteria. Up to now, the only confirmed prognostic factor for achievement of pregnancy after varicocelectomy is the age of the female partner. Given the wide application of intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) during the last few years, the modern research approaches should compare the benefits of varicocelectomy and ICSI, taking under consideration both the efficacy and the cost-effectiveness of the methods.","983":"A vast amount of papers is published every year about species evolution, the most interesting being those recently published in the journal \"Nature\", concerning the human-ape relationship. The results and the new theories generated from this research are sometimes astonishing, raising not only biological, but also social, religious and cultural questions. One of the new questions concerns the role of species interbreeding as a means of evolution. In the subject of species interbreeding between human and ape we found some interesting historical and mythical information that sort of back-up this theory of interbreeding, with a historical and cultural side view.","984":"Adnexal tumors of the hair follicle can be regarded as lesions that show similar differentiation to one or more portions of the hair follicle. Trichoblastic carcinoma is a rare malignant adnexal tumor, which usually occurs on the scalp. There have been reported cases with regional lymph node metastasis. We report a case of a 65 years old man with a painless irregular mass of the posterior surface of the right pinna, which was slowly growing over a 5-year period. He had a history of a similar lesion on the same site, which was removed 8 years before he presented to us. We excised the lesion and the defect was covered with an advancing flap. Because of the histology result the patient was re-operated and reviewed for over 3 years and there wasn't any sign of recurrence.","985":"This report describes a rare case of a young woman with massive intra-abdominal bleeding due to a giant ruptured hepatocellular adenoma. The patient had never used oral contraceptive pills and she was urgently operated for haemorrhage control in another hospital where the left hepatic artery was also ligated. After haemodynamic stabilization in the ICU and because of a complicated postoperative course (signs of intraabdominal sepsis) she was transferred to our hospital and a left lobectomy was performed. We present the case and comment on the preferred treatment modalities of hepatocellular adenomas.","986":"We present a 7-year old girl with severe urolithiasis due to cystinouria. Medical treatment after the surgical procedures was initiated with intensive hydration, urine alkalinisation and captopril. We discuss the therapeutic efficacy of captopril in resolving lithiasis as well as in preventing new stone formation.","987":"The cochlear implantation is among the most important achievements of medicine and biotechnology in the last 20 years, because it allows individuals who had never heard or had lost their hearing to perceive sound and improve their quality of life. Selection criteria for candidates are strict and are evaluated in each individual by a scientific committee specially trained for implantations which includes Ear Nose and Throat (ENT) surgeon, audiologist, psychiatrist and speech therapist. In our department, the first cochlear implantation was performed in 1995. During the last ten years more than 250 individuals have been evaluated due to profound hearing loss and 170 of them were found to be suitable candidates for cochlear implantation. One hundred and fifty (150) have already been operated and most of them are children with congenital hearing loss. No major or permanent complications were recorded in any of our 150 patients. Activation and fitting\/mapping of the cochlear implant is initiated three weeks post-operatively. Regular follow-up and mapping of the implant are held, more frequently in children, along with specialized speech therapy. Each new mapping is evaluated according to the record of the patient with regard to the acoustic perception of sounds and speech and the discrimination of individual elements of phonation based on a protocol that we have created for the needs of Greek language. Speech discrimination (AHEPA Hospital protocol), before the Implantation, at the activation of the cochlear implant and till 4 years of the follow-up showed that in our patients, we obtained better and faster results in post-speech acquisition adults with recent or chronic deafness and in children with congenital deafness operated before the 5th year of age, who underwent special preoperative speech therapy programme, fact which is in agreement with current literature. Patient satisfaction evaluated by \"Sanders\" psychometrics tests, was achieved in accordance to pre-operative expectations. In our patients, we observed better and faster results in children with congenital deafness operated before the third year of age, in post-speech acquisition adults with recent deafness and in post-speech acquisition adults with chronic deafness but with auditory memory reserve. ","988":"Hypertension is associated with more rapid progression of chronic kidney disease. Several studies have shown that treating hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria may attenuate the decline in glomerular filtration rate. The study evaluates the prevalence of hypertension and its association with chronic kidney disease progression in patients without and with diabetic nephropathy. Patients with CKD stage 2-4 were followed up by a nephrologist for 12-52 months. A total of 137 patients were included in the study, 70 with non-diabetic CKD and 67 with type 2 diabetes and diabetic nephropathy. Demographic and clinical parameters were recorded at initiation and during follow-up. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by the Cockroft-Gault formula and progression of CKD by the slope of the estimated GFR decline. Out of 70 patients in the non-diabetic group, 34 were males, (mean age 50.37+\/-12.2 years). Out of 67 diabetic patients, 30 were (males, mean age 57.8+\/-8.4 years). 77% in the non-diabetic group had SBP above 140 mmHg. The higher SBP was associated with older age, (53.16+\/-10.8 vs 40.9+\/-12.2 years, p&lt;0.0001). Diastolic blood pressure above 90 was present in 73%. Pulse pressure above 80 had 5.7% and was associated with older age (p&lt;0.02). Progression of chronic kidney disease correlated inversely with age, and positively with diastolic blood pressure and proteinuria (p=0.005, p=0.019 and p=0.02 respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that only younger age and higher proteinuria were predictive for chronic kidney disease progression (p=0.00002). 6% of pts in the diabetic group had SBP below 140, 19% between 140 and 160, and 75% above 160 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure below 80 had only 6% of patients, between 80 and 90 had 37% and above 90 mmHg had 57%. Pulse pressure below 80 mmHg had 55% and it was correlated positively with age, p=0.009. Progression of chronic kidney disease in the diabetic group correlated positively with mean arterial pressure, systolic blood pressure and proteinuria, (p=0.017, 0.036 and 0.000000 respectively) and inversely with age (p=0.0003). Multiple regression analysis showed that proteinuria, age and SBP were the only predictors for chronic kidney disease progression in diabetics. Isolated systolic hypertension predominates the older age groups, proteinuria and age significantly correlate with GFR decline in both groups, and SBP is associated with more rapid progression of CKD in the diabetic patients. ","989":"In the past it was widely believed that pain and itching are transmitted by the same nerve pathway with the low intensity stimulation of unmyelinated polymodal C fibers resulting in sensation of pruritus whereas high intensity stimulation causing pain. In recent experiments however, stimulation of single unmyelinated C fibers led to the identification of two kinds of fibers. Stimulation of most of these fibers induces pain, whereas a small number of fibers provoke the sensation of itching. Pruritus is an unpleasant sensation, often accompanied by scratching. It may present due to a number of cutaneous diseases or internal disorders. Pruritus may be caused by some chemical substances as histamine, prostaglandins, proteases and substance P. This review describes the existence of pruritus in different internal disorders. It is quite important the reason of pruritus to be discovered, for the application of an adequate therapy.","990":"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the seventh most frequent cancer in European women. Many theories have been postulated regarding the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. Risk factors are not well defined, with the exception of low parity and oral contraceptive use. Approximately 10% of ovarian cancer are hereditary, with BRCA1 and BRCA2 explaining the majority (approximately 90%) of hereditary ovarian cancer cases. The lifetime risk varies between 15 and 66%, suggesting the existence of modifying genetic or environmental factors.Family history can be used to define women who are at increased risk of ovarian cancer. Individuals at high risk are those with a first degree relative (mother, father, sister, brother, daughter or son) affected by cancer. It must be noted that currently available tests do not attain the aforementioned high level of sensitivity. Evidence suggest that presymptomatic screening by grey scale ultrasound (with or without Doppler), CA125, pelvic examination, or combinations of these, are not effective in detecting tumors at an early stage. Women identified as being at high risk of ovarian cancer can be offered prophylactic oophorectomy. The decision whether or not to proceed to prophylactic oophorectomy is influenced by the fact that most women at increased risk of ovarian cancer are also at increased risk of breast cancer and there is evidence that oophorectomy reduces breast cancer in these cases.","991":"Assessing airway inflammation is important for investigating the underlying mechanisms of many lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and cystic fibrosis. A growing interest has recently directed toward non-invasive methods for the assessment of airway inflammation. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide in exhaled air is an exciting innovative technique that gives new insights into the pathophysiology of lung disease and asthma in particular, with many potential clinical applications. Careful standardisation of measurement techniques has facilitated the use of this new measurement in paediatric respiratory medicine. Non-invasiveness and instantaneous results potentially make it a suitable instrument for use in children starting from the age of 4, with useful applications both in asthma diagnosis and monitoring.","992":"We report a case of diamniotic, dichorionic pregnancy presented at 24 weeks with premature rupture of the first amnionic sac. Seven days later, premature labour and delivery of the first twin took place, with unfortunate outcome. The second twin was left in utero. The management included combination of tocolytics, antibiotics and cervical cerclage. Caesarean section was performed 48 days later, at 32 weeks and we delivered a live male infant, successfully.","993":"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of death among hemodialysis (HD) patients, yet the risk factors for these events have not been well established. Our study objective was to determine predictors of cardiovascular mortality, considering the non-traditional\/disease-related and treatment-related\/ cardiovascular risk factor in HD patients. Disease-related cardiovascular risk factors, such as anaemia, calcium-phosphate disorders, nutrition-inflammation and treatment\/dialysis-related cardiovascular risk factors such as HD dose, using the index Kt\/V were analyzed in 214 patients on HD. Mortality was monitored prospectively over a two year period. Fifty-three of the 214 HD patients died during the follow-up period and the main cause of death was cardiovascular events (56.6%), followed by infection\/sepsis (26.4%). The patients who died were significantly older than those alive, had significantly lower serum levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin and Kt\/V. Serum levels of calcium, C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen were significantly higher in patients who died during the follow-up period. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the all cause and cardiovascular mortality was considerably higher in patients with Hb&lt;110 g\/l, albumin &lt;40 g\/l, CRP&gt;8 mg\/l and spKt\/V&lt;1.2 (log rank, p=0.000\/p=0.000, p=0.000\/ p=0.001, p=0.000\/p=0.000, p=0.000\/p=0.000), respectively. No difference in cardiovascular mortality was observed between the fibrinogen &lt;4 g\/l&gt; levels. High CRP, low Hb levels and low spKt\/V were significant predictors of all-cause mortality, but low albumin and high fibrinogen levels were not in the Cox proportional hazards analysis. When only cardiovascular mortality was entered into the Cox model, high CRP and low Hb levels were the only significant predictors for mortality. It can be concluded that, inflammation (elevated CRP) and anaemia (decreased Hb), were identified as significant independent non-traditional, disease-related cardiovascular risk factors that predict cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. ","994":"The last decade the external approach has gained enormous popularity in rhinoplastic surgery and it is a relatively new technique in Greece for the correction of functional and aesthetic problems of the nose. We introduce our experience in open rhinoplasty, we describe the operative technique, its advantages. In a period of two years (2003-2005), 98 patients underwent open rhinoplasty in our department. In 42 of them, breathing problems were existed in combination with nasal deformities. Eighty seven patients underwent septo\/rhinoplasty under general anesthesia and the other 11 under local anesthesia. The postoperative course was uneventful, painless and without postoperative bleeding in all patients. Postoperative photo documentation was performed in all of them after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Only two patients needed to undergo revision surgery (the first patient due to \"polly beak\" deformity and the second one due to postoperative nasal valve stenosis). The scar of broken columella incision was invisible in all patents some weeks postoperatively. In open approach in Rhinoplasty, as provides a full exposure of the osseocartilaginous vault, it is much more easier to perform all the modern rhinoplasty techniques with sutures, biological and non biological materials, to modify the nasal tip deformities and asymmetries and to gain an aesthetic result balanced with the other facial components. Its disadvantages are minimal, that's why it becomes every day more popular all over the world. ","995":"Intravenous iron and erythropoietin are commonly used for the treatment of anemia in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Even though i.v. iron is proven to be very effective, there is great concern regarding its possible toxic effects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible correlation between iron administration and the incidence of angina pectoris in hemodialysis patients. The study sample consisted of 10 stable coronary heart disease patients, receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment. The patients followed consecutively three different i.v. iron dose regimens according to their needs. Their standard monthly laboratory measurements were correlated with the incidence of angina pectoris and i.v. iron treatment. Hematocrit, ferritin, serum iron and mean rhEPO dose were related to the total amount of administered iron. Angina pectoris was related to intensive iron treatment, age and platelet count. Total white blood cell count were related to hemodialysis duration, platelet count and serum triglycerides. It is suggested that the intensive intravenous iron treatment (300 mg\/week) is associated with the increased incidence of angina pectoris in stable coronary heart disease patients receiving hemodialysis. ","996":"Preclinical and clinical evaluation of amifostine (AMI) administration in conjunction with systemic chemotherapy supports its role as a cytoprotective agent of normal tissues without loss of impairing the antitumour effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents. Since only a limited number of clinical studies has been performed using AMI in paediatric pts with malignancies we investigated the protective effect of AMI against carboplatin-induced myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in a paediatric group of patients. AMI was administered in 18\/28 paediatric patients with reccurent solid tumours along with ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide) chemotherapy. A significant (p&lt;0.05) decrease in GFR was observed in the control group whereas it was maintained at pre-treatment levels in the AMI-treated group. Leukopenia and neutropenia were significantly (p&lt;0.05) less in AMI-group. No protective effect of AMI was shown concerning thrombocytopenia. AMI was generally well tolerated at the dose of 740 mg\/m2. Side effects including nausea, vomiting, hypotension, flushing and rigors were moderate and reversible and the interruption of infusion was never required. ","997":"Interventional Nephrology is a new and emerging subspecialty of Nephrology that mainly deals with ultrasonography of kidneys and ultrasound-guided renal biopsy, insertion of peritoneal dialysis catheters, tunneled dialysis catheters as a vascular access for patients undergoing hemodialysis as well as percutaneous endovascular procedures performed to manage dysfunction of arteriovenous fistulas or grafts in end stage renal disease patients. Traditionally, these procedures have been delegated to a variety of specialists with resultant delays in diagnosis and initiation of therapy. To avoid the delays nephrologists have taken the initiative to perform these procedures themselves. Indeed, recent data have emphasized that nephrologists can safely and successfully perform these procedures with excellent results. The success of nephrologist's role in Interventional Nephrology insures the ideal management of renal patients with effectiveness, safety and lower cost for Public Health System. Certainly nephrologists must have adequate training and develop the necessary skills in the new fields as a prerequisite for the success of the concept.","998":"The ultimate goals of preoperative medical assessment are to reduce the patient's surgical and anesthetic perioperative morbidity or mortality, and to return him to desirable functioning as quickly as possible. It is imperative to realize that \"perioperative\" risk is multifactorial and a function of the preoperative medical condition of the patient, the invasiveness of the surgical procedure and the type of anesthetic administered. A history and physical examination, focusing on risk factors for cardiac and pulmonary complications and a determination of the patient's functional capacity, are essential to any preoperative evaluation. Laboratory investigations should be ordered only when indicated by the patient's medical status, drug therapy, or the nature of the proposed procedure and not on a routine basis. Persons without concomitant medical problems may need little more than a quick medical review. Those with comorbidity should be optimized for the procedure. Proper consultations with appropriate medical services should be obtained to improve the patient's health. These consultations should ideally not be done in a \"last second\" fashion. The preoperative preparation involves procedures that are implemented based on the nature of the expected operation as well as the findings of the diagnostic workup and the preoperative evaluation.","999":"Advances in the field of kidney transplantation have led to a significant increase in the life of renal allograft with 1-year graft survival rates of 93% to 99%. This increase in early graft survival has made it possible to observe the long-term morbidities that accompany renal transplantation. Studies correlating the reduction of arterial blood pressure with patient and graft survival as well as the risk of cardiovascular disease do not exist. The recommendations come from the general population and from comparative studies of hypertensive and normotensive kidney graft recipients. It is known that in the general population hypertension is a risk factor for chronic kidney disease but at the same time a risk factor for death, ischaemic heart disease, chronic heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy. We must always have in mind that there are many similarities between a kidney graft recipient and a patient with chronic kidney disease. Renal transplant recipients represent a patient population with a very high risk for development of cardiovascular disease which has been identified as the leading cause of death in these patients. Of 18,482 deaths among renal allograft recipients, 38% had functioning renal allografts. Successful renal transplantation (Rt) can result in partial regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if it is associated with hypertension (HTN) remission or if HTN is controlled by medications. Frequently post transplant HTN is associated with failure of LVH to regress. Transplant clinicians must choose antihypertensive agents that will provide their patients with maximum benefit from renal allograft and cardiovascular perspective. The target must always be long term patient and graft survival and acceptable quality of life. The antihypertensive drugs usually used after kidney transplantation are diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers and beta-blockers. Most emphasis is given lately to ACEIs\/ARBs and beta-blockers because of their cardioprotecive effect.","1000":null,"1001":"During the third stage of labour there are a lot of causes of significant hemorrhage. The commonest causes of acute hemorrhage are the uterine atony, the retained placenta, the lower tract lacerations, uterine rupture, placenta accreta, hereditary coagulopathy. Also, there could be significant bleeding, during caesarian section, usually at the time of removal of the placenta in cases of low lying placenta or placenta previa. A lot of times we have to confront serious hemorrhages in gynecological procedures like hysterectomies in cases of cervical, uterine or ovarian cancers. In order to deal with these problems successfully, general and specific measures are being taken. In cases of atonic uterus when all the other methods are unsuccessful we have to proceed to ligation of the internal iliac artery or even hysterectomy. We have tried to use the hemostatic type I collagen in obstetrical and gynecological cases in order to control the bleeding. We have used the collagen type I totally in 8 cases. Five of them were cases of atonic uterus after normal delivery or caesarian section and three of them were gynecological cases of uterine fibroids and ovarian cancer. By placing the collagen type I over the bleeding surfaces we have realized that in a very short period of time, there has been satisfactory control of the bleeding and immediate clinical improvement of the patient. In four out of five obstetrical cases that we have used the type I collagen, we have managed to avoid the hysterectomy. ","1002":null,"1003":"Background - Aim: The distraction and stabilization provided by anterior cervical discectomy and fusion contribute to neural decompression and optimize osteogenesis. A new titanium cervical implant with specific properties was applied through an anterior approach in ten pigs. Implant behavior regarding in situ position and related osteogenesis were evaluated. In this controlled animal study, the progress of fusion and osteogenesis was evaluated after one level cervical interbody fusion with a new titanium cage. Ten pigs underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. No substitutes stimulating osteoblastic activity were used. Plain radiographs were carried out. The animals were euthanised 12 and 14 weeks after the operation respectively. Tissue samples were processed routinely and studied histologically. All pigs survived the surgery. Plain radiographs confirmed implant position. Histological analysis demonstrated fibrous connective tissue formation inside and around the implant which was largely transformed into cartilaginous and osseous tissue. Intervertebral space stabilization remains a parameter of crucial importance for early bone healing after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The new titanium alloy cage tested in this experimental study can offer the necessary stabilization for osteogenesis and adequate cervical interbody fusion without the need of growth factors. ","1004":"To study the morbidity of the operation, to investigate it's safety and effectiveness in order to establish if it is reasonable to offer it as treatment to patients in one sitting instead of a staged procedure. Finally, to indentify the patient's long term satisfaction and to establish best practice. Retrospective case series study and prospective telephone interview. Teaching General Hospital, Scotland, UK. 14 patients with dysthyroid orbitopathy who underwent the operation over a 4 year period. Proptosis improved in all but one of the cases. There was a relatively small morbidity and short inpatient stay. A significant amount of patients reported satisfaction with the results. All patients expressed strong preference for the simultaneous procedure instead of a staged one. The study shows that for the management of orbitopathy , bilateral simultaneous orbital decompression with endoscopic approach is a safe and effective operation, with small morbidity and significant patient satisfaction. Therefore, it is reasonable to offer it to patients instead of a staged procedure. ","1005":"Aim. In patients with advanced and\/or inoperable bronchial tumors, methods of palliative care such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, brachytherapy and cryotherapy, singly and\/or in combination, aiming at extending the survival time and improving the quality of life, were examined. Methods. One hundred and sixty three (163) patients, with mean age 67.9 yrs (range 22-25) and a male\/female ratio at 1.34\/1, treated between 2000-2004 were studied. Eighty one (81) patients receiving only cryotherapy presented a two-year survival rate at 19.3%, whilst eighty three (83) patients treated with radiotherapy or brachytherapy and\/or chemotherapy showed a two-year survival rate at 25%. Sixty-five percent (65%) of patients only cryotreated had improvement in at least one or more Karnofsky and WHO indices. Results. Eighty percent (80%) of patients who received cryotherapy accompanied with supplementary palliative treatment showed amelioration of their clinical status. Conclusion. It seems that for patients with advanced or inoperable lung tumors, cryotherapy associated with additional palliative care may influence the survival time and improve their quality of life.","1006":"Breast cancer remains to be one of the most malignant diseases in the female population. It affects an essential part of female self-consciousness, and therefore causes a wide range of psychological traumas. The incidence in Europe and North America varies between 70 up to 100 new cases in 100.000 inhabitants per year. According to contemporary literature, mastectomy remains one of the most effective methods in the laborious effort to treat and overcome cancer. In this report the history of breast reconstruction is presented. The established methods which are taken into consideration after mastectomy and their clinical outcome are portrayed. The authors propose the free TRAM and DIEP flap as the methods of first choice after mastectomy, which offer most reliable transfer and low morbidity. In the recent past, increasing interest is observed for the SIEA flap. The free S-GAP flap is proposed for patients who are not candidates for a TRAM, DIEP or SIEA flap. Moreover, the pedicled Latissimus Dorsi flap remains still as a reliable, versatile alternative, particularly in case of contraindications for the above mentioned free flaps or when complications occurred.","1007":"Magnesium depletion in clinical practice is mainly related to loop diuretics and thiazides. Among patients treated with diuretics more than 1\/3 exhibit hypomagnesa. Arrhythmias and sudden death attributed to magnesium depletion could be prevented by Mg administration. Magnesium deficiency in experimental animals promotes atherosclerotic lesions whereas this ion is involved in various stages of myocardial damage after experimental coronary artery occlusion. In humans magnesium administration in the first 24 hours of myocardial infarction was related to beneficial effects in first year mortality rate. Nevertheless more evidence from clinical investigation is needed for permanent conclutions.","1008":"The aim of this study is the presentation of the imaging findings in patients with pulmonary embolism, the diagnosis of which was made with the use of helical computed tomography. The lung CT scans of 14 patients were retrospectively studied. The presence of hypoattenuating thrombus within the lumen of one or more pulmonary arterial branches was considered as the imaging criterion for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. Emboli within the lumen of 1st order branches were found in 2 patients, within the lumen of 2nd order branches in 8 patients, into the lumen of 3rd order branches (lobar) in 10 patients and into the lumen of 4th order branches (segmental) in 6 patients. No emboli were detected in subsegmental or more peripheral branches. Concomitant, secondary findings were the presence of unilateral pleural effusion, areas of pulmonary oligaemia and the presence of a wedge-shaped, pleural-based opacity, indicative of a pulmonary infarct. In conclusion, we were able to make the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism through the direct visualization of intraluminal emboli up until the segmental level, as well as of concomitant, accessory findings of pulmonary embolism. ","1009":"Preeclampsia (PE) is a pregnancy complication usually of the third trimester. The clinical manifestations are hypertension and proteinuria with or without edema. Its pathogenesis is characterized by generalized vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the Doppler ultrasound examination of the renal interlobar vessels in pregnancy complicated with preeclampsia in the context of the theory about the increased vessel resistance in this pregnancy disorder. Fifty two women aged 16-38, (mean age 23+\/-9.54) streamed into three groups were examined by abdominal ultrasound in Triplex regime. The first group included 18 pregnant with PE, the second 21 women in the third trimester of normal pregnancy, and the third group 13 non-pregnant women. In all 3 groups the renal volume (RV) and parenchyma volume (PV) were determined by conventional ultrasound (CU). The doppler waveform analysis (DWA) of the interlobar renal arteries (IRA) gave the following indices: resistance index (RI), pulsatility index (PI), peak systolic velocity (Vmax) and end diastolic velocity (Vmin). RESULTS. RV and PV in the PE group were significantly higher then those of the healthy pregnant women: RV: 231.4+\/-58 to 187+\/-45, p&lt;0.05 and for PV: 200+\/-11 to 130+\/-6.78, p&lt;0.05. Such a difference was not found out for the healthy pregnant women compared to the non-pregnant ones. No significant differences of the examined doppler indices were found in the three groups. Although the arteriolar vasoconstriction and the tissue hypoxia are leading in the PE pathogenesis, the DWA of the IRA in PE pregnancy does not differ from those of the healthy pregnant and nonpregnant women. As one of the most frequently used imaging technique Doppler Ultrasound (DU) of the renal IRA and DWA of these vessels shows no diagnostic advantage as compared to the renal CU in pregnancy complicated with PE. ","1010":"Breast cancer is the most frequent type of cancer of women in the western world. Antiestrogens, including Tamoxifen (OHT) and Faslodex (ICI), are widely used in the endocrine treatment of breast cancer. However, the majority of breast cancers are either resistant to endocrine therapy or eventually become unresponsive to antiestrogen therapy. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern tumour proliferation, is therefore needed to develop new therapies for the disease. The Forkhead family of transcription factors plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation, cell death and differentiation.The estrogen receptor (ER) a positive breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and the ERa negative line MDA-MB-231 was used to study the potential regulation of the Forkhead member FOXM1 by ER. It was indicated that estrogen and ER regulate the expression of FOXM1 at the protein level. Since Forkhead proteins play an important role in regulating cell proliferation, cell death and differentiation, this study helps to explain some of the functions of ER in tumourigenesis, and the way these Forkhead proteins could be crucial targets for therapeutic strategies and\/or markers for diagnosis and prognosis.","1011":"Conventional treatment of normogonadotropic anovulatory infertility is ovulation induction using the antiestrogen clomiphene citrate, followed by follicle-stimulating hormone. Multiple follicle development, associated with ovarian hyperstimulation, and multiple pregnancy remain the major complications. Cumulative singleton and multiple pregnancy rate data after different induction treatments are needed. Newer ovulation induction interventions, such as insulin-sensitizing drugs, aromatase inhibitors and laparoscopic ovarian electrocoagulation, should be compared with conventional treatments. Ovulation induction efficiency might improve if patient subgroups with altered chances for success or complications with new or conventional techniques could be identified, using multivariate prediction models based on initial screening characteristics. This would make ovulation induction more cost-effective, safe and convenient, enabling doctors to advise patients on the most effective and patient-tailored treatment strategy.","1012":"p53 is the main intrinsic factor inducing apoptosis by recognizing the external stimuli and activating the p53 responsive genes to an irreversible series of events. P53 activates the transcription of specific proapoptotic genes called p53 target genes. A growing number of p53 responsive genes have been identified and numerous studies have demonstrated that p53 proapoptotic factors such as Noxa, Puma and Perp play cell type specific roles in p53's mediated response to certain stimuli. Perp (p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22) is a direct proapoptotic target gene encoding a tetraspan protein. Perp is highly expressed in cells undergoing apoptosis compared to cells under G1 arrest and its overexpression is sufficient to cause cell death in fibroblasts. Noxa is another member of the preapoptotic p53 genes family. When expressed Noxa acts in a BH3 motif-dependent localization to mitochondria, causing structural changes, activation of caspase 9 and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Puma (p53 mutant of apoptosis) is another critical mediator of p53-dependent apoptosis. P53 binds to Puma-promoter gene sites, leading to puma production. The mtCLIC, a member of intracellular chloride channels, is a cytoplasmic and mitochondrial protein positively regulated by p53. Caspase 10 is induced in p53-dependent manner leading to cellular apoptosis. Other newly announced factors are also involved in p53-regulated apoptosis such as brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor-1 (BSAI1), MSOD and GPX genes. A global discussion on this topic is attempted in the present review article.","1013":"Ever since RNA interference (RNAi) was discovered in the early 1990s, a number of scientists from the academic and biotechnology world have continued to view it as the revolutionary discovery of the century. Unequivocally, RNAi can be considered as an important regulator of gene expression in many eukaryotic cells. The term RNAi describes a natural process by which a double-stranded RNA molecule, when introduced into the cell is processed into short RNA duplexes and drives gene silencing by specific and distinct mechanisms. Many of the players involved in this cellular defense network have been elucidated but a more complete understanding of the process is essential. Worldwide interest on RNAi in the last decade is mainly attributed to its power as a laboratory tool for the experimental manipulation of gene expression. RNAi assisted already in the dissection of numerous cellular pathways and revealed the role of many proteins in an approach aimed to drug discovery. This new technology has the potential to improve our understanding of physiologic and pathologic processes and lead to the discovery of new drugs. More importantly, there is growing interest among the scientific community for the potential therapeutic applications of RNAi.","1014":"Gestational diabetes mellitus and new-onset hypertension, which includes gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, are common complications of pregnancy. Many features of the insulin resistance syndrome have been associated with these conditions. These include glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, obesity, and lipid abnormalities. Other accompanying abnormalities may include elevated serum levels of leptin, TNFalpha, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and testosterone. The establishment of these features before the onset of gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension in pregnancy suggests that insulin resistance or associated abnormalities may play a role in these disorders. These observations suggest that therapeutic interventions to reduce insulin resistance may lower the risk of both gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertension in pregnancy.","1015":"Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome after kidney transplantation affects an increasing number of patients. It is characterized as recurrent and de novo. Older age at onset of HUS, shorter mean interval between HUS and transplantation or ESRD, living related donor and treatment with CNI have been associated with an increased risk of recurrence. Patients who lost the first transplant because of HUS recurrence should not receive a second transplant. The outcome of recurring HUS after transplantation is worse in familial forms leading invariably to graft loss and for this reason doctors should discourage the use of living related donors in this setting. De novo HUS is not a rare complication after kidney transplantation and may be associated with infection, CNI or mTOR inhibitor toxicity, antibody use (OKT3), or acute vascular rejection. The clinical picture is obscure and treatment rests on removal of inciting factor with or without plasma exchange\/FFP infusion."},"articletitle":{"0":"Congenital ulcerated subcutaneous fat necrosis in a newborn - an unusual entity.","1":"Paraganglioma syndrome type 4 presenting as hypertensive encephalopathy in an 8-year-old boy.","2":"Primary adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction, combined with an obscure hepatoid adenocarcinoma component, as discovered after the development of a metachronous liver metastasis.","3":"Customized compared to population-based centiles for detecting term small for gestational age infants in Greece.","4":"Theatrical performance in medical education: A fast-track differential approach of emergency cases.","5":"Vitamin D in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.
