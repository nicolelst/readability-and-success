Lentiviral vector technology, highly modified from HIV-1, is used to induce stable, long-term transgene expression by integration into the host genome. This integration may interfere with HIV-1 NAAT producing false-positive results. Guidance for HIV diagnostic testing in pediatric B-ALL undergoing this type of therapy is lacking. Herein, we report case series with presented scenarios in which HIV-1 NAAT testing among CAR-T cell patients produced false-positive results, highlighting the importance careful assay selection and performance among this patient population.","3":null,"4":"Pregnant women at public medical centers in Porto Alegre, Brazil, were recruited for a study on screening and treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

Baloxavir might be more beneficial than neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), as suggested by a subgroup analysis of a clinical trial. Although the association between baloxavir prescription and healthcare use pertains mainly to influenza A, few studies have investigated the association in influenza B. We evaluated the healthcare utilization of children (0-15 years old) treated with either baloxavir or NAIs between December 2018 and May 2019 using claims records in Japan. The primary endpoint was the composite of medical resource utilization, including hospitalization, antibiotic use, laboratory tests, radiological images, and fluid replacement therapy, over 1-9 days after antiviral prescription. Secondary outcomes representing each single outcome in the composite were examined. Subgroup analyses comparing baloxavir with each NAI were also performed. Of 4490 patients with influenza B who received antiviral treatment, 51.6% were male, and the median age was 8 years old. Baloxavir was prescribed for 29.4% of the population, and NAIs were prescribed for 70.6%. In the total cohort, 49.3% of patients had any comorbidity related to complicated influenza infection. Concerning the composite endpoint, baloxavir prescription was not associated with a risk of subsequent medical resource use (adjusted odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 0.90-1.38; P = 0.34). Secondary outcomes and subgroup analyses showed similar results to the primary outcome. In a single-year comparative study in Japan, baloxavir prescription for influenza B was not associated with less healthcare consumption than NAIs within 9 days of treatment.

Induced sputum (IS) is an attractive option for the evaluation of the lower respiratory tract. Children aged 0-18 years with CAP were enrolled in the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study between 2010 and 2012. Blood and respiratory specimens were assessed by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The radiographic CAP was determined by a study radiologist. Sputum was induced with hypertonic saline. IS specimen was high quality (HQ) if Gram stain showed &gt;25 white blood and &lt;10 epithelial cells per low-powered field; all others were low quality (LQ). We compared IS pathogen prevalence between HQ and LQ IS, and by radiographic pneumonia. Pathogen concordance with EPIC etiology was assessed. Length of stay (LOS) was compared by receipt of IS pathogen-concordant antibiotics. Out of 977 children, 916 (94%) children enrolled in Memphis, Tennessee, produced IS; 794 (87%) had radiographic CAP and 174 (19%) were HQ. HQ IS yielded pathogenic bacteria more often than LQ (64% vs 44%; P &lt; .01); however, pathogens were isolated at similar rates in HQ IS in patients with and without radiographic CAP (64% vs. 63%; P = .6). Pathogens from study specimens matched an IS pathogen in only 9\/42 (21%) patients with radiographic CAP. Median LOS was similar among patients with radiographic CAP regardless of receipt of IS pathogen-concordant antibiotics (3.1 days), non-pathogen-concordant antibiotics (2.7 days), or no antibiotics (3.2 days; P = .5). Bacterial pathogens were isolated from most IS cultures regardless of radiographic CAP and quality of IS. IS cultures infrequently corresponded with sterile site cultures.

We determined SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in children and adolescents from Arkansas over the first year of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We tested remnant serum samples from children ages 1-18 years who visited Arkansas hospitals or clinics for non-COVID-19-related reasons from April 2020 through April 2021 for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We used univariable and multivariable regression models to determine the association between seropositivity and participant characteristics. Among 2357 participants, seroprevalence rose from 7.9% in April\/May 2020 (95% CI, 4.9-10.9) to 25.0% in April 2021 (95% CI, 21.5-28.5). Hispanic and black children had a higher association with antibody positivity than non-Hispanic and white children, respectively, in multiple sampling periods. By spring 2021, most children in Arkansas were not infected with SARS-CoV-2. With the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, recognition of long-term effects of COVID-19, and the lack of an authorized pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccine at the time, these results highlight the importance of including children in SARS-CoV-2 public health, clinical care, and research strategies.

The levels of anti-spike (S) IgG, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) were measured during various time points in children &lt;19 years of age with COVID-19 in South Korea from February 2020 to September 2020. One hundred sixty-five blood samples from 114 children with COVID-19 (43.9% asymptomatic and 56.1% mildly symptomatic) were analyzed. In both asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic children, the positive rates of anti-S IgG, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and NAb were low within 7 days after onset, but they soon reached 100% 14 to &lt;28 days after onset. In symptomatic children, the geometric mean titers (GMTs) of antibodies were all below the positive cutoff during the first 2 weeks from onset and peaked at 28 to &lt;56 days (5.6 for anti-S IgG, 383.6 for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, and 55.0 for NAb, P &lt; .001, respectively).

Infants with early-onset neonatal sepsis born in Connecticut during 2007-2016 were identified from statewide surveillance data and matched with a statewide hospital discharge database. We describe readmission rates, causes and timing of readmissions, and demographic and clinical factors associated with readmission among this group. Among 241 infants with early-onset neonatal sepsis matched to discharge data, 203 (84.2%) infants survived their initial hospitalization at birth. During the first year of life, 47 (23.2%) infants were readmitted, most often in the first 3 months after birth (n = 29, 42.6%). The most frequent reasons for readmissions were pulmonary complications (19%), infections (17%), and gastrointestinal illness (13%). Infants with initial hospitalizations lasting longer than 30 days after birth were associated with higher rates of readmission compared with those discharged within 30 days after birth (35% vs 19%, P = .02).

We evaluated the impact of viral radiographic features on antibiotic treatment among children undergoing pneumonia evaluation in the emergency department (ED). Children presenting to a pediatric ED who underwent a CXR for pneumonia evaluation were prospectively enrolled. Prior to CXR performance, physicians indicated their level of suspicion for pneumonia. The CXR report was reviewed to assess for the presence of viral features (peribronchial cuffing, perihilar markings, and interstitial infiltrate) as well as radiographic features suggestive of pneumonia (consolidation, infiltrate, and opacity). The relationship between viral radiographic features and antibiotic treatment was assessed based on the level of clinical suspicion for pneumonia prior to CXR. Patients with normal CXRs (n = 400) and viral features alone (n = 370) were managed similarly, with 8.0% and 8.6% of patients receiving antibiotic treatment, respectively (P = .75).

Among children with isolated viral features on CXR, antibiotic treatment rates were correlated with pre-CXR level of suspicion for pneumonia. Among children with suspected pneumonia, the presence of viral features alone on CXR is not associated with increased rates of antibiotic use.

Concerns over speed and actionability, assay validation, liability, cost, and payment models lead to further opportunities for work in this area. Now accelerated by funding for COVID-19, the use of genomics in hospital outbreak investigations has firmly moved from the academic literature to more quotidian operations, with associated concerns involving regulatory affairs, data integration, and clinical interpretation.

Categories were sorted according to the attributable proportion of encounters with an antibiotic prescribed. The proposed metric-the Antibiotic Likelihood Index (ALI)-was defined as the proportion of encounters with an antibiotic prescribed among categories that accounted for &gt;80% of all encounters with an antibiotic prescribed. The ALI was calculated for the entire network and for individual prescribers, and the distribution among prescribers was described.

The most important interventions to reduce the risk of transmission include contact precautions, hand hygiene, and environmental disinfection. Glove use minimizes contamination of the hands by spores and is associated with reductions in CDI incidence. Hand hygiene with soap and water and disinfection with a sporicidal agent are recommended as the best approaches in hyperendemic settings. Because antibiotic exposure is the most important modifiable risk factor for CDI, antimicrobial stewardship focused on identified high-risk antibiotic classes (including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) is critical to preventing progression from colonization to infection. Despite clear evidence that antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are associated with reduced CDI rates in adults, data demonstrating the ASP impact on pediatric CDI are lacking.","65":"Clostridioides difficile is a prominent cause of health care-related gastrointestinal illness in adults. C. difficile infection (CDI) has been researched for over 40 years; however, research on pediatric CDI specifically has lagged behind for various reasons. Over the past decade, C. difficile has been increasingly reported as a cause of a broad spectrum of gastrointestinal diseases in children, ranging from mild self-limiting diarrhea to severe conditions such as pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. Recent publications have shown a rise in CDI incidence in children in different parts of the world, especially in patients with particular comorbidities such as hematological malignancies and inflammatory bowel disease. In addition, rising CDI rates have been reported in children in the community without traditional risk factors for CDI. Due to the extensive use of sensitive molecular detection methods to diagnose CDI in many countries, differentiating children who require treatment from those colonized with toxigenic strains remains a problem. Consequently, the molecular epidemiology of pediatric CDI is poorly understood. Even though well-known C. difficile strains causing CDI in children have been described (including hypervirulent strains such as ribotypes 027 and 078), there is a paucity of information about specific C. difficile strains. This mini-review summarizes the information that is currently available on the molecular epidemiology of CDI in children.","66":"Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming, obligate anaerobe, and ubiquitous nosocomial pathogen. While C. difficile infection in adults causes a spectrum of disease, including pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon, healthy infants are asymptomatically colonized at high rates. The mechanisms leading to high colonization rates and infant protection from C. difficile are currently unknown; however, the ecology and metabolic state of the intestinal microbiome are factors known to influence C. difficile pathogenesis. In this review, we will examine the aspects of the early-life microbiome that may contribute to the incidence of C. difficile and protection from disease manifestation in infants. We will also discuss whether features of the adult microbiota that enable and restrict C. difficile are prevalent during early-life colonization.","67":"Children with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) can experience recurrent or severe disease. Recurrent CDI occurs in 20%-30% of children with an initial CDI episode. A careful clinical evaluation is important to distinguish recurrent CDI from other disorders that cause recurring gastrointestinal symptoms. Multiple treatment options exist for recurrent CDI, but the optimal therapeutic approach remains undefined. Severe or fulminant CDI can result in poor outcomes and significant morbidity in children. Since there is not a validated definition for severe CDI in children, physicians must use their clinical judgment to identify patients with severe CDI to institute appropriate therapy. In this review, we describe the diagnostic and management challenges in caring for children with recurrent and severe CDI.","68":"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) in children is more often acquired in the community than in the hospital. Community-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CA-CDI) cases seem to be rising, although this is confounded by the unclear role of C. difficile in children 1 and 3 years of age and overreliance on nucleic acid amplification tests for diagnosis. Exposure to antibiotics, acid suppression medications, health care settings, and close contacts with CDI are associated with CA-CDI in children. These infections are more common in children with chronic medical conditions, especially those involving the gastrointestinal tract and immune suppression. Most CA-CDI in children are mild and managed in the outpatient setting, but a small subset requires hospitalization and can be quite severe. Approximately 10% of children with CA-CDI experience a recurrence. Infection control guidance focuses on the hospital setting and future studies on the best methods for preventing community spread of C. difficile are needed.","69":"Clostridioides difficile infection is very common in immunocompromised children. Management is confounded by frequent asymptomatic colonization, multiple alternative etiologies for gastrointestinal symptoms, and high rates of relapse. Important considerations include indications for testing, appropriate choice of diagnostic tests, antibiotic therapy for initial and subsequent episodes, and primary and secondary prevention.","70":"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the most common cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and has high rates of recurrent disease. As a disease associated with intestinal dysbiosis, gastrointestinal microbiome manipulation and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) have evolved as effective, although relatively unregulated therapeutics and not without safety concerns. FMT for the treatment of CDI has been well studied in adults with increasing data reported in children. In this review, we discuss the current body of literature on the use of FMT in children including effectiveness, safety, risk factors for a failed FMT, and the role of FMT in children with comorbidities. We also review emerging microbial therapeutics for the treatment of rCDI.","71":"Although the pathogenesis of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is complex and incompletely understood, it is believed that the elaboration of C. difficile toxins is necessary for disease. There are a variety of tests available for the detection of both the C. difficile organism and its toxins; however, each has limitations and the best application of these tests to the diagnosis of CDI in children remains uncertain. Nucleic acid amplification tests are unable to reliably discriminate between CDI and C. difficile colonization, while commercially available enzyme immunoassays for toxin detection lack sensitivity. An understanding of preanalytic factors, relevant patient features, and test performance characteristics is essential to the accurate diagnosis of CDI in children. Specific diagnostic stewardship strategies can also increase the likelihood that positive tests reflect disease rather than colonization. Ultimately, CDI remains a clinical diagnosis and clinical judgment is essential when interpreting test results, regardless of the methods used.","72":"","73":"While rates of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) are increasing among children in the United States, studies assessing CDI treatment in children are severely lacking. Thus, treatment guidelines have historically relied on evidence from limited observational data in children and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adults to form recommendations. Currently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA) recommend metronidazole and\/or vancomycin for pediatric CDI depending on disease severity. Recently however, the first and only RCT of CDI treatment in children demonstrated fidaxomicin to be non-inferior to vancomycin, proving its safety and efficacy in this population. Additionally, observational data published since the IDSA\/SHEA guidelines were released suggest metronidazole has lower rates of clinical improvement when compared to vancomycin in hospitalized children with non-severe CDI. Given these recent publications, fidaxomicin and vancomycin, instead of metronidazole, appear to be more appropriate, evidence-based options for the treatment of CDI in children.","74":"Clostridioides difficile has become the most common healthcare-associated pathogen in the United States, leading the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to classify C. difficile as an \"urgent\" public health threat that requires \"urgent and aggressive action.\" This call to action has led to new discoveries that have advanced our understanding of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) immunology and clinical development of immunologic-based therapies for CDI prevention. However, CDI immunology research has been limited in pediatric populations, and several unanswered questions remain regarding the function of host immune response in pediatric CDI pathogenesis and the potential role of immunologic-based therapies in children. This review summarizes the innate and adaptive immune responses previously characterized in animals and humans and provides a current update on clinical development of immunologic-based therapies for CDI prevention in adults and children.

Seropositivity against all 3 poliovirus serotypes was assessed using a microneutralization assay at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA. Analyzable data were obtained from 236 out of 285 (82.8%) enrolled children. Seroprevalence of polio antibodies for serotypes 1, 2, and 3 was 214\/236 (90.7%); 145\/236 (61.4%); and 196\/236 (86.2%), respectively. For serotype 2, the seroprevalence significantly increased with age (P = .004); chronic malnutrition was a significant risk factor for being type 2-seronegative. Poliovirus type 2 seroprevalence in young children was considered insufficient to protect against the spread of paralytic diseases caused by VDPV2. Indeed, VDPV2 outbreaks were reported from Chad in 2019 and 2020. High-quality immunization response to these outbreaks is needed to prevent further spread.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) is a simple, rapid, and specific point-of-care molecular diagnostic test. However, evaluation of its performance remains limited in children. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Eiken TB-LAMP among children with presumed tuberculosis disease. Pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens were collected from children under 18 years with presumed TB. Each specimen was tested by using TB-LAMP, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy, and one of the two molecular assays (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or Xpert MTB\/RIF). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated compared to mycobacterial culture as reference standard. From January 2020 to January 2021, 75 participants with presumed TB were enrolled with median age of 7 years (IQR 2-12). Seventeen specimens from 16 (21.3%) children had bacteriologically confirmed TB: 10 pulmonary and 7 extrapulmonary specimens. Overall sensitivity and specificity of TB-LAMP was 76.5% (95% CI 50.1%-93.2%) and 100% (95% CI 94.3%-100%), respectively. It had significantly higher sensitivity than AFB (52.9%, 95% CI 27.8%-77.0%) and similar to other molecular assays; PCR 82.4% (95% CI 56.6%-96.2%), Xpert MTB\/RIF 70.0% (95% CI 34.8%-93.3%).

This multinational observational cohort study enrolled patients aged &gt;120 days and &lt;18 years with proven invasive candidiasis from January 1, 2014, to November 28, 2017, at 43 International Pediatric Fungal Network sites. Primary exposure was initial directed therapy administered at the time qualifying culture became positive for yeast. Exposure groups were categorized by receipt of an echinocandin vs receipt of triazole\/amphotericin B. Primary outcome was global response at 14 days following invasive candidiasis onset, adjudicated by a centralized data review committee. Stratified Mantel-Haenszel analyses estimated risk difference between exposure groups. Seven-hundred and fifty invasive candidiasis episodes were identified. After exclusions, 541 participants (235 in the echinocandin group and 306 in the triazole\/amphotericin B group) remained. Crude failure rates at 14 days for echinocandin and triazole\/amphotericin B groups were 9.8% (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 6.0% to 13.6%) and 13.1% (95% CI: 9.3% to 16.8%), respectively.

The life cycle of C. difficile illustrates an interdependent relationship between bile acids, commensal microbiota, and C. difficile. Primary bile acids are critical for the germination of C. difficile spores in the small intestine, while secondary bile acids serve as a counterbalance to inhibit the growth of the organism in the colon. Many commensal bacteria especially Clostridium spp. are responsible for transforming primary bile acids into secondary bile acids. Antibiotics eliminate bacteria that convert primary bile acids into secondary bile acids and, thus, allow C. difficile to flourish and cause diarrhea. In children younger than 2 years of age, who normally only produce primary bile acids, colonization with toxin-producing C. difficile is exceedingly common. The reason for the absence of C. difficile diarrhea in the children remains unexplained.","158":"Antibiotic overuse contributes to antibiotic resistance, which is a threat to public health. Antibiotic stewardship is a practice dedicated to prescribing antibiotics only when necessary and, when antibiotics are considered necessary, promoting the use of the appropriate agent(s), dose, duration, and route of therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the unintended consequences of antibiotic use. Because there are differences in common infectious conditions, drug-specific considerations, and the evidence surrounding treatment recommendations (eg, first-line therapy and duration of therapy) between children and adults, this statement provides specific guidance for the pediatric population. This policy statement discusses the rationale for inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs); essential personnel, infrastructure, and activities required; approaches to evaluating their effectiveness; and gaps in knowledge that require further investigation.

We investigated the epidemiology of sHCoV infection during the first year of life, including risk factors and association with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We conducted a nested case-control study of infants enrolled in a birth cohort near Cape Town, South Africa, from 2012 to 2015. LRTI surveillance was implemented, and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected fortnightly over infancy. Quantitative PCR detected respiratory pathogens, including coronaviruses-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1. Swabs were tested from infants at the time of LRTI and from the 90 days prior as well as from age-matched control infants from the cohort over the equivalent period. In total, 885 infants were included, among whom 464 LRTI events occurred. Of the 4751 samples tested for sHCoV, 9% tested positive, with HCoV-NL63 the most common. Seasonal HCoV detection was associated with LRTI; this association was strongest for coronavirus-OC43, which was also found in all sHCoV-associated hospitalizations. Birth in winter was associated with sHCoV-LRTI, but there were no clear seasonal differences in detection. Co-detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae was weakly associated with sHCoV-LRTI (odds ratio: 1.8; 95% confidence interval: 0.9-3.6); detection of other respiratory viruses or bacteria was not associated with sHCoV status. Seasonal HCoV infections were common and associated with LRTI, particularly sHCoV-OC43, which is most closely related to the SARS group of coronaviruses. Interactions of coronaviruses with bacteria in the pathogenesis of LRTI require further study.

This fungal pathogen was initially identified in 2009 in Japan, but it has spread to all continents. Candida auris poses significant diagnostic and treatment challenges. Conventional microbiology laboratories often misidentify this pathogen as Candida haemulonii or as other Candida spp., Rhodoturola glutinis, and even with some bacterial pathogens, including Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A. Furthermore, C. auris displays distinct mechanisms of antifungal resistance to azoles and amphotericin B formulations. Most of the case series and outbreak reports have included invasive infections in adult populations. Herein, we present a cluster of neonatal infections caused by Candida auris at a large referral center in Colombia. We report a case series of 8 neonates and infant patients who were seen at a large referral center in Colombia and who develop invasive infections caused by C. haemulonii and C. auris. Our report highlights the diagnostic challenges in identifying this fungal pathogen correctly, its clinical spectrum of disease, recommendations for empiric antifungal therapy, and it is not always associated with a high case fatality rate.

Antimicrobial stewardship supports short-course antibiotics, but how long antibiotic concentrations remain therapeutic post-last dose is unknown. Using Monte Carlo simulations (NONMEM 7.3), we analyzed antibiotic exposures in a retrospective cohort of 34 689 neonates (&lt;1500 g, 22-27 weeks of gestation). Therapeutic exposure for ampicillin and gentamicin was evaluated relative to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for common pathogens (MIC 0.25-8 mcg\/mL for group B streptococcus [GBS] and Escherichia coli). Post-discontinuation antibiotic exposure (PDAE) was defined as the time from the last dose to time when concentration decreased below MIC. Neonates had a median (range) gestational age of 26 (22-27) weeks and BW, 790 g (400-1497) . All ampicillin dosing regimens (50-100 mg\/kg every 8-12 hours for 2-6 doses) achieved therapeutic exposures &gt; MIC range. After the last dose, the PDAE mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) ranged from 34 to 50 hours (17-79) for E. coli (MIC 8) and 82 to 104 hours (95% CI: 39-122) for GBS (MIC 0.25); longer PDAE occurred with higher dose, shorter interval, and longer course. Short-course ampicillin (2 doses, 50 mg\/kg every 12 hours) provided PDAE 34 hours for E. coli and 82 hours for GBS. Single-dose 5 mg\/kg gentamicin provided PDAE &gt; MIC 2 for 26 hours. In VLBW neonates, ampicillin exposure remains therapeutic long after the last dose. Short-course ampicillin provided therapeutic exposures throughout the typical blood culture incubation period.

In total, 1905 children with bacterial meningitis (BM) were documented in the Beijing Children's Hospital medical record database. A total of 43 patients had RBM. The rate of RBM in children was 2.3% (43\/1905). Forty (93.0%) patients had predisposing conditions, including 15 (34.9%) cases of inner ear malformations, 5 (11.6%) cases of dermal sinus tracts, 9 (20.9%) cases of head injury, 5 (11.6%) cases of congenital cranial meningocele, 3 (7.0%) cases of congenital skull base defects, 3 (7.0%) cases of immunodeficiency, and other 3 (7.0%) cases of unknown reason. Among all the 121 BM episodes, a total of 64 episodes were etiologically confirmed BM and the other 57 episodes were probable BM. Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 52) was accounted for 81.3% of confirmed BM episodes. Thirty-four of the 37 patients with congenital or acquired anatomical defects were available to follow up after surgeries, and all of them had no BM after surgeries. Three patients with antibody deficiencies got intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and they did not suffer BM anymore. RBM is rare in children. The majority of children with RBM had predisposing conditions including congenital\/acquired anatomical defects and immunodeficiency.

We implemented pretransplant serology testing of HHV-6 in a large pediatric hospital and retrospectively assessed the incidence, manifestations and outcomes of HHV-6 infections over a 3-year period. Among 101 pediatric LT recipients, 96 had pretransplant HHV-6 serologies; 34 (35.4%) were seronegative and 62 (64.6%) seropositive. Posttransplantation, 8\/25 (32%) seronegative patients had HHV-6 DNAemia (primary infection) compared to 2\/48 (4%) seropositive patients (p=0.002). Compared to seropositive patients, seronegative patients with HHV-6 DNAemia were younger, and had symptoms of fever and\/or elevated aminotransferases in association with higher viral loads, in the first month post-transplant. More than 90% of seronegative patients and 77.8% of seropositive patients had HHV-6 detected by PCR in liver biopsy obtained for concerns of allograft rejection, but most had no detectable concomitant DNAemia. Active replication of virus in the liver was confirmed by in situ hybridization in select cases. While HHV-6 infection occurred among patients on prophylaxis doses of antivirals for CMV, HHV-6 DNAemia and presenting symptoms resolved on treatment doses. HHV-6 DNA-emia occurred more frequently in seronegative pediatric LT recipients, usually in the early posttransplant period, and was subsequently detected in allograft biopsies. HHV-6 cannot be ruled out as a cause of hepatitis in the absence of allograft tissue testing and specialized virological assays, as HHV-6 may disrupt local allograft immune homeostasis while evading traditional screening methods using blood or plasma. The assessment of pre-transplant HHV-6 serological status may be important for risk stratification and post-transplant management of pediatric LT recipients.

A retrospective review was performed to determine the frequency of BKV-HC and identify risk factors and renal morbidity associated with BKV-HC in pediatric HSCT recipients at our institution. A total of 314 pediatric recipients underwent allogeneic HSCT for either malignant (173, 55.1%) or nonmalignant disorders (141, 44.9%) from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015, with a minimum follow-up of 5 years post-HSCT. Severe BKV-HC (grades 3 and 4) was prevalent in 46 out of 67 (68.7%) recipients. Timing to presentation of severe BKV-HC (grades 3 and 4) occurred at a median of 37 days (26, 74; IQ1, IQ3) post-HSCT, with the duration of macroscopic hematuria lasting a median of 37.5 days (18, 71; IQ1, IQ3). In the first 60 days post-HSCT, peak acute kidney injury (AKI) stages 2 and 3 were seen more frequently in HSCT recipients who developed BKV-HC than those without (P = .004). Similarly, during post-HSCT days 61 to 100, peak AKI stage 3 was also more frequently seen in HSCT recipients who already developed BKV-HC prior to or during this time period than those without BKV-HC (P = .0002). Recipients who developed BKV-HC within 1 year of HSCT had more frequent mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD stages 2-3) than those without BKV-HC (P = .002 and .007, respectively). On multivariate analysis, BKV-HC was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.35-3.65). The following clinical variables were associated with time to development of HC on multivariate analysis: age (subdistribution HR [sHR] 1.11; 95% CI: 1.06-1.16) and myeloabalative conditioning regimen (sHR 4.2; 95% CI: 2.12-8.34).

","173":"Xpert MTB\/RIF Ultra (Xpert Ultra) has improved the sensitivity to detect pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in adults. However, there have been limited prospective evaluations of its diagnostic accuracy in children. We enrolled children undergoing assessment for pulmonary TB in Kampala, Uganda, over a 12-month period. Children received a complete TB evaluation and were classified as Confirmed, Unconfirmed, or Unlikely TB. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert Ultra among children with Confirmed vs Unlikely TB. We also determined the diagnostic accuracy with clinical, microbiological, and extended microbiological reference standards (MRSs). Of the 213 children included, 23 (10.8%) had Confirmed TB, 88 (41.3%) had Unconfirmed TB, and 102 (47.9%) had Unlikely TB. The median age was 3.9 years, 13% were HIV-positive, and 61.5% were underweight. Xpert Ultra sensitivity was 69.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.1-86.8) among children with Confirmed TB and decreased to 23.4% (95% CI: 15.9-32.4) with the clinical reference standard. Specificity was 100% (95% CI: 96.4-100) among children with Unlikely TB and decreased to 94.7% (95% CI: 90.5-97.4) with a MRS. Sensitivity was 52.9% (95% CI: 35.1-70.2) and specificity 95.5% (95% CI: 91.4-98.1) with the extended MRS. Of the 26 positive Xpert Ultra results, 6 (23.1%) were \"Trace-positive,\" with most (5\/6) occurring in children with Unconfirmed TB.

","174":"While it is clear that first trimester congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection can lead to serious neonatal and childhood adverse outcome, the extent of the effect of second and third trimester congenital CMV infection is still unclear. Our aim was to study the short- and long-term outcomes following second and third trimester infection and to evaluate the contribution of prenatal imaging in a prospective cohort. We studied pregnant women with primary CMV infection in the second and third trimesters, as diagnosed by well-dated seroconversion, and proof of vertical CMV transmission. All patients underwent serial prenatal ultrasound (US) and most of them fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Follow-up information was obtained from hospital charts and by telephone interviews with parents. Primary CMV infection occurred in 135 patients, 107 and 28 with second and third trimester infection, respectively. The incidence proportion of composite outcome (hearing loss or neurodevelopmental impairment) following second trimester infection was 7% (7\/100, after excluding cases that were terminated) with a 3% incidence of partial unilateral sensory neural hearing loss and a 5% incidence of minor neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including slight verbal and motor delay. Following third trimester infection, there was one case of a very mild motor delay. The incidence proportion of abnormal prenatal findings on US or MRI was not significantly correlated to hearing loss or neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Second trimester infection is associated with a slight risk of developing mild childhood sequelae, mostly partial unilateral hearing loss, which may develop late in childhood. Prenatal imaging failed to predict the development of childhood adverse outcome. ","175":"We explored the nasal microbiota in Indigenous Australian children in relation to ear and nasal health. In total, 103 Indigenous Australian children aged 2-7 years (mean 4.7 years) were recruited from 2 Queensland communities.

URT microbiota were characterized using culturomics with Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) identification. Real-time PCR was used to quantify otopathogen (Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) loads and detect respiratory viruses. Data were analyzed using beta diversity measures, regression modeling, and a correlation network analysis. Children with historical\/current otitis media (OM) or URT infection (URTI) had higher nasal otopathogen detection and loads and rhinovirus detection compared with healthy children (all P &lt; .04). Children with purulent rhinorrhea had higher nasal otopathogen detection and loads and rhinovirus detection (P &lt; .04) compared with healthy children. High otopathogen loads were correlated in children with historical\/current OM or URTI, whereas Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum and Dolosigranulum pigrum were correlated in healthy children. Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum and D. pigrum are associated with URT and ear health. The importance of the main otopathogens in URT disease\/OM was confirmed, and their role relates to co-colonization and high otopathogens loads.

This has challenged clinicians to determine the best approach to use of these products. A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacy, pediatric intensive care medicine, and pediatric hematology from 29 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a guidance statement was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. The course of COVID-19 in children and adolescents is typically mild and there is no high-quality evidence supporting any high-risk groups. There is no evidence for safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, limited evidence of modest benefit in adults, and evidence for potential harm associated with infusion reactions or anaphylaxis. Based on evidence available as of December 20, 2020, the panel suggests against routine administration of monoclonal antibody therapy (bamlanivimab, or casirivimab and imdevimab), for treatment of COVID-19 in children or adolescents, including those designated by the FDA as at high risk of progression to hospitalization or severe disease. Clinicians and health systems choosing to use these agents on an individualized basis should consider risk factors supported by pediatric-specific evidence and ensure the implementation of a system for safe and timely administration that does not exacerbate existing healthcare disparities.

Maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was initially deemed uncertain; however, recently a few cases of vertical transmission have been reported. The intrauterine mechanisms, besides direct vertical transmission, leading to the perinatal adverse outcomes are not well understood. Multiple maternal, placental, and neonatal swabs were collected for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Serology of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in maternal, umbilical cord, and neonatal blood. Placental examination included immunohistochemical investigation against SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression, with SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy. RT-qPCRs of the oropharynx, maternal blood, vagina, placenta, and urine were all positive over a period of 6 days, while breast milk, feces, and all neonatal samples tested negative. Placental findings showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles with generalized inflammation characterized by histiocytic intervillositis with diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions with damage to the syncytiotrophoblasts. Placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 leads to fibrin depositions hampering fetal-maternal gas exchange with resulting fetal distress necessitating a premature emergency cesarean section. Postpartum, the neonate showed a fetal or pediatric inflammatory multisystem-like syndrome with coronary artery ectasia temporarily associated with SARS-CoV-2 for which admittance and care on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were required, despite being negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Total household cost per illness episode, including direct and indirect costs and lost income, was reported by parents\/guardians at the initial visit and 6 weeks post discharge. The total cost to the health system was based on patient charts and hospital expenditures. All-cause acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and RSV costs for inpatient and outpatients are presented separately. All costs are in the 2018 US Dollar. The mean costs per RSV episode were $62.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $50.87-$73.66) and $12.51 (95% CI: $8.24-$16.79) for inpatient and outpatient cases, respectively.

Household costs accounted for roughly 20% of the total cost per episode. For the lowest-income families, household cost per inpatient RSV episode was about 32% of total monthly household income. Among infants receiving care at a referral hospital in Malawi, the cost per episode in which RSV was detected is comparable to that of other episodes of respiratory illnesses where RSV was not detected.

The fourth boy had mitral and aortic regurgitation that rapidly regressed after steroids. KD, myocarditis, and MIS-C were distinguishable cardiovascular manifestations. KD did not show a more aggressive form compared with previous years: coronary involvement was frequent but always transient. MIS-C and myocarditis rapidly responded to treatment without cardiac sequelae despite high markers of myocardial injury at the onset, suggesting a myocardial depression due to systemic inflammation rather than focal necrosis. Evidence of actual or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was documented only in patients with MIS-C.

Further exploration is needed for the application of Sinovac EV71 vaccine in older children. A phase III, double-blind, single-center, randomized, controlled, non-inferiority, and bridging-designed trial enrolled 300 participants aged 6-35 months and 600 participants aged 36-71 months. Non-inferiority and superiority analyses were made to determine the immunogenicity of Sinovac EV71 vaccine in older children (Older-S group), comparing with that of control EV71 vaccine in the same age group (Older-C group), or comparing with that of Sinovac EV71 vaccine in younger children (Younger-S group). The seroconversion rate of anti-EV71 in Older-S group (95.5%) was superior to that of Older-C group (86.0%), and non-inferior to that of Younger-S group (98.5%). For baseline seronegative participants, the geometric mean titer of Older-S group (370.0) was non-inferior to that of Older-C group (296.2) and superior to that of Younger-S group (176.5). Incidence of adverse reactions in Older-S group (47.0%) was similar to that of Older-C group (44.8%), or Younger-S group (49.8%).

Associated infections include Epstein Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus, and influenza. To our knowledge, this is the first report of LU occurring with murine typhus. Murine typhus is caused by Rickettsia typhi, a Gram-negative, obligate intracellular organism. Rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) are the classic vector, although cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) found on cats, dogs, and opossums have been implicated in maintaining the life cycle of R. typhi in suburban areas. Murine typhus can have a nonspecific presentation making a strong index of suspicion crucial to its diagnosis. The most common presenting signs include fever, poor appetite, malaise, and headache. Laboratory abnormalities may include elevated C-reactive protein, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hypoalbuminemia, elevated transaminases, elevated neutrophil band count, and thrombocytopenia. The treatment of choice for R. typhi is doxycycline.","193":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody responses in children remain poorly characterized.

We evaluated PCV10 impact on the carriage of vaccine-type (VT), non-VT, and antimicrobial non-susceptible pneumococci 3 years after introduction. We conducted cross-sectional carriage surveys among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children aged 6 weeks to 59 months: 1 pre-PCV10 (2012-2013 [Baseline]) and 2 post-PCV10 introductions (2014-2015 [Post1] and 2015-2016 [Post2]). Pneumococci isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs underwent Quellung serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Non-susceptible isolates (intermediate or resistant) were defined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute 2018 breakpoints. We used log-binomial regression to estimate changes in the pneumococcal carriage between survey periods. We compared proportions of non-susceptible pneumococci between Baseline and Post2. We enrolled 720 children at Baseline, 911 at Post1, and 1208 at Post2. Baseline VT carriage was similar for HIV-uninfected (36.0%, 110\/306) and HIV-infected children (34.8%, 144\/414). VT carriage was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 19%-49%) and 27% (95% CI: 11%-41%) lower in Post1 vs baseline among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children, respectively. VT carriage prevalence declined in Post2 vs Post1 for HIV-uninfected but remained stable for HIV-infected children. VT carriage prevalence 3 years after PCV10 introduction was 14.5% in HIV-uninfected and 21.0% in HIV-infected children. Pneumococcal isolates non-susceptible to penicillin declined from 66.0% to 56.2% (P= .0281) among HIV-infected children. VT and antimicrobial non-susceptible pneumococci carriage dropped after PCV10 introduction, especially in HIV-uninfected children.

In 2019, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) Telehealth Working Group surveyed PIDS members to collect data on the use of TH modalities, adoption barriers, interest, extent of curbside consultations (CCs), and reimbursement. Of 1213 PIDS members, 161 (13.3%) completed the survey, and the responses of 154 (12.7%) from the United States were included in our report. Medical school (63.6%) and hospital (44.8%) were the commonest work settings with 16.9% practicing in both of them. The most common TH modalities used were synchronous provider-patient virtual visits (20.8%) and synchronous provider-provider consultations (13.6%). TH services included outpatient consultations (48.1%), vaccine recommendations (43.5%), inpatient consultations (39.6%), and travel advice (39.6%). Barriers perceived by respondents included reimbursement (55.8%), lack of experience with TH (55.2%), lack of institutional support (52.6%), lack of administrative support (50%), and cost of implementation (48.7%). Most of the respondents (144, 93.5%) were interested in implementing a wide range of TH modalities. CCs accounted for 1-20 hours\/week among 148 respondents. Most of the PIDS survey respondents reported low utilization of TH and several perceived barriers to TH adoption before the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, they expressed a strong interest in adopting different TH modalities. They also reported spending considerable time on non-reimbursed CCs from within and outside their institutions. The results of this survey provide baseline information that will allow comparisons with post-COVID-19 changes in the adoption of TH in PID.

Because of the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, there are several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently in late-stage clinical trials, so the ACIP is now meeting monthly for single day meetings, with plans to continue standard 2- to 3-day meetings as per usual (February, June, and October). Emergency meetings of ACIP may occur if a vaccine candidate receives an Emergency Use Authorization from the food and drug administration (FDA). This Update provides a combined summary of the August 26 and September 22, 2020, meetings, both of which focused completely on Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines.

Negative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing associated with positive serology in most of the cases suggests a postinfectious syndrome. Because the pathophysiology of this syndrome is still poorly understood, extensive virological and immunological investigations are needed. We report a series of 4 pediatric patients admitted to Geneva University Hospitals with persistent fever and laboratory evidence of inflammation meeting the published definition of MIS-C related to COVID-19, to whom an extensive virological and immunological workup was performed. RT-PCRs on multiple anatomical compartments were negative, whereas anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were strongly positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence. Both pseudoneutralization and full virus neutralization assays showed the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all children, confirming a recent infection with SARS-CoV-2. The analyses of cytokine profiles revealed an elevation in all cytokines, as reported in adults with severe COVID-19. Although differing in clinical presentation, some features of MIS-C show phenotypic overlap with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). In contrast to patients with primary HLH, our patients showed normal perforin expression and natural killer (NK) cell degranulation. The levels of soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2R) correlated with the severity of disease, reflecting recent T-cell activation. Our findings suggest that MIS-C related to COVID-19 is caused by a postinfectious inflammatory syndrome associated with an elevation in all cytokines, and markers of recent T-cell activation (sIL-2R) occurring despite a strong and specific humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Further functional and genetic analyses are essential to better understand the mechanisms of host-pathogen interactions.

The infant's symptoms, including their temporal appearance, were consistent with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A unique finding on colonic histology which may shed light on the pathogenesis of MIS-C was identified. The patient improved significantly following several anti-inflammatory treatments. The lag between the presentation of MIS-C and initial SARS-CoV-2 exposure, which may often be asymptomatic, together with the young age of our patient, makes this a challenging diagnosis. Clinicians should be aware of this entity, even in the neonatal and infantile age groups, to facilitate timely identification and treatment.","207":"Enteroviruses (EVs) occur frequently worldwide and are known to be associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild syndromes to neurological disease. To understand the epidemiology of EV in Korea, we characterized EV-infected cases during 2012-2019 based on national surveillance. We collected specimens from patients with suspected EV infections and analyzed the data using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and VP1 gene sequencing. Among the 18 261 specimens collected, EVs were detected in 6258 (34.3%) cases. Although the most common EV types changed annually, EV-A71, echovirus 30, coxsackievirus B5, coxsackievirus A6, and coxsackievirus A10 were commonly identified. Among the human EVs, the case numbers associated with the 2 major epidemic species (EV-A and EV-B) peaked in the summer. While EV-A species affected 1-year-old children and were associated with herpangina and hand, foot, and mouth disease, EV-B species were mostly associated with neurologic manifestations. The highest incidence of EV-B species was observed in infants aged &lt;12 months. Feces and respiratory specimens were the most predictive of EV infection. Specimens collected within 5 days of symptom onset allowed for timely virus detection. EV-A and EV-B species co-circulating in Korea presented different epidemiologic trends in clinical presentation, affected subjects, and seasonality trends. This study could provide information for the characterization of EVs circulating in Korea to aid the development of EV antivirals and vaccines, as well as public health measures to control enteroviral diseases. ","208":"Acute respiratory tract infections are a serious clinical burden in infants; human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is an important etiological agent. We investigated genotypic variation and molecular epidemiological patterns among infants infected with HMPV in Sarlahi, Nepal, to better characterize infection in a rural, low-resource setting. Between May 2011 and April 2014, mid-nasal swabs were collected from 3528 infants who developed respiratory symptoms during a longitudinal maternal influenza vaccine study. Sequencing glycoprotein genes permitted genotyping and analyses among subtypes. HMPV was detected by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 187 (5%) infants, with seasonality observed during fall and winter months. Phylogenetic investigation of complete and partial coding sequences for the F and G genes, respectively, revealed that 3 genotypes were circulating: A2, B1, and B2. HMPV-B was most frequently detected with a single type predominating each season. Both HMPV genotypes exhibited comparable median viral loads. Clinically significant differences between genotypes were limited to increased cough duration and general respiratory symptoms for type B. In rural Nepal, multiple HMPV genotypes circulate simultaneously with an alternating predominance of a single genotype and definitive seasonality. No difference in viral load was detected by genotype and symptom severity was not correlated with RT-PCR cycle threshold or genotype.

A consensus statement regarding classification of childhood tuberculosis excluded this condition, stating that more data were needed. To assist in this discussion, we reviewed early publications that reported the occurrence of this phenomenon and early anatomical pathology studies that described changes that occur in children following tuberculosis infection. Pathology studies describe frequent cavitation in primary foci in children from whom positive M. tuberculosis cultures might easily arise. These foci were very small in some children who might have normal CR. Positive cultures might also arise from ulcerated mediastinal lymph nodes that are invisible on CR. Young children with recent infection very likely have active primary pulmonary tuberculosis.","217":"","218":"","219":"The burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is poorly understood in pediatric patients due to frequent asymptomatic and mild presentations.

We tested sera from 485 children and observed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence of 1.0% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95%: 0.3%-2.4%). Two patients were positive by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), but only 1 seroconverted. Patients with oncologic diagnoses or SOT were most likely to be tested for COVID-19 when presenting with respiratory illness as compared with other groups. Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompromised children was similar to that of an immunocompetent pediatric population (0.6%, CI 95%: 0.3%-1.1%), suggesting an adequate antibody response. However, none of the patients who tested positive for antibodies or via NP RT-PCR had more than a mild illness course and 2 patients did not have any reported illness, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may not cause a worse clinical outcome in immunosuppressed children, in contrast to immunocompromised adults.

We determined the number of days since the last treatment (DSL) when the risk of RSV hospitalization among children with CLD becomes equivalent to the risk for those not qualified for immunoprophylaxis. The study cohort was assembled using Medicaid billing records from 1999 to 2010 linked to Florida and Texas birth certificate records. We developed DSL-trend discrete time logistic regression models within a survival analysis framework, adjusting for use of immunoprophylaxis, to compare the hospitalization risk of CLD infants at 4 age points to that of term infants at 1 month of age with siblings. The study cohort included 858 830 healthy term and 5562 preterm infants with CLD. Among 1-month-old term infants, the RSV hospitalization risk averaged across all covariate strata was 14.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.5-16.1) per 1000 patient season-months. Risk for preterm CLD children reached the threshold derived from term infants when DSL was 76 (95% CI, 22-198.5), 52 (95% CI, 6.5-123), 35 (95% CI, 0-93.5), and 12 (95% CI, 0-61.5) at the respective ages of 12, 15, 17.2, and 21 months.

This was a retrospective study of pediatric patients admitted to a quaternary children's hospital from 2007 to 2019 for operative management of sinusitis with intracranial extension. Clinical characteristics, including surgical and microbiological data, were collected and analyzed. Fifty-four patients were included; the median age was 11.0 years, and there was a male predominance. Eighty-nine percent of patients had prior healthcare visits for the current episode of sinusitis; 46% of patients had an abnormal neurologic exam on admission. Epidural abscess and subdural empyema were the most common complications, and subdural empyema was associated with repeat surgical intervention. The dominant pathogens were Streptococcus anginosus group organisms (74%). The majority of patients completed treatment parenterally, with a median duration of therapy of 35 days. Neurological sequelae, including epilepsy or ongoing focal deficits, occurred in 22% of patients. History of seizure or an abnormal neurological exam at admission were associated with neurological sequelae. Clinicians should consider intracranial complications of sinusitis in patients with symptoms of sinusitis for &gt;1 week. Patients should undergo urgent neuroimaging, as neurosurgical intervention is essential for these patients. Subdural empyema was associated with repeat neurosurgical intervention.

Using a systematic review of individual cases and case series and collating elements of the clinical course, the objective of this study was to provide a detailed clinical description and natural history of MIS-C. Case reports and series of MIS-C were recovered from repeated MEDLINE searches, a single EMBASE search, and table of contents reviews of major general medicine and pediatric journals performed between June 3 and July 23, 2020. Fever, evidence of inflammation, and evidence of organ dysfunction were required for inclusion. MEDLINE and EMBASE searches produced 129 articles, and 10 articles were identified from journal contents or article bibliographies; 16 reports describing 505 children with MIS-C comprise this review. Thirty-two children (14.7%) had negative results for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid and\/or antibody testing. The weighted median age was 9 years (6 months to 20 years). Clinical findings included fever (100%), gastrointestinal symptoms (88.0%), rash (59.2%), conjunctivitis (50.0%), cheilitis\/ \"strawberry tongue\" (55.7%), or extremity edema\/erythema (47.5%). Median serum C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer concentrations were above the normal range.

Data describing agents with potential antiviral activity continue to expand such that updated guidance is needed regarding use of these agents in children. A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 20 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of the best available evidence and expert opinion. Given the typically mild course of COVID-19 in children, supportive care alone is suggested for most cases. For children with severe illness, defined as a supplemental oxygen requirement without need for noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), remdesivir is suggested, preferably as part of a clinical trial if available. Remdesivir should also be considered for critically ill children requiring invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO. A duration of 5 days is appropriate for most patients. The panel recommends against the use of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir-ritonavir (or other protease inhibitors) for COVID-19 in children.

We conducted a point-prevalence study to assess SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR) results of hospitalized children, their asymptomatic caretakers, and caretaker-child test concordance at a major community hospital in New York City. We screened Children and caretakers with temperature measurements and the presence of COVID-19 symptoms before pediatric emergency department evaluation. Children requiring hospitalization and their caretakers had nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. The paired results are used to identify the infection control level at the appropriate pediatric unit. Forty consecutive asymptomatic caretaker-child pairs had SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing between May 28th to June 22nd, 2020. The rate of asymptomatic COVID-19 was 2.5% in hospitalized children and 7.5% in caretakers. The caretaker-child SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test concordance was evident in 95% of the cohort. This cohort had a low asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive rate in children and their caretakers with a high concordance rate of paired test results.

Although the majority of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections in pediatric populations result in minimal or mild COVID-19 in the acute phase of infection, a small subset of children develop severe and even critical disease in this phase with concomitant inflammation that may benefit from immunomodulation. Therefore, guidance is needed regarding immunomodulatory therapies in the setting of acute pediatric COVID-19. This document does not provide guidance regarding the recently emergent multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). A multidisciplinary panel of pediatric subspecialty physicians and pharmacists with expertise in infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology\/oncology, and critical care medicine was convened. Guidance statements were developed based on best available evidence and expert opinion. The panel devised a framework for considering the use of immunomodulatory therapy based on an assessment of clinical disease severity and degree of multiorgan involvement combined with evidence of hyperinflammation. Additionally, the known rationale for consideration of each immunomodulatory approach and the associated risks and benefits was summarized. Immunomodulatory therapy is not recommended for the majority of pediatric patients, who typically develop mild or moderate COVID-19. For children with severe or critical illness, the use of immunomodulatory agents may be beneficial. The risks and benefits of such therapies are variable and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with input from appropriate specialty services. When available, the panel strongly favors immunomodulatory agent use within the context of clinical trials.

The same patient returned 3 years later with an identical constellation of symptoms, at which time her PCR was positive for C. pneumoniae. In addition to IVIG and a macrolide, a corticosteroid treatment was administered. Here, we present the case of a pediatric patient with a recurrence of mucocutaneous disease that is more consistent with MIRM than the proposed SJS or erythema multiforme (EM) documented via histology. Our patient's symptoms were controlled with azithromycin and IVIG and, in the second episode, with corticosteroids as well. This case adds to that of Mayor-Ibarguren et al, providing further evidence that C. pneumonia may also be a trigger for MIRM. Patients will benefit from expanding the definition of MIRM, as the pathogenesis differs from SJS and EM and could result in more specific treatment options. ","310":"The timing and necessity of repeated blood cultures (BCs) in children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN) are unknown. We evaluated the diagnostic yield of BCs collected pre- and post-empiric FN antibiotics. Data collected prospectively from the Australian Predicting Infectious ComplicatioNs in Children with Cancer (PICNICC) study were used. Diagnostic yield was calculated as the number of FN episodes with a true bloodstream infection (BSI) detected divided by the number of FN episodes that had a BC taken. A BSI was identified in 13% of 858 FN episodes. The diagnostic yield of pre-antibiotic BCs was higher than of post-antibiotic cultures (12.3% vs 4.4%, P &lt; .001). Two-thirds of the post-antibiotic BSIs were associated with a new episode of fever or clinical instability, and only 2 new BSIs were identified after 48 hours of empiric antibiotics and persistent fever. A contaminated BC was identified more frequently in post-antibiotic cultures. In the absence of new fever or clinical instability, BCs beyond 48 hours of persistent fever have limited yield. Opportunity exists to optimize BC collection in this population and reduce the burden of unnecessary tests on patients, healthcare workers, and hospitals.

We developed an electronic surveillance algorithm to identify patients with SSIs. Our objective was to validate our algorithm by comparing it with our institutional National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIP Peds) data. We applied our algorithm to our institutional NSQIP Peds 2015-2017 cohort. The algorithm consisted of the presence of a diagnosis code for post-operative infection or the presence of 4 criteria: diagnosis code for infection, antibiotic administration, positive culture, and readmission\/surgery related to infection. We compared the algorithm's SSI rate to the NSQIP Peds identified SSI. Algorithm performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and Cohen's kappa.

From October 2014 through April 2015, clinician-ordered RSV tests identified laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalizations among children aged &lt;2 years at 4 influenza hospitalization surveillance network sites. Surveillance populations were used to estimate age-specific rates of RSV-associated hospitalization, after adjusting for detection probabilities. We extrapolated these rates using US census data.

We identified cases of invasive Hia disease, defined as detection of Hia from a normally sterile site, in children aged &lt;18 years from Utah between 2007 and 2017. Medical records were reviewed to determine demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes. Available Hia isolates were genotyped using multilocus sequence typing, and phylogenetic division was determined using sodC polymerase chain reaction.

Conceptually related items were grouped into 4 indexes: general infection control, use of health consultants, quality of child care, and pandemic influenza preparedness. These indexes, along with other center and director characteristics, were used to predict director-reported influenza vaccine requirements. Of 518 child care center directors, only 24.5% and 13.1% reported an influenza vaccine requirement for children and adult caregivers, respectively. Center and director characteristics and the indexes were not associated with a director-reported influenza vaccine requirement. After adjusting for covariates, only having a state influenza vaccine law for children and an adult influenza vaccine requirement predicted having a child influenza vaccine requirement. Only having a child influenza vaccine requirement predicted having an adult vaccine requirement. Director-reported influenza vaccine requirements for children and adult caregivers were influenced primarily by state influenza vaccine laws.

RN children had higher plasma levels of endothelin 1 (P = .003), platelet-derived growth factor (P = .012), and platelet factor 4 (P = .034). RP and RN CM may represent different phases of CM. RN CM may be driven by early vasospasm and platelet activation, whereas the more advanced RP CM is associated with greater inflammation, increased erythropoietic drive, blood-brain barrier breakdown, and neuronal injury, each of which may contribute to greater disease severity.

Also, molecular characterization of the MenB strain was conducted to determine whether bacterial antigens matched vaccine antigens. Among the 4 patients (2 girls), 2 had previous risk factors for IMD (recurrent bacterial meningitis of unknown origin and treatment with eculizumab). All patients developed meningitis, but only 2 developed septic shock; they were all cured without sequelae. No other primary or secondary immunodeficiencies were detected. MenB sequence type 213 was identified in 3 cases. With the exception of neisserial heparin-binding antigen peptide 465 present in 1 isolate, the rest of the isolated strains harbored vaccine antigen variants that did not match antigen variants included in the vaccine.

Representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics (Y. A. M. and D. W. K.) and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (S. T. O.) are present as liaisons to the ACIP. The ACIP met February 27 to 28, 2019, to discuss hepatitis A (HepA) vaccination of human immunodeficiency virus-infected persons, pneumococcal vaccination among adults aged 65 years or older, influenza vaccine effectiveness and safety, anthrax vaccination in the setting of a mass exposure, human papillomavirus vaccine, zoster vaccines, and Japanese encephalitis vaccine.","386":"We present here the first published use of letermovir for the treatment of resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a pediatric patient. A 14-year-old girl underwent a double unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation to treat her sickle cell disease (hemoglobin SS) and developed ganciclovir-resistant CMV DNAemia with end-organ involvement that was treated successfully with a combination of foscarnet and letermovir. After she was transitioned to letermovir monotherapy for secondary prophylaxis, she developed recurrent DNAemia with laboratory-confirmed ganciclovir, foscarnet, and letermovir resistance.","387":"Pediatric patients make a substantial contribution to the epidemiologic profile of sporotrichosis in Jilin Province, a region of China in which the disease is strongly endemic. However, the exact epidemiologic and clinical manifestations of childhood sporotrichosis in China are unclear. The medical records of 704 pediatric patients aged &lt;15 years with sporotrichosis diagnosed by fungus culture at the Department of Dermatology at the First Hospital of Jilin University in a 7-year period (January 2010 to December 2016) were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were from rural areas of Jilin Province, located in northeast China. Among the 704 pediatric patients, the male\/female ratio was 1.41:1, and the highest incidence of sporotrichosis (63%) occurred in those aged 0 to 6 years; 561 patients (80%) contracted sporotrichosis in a colder month. Overall, 655 (93%) patients had lesions in the facial region, whereas 602 (86%) patients had fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis. The incidence of the fixed cutaneous form in the 0- to 6-year age group was significantly higher than that in the 7- to 14-year age group (P = .009). Patients were treated with 10% potassium iodide solution, itraconazole, or terbinafine. The characteristics of pediatric sporotrichosis in Jilin Provence include the following: (1) a more frequent occurrence in the colder months; (2) the facial region is affected predominantly, in most cases manifesting in the fixed cutaneous form; and (3) significantly more cases occur in younger children than in older ones. Decaying cornstalks used as fire materials might be the source of infection in this population; however, additional research is needed to explore the exact mechanism of infection.

Complete-series rotavirus vaccination coverage is &lt;75% in the United States, and it might be lower among vulnerable populations. We describe here the clinical characteristics and vaccination status of children during a rotavirus outbreak in a pediatric subacute care facility in 2017. Clinical history, signs and symptoms, and vaccination history were abstracted for the 26 patients residing in the facility during the time of the outbreak. A case-patient was defined as one who experienced 3 or more loose stools in a period of 24 hours with onset between April 17 and May 17, 2017. Stool samples from 14 resident patients were tested for rotavirus with reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The median patient age at the facility was 2.9 years. Of the 26 resident patients, 22 (85%) met the case definition. One child died. Stool samples from 11 case-patients were positive according to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction for rotavirus. Fifteen case-patients were unvaccinated against rotavirus; 3 were partially vaccinated, and 2 were fully vaccinated. Vaccination status could not be completely determined in 2 cases. An outbreak of rotavirus affected nearly all resident patients of a subacute care facility and caused 1 death. Because of recommendations against giving rotavirus vaccine in an intensive care setting, infants who require a prolonged intensive care stay might age out of rotavirus vaccine eligibility (the first dose must be given before 15 weeks of age according to Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations). The result is a vulnerable population of unvaccinated infants who might later congregate in another care setting.

We identified 20 cases of invasive infection, only 2 of which involved children, and 7 cases of noninvasive infection. The reports originated in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Of those with invasive infection, 16 (80%) patients had an underlying chronic disorder or had received immunosuppressive therapy, 8 (40%) had fungemia, and 6 (30%) had a central nervous system infection.

Given improved survival rates from advances in the treatment of malignancies, the population at risk for mucormycosis is increasing. We conducted a systematic review of cases of mucormycosis in children in the English-language literature reported between August 2008 and June 2017 and analyzed the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, management, and outcome of those infections. The most common underlying diagnoses included neutropenia (41%), hematologic malignancy (39%), prematurity (13%), and hematopoietic stem cell transplant (11%). Sinus disease (28%) and disseminated disease (24%) were the most common presentations. Rhizopus spp were the most common organisms isolated (22%). Amphotericin B remains the backbone of treatment and was prescribed in 86% of these cases. The resulting mortality rate remains high (32%).

We included infants born in New York City between 2016 and 2017 who had or were born to a woman who had laboratory evidence of ZIKV infection during pregnancy. We conducted provider\/patient interviews and reviewed medical records to collect information about the pregnant women and, for infants, clinical and neurodevelopmental status at birth and 2, 6, and 12 months of age. Of the 404 infants who met inclusion criteria, most (385 [95.3%]) appeared well, whereas 19 (4.7%) had a possible ZIKV-associated birth defect. Seven had congenital ZIKV syndrome, and 12 were microcephalic without other abnormalities. Although infants with congenital ZIKV syndrome manifested clinical and neurodevelopmental sequelae during their first year of life, all 12 infants with isolated microcephaly were normocephalic and appeared well by 2 months of age. Laboratory evidence of ZIKV was detected for 22 of the infants, including 7 (31.8%) with a birth defect. Among 148 infants without a birth defect and negative\/no laboratory results on ZIKV testing, and for whom information was available at 1 year, 4 presented with a developmental delay. Among infants with possible congenital ZIKV exposure, a small proportion had possible ZIKV-associated findings at birth or at follow-up, or laboratory evidence of ZIKV.

Although viruses are often implicated, an etiology is not identified in the majority of cases. Metagenomics-based next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a high-throughput sequencing technique that can enhance the detection of novel or low-frequency pathogens. Hospitalized immunocompetent children aged 6 months to 18 years with encephalitis of unidentified etiology were eligible for enrollment. Demographic, historical, and clinical information was obtained, and residual blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were subjected to mNGS. Pathogens were identified by querying the sequence data against the NCBI GenBank database. Twenty children were enrolled prospectively between 2013 and 2017. mNGS of CSF identified 7 nonhuman nucleic acid sequences of significant frequency in 6 patients, including that of Mycoplasma bovis, parvovirus B19, Neisseria meningitidis, and Balamuthia mandrillaris. mNGS also detected Cladophialophora species, tobacco mosaic virus, and human bocavirus, which were presumed to be contaminants or nonpathogenic organisms. One patient was found to have positive serology results for California encephalitis virus, but mNGS did not detect it. Patients for whom mNGS identified a diagnosis had a significantly higher CSF white blood cell count, a higher CSF protein concentration, and a lower CSF glucose level than patients for whom mNGS did not identify a diagnosis. We describe here the results of a prospective cohort analysis to evaluate mNGS as a diagnostic tool for children with unexplained encephalitis.

We randomly assigned 181 children, aged 4 months to 5 years, with a normal urinary tract after recovery from their first febrile UTI in a 1:1 ratio to receive a probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Bifidobacterium lactis (n = 91) or placebo (n = 90) for a total of 18 months of therapy. The primary objective was to show the superiority of probiotic prophylaxis to placebo. The primary end point was composite cure (UTI-free survival) at 18 months, and the secondary end point was the median time to first UTI recurrence. The probiotics were superior to placebo with respect to the primary efficacy end point. At 18 months, composite cure was observed in 96.7% (3 of 91) of the patients in the probiotic group and 83.3% (15 of 90) of those in the placebo group (P = .02). The median time to the first incidence of UTI recurrence was 3.5 months (range, 1-4 months) and 6.5 months (range, 2-14 months) in the probiotic and placebo groups, respectively (P = .04). The main microorganism that caused recurrent UTI was Escherichia coli, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and these results were not significantly different between the 2 groups. We found no specific adverse events among the participants who received the probiotic mixture during the course of therapy. The probiotics were more effective than placebo at reducing the risk of recurrent UTI in children with a normal urinary tract after their first episode of febrile UTI.

Approximately 40 000 women of childbearing age living in the United States have chronic Chagas disease. Most of them are unaware that they have an infection that is transmissible to their offspring. The estimated US maternal-to-infant transmission rate of Trypanosoma cruzi is 1% to 5%. Ten percent to 40% of neonates with congenital T cruzi infection have clinical signs consistent with a congenital infection but no findings are unique to Chagas disease. If left untreated, 20% to 40% of infants with Chagas disease will later develop potentially fatal cardiac manifestations. Molecular testing can confirm the diagnosis in neonates. Treatment is well tolerated in infancy and usually results in cure. Screening of at-risk women during pregnancy can identify maternal infection and allow early assessment and treatment for congenital T cruzi infection.","417":"The pediatric infectious disease community has struggled to identify metrics that demonstrate the value that we add to the care of our patients. This challenge is largely a function of our typical role as a consultant in most healthcare settings.

We assessed the clinical impact of the implementation of malaria rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) on the management of children with malaria at an urban US children's hospital that serves a large immigrant population. This was a retrospective cohort study of all children diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed malaria at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) between 2000 and 2014. RDT using a US Food and Drug Administration-approved immunochromatographic assay was introduced at CHOP on August 1, 2007. We compared clinical management and outcomes of patients with malaria diagnosed before and after RDT introduction. We analyzed 82 pediatric malaria cases (32 before and 50 after RDT implementation). The majority of these patients had traveled to West Africa (91.5%) and were infected with Plasmodium falciparum (80.5%). The mean time to a positive result decreased from 10.4 to 0.9 hours (P &lt; .001) after the introduction of RDT for patients with P falciparum. The mean time to antimalarial therapy decreased from 13.1 to 6.9 hours (P =; .023) in hospitalized patients. We found no significant reduction in the mean number of clinical signs of severe malaria between 0 and 48 hours of hospitalization and no difference in the need for exchange transfusion, time to resolution of parasitemia, or length of hospital stay. Implementation of RDT for malaria was associated with shorter times to malaria diagnosis and initiation of antimalarial therapy. The results of this study support RDT in the optimal management of patients with malaria who present in settings in which the disease is not endemic.

Data on the actual impact of outsourcing on patient care, safety, and medical education, including costs, are limited. The objective of this study was to examine the published literature on the potential benefits and harms when medical centers outsource common microbiology services. We conducted a 16-step literature search of PubMed and Embase. Articles were selected for full-text review if their content matched our key questions: (1) What are the potential benefits of outsourcing core microbiology laboratory testing? (2) What are the potential harms to patient care and medical education when medical centers outsource essential microbiology services? The initial search yielded 6111 unique published articles; 36 were selected for full-text review, which resulted in the identification of 8 articles that addressed our key questions (2 editorials, 3 editorials with observational data, 1 survey, 1 case series, and 1 study of blood culture transport). These articles described a variety of issues, including longer turnaround times for blood cultures that resulted in delays in diagnosis and treatment, errors that resulted in patient morbidity, limited cost savings, and communication barriers. In this study, with the exception of the blood culture transport study, we found no published prospective studies that quantified the effects of outsourcing microbiology services on patient care, patient safety, or medical education. However, these largely anecdotal reports suggest that outsourcing microbiology services may have a detrimental impact on medical education, especially infectious disease training programs.

The majority of HPN-dependent children in southern Israel reside in poor communities with substandard living conditions, which creates significant challenges for the safe provision of HPN. We developed a pilot intervention that aimed to reduce the rates of CLABSI and central venous catheter (CVC) replacements in this vulnerable population in our region. Between 2012 and 2014, all HPN-dependent children with intestinal failure who were treated in our center, received HPN through a Hickman catheter, and experienced at least 1 previous CLABSI episode participated in the intervention. The intervention included home visits to assess the caregivers' CVC-handling technique, instillation of prophylactic ethanol lock solution, and the convening of regular multidisciplinary staff debriefings. We calculated CLABSI and CVC-replacement rates before and after the intervention. Eight patients who served as their own historical controls were included in the intervention (total of 2544 catheter-days during the intervention period). The mean CLABSI rate decreased from 9.62 to 0.79 CLABSI episodes per 1000 catheter-days; the CVC-replacement rate decreased from 2.5 to 1.2 replacements per 1000 catheter-days in the preintervention and intervention periods respectively. The median hospital length of stay and individual monthly cost of medical care decreased compared to those found in the preintervention period.

In this study, we assessed the immunogenicity and safety of another MMR vaccine (MMR-RIT [Priorix, GlaxoSmithKline]) compared with those of the MMR II in 12- to 15-month-old children who received it as a first dose. In this phase III, observer-blinded, noninferiority, lot-to-lot consistency clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01702428), 5003 healthy children were randomly assigned to receive 1 dose of MMR-RIT (1 of 3 production lots) or MMR II along with other age-recommended routine vaccines. We evaluated the immunogenicity of all vaccines in terms of antibody concentrations (by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or electrochemiluminescence assay) and\/or seroresponse rates 43 days after vaccination. We also assessed the reactogenicity and safety of the vaccines. Immunoresponses after vaccination with MMR-RIT were robust and noninferior to those after vaccination with the MMR II. Immunogenicity of the 3 production lots of MMR-RIT was consistent; more than 97% of the children had a seroresponse to MMR components. The coadministered vaccines elicited similar immunoresponses in the MMR-RIT and MMR II groups. Both MMR vaccines resulted in comparable reactogenicity profiles, and no safety concerns were detected. If licensed, the MMR-RIT could provide a valid option for the prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella in children in the United States and would reduce potential risks of a vaccine shortage.

Their use reduced the average rate of reported pertussis cases from 157 in 100 000 in the prevaccine era to &lt;1 in 100 000 in the 1970s. Because of alleged reactions (encephalopathy and death), several countries discontinued (Sweden) or markedly decreased (United Kingdom, Germany, Japan) use of the vaccine. During the 20th century, Bordetella pertussis was studied extensively in animal model systems, and many \"toxins\" and protective antigens were described. A leader in B pertussis research was Margaret Pittman of the National Institutes of Health\/US Food and Drug Administration. She published 2 articles suggesting that pertussis was a pertussis toxin (PT)-mediated disease. Dr Pittman's views led to the idea that less-reactogenic acellular vaccines could be produced. The first diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTaP) vaccines were developed in Japan and put into routine use there. Afterward, DTaP vaccines were developed in the Western world, and definitive efficacy trials were carried out in the 1990s. These vaccines were all less reactogenic than DTwP vaccines, and despite the fact that their efficacy was less than that of DTwP vaccines, they were approved in the United States and many other countries. DTaP vaccines replaced DTwP vaccines in the United States in 1997. In the last 13 years, major pertussis epidemics have occurred in the United States, and numerous studies have shown the deficiencies of DTaP vaccines, including the small number of antigens that the vaccines contain and the type of cellular immune response that they elicit. The type of cellular response a predominantly, T2 response results in less efficacy and shorter duration of protection. Because of the small number of antigens (3-5 in DTaP vaccines vs &gt;3000 in DTwP vaccines), linked-epitope suppression occurs. Because of linked-epitope suppression, all children who were primed by DTaP vaccines will be more susceptible to pertussis throughout their lifetimes, and there is no easy way to decrease this increased lifetime susceptibility.","435":null,"436":null,"437":"We collected lumbar and ventricular cerebrospinal fluid and serum from 40 children treated for tuberculous meningitis and measured the concentrations of gelatinases and their inhibitors.

For community-based studies, home-based specimen collection by parents could be a resource-saving alternative to collection by healthcare workers (HCWs). In this study, we compared parent and HCW groups for their likelihood to collect specimens and the timeliness and quality of such collection. In this unblinded randomized controlled trial, parents from Brisbane, Australia, were taught to identify new ARI episodes in their children aged &lt;2 years. When their child had a new ARI, parents either collected a nasal swab from the child (P group) or contacted an HCW who visited to obtain a nasopharyngeal swab (HCW group). We compared the likelihood and timeliness of specimen collection and respiratory pathogen detection. A nested diagnostic study compared paired specimen collections from children in the HCW group. Included were 76 incident ARI episodes from 31 children and 102 episodes from 33 children in the P and HCW groups, respectively. The proportions of ARIs for which a specimen was collected were similar (P group, 69.7%; HCW group, 72.5%; P = .77), and pathogens were detected in 93.8% and 77.5% of the specimens, respectively (P = .03). The period between ARI onset and specimen collection was shorter in the P group than in the HCW group (mean difference, 1.9 days [95% confidence interval, 0.7-3.0 days]; P &lt; .001). For the 69 paired specimens, viral loads were lower in the parent-collected swabs (mean cycle threshold difference, 4.5 [95% confidence interval, 3.1-5.9]; P &lt; .001).

Despite its high national disease burden, the epidemiologic characteristics of child and adolescent cases are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to describe the socioeconomic, transmission risk factors, clinical manifestations, and geospatial variables associated with cases of T vaginalis infection in the Houston, Texas, metropolitan area. We performed a retrospective chart abstraction of all T vaginalis cases at 2 large pediatric hospitals in Houston between 2008 and 2016. We identified 87 patients (mean age, 16 years; range, 4-18 years); 30% of them were asymptomatic, and 39% were coinfected with another sexually transmitted infection(s). Almost all T vaginalis infections in sexually assaulted patients were diagnosed incidentally. Geospatial analysis identified clustering of cases in areas of high poverty and in minority populations. Our findings indicate that children and adolescents are at risk for T vaginalis infection; however, their risk factors might differ from those in adults. In addition, our geospatial analysis revealed the need for dedicated resources in neighborhoods associated with health disparities to prevent future incident cases. ","448":"In utero infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy can lead to the development of birth defects and postnatal deficits. A nonhuman primate (NHP) model of congenital ZIKV infection can help fill the gaps in knowledge where tissue studies are required to define viral pathogenesis and identify targets for therapeutic intervention. This model system has already identified critical features of ZIKV pathogenesis in congenital infection. Before translating these NHP studies to human clinical trials, we must understand the similarities and differences between human and NHP fetal immune system development, neural development, and infant assessment tools. Because of the overall similarity between fetal and infant development in humans and NHPs, this NHP model can complement human clinical trials by defining immune correlates of protection and evaluating therapeutic interventions.","449":"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains a significant contributor to morbidity and death after pediatric solid and stem cell transplantation. Decisions regarding prevention and treatment often lack pediatric-specific data to drive decision making. We present here a case-based discussion around some of these specific topics and focus on approaches to CMV prevention, post-CMV secondary prophylaxis options, and identification and treatment of resistant CMV infection, including emerging antiviral agents and the use of cytotoxic CMV-specific T-cells, in the setting of pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","450":"Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation (SOT) may acquire infections from the transplanted organ. Routine screening for common infections are an established part of the pretransplant evaluation of donors and recipients. Likewise, strategies exist for prophylaxis and surveillance for common donorassociated infections including hepatitis B, CMV and EBV. However, despite advances in diagnostic testing to evaluate the infectious risk of donors, unanticipated transmission of pathogens occurs, particularly when donors are asymptomatic or have subtle or unusual manifestations of a transmissible Infection. Infectious diseases (ID) providers play an integral role in donor and recipient risk assessment and can advise transplant centers on organ utilization and guide evaluation and management of the SOT recipient. Consideration of the donor cause of death and preceding clinical syndromes are important for characterizing the potential risk for recipient infection. This allows a more accurate analysis of the risk: benefit of accepting a life-saving organ and risk of infection. ID providers and transplant teams should work closely with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) to solicit additional donor information when a donor-derived infection is suspected so that reporting can be facilitated to ensure communication with the care-teams of other organ recipients from the same donors. National advisory committees work closely with federal agencies to provide oversight, guide policy development, and assess outcomes to assist with the prevention and management of donor-transmitted disease through organ transplantation. The clinical vignettes in this review highlight some of the complexities in the evaluation of potential donor transmission.","451":"This article presents an overview of the Career Development session at the 17th Annual St. Jude\/PIDS Pediatric Infectious Diseases Research Conference. This annual conference discusses key academic skills, such as grant writing and negotiating for protected time for research and academic endeavors, as well as highlighting the many career options available in infectious disease. This year's session included discussions about basic science, public health, health outcomes research, and private practice pediatric infectious disease careers. The combination of practical career advice, mentoring, and inspiration offered in the career-development track talks at the St. Jude\/PIDS Pediatric Infectious Diseases Research Conference this and every year helps trainees to faculty navigate the path to building a satisfying career in pediatric infectious disease.","452":"Human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) is a ubiquitous pathogen that infects most individuals before the age of three years. HHV-6B reactivates in approximately 40% of transplant recipients where it has been associated with a number of important outcomes, especially in allogeneic transplant recipients. This article will review the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of HHV-6B infection.","453":"Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a pathogen that causes outbreaks of respiratory illness across the world, mostly in children, and can be especially severe in those with asthma. Clusters of acute flaccid myelitis, a poliomyelitis-like neuromuscular weakness syndrome, often occur concurrent with EV-D68 respiratory outbreaks. Seroepidemiologic studies have found that the serum of nearly everyone older than 2 to 5 years contains anti-EV-D68 neutralizing antibodies, which suggests that EV-D68 is a ubiquitous pathogen of childhood. However, knowledge of the viral epitopes against which the humoral immune response is directed is only inferred from previous studies of related viruses. Although neutralizing antibodies protect newborn mice from lethal EV-D68 inoculation via nonphysiologic routes, cotton rats have a mixed phenotype of both benefit and possible exacerbation when inoculated intranasally. The human antibody response to EV-D68 needs to be studied further to clarify the role of antibodies in protection versus pathogenesis, which might differ among respiratory and neurologic disease phenotypes.","454":"","455":"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been the standard of care for infants with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) for several decades due to the dismal prognosis early in life without immune reconstitution. In recent years, as HSCT conditioning regimens and supportive care have greatly improved, HSCT is gaining in acceptance for more non-SCID primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) and outside the early childhood period. In addition, potential donor options for non-SCID PIDs are expanding with increasing success for haploidentical donor transplants. In this brief report of a presentation at the PIDS-St. Jude 2018 conference, PIDs for which transplants are increasingly performed outside of early childhood will be discussed.","456":"Immunization is one of the most effective public and private preventive health interventions, resulting in significant reductions in vaccine-preventable diseases and in substantial cost savings to the US healthcare system. Vaccine licensure, development of recommendations for use, and implementation of those recommendations leading to uptake, community protection, and effect on disease burden represent a complex system that requires collaboration in the areas of basic science, public health, vaccine delivery, outcome monitoring, and public perception. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) sets standards for immunization delivery for both public and private vaccine providers, and state immunization programs can use these ACIP recommendations to develop school immunization requirements.","457":"Among 182 children with influenza infection in 2016-2017, 18% had neurologic manifestations of influenza (NMI), including seizures and encephalopathy; 85% of these children were infected with the H3N2 strain.

FUT variations influence the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) (H-type 1 and Lewis), which are highly expressed in the gut and play an important role in microbial attachment, metabolism, colonization, and shaping of the microbiome. In particular, FUT polymorphisms confer susceptibility to specific rotavirus and norovirus genotypes, which has important global health implications. We designed a genotyping method using a nested polymerase chain reaction approach to determine the frequency of SNPs in FUT2 and FUT3, thereby inferring the prevalence of Lewisb-positive, Lewisb-negative, secretor, and nonsecretor phenotypes in 520 Swedish newborns. There was an increased frequency of homozygotes for the minor allele for 1 SNP in FUT2 and 4 SNPs in FUT3. Overall, 37.3% of newborns were found to have Lewis b negative phenotypes (Le (a+b-) or Le (a-b-). Using our new, sensitive genotyping method, we were able to genetically define the Le (a-b-) individuals based on their secretor status and found that the frequency of Lewis b negative newborns in our cohort was 28%. Given the high frequency of fucosyltransferase polymorphisms observed in our newborn cohort and the implications for disease susceptibility, FUT genotyping might play a future role in personalized health care, including recommendations for disease screening, therapy, and vaccination. ","460":"Blood cultures are obtained routinely for infants and young children for the evaluation for serious bacterial infection. Isolation of organisms that represent possible contaminants poses a management challenge. The prevalence of bacteremia reported in this population is potentially biased by inconsistent contaminant categorization reported in the literature. Our aim was to systematically review the definition and reporting of contaminants within the literature regarding infant bacteremia. A search of studies published between 1986 and mid-September 2016 was conducted using Medline\/PubMed. Included studies examined children aged 0 to 36 months for whom blood culture was performed as part of a serious bacterial infection evaluation. Studies that involved children in an intensive care unit, prematurely born children, and immunocompromised children or those with an indwelling catheter\/device were excluded. Data extracted included contaminant designation methodology, organisms classified as contaminants and pathogens, and contamination and bacteremia rates. Our search yielded 1335 articles, and 69 of them met our inclusion criteria. The methodology used to define contaminants was described in 37 (54%) study reports, and 16 (23%) reported contamination rates, which ranged from 0.5% to 22.8%. Studies defined contaminants according to organism species (n = 22), according to the patient's clinical management (n = 4), and using multifactorial approaches (n = 11). Many common organisms, particularly Gram-positive cocci, were inconsistently categorized as pathogens or contaminants. Reporting and categorization of blood culture contamination are inconsistent within the pediatric bacteremia literature, which limits our ability to estimate the prevalence of bacteremia. Although contaminants are characterized most frequently according to organism, we found inconsistency regarding the classification of certain common organisms. A standardized approach to contaminant reporting is needed.

We tested the ability of a biomarker-based algorithm to reduce excess antibiotic administration in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without bacterial infections (uninfected) in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The algorithm suggested that PICU clinicians stop antibiotics if (1) C-reactive protein &lt;4 mg\/dL and procalcitonin &lt;1 ng\/mL at SIRS onset and (2) no evidence of bacterial infection by exam\/testing by 48 hours. We evaluated excess broad-spectrum antibiotic use, defined as administration on days 3-9 after SIRS onset in uninfected children. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) compared unadjusted excess length of therapy (LOT) in the 34 months before (Period 1) and 12 months after (Period 2) implementation of this algorithm, stratified by biomarker values. Segmented linear regression evaluated excess LOT among all uninfected episodes over time and between the periods. We identified 457 eligible SIRS episodes without bacterial infection, 333 in Period 1 and 124 in Period 2. When both biomarkers were below the algorithm's cut-points (n = 48 Period 1, n = 31 Period 2), unadjusted excess LOT was lower in Period 2 (IRR, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.93). Among all 457 uninfected episodes, there were no significant differences in LOT (coefficient 0.9, P = .99) between the periods on segmented regression. Implementation of a biomarker-based algorithm did not decrease overall antibiotic exposure among all uninfected patients in our PICU, although exposures were reduced in the subset of SIRS episodes where biomarkers were low. ","466":"Reliance on tests that detect only the presence of toxigenic Clostridium difficile can result in overdiagnosis and overtreatment of C difficile infection (CDI). The C difficile polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (CT) can sensitively predict the presence of free C difficile toxins; however, the clinical application for this testing strategy remains unexplored. We evaluated the impact of dual PCR and toxin result reporting, as predicted by the CT, on CDI management and outcomes in children. Before the intervention, results for C difficile testing at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford were reported as PCR positive (PCR+) or negative (PCR-) according to the GeneXpert C diff Epi tcdB PCR assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California). Beginning October 5, 2016, the presence of free toxins, as predicted by the CT, was reported also. The CDI treatment rates 1 year before and 18 months after implementation of toxin reporting were compared. Demographic and treatment-related data were collected, and patient outcomes were followed up 8 weeks later. CDI treatment decreased 22% after the intervention (96% [preintervention] vs 74% [postintervention]; P &lt; .001). During the postintervention period, there were 152 PCR+C difficile results, and 94 (62%) of them were toxin positive (toxin+) according to the CT. Of the 58 PCR+\/toxin-negative (toxin-) results, 38 (66%) did not result in CDI treatment. Seven (18%) of the untreated PCR+\/toxin- patients underwent repeat testing within 8 weeks, and 5 (13%) of them were subsequently PCR+\/toxin+ and treated. No CDI-related complications were identified. Addition of the CT-predicted C difficile toxin result to PCR reporting reduces the proportion of PCR+ children treated for CDI.

Risk factors for initial and repeated respiratory viral infections in young infants in resource-limited settings have not been well described. From 2011 to 2014, a birth cohort of infants in rural Nepal was enrolled and followed with weekly household-based active surveillance for respiratory symptoms until 6 months of age. Respiratory illness was defined as having any of the following: fever, cough, wheeze, difficulty breathing, and\/or a draining ear. We tested nasal swabs of infants with respiratory illness for multiple respiratory viruses by using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The risk of primary and repeated infections with the same virus was evaluated using Poisson regression. Of 3528 infants, 1726 (49%) had a primary infection, and 419 (12%) had a repeated infection. The incidences of respiratory viral infection in infants were 1816 per 1000 person-years for primary infections and 1204 per 1000 person-years for repeated infection with the same virus. Exposure to other children and male sex were each associated with an increased risk for primary infection (risk ratios, 1.13 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.06-1.20] and 1.14 [95% CI, 1.02-1.27], respectively), whereas higher maternal education was associated with a decreased risk for both primary and repeated infections (risk ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.95-0.98]). The incidence of subsequent infection did not change when previous infection with the same or another respiratory virus occurred. Illness duration and severity were not significantly different in the infants between the first and second episodes for any respiratory virus tested. In infants in rural Nepal, repeated respiratory virus infections were frequent, and we found no decrease in illness severity with repeated infections and no evidence of replacement with another virus. Vaccine strategies and public health interventions that provide durable protection in the first 6 months of life could decrease the burden of repeated infections by multiple respiratory viruses, particularly in low-resource countries.

We evaluated plasma drug concentrations of rifampicin (RIF), isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) among children undergoing TB treatment in Tanzania when these dosing recommendations were being implemented. At the end of intensive-phase TB therapy, blood was obtained 2 hours after witnessed medication administration to estimate the peak drug concentration (C2h), measured using high-performance liquid chromatography or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods. Differences in median drug concentrations were compared on the basis of the weight-based dosing strategy using the Mann-Whitney U test. Risk factors for low drug concentrations were analyzed using multivariate regression analysis. We enrolled 51 human immunodeficiency virus-negative children (median age, 5.3 years [range, 0.75-14 years]). The median C2hs were below the target range for each TB drug studied. Compared with children who received the \"old\" dosages, those who received the \"revised\" WHO dosages had a higher median C2h for RIF (P = .049) and PZA (P = .015) but not for INH (P = .624) or EMB (P = .143); however, these revised dosages did not result in the target range for RIF, INH, and EMB being achieved. A low starting dose was associated with a low C2h for RIF (P = .005) and PZA (P = .005). Malnutrition was associated with a low C2h for RIF (P = .001) and INH (P = .001).

Classification of children who had had measles was completed using maternal recall and measles immunoglobulin G serostatus obtained via dried-blood-spot analysis with a multiplex immunoassay. The association with time since measles infection and fever, cough, and diarrhea outcomes was also examined. The odds of fever in the previous 2 weeks were 1.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25-2.60) among children for whom measles was reported compared to children with no history of measles. Measles vaccination demonstrated a protective association against selected clinical markers of acute infectious diseases. Our results suggest that measles might have a long-term effect on selected clinical markers of acute infectious diseases among children aged 9 to 59 months in the DRC.

Vaccination is the most effective approach to preventing influenza infection; however, vaccination rates are low, and interventions to optimize vaccine coverage are needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if pharmacy-initiated screening and recommendations for influenza immunization improve the rate of vaccination in pediatric SOT recipients. We performed a retrospective pre-post chart review of all kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients followed by Children's Healthcare of Atlanta\/Emory University transplant services between September 1, 2011, and February 16, 2017. Influenza vaccination coverage and influenza rates before (2011-2013) and after (2014-2016) the implementation of pharmacy-driven vaccination in SOT recipients were assessed. A total of 822 patients were included; 101 (13%) of these patients were diagnosed with influenza, and 40 (5%) were hospitalized secondarily during the study period. Vaccination coverage increased over time (144 [36%] patients vaccinated in 2011 vs 430 [74%] in 2016; P &lt; .001). Influenza diagnosis rates decreased between the 2 eras (P = .006). The median time in which 50% of the population was vaccinated decreased over time from 163 days in 2012 to 94 days in 2016 (P &lt; .001). Within the constraints of the pre-post study design, we observed a significant increase in influenza vaccination rates after implementation of a transplant pharmacy-initiated screening and vaccination program.

Infants received 3 doses of PCV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age or at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, and 9 months of age; toddlers received 2 doses 2 months apart or 1 dose beginning at 12 to 15 months of age; and children received 1 dose between 2 and 4 years of age. We measured each participant's serotype-specific serum immunoglobulin G concentration and opsonophagocytic activity before and after vaccination. For each age group, we compared immune responses between study arms and between the standard schedule in our study and the PCV13-licensing trials. In total, 280 infants, 302 toddlers, and 81 children were assigned randomly and underwent vaccination; 268, 235, and 77 of them completed follow-up, respectively. PCV13 resulted in low reactogenicity in all the study arms. The vaccine elicited a strong primary immune response in infants after 2 or more doses and in children aged 1 to 4 years after 1 dose. Infants who received a booster dose exhibited a robust memory response. Immunogenicity was higher than or comparable to that observed in the PCV13-licensing trials for a majority of serotypes in all 3 age groups. PCV13 has a satisfactory immunogenicity and reactogenicity profile in this population.

We developed a 3-phase intervention that involved departmental discussion, audit, and follow-up action. A 4-month unobtrusive audit during night and day shifts was performed. The audit results were presented, and a conceptual framework of barriers to and solutions for increasing hand hygiene compliance was developed collectively. A total of 1308 hand hygiene opportunities were observed. Among 1227 planned patient contacts, hand-washing events (707 [58.6%]), hand rub events (442 [36%]), and missed hand hygiene (78 [6.4%]) events were observed. The missed hand hygiene rate was 20% during resuscitation. Missed hand hygiene opportunities occurred 3.2 times (95% confidence interval, 1.9-5.3 times) more often during resuscitation procedures than during planned contact and 6.14 times (95% confidence interval, 2.36-16.01 times) more often when providers moved between patients. Structural and process determinants of hand hygiene noncompliance were identified through a root-cause analysis in which all members of the neonatal intensive care unit team participated. The mean hand-washing duration was 40 seconds. In 83% of cases, drying hands after washing was neglected. Hand recontamination after hand-washing was seen in 77% of the cases. Washing up to elbow level was observed in 27% of hand-wash events. After departmental review of the study results, hand rubs were placed at each bassinet to address these missed opportunities. Hand hygiene was suboptimal during resuscitation procedures and between patient contacts. We developed a conceptual framework for improving hand hygiene through a root-cause analysis. ","494":"Approximately 20% of the nationally reported tetanus infections in children aged 0 to 14 years that occurred in the United States between 2005 and 2015 were treated at Penn State Children's Hospital. With an electronic medical record search, we identified 5 cases of pediatric tetanus; 100% of these cases occurred in unimmunized children. Their median length of stay was 10 days, and the costs were significant.","495":"","496":"Parechovirus A (PeV-A) is an important cause of sepsis and meningoencephalitis in neonates and young infants. Thus, identifying the source of PeV-A is essential for prevention; however, little is known regarding the spread of PeV-A among family members of PeV-A-infected neonates and young infants. In this prospective study, we evaluated stool samples from family members of PeV-A-infected neonates and infants younger than 4 months who presented with sepsis, meningoencephalitis, or both in Niigata, Japan, in 2016. Because of a simultaneous outbreak, enteroviruses (EVs) were also evaluated during this period. Real-time polymerase chain reaction followed by sequence analysis was used for viral diagnosis using serum and\/or cerebrospinal fluid samples. Among 54 febrile patients, the stool samples of 14 (26%) and 12 (22%) patients tested positive for PeV-A and EV, respectively. Stool samples from 54 family members (38 adults and 16 children) of 12 PeV-A-infected patients were available. The rate of PeV-A positivity in these samples was higher among the children (88% [14 of 16]) than the adults (34% [13 of 38]). Among family members with a PeV-A-positive stool sample, 29% (4 of 14) of the children and 77% (10 of 13) of the adults were asymptomatic. Similarly, among 53 stool samples from family members (31 adults and 22 children) of 11 EV-infected patients, the rate of EV positivity in the stool samples was higher among the children (91% [20 of 22]) than among the adults (42% [13 of 31]). The asymptomatic-patient rates were 45% (9 of 20) among the children and 85% (11 of 13) among the adults in family members with EV-positive stool. Similar to EVs, PeV-A was detected frequently in stool samples from family members of PeV-A-infected patients. Among family members with PeV-A-positive stool, adults were more likely than children to be asymptomatic and therefore could be an important source of PeV-A infection. ","497":"The rotavirus disease burden has declined substantially since rotavirus vaccine was introduced in the United States in 2006. The aim of this study was to determine the viral etiology of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in US children aged &lt;2 years. The New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) of geographically diverse US sites conducts active pediatric population-based surveillance in hospitals and emergency departments. Stool samples were collected from children aged &lt;2 years with symptoms of AGE (n = 330) and age-matched healthy controls (HCs) (n = 272) between January and December 2012. Samples were tested by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays {adenovirus (type 40 and 41), norovirus, parechovirus A, enterovirus, sapovirus, and astrovirus} and an enzyme immunoassay (rotavirus). All samples that tested positive were genotyped. Detection rates of pathogens in children with AGE versus those of HCs were, respectively, 23.0% versus 6.6% for norovirus (P &lt; .01), 23.0% versus 16.0% for adenovirus (P = .08), 11.0% versus 16.0% for parechovirus A (P = .09), 11.0% versus 9.0% for enterovirus (P = .34), 7.0% versus 3.0% for sapovirus (P = .07), 3.0% versus 0.3% for astrovirus (P = .01), and 3.0% versus 0.4% for rotavirus (P = .01). A high prevalence of adenovirus was detected at 1 surveillance site (49.0% for children with AGE and 43.0% for HCs). Norovirus GII.4 New Orleans was the most frequently detected (33.0%) norovirus genotype. Codetection of &gt;1 virus was more common in children with AGE (16.0%) than in HCs (10.0%) (P = .03). Norovirus, astrovirus, sapovirus, and rotavirus were detected significantly more in children with AGE than in HCs, and norovirus was the leading AGE-causing pathogen in US children aged &lt;2 years during the year 2012. ","498":"","499":"Assays to estimate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reservoir size require large amounts of blood, which represents a drawback especially in pediatric settings. We investigated whether HIV-antibody repertoire could estimate the viral reservoir size. Moreover, we assessed the magnitude of HIV-antibody response as a predictor of time of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Human immunodeficiency virus-antibody responses to 10 different viral proteins were evaluated by HIV Western blot (WB) kit and a WB score was assigned to each patient. Patients were classified in 2 subgroups based on the timing of ART initiation (early treated [ET], 0-24 weeks and late treated [LT], &gt;24 weeks). Human immunodeficiency virus-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was quantified using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Logistic regression and principal component analysis were built on these data to test the ability of WB score to predict the expected value of HIV-DNA and the timing of ART initiation. Sixty-nine perinatally HIV-infected children were evaluated. Reduced HIV-specific antibody responses and lower size of HIV-DNA were observed in ET compared with LT patients (P &lt; .001 and P = .02, respectively). We found that WB score correlates with HIV-DNA (P = .032) and timing of ART initiation (P &lt; .001). Based on the logistic regression analysis, we found that WB score can predict the HIV-DNA size and the timing of ART initiation with an Akaike information criterion of -118.13 and -151.51, respectively. Western blot score can estimate HIV-DNA size and timing of ART initiation in long-term virally suppressed children. This rapid, inexpensive, and easily reproducible tool can provide useful information to identify potential candidates for HIV remission studies. ","500":"Guidelines for pediatric Lyme meningitis recommend treatment with parenteral therapy [1, 2]. Adult studies suggest that Lyme meningitis can be successfully treated with oral therapy. Our objective was to evaluate the clinical response, side effects and outcome of oral therapy for Lyme meningitis in the pediatric population compared with parenteral therapy in an area endemic for Lyme disease. We conducted a case series chart review from January 2012 to May 2017 of pediatrics patient diagnosed and treated for Lyme meningitis. We recorded clinical presentation, laboratory values, antimicrobial therapy and follow up after therapy to compare the efficacy of oral versus parenteral route of therapy. We identified 38 patients diagnosed with Lyme meningitis. Thirty-two patients were discharge with exclusively oral therapy with: doxycycline and amoxicillin. We had only 2 patients developed potential adverse effects from oral doxycycline therapy. All patients treated with oral antibiotics had resolution of symptoms on follow up appointments. Oral therapy for Lyme meningitis yields no serious adverse events, was well tolerated and showed resolution of symptoms.

We sought to evaluate the contemporary clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and outcomes in children with histoplasmosis living in an area of endemicity. This study was a single-center retrospective review of proven and probable cases of histoplasmosis in children aged 0 to 18 years between April 2008 and April 2014. Case ascertainment was ensured by us using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes cross-referenced with laboratory, microbiology, and histopathology tests that detected Histoplasma capsulatum. Demographics, diagnostics, clinical management, and outcomes were evaluated. Seventy-three children with histoplasmosis (41 males; median age, 13 years [range, 3-18 years]) were diagnosed with proven (n = 17 [23%]) or probable (n = 56 [77%]) histoplasmosis, which manifested as pulmonary (n = 52 [71%]) or disseminated (n = 21 [29%]) disease. Symptoms at presentation were nonspecific; the examination of 21 (29%) patients revealed abnormal physical findings. Detection of H capsulatum by serologic methods occurred in 93% (63 of 68) of the patients tested. Histoplasma antigen in blood or urine was detected in 42% (20 of 48) and 28% (15 of 53) of the patients tested, respectively. The 16 (22%) patients who were immunocompromised had significantly higher rates of disseminated disease (56% vs 21%, respectively; P = .01), antigenuria (62% vs 18%, respectively; P = .004), and antigenemia (69% vs 31%, respectively; P = .02) and longer durations of antigenuria (403 vs 120 days, respectively; P = .003) and antigenemia (451 vs 149 days, respectively; P &lt; .0001) than did the immunocompetent children. Pediatric histoplasmosis manifests most frequently as pulmonary disease. The highest diagnostic yield was achieved when multiple diagnostic modalities were used. Presentation with disseminated disease and evidence of antigenemia, antigenuria, and delayed antigen clearance were more likely to be seen in immunocompromised children.

Shared accommodations and activities can facilitate acute gastroenteritis (AGE) outbreaks. We analyzed data from the National Outbreak Reporting System on US youth camp-associated AGE outbreaks that occurred between 2009 and 2016. We also conducted a systematic literature search of youth camp-associated AGE outbreaks that have occurred around the world and a gray literature search for existing recommendations on outbreak prevention and control at camps worldwide. Thirty-nine US jurisdictions reported a total of 229 youth camp-associated AGE outbreaks to the National Outbreak Reporting System. Of the 226 outbreaks included in our analyses, 120 (53%) were reported to have resulted from person-to-person transmission, 42 (19%) from an unknown transmission mode, 38 (17%) from foodborne transmission, 19 (8%) from waterborne transmission, 5 (2%) from animal contact, and 2 (&lt;1%) from environmental contamination. Among 170 (75%) outbreaks with a single suspected or confirmed etiology, norovirus (107 [63%] outbreaks), Salmonella spp (16 [9%]), and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (12 [7%]) were implicated most frequently. We identified 43 additional youth camp-associated AGE outbreaks in the literature that occurred in various countries between 1938 and 2014. Control measures identified through the literature search included camp closure, separation of ill campers, environmental disinfection, and education on food preparation and hand hygiene. Youth camp-associated AGE outbreaks are caused by numerous pathogens every year. These outbreaks are facilitated by factors that include improper food preparation, inadequate cleaning and disinfection, shared accommodations, and contact with animals. Health education focused on proper hygiene and preventing disease transmission could help control or prevent these outbreaks. ","510":"Bacterial infections caused by group A Streptococcus (GAS) are common in childhood. Few study reports have provided data on pediatric-specific trends in the epidemiology and bacterial strain characteristics of GAS infections. We prospectively collected GAS isolates from the clinical microbiology laboratory at Texas Children's Hospital between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2017. Patient characteristics and GAS disease categories were determined through chart review. GAS isolates were obtained from patients in either the inpatient or outpatient setting, and cases were defined as pharyngeal disease, skin and soft-tissue infection (SSTI), or invasive disease on the basis of predefined criteria. All isolates were emm typed to determine trends over time. We identified 930 cases over the 4-year period, including 432 (46.4%) pharyngeal, 235 (25.3%) SSTI, and 263 (28.3%) invasive disease types. The most frequently encountered emm types were emm1 (21.4%), emm12 (15.7%), emm89 (14.6%), emm4 (9.2%), and emm3 (8.2%). We observed significant changes over the 4-year period in the relative frequency of infections caused by emm1 (-17.7%; P = .046), emm4 (8.7%; P = .023), or emm6 (-7.9%; P = .024). Using bioinformatic analyses and targeted gene sequencing, we also discovered that all GAS emm28 and emm87 types harbored mutations that rendered them incapable of producing capsule. The relative frequency of GAS disease cases caused by capsule-negative GAS emm types (emm4, emm22, emm28, emm87, and emm89) increased over the 4-year period (32.2%-44.4%), although the difference was statistically significant for only nonpharyngeal disease types (27.1%-43.9%; P = .038). Our data suggest an evolving epidemiology of GAS in the Houston pediatric population characterized by an increase in the frequency of capsule-negative emm types.

The vast majority of the patients improved promptly after receiving appropriate antibiotics. Patients with a longer duration of arthritis before the institution of therapy experienced a longer time to recovery.","512":"Recurrent urinary tract infection (rUTI) continues to challenge pediatric care providers. The diagnosis of an rUTI can be difficult, especially in young febrile children. Antibiotic resistance rates continue to rise, which limits oral treatment options. Prophylactic antibiotics are used commonly to manage rUTI, but their use increases the risk of rUTI with antibiotic-resistant strains without significantly reducing renal scarring. Alternative therapies for rUTI include probiotics and anthocyanidins (eg, cranberry extract) to reduce gut colonization by uropathogens and prevent bacterial adhesion to uroepithelia, but efficacy data for these treatments are sparse. The future of rUTI care rests in addressing the following contemporary issues: best diagnostic practices, risk factors associated with rUTI, and the prevention of recurrent infection. In this review, we summarize the state of the art for each of these issues and highlight future studies that will aim to take an alternative approach to managing rUTI.","513":"Kingella kingae typically causes musculoskeletal infection in young children between the ages of 6 months and 4 years who may be in close contact with other similarly aged children who are colonized with the organism in their oropharynx. Kingella infections have rarely been described in older individuals with chronic medical conditions or immune compromise. This is a case report of a healthy, older child who developed an invasive infection due to Kingella kingae. Clinical and laboratory details are provided of an otherwise healthy 11-year-old female who developed an acute onset of septic arthritis of her shoulder. The organism was identified by culture and 16S polymerase chain reaction. Her clinical course necessitated an antibiotic change after the organism was correctly identified. The affected child had close contact with a 2-year-old sibling who recently had a viral upper respiratory infection. This case illustrates the potential for Kingella kingae to rarely cause invasive infection in older, healthy children. Supplemental laboratory techniques may be helpful to identify this organism. Although it is reasonable to limit the antibiotic spectrum for older children, clinicians should be aware of this possibility, particularly if there is a history of close contact with young children.","514":"The epidemiology of Staphylococcus aureus infection in children is dynamic. We conducted a retrospective observational study on pediatric clinical cultures, performed between 2005 and 2017, that grew S aureus to determine temporal trends in antibiotic resistance.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of antibiotic treatments, including oral erythromycin, azithromycin, and trimethoprim, for neonatal chlamydial conjunctivitis. We searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from their inception to July 14, 2017. We included randomized and nonrandomized studies that evaluated the effects of erythromycin, azithromycin, or trimethoprim in neonates with chlamydial conjunctivitis. A meta-analysis using a random-effects generic inverse-variance method was performed, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We found 12 studies (n = 292 neonates) and were able to meta-analyze 7 studies that used erythromycin at a dose of 50 mg\/kg body weight per day for 14 days. The clinical and microbiological cure were 96% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94%-100%) and 97% (95% CI, 95%-99%), respectively, and adverse gastrointestinal effects occurred in 14% (95% CI, 1%-28%) of the neonates. The microbiological cure in the study that assessed azithromycin at 20 mg\/kg per day were 60% (95% CI, 27%-93%) when it was given in a single dose and 86% (95% CI, 61%-100%) when given in a 3-day course. Two studies reported compliance with treatments, and 1 study reported no pyloric stenosis events. Because of the risk of bias and the few neonates included across the studies, the certainty of evidence is low to very low. No studies assessed trimethoprim. Although evidence suggests that erythromycin at 50 mg\/kg per day for 14 days results in higher numbers of cure than does azithromycin, compliance and risk of pyloric stenosis related to their use for other infections in neonates will factor into treatment recommendations. More data are needed to compare these treatments directly. ","518":"Our goal was to evaluate the infrastructure of programs for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in major delivery units in the Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan statistical area and to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of providers in these facilities around PMTCT. Hospital assessments and individual knowledge and practices were surveyed among 71 healthcare providers from March 2015 to March 2016 in 11 hospitals that deliver 40000 infants annually, which represents 70% of all deliveries in the Atlanta metropolitan statistical area. Included were questions about HIV testing for mother-infant pairs, test result turnaround times, policies and procedures for PMTCT, opt-out versus opt-in testing, availability of rapid point-of-care testing on labor and delivery units, and postnatal prophylaxis. Seventy-three percent (8 of 11) of the hospitals had limitations in their PMTCT infrastructure, and 36% (4 of 11) reported no standardized policies for care of HIV-infected women. Three labor and delivery units used opt-in HIV testing of women. Only 27% (3 of 11) of the hospitals reported nucleic acid testing of HIV-exposed infants. Oral zidovudine for infant prophylaxis was available in all the hospitals, but 64% (7 of 11) of them did not stock nevirapine. Fifty-nine percent (24 of 44) of the obstetricians did not routinely offer rapid testing at delivery without a third-trimester HIV test, and 78% (n = 32 of 41) of them did not offer testing at delivery if the woman declined antenatal testing. The facility with the most annual births in Georgia did not offer rapid testing at delivery for women with an unknown HIV status. We identified several limitations in PMTCT infrastructure that might have contributed to perinatal HIV transmissions.

We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients aged &lt;18 years who received oral or intravenous moxifloxacin at our institution between January 2011 and July 2016. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, indication for moxifloxacin use, and adverse events (AEs) were extracted via chart review. The attribution of AEs to moxifloxacin use was adjudicated in consultation with a pediatric infectious disease (ID) pharmacist. We identified 221 patients who received 300 courses of moxifloxacin. The average age at moxifloxacin initiation was 10.4 years. One or more AEs occurred during 195 (65%) of the courses. Of the 463 distinct AEs, 46 (9.9%) were attributed to moxifloxacin. AEs attributed to moxifloxacin included corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation (18 [6%] courses), transaminase level elevation (7 [2.3%] courses), and increased bilirubin level (3 [1%] courses). AEs led to moxifloxacin discontinuation in 18 (6%) courses. ID consultation was associated with QTc (P &lt; .001) and transaminase (P = .002) monitoring. AEs that occur during pediatric moxifloxacin therapy are relatively common but rarely serious enough to require premature discontinuation.

During February-May 2013, Idaho public health officials and pediatric infectious disease physicians investigated an outbreak of M abscessus skin infections in children whose only common exposure was an indoor wading pool. Healthcare providers and parents reported possible M abscessus cases. We used a standardized questionnaire to interview parents of affected children. Clinical specimens were submitted for mycobacterial examination. We conducted an environmental investigation of the pool. Microbial isolates from clinical and environmental samples were identified by sequencing polymerase chain reaction amplicons and underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Twelve cases were identified. Specimens from 4 of 7 children grew M abscessus or Mycobacterium abscessus\/Mycobacterium chelonae . Ten (83%) of 12 children were female; median age was 3 years (range, 2 to 6 years); and all were immunocompetent. Pool maintenance did not fully comply with Idaho state rules governing pool operation. Mycobacterium abscessus\/chelonae was isolated from pool equipment. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis composite patterns were 87% similar between isolates from the pool ladder and 1 patient, and they were 90% similar between isolates from 2 patients. Environmental remediation included hyperchlorination, scrubbing and disinfection of pool surfaces, draining the pool, and replacement of worn pool materials. Immunocompetent children acquired M abscessus cutaneous infection involving hands and feet after exposure to a wading pool. Environmental remediation and proper pool maintenance likely halted transmission.

Antibiotics are commonly continued for 48 hours pending culture results and clinical status. The goal of this study was to examine if the implementation of a 48-hour automatic stop (autostop) order during NICU admissions would decrease antibiotic use at UnityPoint Health-Meriter. An observational double-cohort study was performed in a level 3 NICU. Antibiotic use was evaluated before and after the autostop initiative. The admission order set included 48 hours of ampicillin and gentamicin coverage. After the autostop initiation, total doses given per patient decreased by 35% and doses per patient-day decreased by 25% (P &lt; .0001). The greatest effect was a 66% decrease in the use of vancomycin, an antibiotic not included in the admission order set. Providers proactively continued antibiotics for infants in whom they had high suspicion for sepsis and in those with positive blood or cerebral spinal fluid culture results. An admission-order autostop was highly effective at decreasing antibiotic usage with no doses intended for a pathogen missed. Fewer doses of certain antibiotics outside of the admission order set were administered, particularly vancomycin, which results in our speculation that provider awareness of the antibiotic stewardship initiative might have altered prescribing practices.

Furthermore, we are critical to the education of future physicians (in general), pediatricians, and infectious diseases doctors. In addition to diagnosing and treating bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic infections known through the ages, we have been at the forefront of meeting today's new infectious threats to children's health, which include the following: antibiotic-resistant organisms; hospital-acquired infections; global outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, human immunodeficiency virus-acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and new strains of influenza; infections in immunocompromised children; vaccine-preventable infections; the inefficient use of medical resources; and the high cost of medical care.","537":"Less than optimal adherence with antiretroviral therapy occurs commonly among human immunodeficiency virus HIV)-infected youth. In this study, our object was to identify patterns in the prefailure measurement of viral load (VL) that can reliably predict virological failure (VF) in HIV perinatally infected youth on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). We conducted a retrospective chart review of HIV-infected youth with low-level viremia (LLV), defined as an HIV VL between the lower limits of detection (20-75 copies\/mL) and 1000 copies\/mL. All patients were perinatally infected, under 22 years of age, observed for at least 24 months of consecutive follow-up between May 2008 and July 2014, and received their HIV care at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Of the 349 subjects screened, 100 were eligible for analysis. Virological failure was defined as 3 or more consecutive VLs greater than 1000 copies\/mL. Multiple logistic regression and receiver operator characteristic curves were used to identify patterns in VL that ultimately resulted in VF. Fifteen of the 100 patients experienced VF. Higher log10 mean VL, positive slope of the VL (log10 copies\/mL per day), and fewer clinic visits were associated with a higher probability of VF. Sensitivity and specificity were .87 and .95, respectively. Resistance was not found in 12 of 15 patients with VF. Patients with LLV that had fewer clinic visits and a trend toward increasing VLs had an increased risk of VF. Noncompliance seems to be a major component of VF. Physicians should emphasize the critical nature of medication adherence.

We analyzed inpatient and outpatient children with AGE and healthy controls from Vanderbilt University Medical Center between December 1, 2014, and November 30, 2015. The following 4 outcome groups were defined: overall AGE, norovirus-associated AGE, rotavirus-associated AGE, and nonnorovirus\/nonrotavirus AGE. Multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between previous antibiotic use and the 4 AGE outcomes and with AGE severity. Reported antibiotic use rates in the 3 months before illness onset were similar across the 4 AGE outcomes (overall AGE, 21%; norovirus-associated AGE, 23%; rotavirus-associated AGE, 28%; and nonnorovirus\/nonrotavirus AGE, 22%) but were higher than that reported for healthy controls (9%). Compared with healthy controls, patients with AGE overall were 4.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-11.4) times more likely to have reported antibiotic use in the 3 weeks before illness onset and 2.6 (95% CI, 1.7-4.1) times more likely to have reported antibiotic use within 3 months before illness onset. Similar results were found for the other specific AGE outcomes. For the overall AGE group, the odds of antibiotic use in the 3 months before illness onset was 3.5 (95% CI, 1.8-7.1) times higher for inpatients than for outpatients. Previous antibiotic use among children was associated with increased odds of AGE, irrespective of etiology, and this association was stronger with more recent antibiotic use. Previous antibiotic use was associated also with more severe AGE.

Our objective was to describe variation in patient and treatment characteristics for children with first CSF shunt infection, stratified by infecting organism subgroups outlined in the 2017 Infectious Disease Society of America's (IDSA) guidelines. We studied a prospective cohort of children &lt;18 years of age undergoing treatment for first CSF shunt infection at one of 7 Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network hospitals from April 2008 to December 2012. Differences between infecting organism subgroups were described using univariate analyses and Fisher's exact tests. There were 145 children whose infections were diagnosed by CSF culture and addressed by IDSA guidelines, including 47 with Staphylococcus aureus, 52 with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 37 with Gram-negative bacilli, and 9 with Propionibacterium acnes. No differences in many patient and treatment characteristics were seen between infecting organism subgroups, including age at initial shunt, gender, race, insurance, indication for shunt, gastrostomy, tracheostomy, ultrasound, and\/or endoscope use at all surgeries before infection, or numbers of revisions before infection. A larger proportion of infections were caused by Gram-negative bacilli when antibiotic-impregnated catheters were used at initial shunt placement (12 of 23, 52%) and\/or subsequent revisions (11 of 23, 48%) compared with all other infections (9 of 68 [13%] and 13 of 68 [19%], respectively). No differences in reinfection were observed between infecting organism subgroups. The organism profile encountered at infection differs when antibiotic-impregnated catheters are used, with a higher proportion of Gram-negative bacilli. This warrants further investigation given increasing adoption of antibiotic-impregnated catheters.

Current evidence supports the use of prophylactic antibacterial, antifungal, and immunomodulatory therapies designed to prevent serious or life-threatening infections in patients with CGD. In this review, we discuss current strategies for the prevention of infections in children and adults with CGD and the evidence that supports those strategies. In addition, we address current challenges and opportunities for future research in this important area.","543":"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a congenital disorder characterized by recurrent life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections and development of severe inflammation secondary to a congenital defect in 1 of the 5 phagocyte oxidase (phox) subunits of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex. Hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is a curative treatment for patients with CGD that provides donor neutrophils with functional NADPH and superoxide anion production. Many characteristics of CGD, including preexisting infection and inflammation and the potential for cure with mixed-donor chimerism, influence the transplant approach and patient outcome. Because of the dangers of short-term death, graft-versus-host disease, and late effects from chemotherapy, HCT historically has been reserved for patients with high-risk disease and a matched donor. However, as advances in CGD and HCT treatments have evolved, recommendations on transplant eligibility also must be amended, but the development of modern guidelines has proven difficult. In this review, we provide an overview of HCT in patients with CGD, including the debate over HCT indications in them, the unique aspects of CGD that can complicate HCT, and a summary of transplant outcomes.","544":"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency characterized by a deficient neutrophil oxidative burst and the inadequate killing of microbes, is well known to cause a significantly increased risk of invasive infection. However, infectious complications are not the sole manifestations of CGD; substantial additional morbidity is driven by noninfectious complications also. These complications can include, for example, a wide range of inflammatory diseases that affect the gastrointestinal tract, lung, skin, and genitourinary tract and overt autoimmune disease. These diseases can occur at any age and are especially problematic in adolescents and adults with CGD. Many of these noninfectious complications present a highly challenging therapeutic conundrum, wherein immunosuppression must be balanced against an already markedly increased risk of invasive fungal and bacterial infections. In this review, the myriad noninfectious complications of CGD are discussed, as are important gaps in our understanding of these processes, which warrant further investigation.","545":"","546":"","547":"Chronic granulomatous disease is a rare and potentially fatal disorder of neutrophil function. Beyond current medical management and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, new methods of gene therapy that use lentiviral vectors or gene editing might extend curative therapies to patients who lack a suitable transplantation donor while eliminating the risk of graft-versus-host disease. Furthermore, new therapies focused on altering the biology of phagolysosomes might offer novel targeted treatments for inflammatory complications in patients with chronic granulomatous disease.","548":"Chronic Granulomatous Disease is one of the classic primary immunodeficiencies of childhood. While the incidence and severity of bacterial and fungal infections have been greatly reduced in this patient population, much remains to be learned about the pathophysiology of the disease, particularly for autoinflammatory manifestations.

The disease presents in most patients initially with infection, especially of the lymph nodes, lung, liver, bone, and skin. Patients with CGD are susceptible to a narrow spectrum of pathogens, and Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia complex, Serratia marcescens, Nocardia species, and Aspergillus species are the most common organisms implicated in North America. Granuloma formation, most frequently in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems, is a common complication of CGD and can be seen even before diagnosis. An increased incidence of autoimmune disease has also been described in patients with CGD and X-linked female carriers. In patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with CGD, a flow cytometric dihydrorhodamine neutrophil respiratory burst assay is a quick and cost-effective way to evaluate NADPH oxidase function.

The most severe category of influenza-associated encephalopathy (IAE) is acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), characterized by high frequency of neurologic sequelae and fatal outcomes. We report two young siblings who developed fever and seizures with altered mental status. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection was identified in upper respiratory tract specimens from both patients, and neuroimaging revealed bilateral inflammatory lesions, consistent with acute necrotizing encephalopathy. Neither child had received influenza vaccination. Both children progressed to critical illness and required invasive mechanical ventilation. In addition to critical care management, both patients received high-dose corticosteroids, mannitol, anticonvulsants, and antiviral treatment of influenza. The older child recovered fully and was discharged 2 weeks after illness onset, but the younger sibling developed severe brainstem edema and cerebellar tonsillar herniation, and died on illness day 11. Both children tested positive for Ran Binding Protein 2 (RANBP2) gene mutations. RANBP2 is a genetic polymorphism associated with recurrent episodes of necrotizing encephalitis with respiratory viral infections. Annual influenza vaccination is especially important for ANE survivors, with or without RANBP2 mutations, their household contacts, and caregivers.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether combination therapy with vancomycin and TZP is associated with an incidence of AKI in pediatric patients higher than that in those on combination therapy with vancomycin and cefepime. We performed a retrospective single-center matched-cohort study of pediatric patients who received vancomycin in combination with TZP or cefepime between January 2015 and June 2016. The patients were matched according to chronic disease, age, sex, and number of concomitant nephrotoxic medications at the time of combination antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was incidence of AKI. Secondary outcomes included differences between groups in time to AKI, resolution of AKI, and effect of vancomycin trough levels on the incidence of nephrotoxicity. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare categorical and continuous variables between treatment groups. Conditional Poisson regression was used to assess the association between AKI and treatment groups. Stratified log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models with shared frailty were used to compare the times to AKI according to treatment group. Two hundred twenty-eight matched patients were included. AKI developed in 9 (7.9%) of 114 and 33 (28.9%) of 114 patients in the cefepime and TZP groups, respectively (P &lt; .001).

Using the standardized Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children Point Prevalence Survey protocol, a cross-sectional point-prevalence survey was conducted at 226 pediatric hospitals in 41 countries from October 1 to November 30, 2012. Overall, 17693 pediatric patients were surveyed and 36.7% of them received antibiotics (n = 6499). Of 6818 inpatient children, 2242 (32.9%) received at least 1 antimicrobial for prophylactic use. Of 11899 prescriptions for antimicrobials, 3400 (28.6%) were provided for prophylactic use. Prophylaxis for medical diseases was the indication in 73.4% of cases (2495 of 3400), whereas 26.6% of prescriptions were for surgical diseases (905 of 3400). In approximately half the cases (48.7% [1656 of 3400]), a combination of 2 or more antimicrobials was prescribed. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAs), which included tetracyclines, macrolides, lincosamides, and sulfonamides\/trimethoprim, was high (51.8% [1761 of 3400]). Broad-spectrum antibiotic use for medical prophylaxis was more common in Asia (risk ratio [RR], 1.322; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.202-1.653) and more restricted in Australia (RR, 0.619; 95% CI, 0.521-0.736). Prescription of BSA for surgical prophylaxis also varied according to United Nations region. Finally, a high percentage of surgical patients (79.7% [721 of 905]) received their prophylaxis for longer than 1 day. A high proportion of hospitalized children received prophylactic BSAs.

Antimicrobial susceptibility data from The Surveillance Network were used to phenotypically identify antibiotic resistance in A baumannii isolates in children 1-17 years of age between January 1999 and July 2012. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate trends in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in A baumannii. Isolates from infants (&lt;1 year old) were excluded. The crude proportion of cephalosporin-resistant (CephR) A baumannii increased from 13.2% in 1999 to 23.4% in 2012 with a peak of 32.5% in 2008, and the proportion of CR A baumannii increased from 0.6% in 1999 to 6.1% in 2012 with a peak of 12.7% in 2008.

Overall, between 1999 and 2012, CephR and CR A baumannii isolates increased in children; however, a decreasing trend was observed after 2008.There is a need for ongoing surveillance of A baumannii infections and continued assessment of effective prevention strategies in vulnerable populations. ","568":"Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) infection is the most common congenital infection and causes significant morbidity. This study was undertaken to evaluate the benefits of screening newborns for cCMV and to understand the cCMV disease burden in Finland. Infants born in Helsinki area hospitals were screened for CMV by testing their saliva with a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay. The CMV-positive infants and matched controls were monitored to determine their neurodevelopmental, audiological, and ophthalmological outcomes at 18 months of age. Griffiths Mental Development Scales, otoacoustic emission and sound field audiometry, and ophthalmologic examination were performed. Of the 19868 infants screened, 40 had confirmed cCMV infection (prevalence, 2 in 1000 [95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.6 in 1000]). Four (10%) infants had symptomatic cCMV. Griffiths general quotients did not differ significantly between the CMV-positive (mean, 101.0) and control (mean, 101.6) infants (P = .557), nor did quotients for any of the Griffiths subscales (locomotion, personal-social, hearing and language, eye and hand, performance) (P = .173-.721). Four of 54 CMV-positive ears and 6 of 80 CMV-negative ears failed otoacoustic emission testing (P = 1.000).

No CMV-related ophthalmologic findings were observed. The prevalence of cCMV was low, and outcomes at 18 months of age did not differ between the infected infants and healthy control infants. With such a low burden in Finland, universal newborn screening for cCMV seems unwarranted. ","569":"Staphylococcus aureus is among the most commonly identified causes of invasive bacterial infection in children; however, reliable results from cultures of sterile-site samples often cannot be obtained, which necessitates prescription of a broad empiric antimicrobial agent(s). Children with invasive S aureus infection rapidly generate high antibody titers to the cytotoxin LukAB; therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic utility of an anti-LukAB antibody assay for children with musculoskeletal infection (MSKI). We conducted a 2-year prospective study of all eligible children admitted to Vanderbilt Children's Hospital with an MSKI. Acute and convalescent sera were obtained, and antibodies that target LukAB were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Forty-two children were enrolled. The median concentrations of LukAB antibodies for children with S aureus infection were 130.3 U\/mL in the acute phase and 455 U\/mL in the convalescent phase (P &lt; .001). The median concentrations of LukAB antibodies in children with a non-S aureus MSKI were 8.6 U\/mL in the acute phase and 9.7 U\/mL in the convalescent phase. The assay discriminated between S aureus and non-S aureus infection with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.95; P &lt; .001) and 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-1; P &lt; .001) for samples tested in the acute and follow-up periods, respectively. With no false-negative results, the assay accurately ruled out S aureus in samples obtained during the convalescent phase. Culture-independent diagnostics have the potential to improve care by narrowing antimicrobial therapy on the basis of the likelihood of S aureus infection. The results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that a LukAB serologic assay might be useful in the diagnosis of invasive bacterial infections, and larger-scale validation studies are warranted. ","570":"Respiratory virus infection (RVI) in pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients poses a significant risk; however, the epidemiology and effects of an RVI after pediatric SOT in the era of current molecular diagnostic assays are unclear. A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric SOT recipients (January 2010 to June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Charts were reviewed for RVI events associated with hospitalization within 1 year after the transplant. An RVI diagnosis required respiratory symptoms and detection of a virus (ie, human rhinovirus\/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, coronavirus, and\/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline SOT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. Of 1096 pediatric SOT recipients (448 liver, 289 kidney, 251 heart, 66 lung, 42 intestine\/multivisceral), 159 (14.5%) developed RVI associated with hospitalization within 12 months after their transplant. RVI occurred at the highest rates in intestine\/abdominal multivisceral (38%), thoracic (heart\/lung) (18.6%), and liver (15.6%) transplant recipients and a lower rate in kidney (5.5%) transplant recipients. RVI was associated with younger median age at transplant (1.72 vs 7.89 years; P &lt; .001) and among liver or kidney transplant recipients with the receipt of a deceased-donor graft compared to a living donor (P = .01). The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of RVI onset were 4% and 0%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models revealed that age was independently associated with increased risk for a pulmonary complication (odds ratio, 1.24 [95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.51]) and that receipt of an intestine\/multivisceral transplant was associated with increased risk of all-cause death (odds ratio, 24.54 [95% confidence interval, 1.69-327.96]).

We calculated incidences among neonates (0-30 days old), infants (0-364 days old), and noninfant children (1-19 years old), documented their clinical features and antifungal drug resistance. We identified 307 pediatric candidemia cases. Incidence trends varied according to site, but overall, the incidence in neonates decreased from 31.5 cases\/100000 births in 2009 to 10.7 to 11.8 cases\/100000 births between 2012 and 2015, the incidence in infants decreased from 52.1 cases\/100000 in 2009 to 15.7 to 17.5 between 2012 and 2015, and the incidence in noninfant children decreased steadily from 1.8 cases\/100000 in 2009 to 0.8 in 2014. Common underlying conditions were prematurity in neonates (78%), surgery in nonneonate infants (38%), and malignancy in noninfant children (28%). Most neonate cases were caused by C albicans (67%), whereas non-C. albicans species accounted for 60% of cases in nonneonate infants and noninfant children. Fluconazole and echinocandin resistance rates were low overall. Thirty-day crude mortality was 13%. The incidence of candidemia among neonates and infants declined after 2009 but remained stable from 2012 to 2015. Antifungal drug resistance is uncommon. Reasons for the lack of recent declines in neonatal and infant candidemia deserve further exploration.

We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of children who presented to Seattle Children's Hospital and in whom HCoV was detected by a multiplex respiratory polymerase chain reaction assay of a nasal sample between October 2012 and March 2016. Lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) was defined as possible or definite infiltrate seen in chest imaging, need for oxygen, or abnormal lung examination in conjunction with a physician diagnosis of LRTD. We used logistic regression modeling to evaluate risk factors for LRTD and LRTD that necessitated oxygen use (severe LRTD), including an immunocompromised state, in children with HCoV infection. The median ages of 85 immunocompromised and 1152 nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV infection were 6.3 and 1.6 years, respectively. The prevalence of LRTD and of severe LRTD did not differ greatly between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients (22% vs 26% [LRTD] and 15% vs 11% [severe LRTD], respectively); however, in a multivariable model, an immunocompromised state was associated with an increased likelihood of severe LRTD (adjusted odds ratio, 2.5 [95% confidence interval, 1.2-4.9]; P = .01). Younger age, having an underlying pulmonary disorder, and the presence of respiratory syncytial virus were also associated with LRTD or severe LRTD in multivariable models. The risks of LRTD or severe LRTD did not differ among the children with different HCoV strains. The presence of a copathogen and host factors, including an immunocompromised state, were associated with increased risk for severe LRTD.

Solicited adverse events following immunization were documented for 7 days after vaccination, and serious adverse events and adverse events of medical significance were documented for 6 months after vaccination. Levels of antibodies against component vaccine antigens were measured before and 1 month after vaccination. A solicited adverse event was reported by 87.7% of Tdap and 88.0% of Td vaccine recipients. We found no significant differences in the rates of injection-site reactions, systemic reactions, or serious adverse events between the vaccine groups.

We conducted a retrospective study of 78673 pediatric patients (aged 3 months to 17 years) hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia. Analyses were performed with data from the Pediatric Health Information System between 2007 and 2016, including discharge data from 48 freestanding children's hospitals. Patients who received antibiotics used to treat aspiration pneumonia and patients with a complex chronic condition were excluded to focus the study on uncomplicated cases. We modeled hospital practice patterns using hospital-level averages for the last day of service on which patients received antibiotics intravenously or first day of service on which patients received antibiotics orally. We found that a 1-day decrease in the hospital-level average last day of service on which a patient received antibiotics intravenously reduced the average length of stay by 0.58 day (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.69 to -0.47 day) and average cost by $1332 (95% CI, -$2363 to -$300). Results were similar when hospital practice patterns were modeled using the average first day of service on which a patient received antibiotics orally. These reductions in lengths of stay and costs were not associated with a difference in 30-day readmission rates. Given the reductions in lengths of stay and costs without sacrificing patient outcomes (readmissions), antimicrobial stewardship programs could target provider education on the duration of intravenous antibiotic therapy as a way to reduce resource utilization.

By law, newborns in Connecticut who fail newborn hearing screening are tested for infection with CMV. This targeted screening is controversial, because most children with congenital CMV infection are asymptomatic, and CMV-related hearing loss can have a delayed onset. Our hospital uses a saliva polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (confirmed by a urine PCR assay) to detect CMV. Here, we report the results of the first year of our screening program. We reviewed the medical records of newborns in the Yale New Haven Health System who failed the newborn hearing screening test between January 1 and December 31, 2016. Of 10964 newborns, 171 failed newborn hearing screening, and 3 of these newborns had positive saliva CMV PCR test results. Of these 3 newborns, 2 had positive results on the confirmatory test (for 1 of them the confirmatory test was not performed until the infant was 10 weeks old), and 1 had a negative result on the confirmatory test. Three additional newborns with congenital CMV infection were tested because of clinical indications (1 for ventriculomegaly on prenatal ultrasound and 2 for CMV infection of the mother). Results of audiology follow-up were available for 149 (87.1%) of the 171 newborns who failed newborn hearing screening; 127 (85.2%) had normal results. Our targeted screening program for congenital CMV infection had a low yield. Consideration should be given to other strategies for identifying children at risk of hearing loss as a result of congenital CMV infection.

Examination of a slide from the culture revealed the presence of wide nonseptate hyphae with sporangiophores, columella, and chlamydospores. The fungal isolate was sent to the National Institutes of Health for further evaluation and was identified as Mucor velutinosus by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and genomic sequencing.

Specifically, Professor Wright's lecture highlighted the remarkable opportunities for mucosal immunity research afforded by having both topically administered live vaccines and systemically administered inactivated vaccines available for the same pathogen. Using influenza and poliovirus case studies, Professor Wright described the use of live attenuated vaccines for human challenges and discussed how recent technological advancements in immunological assays have ushered in a new era for investigating the correlates of immune protection against wild-type infections at mucosal sites.","588":"","589":"Invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) disease has an incidence in high-income countries of 3 to 5 per 100000 per annum and a case-fatality ratio of 10% to 15%. Although these rates are comparable to those of invasive meningococcal disease in Australia before vaccine introduction, invasive GAS disease currently requires reporting in only 2 jurisdictions. Data were collected prospectively through active surveillance at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne (October 2014 to September 2016). Isolation of GAS from a sterile site was required for inclusion. Comprehensive demographic and clinical data were collected, and emm typing was performed on all isolates. Disease was considered severe if the patient required inotropic support or mechanical ventilation. We recruited 28 patients. The median age of the patients was 3.5 years (range, 4 days to 11 years). Ten (36%) patients had severe disease. Fifteen (54%) children had presented to a medical practitioner for review in the 48 hours before their eventual admission, including 7 of the 10 patients with severe GAS infection. Complications 6 months after discharge persisted in 21% of the patients. emm1 was the most common emm type (29%). We found considerable short- and longer-term morbidity associated with pediatric invasive GAS disease in our study. Disease manifestations were frequently severe, and more than one-third of the patients required cardiorespiratory support. More than one-half of the patients attended a medical practitioner for assessment but were discharged in the 48-hour period before admission, which suggests that there might have been a window for earlier diagnosis.

The American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Infectious Diseases in collaboration with the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society sought to assess the status of the current PID workforce. A Web-based survey conducted in 2015 collected data on demographics, practice patterns, and job satisfaction among the PID workforce, and identified factors related to job placement among recent fellowship graduates. Of 946 respondents (48% response rate), 50% were female. The average age was 51 years (range, 29-88 years); 63% were employed by an academic center\/hospital, and 85% provided direct patient care; and 18% were not current PID practitioners. Of the 138 (21%) respondents who had completed a PID fellowship within the previous 5 years, 83% applied for &lt;5 PID positions; 43% reported that their first position was created specifically for them; 47% had 1 job offer, and 41% had 2 or 3 job offers; 82% were employed within 6 months; and 74% remained at the institution of their first job. Respondents who were practicing PID full-time or part-time (n = 778) indicated desiring more focused training in immunodeficiencies (31%), transplant-related care (31%), and travel\/tropical medicine (28%). Overall, 70% of the respondents would \"definitely\" or \"probably\" choose PID again. Most respondents were satisfied with their career choice in PID.

","592":null,"593":"Vancomycin dosing in neonates is challenging because of the large variation in pharmacokinetics. Existing empiric dosing recommendations use table-based formats, within which a neonate is categorized on the basis of underlying characteristics. The ability to individualize dosing is limited because of the small number of \"dose categories,\" and achieving narrow exposure targets is difficult. Our objective was to evaluate a model-based dosing approach (which we designated Neo-Vanco) designed to individualize empiric vancomycin dosing in neonates. Neo-Vanco was developed on the basis of a published, externally validated population pharmacokinetic model. Using a simulation-based methodology, individualized empiric doses that maximize the probability of attaining a 24-hour area under the curve\/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (AUC24\/MIC) of &gt;400 while minimizing troughs &gt;20 mg\/L are calculated. To evaluate the Neo-Vanco strategy, retrospective data from neonates treated with vancomycin at 2 healthcare systems were used, and empiric dose recommendations from the following 4 sources were examined: Neo-Vanco, Neofax, Red Book, and Lexicomp. Predicted AUC24 and troughs were calculated and compared. Overall, 492 neonates were evaluated (median postmenstrual age, 36 weeks [5th-95th percentiles (90% range), 25-47 weeks]; median weight, 2.4 kg [90% range, 0.6-4.8 kg]). The percentage of neonates predicted to achieve an AUC24\/MIC of &gt;400 was 94% with Neo-Vanco, 18% with Neofax, 23% with Red Book, and 55% with Lexicomp (all P &lt; .0001 vs Neo-Vanco). Predicted troughs of &gt;20 mg\/L were infrequent and similar across the dosing approaches (Neo-Vanco, 2.8%; Neofax, 1.0% [P = .03]; Red Book, 2.6% [P = .99]; and Lexicomp, 4.1% [P = .27]. A model-based dosing approach that individualizes empiric vancomycin dosing was predicted to improve achievement of target exposure levels in neonates. Prospective clinical evaluation is warranted. ","594":"Mucormycosis represents the third most common invasive fungal infection in children, and recent studies have suggested a rising incidence. Its case fatality rate is high, especially for neonates. Clinical presentation is influenced by underlying risk factors; associations with immunosuppression, neutropenia, diabetes, and prematurity have been described. It has been implicated in several hospital outbreaks. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and evaluation with histopathology, culture, and, increasingly, molecular identification. Surgical debridement and antifungal therapies are the cornerstone for combatting invasive mucormycosis. However, the severity and relative rarity of this disease make comparative clinical trials for evaluating antifungal therapies in children difficult to conduct. Hence, therapeutic decisions are derived mainly from retrospective case series, in vitro data, and animal models. In this review, we summarize the literature on the epidemiology and diagnosis of this invasive fungal infection and provide suggestions on the management of mucormycosis in children.","595":"The prevalence of pediatric antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) is increasing in acute care facilities across the United States. Over the past several years, the evidence base used to inform effective stewardship practices has expanded, and regulatory interest in stewardship programs has increased.

Education techniques that optimize knowledge retention could be an important component of reducing these regimens. We implemented a quality improvement project that incorporated spaced education to reduce the use of redundant anaerobic therapy. The initial interventions (November through December 2015) included education in a hospital-wide newsletter and review of redundant anaerobic regimens by the antimicrobial stewardship program. A spaced education module was then developed with the gastroenterology (GI) service, which had a relatively high rate of redundant anaerobic therapy use. Ten questions with teaching points were delivered to GI physicians at spaced intervals over 2 to 4 weeks (February through March 2016). Knowledge scores were compared at initial and final question presentation using generalized estimating equations. Interrupted time-series analysis was used to compare the rates of redundant-metronidazole-days per 1000 patient-days among patients in the patients admitted to the GI service and those in the non-GI group before and after the intervention. Of 66 GI physicians, 56 (85%) participated in the spaced education activity. After the intervention, their knowledge scores on all the questions improved, and their mean knowledge score increased from 57% to 86% (P &lt; .001). Nearly all (91%) of the participants were very or generally satisfied with the activity. In the GI group, the rate of redundant-metronidazole-days decreased from 26.2 to 13.0 per 1000 patient-days (relative risk [RR], 0.45 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.27-0.73]; P = .001). This rate in the non-GI group also decreased from 5.47 to 2.18 per 1000 patient-days (RR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.36-0.60]; P &lt; .001) after our interventions.

Using a human factors engineering approach, we conducted a work system assessment to facilitate the dissemination of a quality improvement program for optimizing blood culture use in pediatric intensive care units at 2 hospitals. Semistructured face-to-face interviews were conducted with clinicians from Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital and University of Virginia Medical Center. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Blood culture-ordering practices are influenced by various work system factors, including people, tasks, tools and technologies, the physical environment, organizational conditions, and the external environment. A clinical decision-support tool could facilitate implementation by (1) standardizing blood culture-ordering practices, (2) ensuring that prescribing clinicians review the patient's condition before ordering a blood culture, (3) facilitating critical thinking, and (4) empowering nurses to communicate with physicians and advocate for adherence to blood culture-ordering guidelines. The success of interventions for optimizing blood culture use relies heavily on the local context. A work system analysis using a human factors engineering approach can identify key areas to be addressed for the successful dissemination of quality improvement interventions. ","602":"Evaluation for neonatal sepsis routinely includes performing both aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures despite our lack of knowledge of the true incidence of anaerobic bacteremia in this age group and the consequences of not performing these paired cultures. We performed a retrospective review of all blood cultures performed for neonates in a children's hospital. Clinically significant pathogens were defined as microorganisms that rarely are considered to be contaminants, that were recovered from multiple blood cultures or sites, or were considered significant according to the patient's attending physician. The chart of every patient with positive culture results was reviewed for patient characteristics. A total of 662 culture sets among 403 patients were obtained between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015. A clinically significant organism was isolated from 64 (9.7%) culture sets from 25 patients (1.9% contamination rate). A total of 56 organisms were isolated; 35 (62.5%) grew from both the aerobic and anaerobic bottles, 19 (33.9%) grew from the anaerobic bottle alone, and 2 (3.6%) grew from the aerobic bottle alone. One (0.2%) obligate anaerobic bacterium (Clostridium symbiosum) was identified.

Causal mediators of the poor health outcomes of HIV-EU children remain poorly defined. We conducted a hospital-based prospective cohort study of children aged 1 to 23 months with clinically defined pneumonia. The children were recruited at a referral hospital in Gaborone, Botswana, between April 2012 and June 2016. The primary outcome, treatment failure at 48 hours, was assessed by an investigator blinded to the children's HIV-exposure status. We examined associations between HIV exposure and pneumonia outcomes in HIV-uninfected children. We next determined whether the effect of HIV exposure on outcomes was mediated by low-birth-weight status, nonbreastfeeding, malnutrition, in utero exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy, or pneumonia severity. A total of 352 HIV-uninfected children were included in these analyses, including 245 (70%) HIV-unexposed and 107 (30%) HIV-EU children. Their median age was 7.4 months, and 57% were male. Treatment failure occurred in 111 (32%) children, and 19 (5.4%) children died. HIV-EU children were more likely to fail treatment (risk ratio [RR], 1.57 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.19-2.07]; P = .002) and had a higher in-hospital mortality rate (RR, 4.50 [95% CI, 1.86-10.85]; P = .001) than HIV-unexposed children. Nonbreastfeeding mediated 47% of the effect of HIV exposure on the risk of in-hospital death. HIV-EU children have worse pneumonia outcomes than HIV-unexposed children. Nonbreastfeeding mediates nearly half of the effect of HIV exposure on pneumonia mortality. Our findings provide additional evidence for a mortality benefit of breastfeeding by HIV-EU children. ","604":"Respiratory virus infections (RVIs) pose a threat to children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). In this era of sensitive molecular diagnostics, the incidence and outcome of HSCT recipients who are hospitalized with RVI (H-RVI) are not well described. A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients (between January 2010 and June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Their medical charts were reviewed for H-RVI events within 1 year after their transplant. An H-RVI diagnosis required respiratory signs or symptoms plus viral detection (human rhinovirus\/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronaviruses, and\/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of H-RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline HSCT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. Among 1560 HSCT recipients, 259 (16.6%) acquired at least 1 H-RVI within 1 year after their transplant. The median age of the patients with an H-RVI was lower than that of patients without an H-RVI (4.8 vs 7.1 years; P &lt; .001). Among the patients with a first H-RVI, 48% required some respiratory support, and 14% suffered significant pulmonary sequelae. The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of H-RVI onset were 11% and 5.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that H-RVI onset within 60 days of HSCT, steroid use in the 7 days before H-RVI onset, and the need for respiratory support at H-RVI onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death. Results of this multicenter cohort study suggest that H-RVIs are relatively common in pediatric HSCT recipients and contribute to significant morbidity and death. These data should help inform interventional studies specific to each viral pathogen. ","605":"","606":"Current data on tuberculous pericardial effusion in children are limited.

January 1, 2010, and September 31, 2015. Vaccination administration was determined by using Current Procedural Terminology codes. A missed opportunity was defined as the absence of an HPV vaccine at the following encounter types: visits with a 4-valent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) or tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine claim; well adolescent visits; or any encounter with a primary care provider (PCP). Missed opportunities were stratified by type of provider (pediatrician or nonpediatrician). Among 14588 adolescent girls, only 6098 (41.8%) initiated the HPV vaccine series. HPV vaccine was given at 37.1% of visits when a Tdap or MenACWY vaccine was administered, 26.0% of well adolescent visits and 41.8% of PCP visits. Pediatricians had fewer missed opportunities than nonpediatricians to administer HPV (50.7% vs 60.8%), as well as Tdap, although the difference was larger for Tdap (7.0% vs 29.6%). These data indicate that pediatricians and nonpediatricians alike are missing opportunities to administer the HPV vaccine when other adolescent vaccines are given. Efforts should be focused on converting these missed vaccination opportunities into cancer-prevention visits.

We sought to capture parent perceptions of antibiotics at the time of their child's presentation with an ARTI. We conducted semistructured interviews with parents of children who presented with ARTI symptoms to 1 of 4 diverse practices in a large hospital-affiliated network of pediatric primary care practices. Parents were interviewed before their child was seen by the pediatrician and asked about their perceptions of antibiotics. Interviews were conducted with 109 parents. None of the parents said they planned to ask the pediatrician for antibiotics but instead expected to gain reassurance and a plan to minimize symptoms. Three perceptions about antibiotics were identified: parents have a sense of wariness when their child is prescribed antibiotics, they have an understanding that antibiotic overuse is a problem but that it is driven by the demands of other parents, and they have a preference for alternative treatment. The majority of the parents were not concerned about antibiotic resistance. In response to closed-ended questions designed to assess their level of concern with adverse effects, parents were most concerned with their child developing an upset stomach, having an allergic reaction, and experiencing diarrhea. The parents were not concerned with antibiotic treatment failure. Parents in our study expressed a sense of caution about antibiotics and an awareness that they should be used judiciously.

The patients were followed for 180 days after transplant or until death to determine the presence or absence of IFD. The 2008 European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer\/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group Consensus Group criteria were used to define IFD as proven or probable. The incidence of IFD, all-cause mortality rate, and case-fatality rate at 180 days were calculated. Among 584 pediatric patients who underwent SOT, 13 patients sustained 14 episodes of IFD (candidiasis, aspergillosis, and mucormycosis). The overall incidence was 2.2% (14.3 IFD events per 100000 patient-days). The IFD rates according to transplant type were 12.5% (1 of 8) (heart\/lung), 11.4% (4 of 35) (lung), 4.7% (8 of 172) (liver), 0% (0 of 234) (kidney), and 0% (0 of 135) (heart). Three patients with IFD (2 lung and 1 heart\/lung) died, and all these deaths were deemed likely attributable to the IFD; the case-fatality rate was 21.4% (3 of 14). The overall incidence of IFD in these pediatric SOT recipients was low but varied across transplant type, with heart\/lung and lung recipients having the highest IFD rate.

Some case reports recently described the effectiveness of the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4) as an adjuvant therapy. On the basis of these reports, we administered HPV4 to a 2-year-old boy with JoRRP. However, no therapeutic effect was found. A review of the available literature revealed that current evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic HPV4 and other adjuvant therapies for JoRRP is inconsistent. Therefore, the prophylactic use of currently available HPV vaccine for adolescents is the most effective strategy for preventing not only anogenital cancers but also genital warts, which might be a risk factor for JoRRP among their children in the future.","626":"Two doses of measles vaccine (MV) might reduce the nonmeasles mortality rate more than 1 dose of MV does.

Children were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive MV at 4.5 and 9 months of age or the currently recommended dose at 9 months. We compared hospital admission rates among children between 9 and 18 months of age in a Cox regression model with age as the underlying time scale. Half of the children had received neonatal vitamin A supplementation (NVAS) in another trial. The beneficial effect of MV at 4.5 and 9 months on mortality was limited to children who had not received NVAS; therefore, we investigated the interaction of MV with NVAS on admission rates. Among 5626 children (2 doses of MV, 1960 children; 1 dose of MV, 3666), we identified 311 hospital admissions of children between 9 and 18 months of age. Overall, compared to 1 dose of MV, 2 doses reduced the risk of hospital admission for children who had not received NVAS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-0.93]), but we found no effect among NVAS recipients (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.82-1.63]) (P = .02 for interaction). The benefit of 2 doses of MV was limited to children who had not received NVAS. NVAS is not generally recommended; hence, an early 2-dose measles vaccination policy might reduce hospital admissions more than the current policy of providing the first MV at 9 months of age.

We assessed correlates of prenatal hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening and HBsAg positivity among pregnant women and evaluated the care of infants of HBsAg-positive women. Demographic and clinical data were abstracted from the maternal medical records of 966 randomly selected live infants born in 2014. Frequencies were calculated, and prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression. Among the mothers of the 966 infants, 78.2% were Pacific Islanders, 56.9% were &gt;25 years old (born before universal infant hepatitis B vaccination in Guam), 89.0% received prenatal care (PNC), 96.7% underwent prenatal HBsAg screening, and 2.0% were HBsAg positive. Approximately 15% of the women who did not have PNC were not screened for HBsAg. Receipt of PNC was associated with HBsAg screening (adjusted PR, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.04-1.23]), and HBsAg positivity was associated with a maternal age of &gt;25 years (adjusted PR, 6.80 [95% CI, 1.32-35.08]). All 18 infants of the HBsAg-positive mothers received hepatitis B vaccine, and 17 (94.4%) received hepatitis B immunoglobulin. Although the prenatal HBsAg screening prevalence in this sample was high, the maternal HBsAg prevalence among women in this sample was more than 14 times and 2 times the prevalence among US-born Pacific Islander\/Asian women and all women in the continental United States, respectively. Improving access to PNC, ensuring that all pregnant women in Guam (especially those born before universal hepatitis B vaccination) are screened for HBsAg, and adopting postexposure prophylaxis for infants of HBsAg-positive mothers as standard clinical practice are important for preventing perinatal HBV transmission and reducing HBV endemicity.

We examined the impact of a C trachomatis vaccination program using a decision-analysis model to estimate the effects of vaccination on C trachomatis-associated costs and morbidity. We developed a Markov model considering a cohort of 2158117 US females aged 9 to 26 years. Morbidity, death, and healthcare-associated costs associated with chlamydial infection of mothers and fetuses\/neonates were calculated over a 17-year time frame. We developed 2 major comparison arms, namely, a C trachomatis vaccination program and no C trachomatis vaccination program. Base-case efficacy and coverage were set to those of human papillomavirus in the United States with all variables, including efficacy and coverage, ranged in sensitivity analyses. On the basis of a base-case analysis, a vaccination program would cost an estimated $710 million for a cohort of 2158117 women over a 17-year period, an increase of $41 million over having no vaccination program. A vaccination program would prevent 34000 cases of C trachomatis infection and 5976 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease. A C trachomatis vaccination program results in increased cost to the healthcare system but averts significant morbidity and death.

The role of diagnostic imaging in children at risk for an IFD is multifactorial, including initially detecting it, evaluating for dissemination of infection beyond the primary site of disease, monitoring the response to antifungal therapy, and assessing for potential relapse. The objective of this review was to synthesize the published literature relevant to the use of various imaging modalities for the diagnosis and management of IFD in children.","638":null,"639":"Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are devastating opportunistic infections that result in significant morbidity and death in a broad range of pediatric patients, particularly those with a compromised immune system. Recognizing them can be difficult, because nonspecific clinical signs and symptoms or isolated fever are frequently the only presenting features. Therefore, a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary in patients at increased risk of IFD, which requires knowledge of the pediatric patient population at risk, additional predisposing factors within this population, and the clinical signs and symptoms of IFD. With this review, we aim to summarize current knowledge regarding the recognition and clinical presentation of IFD in neonates and children.","640":"Considerable progress has been made in the prevention, diagnosis, and management of pediatric patients with invasive fungal disease (IFD). The reported decreasing trend in the incidence of invasive candidiasis (IC) over the past 15 years in both neonates and children has been encouraging. Nevertheless, due to the growing number of immunocompromised children at risk for IFD, this disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity and death and with increased financial burden to the health care system. Therefore, it is important to understand the contemporary epidemiology of IFD. Incidence rates of IFD in children are affected by geographical, population, and time variability. There is an ongoing effort to constantly document and update the incidence of IFD and species distribution among different pediatric populations as a means to direct preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic resources to the most appropriate subset of patients. Children with a hematologic malignancy or a primary or secondary immunodeficiency, those undergoing solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and premature neonates are the major subsets of pediatric patients at risk of developing IFD.

Here, we define the clinical features of and characterize isolates from children with periorbital or orbital cellulitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. Patients were identified from a prospective S aureus study database from January 2002 to July 2015. Demographic and clinical data were collected retrospectively. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (lukSF-PV [pvl]) genes were detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Data were analyzed with the Fisher exact or Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Eighty-five patients with periorbital (n = 58) or orbital (n = 27) cellulitis were identified. We found 57 (67%) methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) isolates, 72 (85%) pvl-positive (pvl+) isolates, and 66 (78%) USA300 isolates. No differences in clinical characteristics were found when we compared MRSA to methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) infections or USA300 to non-USA300 infections. Patients with orbital cellulitis were hospitalized a median of 12 days (range, 2-28 days) and received antibiotics for 21 days (range, 10-32 days). Twelve (44%) patients with orbital cellulitis received steroids. Steroid treatment did not affect the length of hospitalization or duration of antibiotic treatment. Six (7%) patients with orbital cellulitis were bacteremic. Patients with periorbital cellulitis were hospitalized for a median of 3 days (range, 0-17 days) and received antibiotics for 11 days (range, 7-32 days). According to computed tomography (CT), 19 (70%) patients with orbital cellulitis and 11 (41%) with periorbital cellulitis had sinusitis. The majority of periorbital and orbital S aureus infections at Texas Children's Hospital were caused by MRSA, and no change was observed over time.

We included studies if they consisted of children or adolescents (&lt;25 years) who were receiving treatment for cancer or undergoing HSCT and if the study evaluated risk factors among patients with and those without IFD. Among the 3566 studies screened, 22 studies were included. A number of pediatric factors commonly associated with an increased risk for IFD were confirmed, including prolonged neutropenia, high-dose steroid exposure, intensive-timing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia, and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. Increasing age, a factor not commonly associated with IFD risk, was identified as a risk factor in multiple published cohorts. With this systematic review, we have confirmed IFD risk factors that are considered routinely in daily clinical practice. Increasing age should also be considered when assessing patient risk for IFD. Future efforts should focus on defining more precise thresholds for a particular risk factor (ie, age, neutropenia duration) and on development of prediction rules inclusive of individual factors to further refine the risk prediction.

Clinical presentation and outcomes of children with HGA have been poorly described. A retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the frequency, presentation, and outcomes of pediatric patients with HGA between 1994 and 2015 in a region of Wisconsin in which HGA is highly endemic. Patients with related International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10, respectively) codes or positive HGA laboratory test results were evaluated and classified as having had confirmed, probable, or suspected HGA on the basis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. The Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used in statistical comparisons. Of 187 children identified with possible HGA, 17 (9%) had confirmed, 75 (40%) had probable, and 91 (49%) had suspected infections. The number of cases rose sharply in 2010 and has remained between 16 and 36 cases per year since that time. A minority of children with confirmed or probable infections had elevated liver transaminase levels (33%), leukopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia (17%), or anemia (8%); 6 (7%) of these children required hospitalization. Children with evidence of concurrent HGA and Lyme disease (27% of confirmed or probable cases) had a higher risk of hospitalization (odds ratio, 6.55 [95% confidence interval, 1.11-38.78]).

The purpose of this report is to alert healthcare providers to this potential route of transmission and to highlight the importance of screening guidelines for HSV before a water birth. Furthermore, it is essential to consider NHSV infection in any febrile infant who is not responding to standard empirical antibiotic management, even in the absence of herpetic lesions.","664":"Trichosporonosis is an emerging and often fatal opportunistic fungal infection in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with hematologic malignancy, but data in children are lacking. We report here 3 cases of invasive infection caused by Trichosporon asahii in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, Texas. We also conducted a literature review and identified 16 additional reports of pediatric patients with invasive T asahii infection and an underlying malignant or nonmalignant hematologic disorder. Of the 19 cases of invasive T asahii infection, the most commonly reported underlying hematologic disorder was acute lymphoblastic leukenia (47%), followed by acute myelogenous leukemia (21%). Most of the patients (94%) had neutropenia, defined as an absolute neutrophil count of &lt;500 cells\/mm3. Antifungal prophylaxis information was available in 6 of the 19 cases, and micafungin use was reported in 5 cases. Treatment regimens frequently included voriconazole monotherapy (47%) or the combination of an azole antifungal with amphotericin B (35%). The mortality rate was 58%. Recognizing that echinocandins, which are increasingly used for prophylaxis in patients with a hematologic malignancy, are not active against Trichosporon species is of critical importance. The recommended first-line therapy for trichosporonosis is voriconazole, but successful outcome depends largely on the underlying immune status of the host. ","665":"Kawasaki disease (KD) is widely viewed as an acute arteritis. However, our pathologic studies show that chronic coronary arteritis can persist long after disease onset and is closely linked with arterial stenosis. Transcriptome profiling of acute KD arteritis tissues revealed upregulation of T lymphocyte, type I interferon, and allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF1) genes. We determined whether these immune responses persist in chronic KD arteritis, and we investigated the role of AIF1 in these responses. Gene expression in chronic KD and childhood control arteries was determined by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, and arterial protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Allograft inflammatory factor-1 small-interfering ribonucleic acid macrophage treatment was performed to investigate the role of AIF1 in macrophage and T lymphocyte activation. Allograft inflammatory factor-1 protein was highly expressed in stenotic KD arteries and colocalized with the macrophage marker CD68. T lymphocyte and interferon pathway genes were significantly upregulated in chronic KD coronary artery tissues. Alpha interferon-induced macrophage expression of CD80 and major histocompatibility complex class II was dependent on AIF1, and macrophage expression of AIF1 was required for antigen-specific T lymphocyte activation. Allograft inflammatory factor-1, originally identified in posttransplant arterial stenosis, is markedly upregulated in KD stenotic arterial tissues. T lymphocyte and type I interferon responses persist in chronic KD arteritis. Allograft inflammatory factor-1 may play multiple roles linking type I interferon response, macrophage activation, and antigen-specific T lymphocyte activation. These results suggest the likely importance of lymphocyte-myeloid cell cross-talk in the pathogenesis of KD arteritis and can inform selection of new immunotherapies for clinical trials in high-risk KD children.

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of lipid profiles and growth within a larger longitudinal cohort study of perinatally HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected children aged 4-9 years in Johannesburg, South Africa. At enrollment, anthropometrics, viral load, CD4, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides were measured. Weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ), height-for-age Z-score (HAZ), and body mass index-for-age Z-score (BAZ) were calculated. United States pediatric thresholds for dyslipidemia were used. Five hundred fifty-three HIV-infected and 300 HIV-uninfected children (median age 6.9 years) of similar demographic characteristics were enrolled. Of the HIV-infected children, 94.8% were on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) (65.4% on LPV\/r- and 28.6% on efavirenz-based regimens). Among the treated, 94.3% had a viral load &lt;200 copies\/mL. Median CD4% was 34.4. The HIV-infected children had lower mean WAZ (-0.7 vs -0.3, P &lt; .01) and HAZ (-1.1 vs -0.7, P &lt; .01) compared with HIV-uninfected children. A lower proportion of HIV-infected children were overweight (BAZ &gt;1) compared with HIV-uninfected children (14.4% vs 21.7%, P = .04). Whether on LPV\/r or efavirenz, a higher proportion of HIV-infected children had borderline\/elevated TC or abnormal triglycerides than HIV-uninfected children, although a higher proportion of those on LPV\/r had borderline\/elevated TC, borderline\/elevated LDL, or abnormal triglycerides than those on efavirenz. In a South African cohort of HIV-infected children and population-appropriate HIV-uninfected children, unfavorable alterations in lipid profiles were detected in HIV-infected children regardless of treatment regimen compared with HIV-uninfected children. The HIV-infected children were of smaller size than HIV-uninfected children, but there was a high prevalence of overweight in both groups. Strategies for optimizing growth and early life management of lipid alterations may be warranted. ","669":"Nonsevere diarrheal disease in Nepal represents a large burden of illness. Identification of the specific disease-causing pathogens will help target the appropriate control measures. Infants aged 6 weeks to 12 months were recruited from 5 health facilities in eastern, central, and western Nepal between August 2012 and August 2013. The diarrhea arm included infants with mild or moderate diarrhea treatable in an outpatient setting; the nondiarrhea arm included healthy infants who presented for immunization visits or had a mild nondiarrheal illness. Stool samples were tested for 15 pathogens with a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and real-time reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR assays for rotavirus and norovirus. Rotavirus- and norovirus-positive specimens were genotyped. We calculated attributable fractions (AFs) to estimate the pathogen-specific burden of diarrhea and adjusted for facility, age, stunting, wasting, and presence of other pathogens. We tested 307 diarrheal and 358 nondiarrheal specimens. Pathogens were detected more commonly in diarrheal specimens (164 of 307 [53.4%]) than in nondiarrheal specimens (113 of 358 [31.6%]) (P &lt; .001). Rotavirus (AF, 23.9% [95% confidence interval (CI), 14.9%-32.8%]), Salmonella (AF, 12.4% [95% CI, 6.6%-17.8%]), and Campylobacter (AF, 5.6% [95% CI, 1.3%-9.8%]) contributed most to the burden of disease. In these diarrheal specimens, the most common genotypes for rotavirus were G12P[6] (27 of 82 [32.9%]) and G1P[8] (16 of 82 [19.5%]) and for norovirus were GII.4 Sydney (9 of 26 [34.6%]) and GII.7 (5 of 26 [19.2%]). The results of this study indicate that the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in Nepal will likely decrease outpatient diarrheal disease burden in infants younger than 1 year, but interventions to detect and target other pathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter spp, should also be considered.

Care coordination (CC) is a necessary component to successfully transition patients. Our objective was to assess outcomes of provider time spent on nonreimbursable CC activities in a pediatric OPAT program. We used a qualitative feasibility pilot design and modified the Care Coordination Measurement Tool. We captured nonreimbursable CC activity and associated outcome(s) among pediatric patients enrolled in OPAT from March 1 to April 30, 2015 (44 work days) at Doernbecher Children's Hospital. We generated summary statistics for this institutional review board-waived QI project. There were 154 nonreimbursable CC encounters conducted by 2 infectious diseases (ID) providers for 29 patients, ages 17 months-15 years, with complex infections. Total estimated time spent on CC was 54 hours, equivalent to at least 6 workdays. Five patients with complex social issues used 37% of total CC time. Of 129 phone events, 38% involved direct contact with families, pharmacies (13%), primary care providers (13%), and home health nursing (11%). Care coordination prevented 10 emergency room (ER) visits and 2 readmissions. Care coordination led to 16 additional, not previously scheduled subspecialist and 13 primary care visits. The OPAT providers billed for 32 clinic visits during the study period. Nonreimbursable CC work by OPAT providers prevented readmissions and ER visits and helped facilitate appropriate healthcare use. The value of pediatric OPAT involvement in patient care would have been underestimated based on reimbursable ID consultations and clinic visits alone. ","672":"Acute pediatric musculoskeletal infections are common, leading to significant use of resources and antimicrobial exposure. In order to decrease variability and improve the quality of care, Children's Hospital Colorado implemented a clinical care guideline (CCG) for these infections.

Retrospective chart review evaluated patients admitted to a large pediatric quaternary referral center (CHCO) diagnosed with acute osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, pyomyositis, and\/or musculoskeletal abscess prior to and after guideline implementation. Primary outcomes included length of stay and overall antibiotic use, with additional secondary clinical, process, and therapeutic outcomes examined. 82 patients were identified in both the pre-CCG and post-CCG cohorts. There was a reduction in the median of all primary outcomes, including length of stay (0.6 median days decrease, P = .04), length of IV antibiotic therapy (4.9 median days decrease, P &lt; .0001), and days of IV antibiotic therapy (6.4 median days decrease, P = .0004). Our median length of stay post-CCG was 4.9 days, the shortest reported length of stay for pediatric acute musculoskeletal infections to date. Additionally, there was a 24.5 hour reduction in median length of fever (P = .02), faster CRP normalization (P &lt; .0001), 50% decrease in the number of related readmissions (P = .02), 34% decrease in central venous catheters placed (P &lt; .0001), decreased time to first culture (P = .02), and 79% pathogen identification post-CCG (P = .056).

Among 23 children &lt;2 years old, 19 (83%) had an initial trough &lt;1 mg\/L. There was large intra- and interindividual variability in trough levels. Dosing also varied from 3.3 to 19.6 mg\/kg per dose. Only 2 of 34 patients had a documented adverse drug reaction attributable to voriconazole.

The objective of this evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of a forced second-sign process in the electronic medical record as a pediatric ASP strategy. We anticipated that the second-sign process for antibiotics would increase the appropriateness of empiric antibiotic use, as defined by preapproved criteria, clinical pathways, national guidelines, and pediatric-specific infectious diseases reference texts, while not causing significant delay in the initial administration of antibiotic therapy. This was a retrospective before and after intervention chart review conducted from July 2014 to June 2015. The study was conducted at a 187-bed, freestanding teaching children's hospital that included the following: level-1 pediatric trauma center, 18-bed pediatric intensive care unit, and 32-bed neonatal intensive care unit. A total of 1178 orders were identified, and 389 met inclusion criteria. The vast majority of second-sign orders were for vancomycin (92%), 61% were written for males, and the median age was 6 years old. Appropriateness of second-sign restricted antibiotic use significantly increased after second-sign implementation (84.5% to 92.9%, P = .01).

Kawasaki disease features and classification were documented by the attending physician using a standardized documentation tool on the day of treatment for KD, including confidence in the KD diagnosis on a 4-point scale. Incomplete KD was further classified using American Heart Association (AHA) criteria (sufficient or insufficient) and baseline echocardiogram data. We prospectively recorded intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance, coronary artery abnormalities (CAAs), periungual peeling, and retrospectively identified subsequent diagnoses of autoimmune\/inflammatory disease. From November 2012 to October, 2015, 162 patients were treated for KD: 105 with complete KD (Group 1), 7 with incomplete KD based on CAAs on day of KD diagnosis (Group 2), 23 with incomplete KD meeting AHA criteria (Group 3), and 27 with incomplete KD and insufficient AHA criteria (Group 4). Group 4 patients had lower baseline median C-reactive protein levels (Group 4 median 4.65 mg\/dL [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.3-13.6] vs Group 1 median 8.0 mg\/dL [IQR, 4.5-17], Group 2 median 13.9 mg\/dL [IQR, 1.4-18.2], Group 3 median 13.3 mg\/dL [IQR, 4.9-20.2]), and no coronary abnormalities developed, although 11% had IVIG resistance. Group 4 had higher rates of subsequent autoimmune\/inflammatory conditions diagnosed (11.1% in Group 4 vs &lt;5% for all others, P = .02). Standardized documentation and classification of KD features may be useful to correlate with clinical outcomes, including subsequent diagnosis of autoimmune\/autoinflammatory disease. Among patients with incomplete KD who did not meet AHA criteria and had a normal baseline echocardiogram, the IVIG resistance rate may have been related to a lower likelihood of an accurate diagnosis of KD.

Here, we describe the use of mNGS during investigation of a cluster of human rhinovirus (HRV)-positive infections on a high-risk pulmonary ward. We performed mNGS on 6 midnasal turbinate swabs from 4 case-patients and 10 swabs from 9 control outpatients that tested positive for enterovirus\/rhinovirus by the FilmArray system. HRV reads were recovered in 15 (94%) of the 16 samples sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of HRV whole genomes from the 4 case-patients and 5 outpatient controls along with partial genomes from additional outpatient controls revealed that isolates from the case-patients were not directly related and that the 2 closest case HRV genomes had an estimated time to most recent common ancestor of 172 years. Our turnaround time from receipt of the sample to phylogenetic analysis was 24 hours. We found the use of mNGS downstream of a rapid polymerase chain reaction respiratory panel during an investigation of 4 hospital-acquired rhinovirus infections to rapidly dispel concern of a single-source transmission event.

We developed a multicenter quality improvement collaborative focused on sharing data reports and benchmarking antimicrobial use to improve antimicrobial prescribing among hospitalized children. A national antimicrobial stewardship collaborative among children's hospitals, Sharing Antimicrobial Reports for Pediatric Stewardship (SHARPS), was established in 2013. Characteristics of the hospitals and their ASPs were obtained through a standardized survey. Antimicrobial-use data reports were developed on the basis of input from the participating hospitals. Collaborative learning opportunities were provided through monthly webinars and annual meetings. Since 2013, 36 US hospitals have participated in the SHARPS collaborative. The median full-time equivalent (pharmacist and physician) dedicated to 30 of these ASPs was 0.75 (interquartile range, 0.45-1.4). To date, the collaborative has developed 26 data reports that include benchmarking reports according to specific antimicrobial agents, indications, and clinical service lines. The collaborative has conducted 27 webinars and 3 in-person meetings to highlight the stewardship work being conducted in the hospitals. The data reports and learning opportunities have resulted in approximately 36 distinct stewardship interventions.

We compared time series of internet searches for \"rotavirus\" from Google Trends with rotavirus laboratory reports from the United States and United Kingdom and with hospitalizations for acute gastroenteritis in the United States and Mexico. Using time and location parameters, Google quantifies an internet query share (IQS) to measure the relative search volume for specific terms. We analyzed the correlation between IQS and laboratory and hospitalization data before and after national vaccine introductions. There was a strong positive correlation between the rotavirus IQS and laboratory reports in the United States (R2 = 0.79) and United Kingdom (R2 = 0.60) and between the rotavirus IQS and acute gastroenteritis hospitalizations in the United States (R2 = 0.87) and Mexico (R2 = 0.69) (P &lt; .0001 for all correlations).

The effect of antimicrobial treatment on the resolution of MEE is controversial, and the factors that affect resolution are unknown. We studied the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the time to the resolution of MEE as a secondary objective in our randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Children aged 6 to 35 months with stringently diagnosed AOM were allocated to receive amoxicillin-clavulanate (161 patients) or placebo (158 patients) for 7 days and closely followed for 3 months. This study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier NCT00299455). The median times to resolution of MEE were 20 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 16-24 days) and 29 days (95% CI, 26-32 days) in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively (P = .10). The resolution of MEE was confirmed in 138 (86%) of 161 and 132 (84%) of 158 patients in the amoxicillin-clavulanate and placebo groups, respectively (P = .59). In multivariable analysis, the resolution of MEE was prolonged most significantly by at least 1 recurrence of AOM during follow-up.

A 2 + 1 schedule (2 doses in the first year of life and a booster dose at 12 months of age) in children aged &lt;2 years and 2-dose catch-up immunization in children aged 13 to 24 months was administered during the first year of vaccine introduction. The purpose of this study was to assess the burdens of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and\/or community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized children younger than 5 years during the first 2 years of the program compared to those in the prevaccination period in our setting. This was a multicenter, prospective, and descriptive study. Rates of hospitalization resulting from IPD and\/or CAP in 5 pediatric reference centers across the country were analyzed (every 10 000 admissions). Clinical, epidemiologic, and microbiological data were recorded. Statistical analysis using Stata 8.0 was performed. A comparison of rates of hospitalization resulting from global IPD and\/or CAP in the prevaccine (2009-2011) and postvaccine (2012-2013) periods revealed significant decreases of 50% (P = .003) and 51% (P &lt; .0001), respectively. Significant decreases were also observed in number of hospitalizations resulting from empyema (39%; P = .03) and pneumococcal empyema (67.8%; P = .007); the reduction was not statistically significant for pneumococcal CAP (58%; P = .18). Hospital stays for IPD and\/or CAP decreased by 56%. Rapid and significant decreases in the rates of hospitalization resulting from IPD and\/or CAP during the first 2 years after PCV13 introduction were observed. A longer surveillance period is required to confirm these results and the effectiveness of the vaccination program. ","693":"The escalating incidence of invasive disease caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative enteric Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-GNE) is a global concern. Scant published studies in which the epidemiology of these infections in children is described exist; previous studies focused mainly on adults, described circumscribed populations, or lacked clinical detail. The objective of this study was to examine and describe the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes associated with MDR-GNE infection in children. In this cohort study, we used data from 48 children's hospitals maintained by the Pediatric Health Information System. We documented the proportion of MDR-GNE diagnoses among children's hospital patients aged 0 to &lt;18 years who were diagnosed with an Enterobacteriaceae-associated infection between January 1, 2007, and March 31, 2015, and we analyzed the association between MDR-GNE infection and hospital length of stay and death before discharge. During the study period, 107610 discharges included a diagnosis code for Enterobacteriaceae infection, 724 (0.7%) of which included MDR-GNE infection. The incidence of MDR-GNE, and the proportion of infections with Enterobacteriaceae organisms that were MDR-GNE increased over the study period; from 0.2% in 2007 to 1.5% by 2015 (test for trend &lt; .001). Almost one-quarter (23%) of the infections in children hospitalized for MDR-GNE were nosocomial. Increased odds of MDR-GNE infection were associated with older age and comorbid illnesses. Lengths of stay in patients with MDR-GNE infection were increased 20% (95% confidence interval, 9.9%-30.5%; P &lt; .001) over those without MDR-GNE infection; the increased odds for death did not reach statistical significance (1.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.98-2.18]; P = .06). Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. The incidence of pediatric MDR-GNE infection increased during 2007-2015. MDR-GNE infection was associated with increased length of stay, and we found a trend toward increased risk of death. Infections with Gram-negative enteric bacilli are becoming increasingly difficult to treat; considering the global burden of these antimicrobial-resistant organisms, interventions to curtail or even reverse this trend are needed urgently. ","694":"There is real shortage of national data on antimicrobial resistance rates in Indian neonates and children. A descriptive review was conducted to determine the patterns of antimicrobial resistance in isolates of blood stream infection among hospitalized children in India. Published and gray literature on antibiotic resistance in children was searched using \"Google Scholar\", \"Scopus\", and \"PubMed\" databases between January 2000 and July 2015. Studies were included if they were original articles that reported a minimum of 10 pathogenic bacterial isolates from the bloodstream within a pediatric population in India, and studies were excluded if they reported studies done during an outbreak or epidemic. A total of 1179 studies were screened, and 82 papers were identified as eligible for inclusion. Most studies (78.7%) were reported from neonatal intensive care units. Among a total of 50545 reported blood cultures, 14704 (29.1%) were positive. Staphylococcus aureus (median, 14.7%; IQR, 7.4%-25.6%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (median, 26%; IQR, 16.7%-35.4%) were the commonest reported Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, respectively. Approximately half of all S aureus isolates were reported as methicillin-resistant S aureus (median, 50%; IQR, 31.4%-65.1%). After age stratification, the median rate of resistance of common Gram-negative pathogens to ampicillin and gentamicin\/amikacin were extremely high (K pneumoniae\/ampicillin 95.9%; K pneumoniae\/gentamicin 75%; Escherichia coli\/ampicillin 92.9%; E coli\/gentamicin 55.6%). Likewise, the median resistance of common Gram-negative blood stream isolates to cephalosporins were also high (K pneumoniae\/cefotaxime 62.6%; E coli\/cefotaxime 47.5%). High rates of resistance to World Health Organization-recommended first-line treatment options for neonates and children have been identified in blood stream infections across India.

We describe here the epidemiology of infection with Giardia in the first 2 years of life in the Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health and Development Project (MAL-ED), a multisite birth-cohort study. From 2089 children, 34916 stool samples collected during monthly surveillance and episodes of diarrhea were tested for Giardia using an enzyme immunoassay. We quantified the risk of Giardia detection, identified risk factors, and assessed the associations with micronutrients, markers of gut inflammation and permeability, diarrhea, and growth using multivariable linear regression. The incidence of at least 1 Giardia detection varied according to site (range, 37.7%-96.4%) and was higher in the second year of life. Exclusive breastfeeding (HR for first Giardia detection in a monthly surveillance stool sample, 0.46 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.75]), higher socioeconomic status (HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.56-0.97]), and recent metronidazole treatment (risk ratio for any surveillance stool detection, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56-0.84]) were protective. Persistence of Giardia (consecutive detections) in the first 6 months of life was associated with reduced subsequent diarrheal rates in Naushahro Feroze, Pakistan but not at any other site. Giardia detection was also associated with an increased lactulose\/mannitol ratio. Persistence of Giardia before 6 months of age was associated with a -0.29 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.05) deficit in weight-for-age z score and -0.29 (95% CI, -0.64 to 0.07) deficit in length-for-age z score at 2 years. Infection with Giardia occurred across epidemiological contexts, and repeated detections in 40% of the children suggest that persistent infections were common. Early persistent infection with Giardia, independent of diarrhea, might contribute to intestinal permeability and stunted growth. ","703":"Despite the significant burden of disease associated with infection by group A streptococcus (GAS), little is known about the human immune response to GAS antigens after natural infection. We evaluated 195 serum samples obtained prospectively over a consecutive 24-month period from 41 pediatric subjects who experienced a new pharyngeal GAS acquisition. An enzyme-linked immunoassay was used to determine the kinetics and antigen specificity of antibodies against 13 shared GAS antigens and 18 type-specific M peptides. The majority of the antigens tested are currently being considered as vaccine candidates. Twelve M types of GAS were recovered from 41 subjects who experienced 51 new GAS acquisitions that elicited antibody responses against at least 1 of the 31 antigens tested (immunologically significant new GAS acquisitions). The immune responses to the 13 shared antigens were highly variable. Increases in antibody levels were detected against a mean of 3.5 shared antigens (range, 1-8). Antibody responses to the homologous M peptide were observed in 32 (63%) of the 51 episodes. Seven subjects acquired more than 1 M type of GAS. There were no new immunologically significant acquisitions of an M type against which the subject had preexisting antibodies to the homologous M peptide. Of the subjects with new GAS acquisition, 65% were asymptomatic, yet immune responses were detected against 1 or more GAS antigens. Immune responses to streptolysin O and\/or deoxyribonuclease B were observed after 67% of the new GAS acquisitions. Persistently positive (&gt;12 weeks) throat culture results were returned for 20% of the 41 subjects despite immune responses to homologous M peptides and\/or shared antigens. The availability of throat culture results, GAS isolates, and serial serum samples collected prospectively over a 2-year period of observation provided a unique opportunity for us to assess the serologic status of pediatric subjects before and after new pharyngeal acquisitions of GAS. With the exception of antibody responses to the homologous M peptides, no clear pattern of immune responses against the remaining GAS antigens was seen. There were no new immunologically significant acquisitions of emm types of GAS against which the subjects had preexisting elevated levels of antibodies against the homologous M peptide. The observation that 65% of new GAS acquisitions caused no symptoms yet were immunologically significant suggests that the majority of infections are not detected, which would result in missed opportunities for primary prevention of rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease with appropriate antimicrobial therapy.

A physician reviewed and classified tuberculosis cases. Incidence was the number of children with incident tuberculosis, defined as a first or recurrent tuberculosis diagnosis &gt;30 days after ART initiation, divided by the total person-years of follow-up (PYFU). Risk factors for incident tuberculosis were identified using Fine and Gray's competing risks models, with death from other causes treated as a competing event, and risk factors for death were identified using Cox models. At ART initiation, 670 children (55% female) had a median age of 6.4 years (interquartile range, 2.0-9.6), body mass index-for-age z-score -0.8 (-1.9 to 0.0), HIV ribonucleic acid viral load 5.1 log10 copies\/mL (4.6-5.6), and CD4 9% (3-17). Median duration of follow-up was 7.7 years. Tuberculosis incidence was 7 per 1000 PYFU (95% confidence interval [CI], 5-11) and decreased with ART duration. Lower age-adjusted hemoglobin, hematocrit, and CD4 at ART initiation were associated with a higher risk of incident tuberculosis. Of the 30 incident tuberculosis cases, 9 died. Diagnosis of incident tuberculosis was associated with mortality (unadjusted hazard ratio = 10.2, 95% CI = 4.8-21.5, P &lt; .001 and adjusted hazard ratio = 5.4, 95% CI = 2.5-11.7, P &lt; .001).

We performed a geospatial analysis of subjects from an ongoing study of CMV infection among pregnant women using geographic information systems and spatial statistics. Subjects were categorized on the basis of results of their CMV immunoglobulin G avidity testing as seronegative, seropositive, or primary infection. We used generalized additive models to analyze the spatial distributions of individuals who fell into each category and to control for confounders such as race and age. We used a generalized estimating equation to correlate community-level variables with CMV status. Of 3527 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years, 93.4% were either white or black. CMV seropositivity was significantly more common among non-Hispanic white subjects than among minority subjects (odds ratio, 3.76 [95% confidence interval, 3.25-4.34]). We identified a cluster in which women had elevated odds of CMV seropositivity in the urban neighborhoods of Durham. Cases of primary CMV infection were more common in areas with higher-than-average CMV seroprevalence. Neighborhood median family income was associated inversely with the prevalence of chronic CMV. We found a high prevalence of CMV seropositivity in urban low-income neighborhoods among pregnant women, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. Seronegative pregnant women from these communities might be at heightened risk for primary CMV infection.

We used a case-control study-stool archive to determine if nucleic acid tests for established and newly identified viruses diminish our previously published 32% rate of microbiologically unexplained episodes. Using polymerase chain reaction, we sought to detect noroviruses GI and GII, classic and novel astroviruses, and human bocaviruses (HBoVs) 2, 3, and 4 among 178 case and 178 matched control stool samples and St. Louis and Malawi polyomaviruses among a subset of 98 case and control stool samples. We calculated adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals using conditional logistic regression. Noroviruses were more common in cases (GI, 2.2%; GII, 16.9%) than in controls (GI, 0%; GII, 4.5%) (adjusted odds ratio, 5.2 [95% confidence interval, 2.5-11.3]). Astroviruses and HBoVs 2, 3, and 4 were overrepresented among the cases, although this difference was not statistically significant. Malawi polyomavirus was not associated with case status, and St. Louis polyomavirus was identified in only 1 subject (a control). When identified in cases, HBoVs 2, 3, and 4 were frequently (77%) found in conjunction with a bona fide diarrheagenic pathogen. Thirty-five (20%) case and 3 (2%) control stool samples contained more than 1 organism of interest. Overall, a bona fide or plausible pathogen was identified in 79% of the case stool samples. Preceding antibiotic use was more common among cases (adjusted odds ratio, 4.5 [95% confidence interval, 2.3-8.5]). Noroviruses were found to cause one-third of the diarrhea cases that previously had no identified etiology.

The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence of pertussis in infants less than 6 months of age in Sarlahi District, Nepal. Nested within a population-based randomized controlled trial of influenza vaccination during pregnancy, infants were visited weekly from birth through 6 months to assess respiratory illness in the prior week. If any respiratory symptoms had occurred, a nasal swab was collected and tested with a multitarget pertussis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The prospective cohort study includes infants observed between May 2011 and August 2014. The incidence of PCR-confirmed Bordetella pertussis was 13.3 cases per 1000 infant-years (95% confidence interval, 7.7-21.3) in a cohort of 3483 infants with at least 1 day of follow-up.

We aimed to determine, compare, and assess determinants of unit-specific HA-VRI incidence rates in 2 children's hospitals. This study was a retrospective comparison of prospective cohorts. The Montreal Children's Hospital and the Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York perform prospective surveillance for HA-VRI using standardized definitions that require the presence of symptoms compatible with VRI and virus detection. Cases detected between April 1, 2010, and March 31, 2013, were identified using surveillance databases. Annual incidence rates were calculated, and a generalized estimating equation model was used to assess determinants of HA-VRI rates. The overall HA-VRI rate during the 3-year study period was significantly higher at Montreal Children's Hospital than that at Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York (1.91 vs 0.80 per 1000 patient-days, respectively; P &lt; .0001). Overall, the HA-VRI incidence rate was lowest in the neonatal intensive care unit. Rates in the pediatric intensive care, oncology, and medical\/surgical units were similar. The most common etiology of HA-VRI at both institutions was rhinovirus (49% of cases), followed by parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Hospitals with less than 50% single rooms had HA-VRI rates 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.37) times higher than hospitals with more than 50% single rooms for a given unit type. HA-VRI rates were substantial but different among 2 children's hospitals. Future studies should examine the effect of HA-VRI and evaluate best practices for preventing such infections.

Rotavirus vaccination has dramatically reduced rotavirus occurrence; however, we have noticed mild to moderate recurrences in the St. Louis area in alternate years. In 2013, we found rotavirus genotype G12 to be the dominant strain in the St. Louis region. In this study, we again determined the distribution of genotypes and ascertained vaccine history in patients infected with rotavirus G12 during the 2014-15 season. Samples submitted to the St. Louis Children's Hospital Microbiology Laboratory were tested for rotavirus using an antigen assay. We determined the VP7 genotype using amplicon sequence analysis. We determined genome sequences using high-throughput sequencing. We evaluated rotavirus immunization records when available. Of 30 typed viruses from 2014-15, 29 were G12 (97%). Whole-genome sequencing revealed few changes from G12 viruses analyzed in 2012-13. VP4 and VP7 sequences were &gt;99% identical to previously sequenced G12 strains from St. Louis, and immune epitopes were conserved. Vaccination histories were available from 17 patients. Of these, 4 had been vaccinated, 3 had received incomplete vaccination or had a vaccine history that could not be confirmed, and 10 had not been vaccinated. G12 re-emerged as the predominant rotavirus genotype in 2014-15, comprising a higher percentage of cases than in 2012-13. The majority of patients with G12 and available vaccination histories were unvaccinated. There was no genomic evidence to indicate that the G12 strains in St. Louis had evolved to escape vaccine protection. Our work emphasizes the need for continued surveillance.

Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases and vaccine shortages are also discussed. Nonvoting representatives from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society are present. The ACIP met on June 22-23, 2016 to discuss proposed recommendations for influenza vaccination, for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine dosing schedules, for the cholera vaccine (CVD 103-HgR), and for the use of MenACWY in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons, as well as an overview of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines, safety of maternal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) immunization, and laboratory containment of poliovirus type 2.","723":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of healthcare-associated infection. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) (&gt;3 classes) and carbapenem-resistant (CR) P aeruginosa are significant threats globally. We used a large reference-laboratory database to study the epidemiology of P aeruginosa in children in the United States. Antimicrobial susceptibility data from the Surveillance Network were used to phenotypically identify MDR and CR P aeruginosa isolates in children aged 1 to 17 years between January 1999 and July 2012. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate trends in the prevalence of MDR and CR P aeruginosa. Isolates from infants (&lt;1 year old) and patients with cystic fibrosis were excluded. Among the isolates tested, the crude proportion of MDR P aeruginosa increased from 15.4% in 1999 to 26% in 2012, and the proportion of CR P aeruginosa increased from 9.4% in 1999 to 20% in 2012. The proportion of both MDR and CR P aeruginosa increased each year by 4% (odds ratio [OR], 1.04 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03-1.04] and 1.04 [95% CI, 1.04-1.05], respectively). In multivariable analysis, both MDR and CR P aeruginosa were more common in the intensive care setting, among children aged 13 to 17 years, in respiratory specimens, and in the West North Central region. In addition, resistance to other antibiotic classes (aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, and piperacillin-tazobactam) often used to treat P aeruginosa increased. Rates of MDR and CR P aeruginosa infection in children are rising nationally. Aggressive prevention strategies, including instituting antimicrobial stewardship programs in pediatric settings, are essential for combating antimicrobial resistance. ","724":"Language impairment (LI) risk is increased for perinatally acquired human immunodeficiency virus-infected (PHIV) and perinatally exposed to HIV but uninfected (PHEU) youth. This study evaluates the persistence of LI in these groups. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals was repeated on participants of the Pediatric HIV\/AIDS Cohort Study Adolescent Master Protocol 18 months postbaseline. Regression models identified factors associated with change in standardized score (SC) and the resolution or development of LI. Of 319 participants, 112 had LI at baseline. Upon re-evaluation, SCs were highly stable and changes were similar in PHIV (n = 212) and PHEU (n = 107) participants. Those with family history of language delays had a 2.39 point lower mean increase in SCs than those without, after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors and baseline LI status. Among PHIV participants, CD4 count &lt;350 cells\/mm3 was associated with lower mean SC change (4.32 points), and exposure to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) or protease inhibitors (PIs) was associated with a higher mean SC change (5.93 and 4.19 points, respectively). Initial LI was persistent in most cases (78%); 20 new cases occurred (10%). Female sex was associated with higher odds of LI resolution. Among PHIV, duration and baseline cART and history of PI use were associated with LI resolution; higher percentage of detectable viral loads before baseline was associated with lower odds of resolution. The PHIV and PHEU youth are at risk for persistent LI, and family history of language delays was a risk factor for persistence of problems. Measures of successful HIV treatment predicted more favorable outcomes among PHIV youth. ","725":"Perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV) confers risk for neurocognitive impairment, which potentially affects school performance and functional independence of infected children. In this study, we examined the associations of 2 key neurocognitive domains, memory and executive function (EF), with academic and adaptive skills among youth with PHIV and perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) youth. Participants ages 9 to &lt;19 years enrolled in the Pediatric HIV\/AIDS Cohort Study's Memory and Executive Functioning Study completed standardized measures of reading and math. The primary caregivers completed a standardized measure of their child's adaptive behavior. Participants with PHIV, those with (PHIV\/C) and without (PHIV\/non-C) a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention class C diagnosis, and PHEU participants were compared. Retrospective memory (RM), prospective memory (PM), and EF were evaluated relative to outcomes using general linear regression models adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Of the participants (N = 258; mean age, 14.1 years), 46% were male, 75% were black, and 18% were Hispanic. Adjusted mean scores in math and adaptive behavior did not differ among the youth with PHIV\/C (n = 45), those with PHIV\/non-C (n = 128), and PHEU youth (n = 85). Youth with PHIV\/C had lower adjusted mean reading scores than PHIV\/non-C and PHEU youth (86.9 vs 93.8 [P = .02] and 93.2 [P = .04], respectively). There were positive associations of RM, PM, EF, and some sociodemographic characteristics with higher reading and math scores. Immediate and delayed verbal memory, delayed visual memory, PM, and some EF measures were positively associated with adaptive behavior. Higher-order cognitive abilities such as memory and EF seem to play a key role in academic and adaptive capacities, regardless of a child's HIV status, and might serve as intervention targets for improving functional outcomes. ","726":"Executive functions (EFs) are critical for management of life activities, but few studies have evaluated EFs in children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV), who are at risk for problems in academics, behavior, and medication adherence. We compared EFs in youth with PHIV and in perinatally HIV-exposed but uninfected (PHEU) youth. Four Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) subtests were administered to 173 youth with PHIV and 85 PHEU youth, aged 9 to &lt;19 years, who were enrolled in the Pediatric HIV\/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) Memory and Executive Functioning Study. Youth with PHIV, with or without history of a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Class C (AIDS-defining) condition (PHIV\/C [n = 45] and PHIV\/non-C [n = 128], respectively), were compared with each other and with PHEU youth. Among youth with PHIV, associations with measures of current and past disease severity were evaluated using adjusted linear regression models. The PHIV\/C group (mean age, 15.5 years), compared with the PHIV\/non-C and PHEU groups (mean ages, 14.5 and 12.9 years, respectively), were significantly slower on the Inhibition and Color Naming\/Reading Combined conditions of the Color-Word Interference subtest and made more errors on Inhibition; differences between the PHIV\/C and PHEU groups persisted in adjusted models. No differences in adjusted means for fluency or problem-solving were found. The PHIV\/non-C and PHEU groups did not differ on any measure. Associations of specific EF measures with HIV RNA viral load, CD4-positive T-lymphocyte percentage, and age at greatest disease severity were observed. Youth with PHIV and previous AIDS-defining conditions performed more poorly on some EF measures. Relationships of EF development with the degree and timing of disease severity require further study. Implications for long-term outcomes and interventions are important avenues for follow-up. ","727":"Combination antiretroviral therapy has led to increased survival among youth with perinatally acquired HIV (PHIV). However, cognitive deficits continue to be common. Histopathological studies in adults have found HIV concentrated in subcortical structures, which are involved in sensory processing, movement, and higher-order cognition that emerges with development. We conducted magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing in 40 youth with PHIV at one site of the Adolescent Master Protocol of the Pediatric HIV\/AIDS Cohort Study. We collected HIV disease-severity measures and substance-use reports. Subcortical volume and shape deformation were generated with FreeSurfer-Initiated Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping. Inward shape deformation was defined as negative displacement. We evaluated associations of subcortical shape deformation with past HIV severity after adjustment for sex, age at neuroimaging, age at HIV severity marker, and substance use. We examined associations between subcortical deformation and cognitive function. Negative correlations between shape deformation and peak HIV viral load (VL) were found in clusters in the caudate tail, globus pallidus, lateral putamen, and anterior and medial thalamus. Positive correlations between shape deformation and nadir CD4-positive T-lymphocyte percentage (CD4%) were found in clusters in the medial and posterior thalamus. Inward deformation in caudate and thalamic clusters correlated with worse cognition. Youth with PHIV have demonstrable subcortical shape deformation related to past HIV severity and cognition; inward deformation was associated with higher peak VL, lower nadir CD4%, and worse cognition. Identifying subcortical deformation may inform clinical practice for early intervention to help improve cognitive outcomes and assess the neuroefficacy of combination antiretroviral therapy in youth with PHIV.

A major impact on hospitalization for all-cause gastroenteritis was observed also. Rotavirus vaccination with exclusive use of RotaTeq was added to the National Immunization Programme (NIP) of Finland in September 2009. The objective of our study was to estimate the effectiveness and impact of RotaTeq after 4 years of follow-up. Between 2009 and 2013, we conducted a prospective surveillance study of children aged &lt;16 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) and admitted in 2 hospitals in Finland. Rotavirus and other gastroenteritis viruses were detected in stool samples by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The effectiveness of RotaTeq was investigated by using a case-control design; wild-type rotavirus-positive children were classified as \"cases\" and rotavirus-negative children as \"controls.\" Hospital discharge records were used to estimate the impact of RotaTeq on rotavirus-associated AGE (RV-AGE) and all-cause AGE (AC-AGE) hospitalizations of age-eligible children in the NIP by comparing the prevaccination (2001-2006) and post-NIP seasons (2009-2013). The crude estimate of the effectiveness of RotaTeq to prevent RV-AGE hospitalization in NIP age-eligible children was 94.4% (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-98.4%). No change in prevalent wild-type rotavirus genotypes was observed. Vaccine-derived rotaviruses were detected in 8% of the children with RV-AGE, with a probable causal association in 2 children. Hospital discharge records revealed that RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations in children aged &lt;16 years decreased in the two post-NIP seasons by 79% and 58%, respectively, compared to those in the prevaccination seasons. Over 4 years of follow-up, high rotavirus vaccine coverage in the NIP (&gt;95%) has led to a major reduction in RV-AGE and AC-AGE hospitalizations without a resurgence of rotavirus activity. However, rotavirus continues to circulate in older unvaccinated children.

Sixty of 169 trainees replied (response rate 35%) with 93% of respondents from centers that performed transplants. Eighty-two percent of trainees were unaware of the recommended curriculum for PTID. Although a majority of trainees (78%) indicated they had received structured teaching in PTID, most (&gt;50%) ranked their knowledge in donor selection, donor-derived infections, and candidate risk assessment as poor or fair. A majority (&gt;50%) also reported their competency in areas regarding pre- and posttransplant guidance as poor or fair. Trainees identified the following strategies to augment their PTID training: additional rotations, teaching by experts, case-based learning, and a reference guide. This survey highlights significant trainee-identified gaps in PTID knowledge and competency. Limitations include low survey response rate but appears weighted towards centers with transplantation.

Here, we report the spectrum and severity of disease associated with invasive non-type b H influenzae infection in 17 patients at 2 tertiary-care children's hospitals over a 2-year period. Meningitis was the most common diagnosis. The majority of the patients had neurologic sequelae, and 1 patient died. The high proportions of hospitalization, intensive care utilization, and neurologic complications reveal that non-type b H influenzae infection was associated with significant morbidity in this pediatric population.","734":"","735":"Diarrhea is common in children with cancer, but this has not been systematically studied to date. Remnant stool samples collected between January 2010 and June 2011 from pediatric oncology patients with diarrhea were tested for bacterial, viral, and parasitic enteropathogens using a combination of standard-of-care (SOC) diagnostic tests, including broad-range, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for adenoviruses, astroviruses, and sapoviruses and 2 commercially available multiplexed PCR assays. Corresponding demographic and clinical data were abstracted from patients' medical records. One hundred fourteen episodes of diarrhea in 93 patients (median age, 3.7 years; range, 0.2-18.8) were included in the study. No patients died, but morbidity was significant. A total of 158 potential pathogens were detected in 114 diarrhea episodes, with &gt;1 organism in one third of these; the most common were Clostridium difficile, noroviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses. Clostridium difficile, in combination with norovirus or adenovirus, was most common when &gt;1 pathogen was detected. When both studies were obtained, SOC and broadly multiplexed PCR tests were concordant in 64 episodes (56%). Forty-five pathogens (28%) were identified retrospectively by broadly multiplexed PCR assays only. A total of 19 (13%) were detected by SOC real-time PCR assays but not by either commercially available multiplexed PCR assay. Most pediatric oncology patients in this study had 1 or more potential infectious causes for their diarrhea. Additional studies are warranted to understand the natural history of gastroenteritis in this patient population. Although broadly multiplexed PCR assays offer some advantages over conventional testing, there may be disadvantages to their use for the diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis that are unique to pediatric oncology patients. ","736":"Infections by Gram-positive pathogens pose a public health risk, especially due to increasing antibiotic resistance. Daptomycin has efficacy against most clinically important Gram-positive bacteria. Although experience regarding use of daptomycin in adults is increasing, studies on pediatric populations are limited. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of daptomycin in pediatric settings. We searched MEDLINE and Clinicaltrials.gov (through April 2016) and included 29 original studies in the final analysis. Available evidence suggests that daptomycin in pediatric patients has a favorable safety and tolerability profile and is an efficacious alternative for treatment of Gram-positive bacteremia, endocarditis, and infections of the skin, soft tissues, joints, and bones, especially when resistant strains are involved. However, future studies need to address several issues to determine the optimal dose and various pharmacokinetic parameters in different pediatric age groups.","737":"Rapid diagnostic technologies for infectious diseases have the potential to improve clinical outcomes, but guideline-recommended antimicrobial stewardship (AS) strategies are not currently optimized for rapid intervention. We evaluated the clinical impact and provider acceptability of implementing real-time AS decision support for children with positive blood culture results according to the FilmArray blood culture identification panel (BCID [BioFire Diagnostics]) at Children's Hospital Colorado. A pre-post quasi-experimental design was used to compare the outcomes of 100 postintervention children with positive blood culture results matched with 200 preintervention control children. Causative organisms in the preintervention group were identified using conventional microbiologic techniques and communicated to providers by a microbiology technologist. Postintervention organisms were identified by the BCID and communicated by an AS provider in real time with interpretation and antimicrobial recommendations. The primary outcome was time to optimal antimicrobial therapy (time from blood culture collection to start of predetermined pathogen-specific regimen or antimicrobial discontinuation for contaminants) compared by a log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Provider acceptability of the intervention was assessed via E-mailed surveys. The median time to optimal therapy decreased from 60.2 hours before intervention to 26.7 hours after intervention (P = .001). Among children with blood cultures that contained true pathogens, the time to effective antimicrobial therapy decreased from 6.9 to 3.4 hours (P = .03). Unnecessary antibiotic initiation for children with a culture that contained organisms considered to be contaminants decreased from 76% to 26% (P &lt; .001). Providers reported a change in management as a result of BCID results in 73% of the cases and a mean overall satisfaction rating of 4.8 on a 5-point Likert scale. Real-time AS decision support for rapid diagnostics is associated with improved antimicrobial use and high satisfaction ratings by providers.

To better understand the utility of these assays in diagnosing pertussis, serology assays were evaluated for analytical parameters and clinical accuracy. Forty-three antigen-antibody combinations were evaluated for single-point diagnosis of pertussis. Serum panels included sera from laboratory-confirmed cases, an international reference standard, and healthy donors. Phase I panel (n = 20) of sera was used to assess precision, linearity, and accuracy; Phase II panel (n = 226) followed with positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) estimates. Analytical analyses included coefficients of variation (CV) and concordance correlation coefficients (rc). Intra-analyst variability was found to be relatively low among samples per assay, with only 6% (78 of 1240) having CV &gt;20%, primarily with the highly concentrated immunoglobulin (Ig)G anti-pertussis toxin (PT) specimens and IgM assays. The rc measurements to assess linearity ranged between 0.282 and 0.994, 0.332 and 0.999, and -0.056 and 0.482 for IgA, IgG, and IgM, respectively. Analytical accuracy for calibrated IgG anti-PT assays was 86%-115%. The PPA and NPA varied greatly for all assays; PPA\/NPA ranges for IgA, IgG, and IgM assays, with culture and\/or polymerase chain reaction positivity as control, were 29-90\/13-100, 26-96\/27-100, and 0-73\/42-100, respectively. In IgG assays, mixing filamentous hemagglutinin antigen with PT increased PPA but decreased NPA. Seroassays varied substantially under both analytical and clinical parameters; however, those that were calibrated to a reference standard were highly accurate. Our findings support incorporation of calibrated pertussis seroassays to the pertussis case definition for improved diagnosis and surveillance. ","745":"Children with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) frequently exhibit virus-virus codetection, yet the clinical significance of ARTI remains contentious. Using data from a prospective cohort of children with influenza-like illness, we examined the virology of ARTI and determined the clinical impact of virus-virus codetection. Children aged 6 to 59 months who presented to a tertiary pediatric hospital between influenza seasons 2008 and 2012 with fever and acute respiratory symptoms were enrolled, and nasal samples were collected. Respiratory viruses were identified by culture and polymerase chain reaction. We compared demographics, presenting symptoms, and clinical outcomes of children with a single-virus infection and those in whom 2 or more viruses were detected (virus-virus codetection). We used logistic regression models and estimated marginal means to calculate the adjusted odds ratios and probabilities of symptom presentation, prescription of antibiotics, and hospitalization. Of 2356 children, a virus was detected in 1630 (69.2%) of them; rhinovirus (40.8%), influenza (29.5%), and respiratory syncytial virus (26.4%) were detected most commonly. Two or more viruses were detected in 25% of these children. After we adjusted for demographic factors, children with virus-virus codetection had greater odds of presenting with cough (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.1) and rhinorrhea (aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.9) than those with a single-virus infection, although both symptoms were common. Children with influenza and respiratory syncytial virus combined had the highest probability of hospitalization (55%; 95% CI, 35%-73%), which was significantly greater than for those with influenza infection alone (22%; 95% CI, 16%-29%). Overall, virus-virus codetection has limited impact on clinical severity among children with influenza-like illness. However, infection with specific pathogen pairs might be associated with more severe outcomes. Routine diagnostics to identify specific viruses should be restricted to common pathogens.

Sexually transmitted infections likewise are a risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission; however, there is a lack of data on STI acquisition in HIV-infected AYAs. We determined the incidence of STIs in HIV-infected AYAs 12.5 &lt;25 years of age in the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) P1074 observational cohort study. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of HIV control (mean viral load &lt;500 copies\/mL and CD4+ T cells &gt;500 cells\/mm3 in the year preceding STI diagnosis) and other risk factors with STI occurrence. Of 1201 enrolled subjects, 1042 participants met age criteria and were included (49% male, 61% black, 88% perinatally infected; mean age 18.3 years). One hundred twenty participants had at least 1 STI on study, of whom 93 had their first lifetime STI (incidence rate = 2.8\/100 person-years). For individual STI categories, 155 incident category-specific events were reported; human papillomavirus (HPV) and chlamydial infections were the most common. In the multivariable model, having an STI was associated with older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22), female sex (aOR = 2.65; 95% CI, 1.67-4.21), nonperinatal HIV acquisition (aOR = 2.33; 95% CI, 1.29-4.22), and uncontrolled HIV infection (aOR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.29-3.25). Sexually transmitted infection acquisition in HIV-infected AYAs is associated with older age, female sex, nonperinatal HIV acquisition, and poorly controlled HIV infection. Substantial rates of STIs among HIV-infected AYAs support enhanced preventive interventions, including safe-sex practices and HPV vaccination, and antiretroviral adherence strategies.

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) aim to prevent these adverse outcomes and optimize antibiotic prescribing. However, data evaluating ASP coverage of nurseries are limited. The objectives of this study were to describe the characteristics of nurseries with and without ASP coverage and to determine perceptions of and barriers to nursery ASP coverage. The 2014 American Hospital Association annual survey was used to randomly select a level III neonatal intensive care unit from all 50 states. A level I and level II nursery from the same city as the level III nursery were then randomly selected. Hospital, nursery, and ASP characteristics were collected. Nursery and ASP providers (pharmacists or infectious disease providers) were interviewed using a semistructured template. Transcribed interviews were analyzed for themes. One hundred forty-six centers responded; 104 (71%) provided nursery ASP coverage. In multivariate analysis, level of nursery, university affiliation, and number of full-time equivalent ASP staff were the main predictors of nursery ASP coverage. Several themes were identified from interviews: unwanted coverage, unnecessary coverage, jurisdiction issues, need for communication, and a focus on outcomes. Most providers had a favorable view of nursery ASP coverage. Larger, higher-acuity nurseries in university-affiliated hospitals are more likely to have ASP coverage. Low ASP staffing and a perceived lack of importance were frequently cited as barriers to nursery coverage. Most nursery ASP coverage is viewed favorably by providers, but nursery providers regard it as less important than ASP providers.

We investigated the combined impact of matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) technology and an antimicrobial stewardship program (ASP) in pediatric patients with blood stream infections (BSIs). This is a single-center study comparing a control group of patients from October 2009 to July 2010 with BSIs to a cohort of patients postimplementation of MALDI-TOF and an ASP, from October 2013 to July 2014. Primary outcome was time to optimal therapy. Secondary outcomes included time to effective therapy, 30-day all-cause mortality, 30-day readmission rate, hospital length of stay, and intensive care admission. One hundred episodes of BSIs were identified in the preintervention period, and 121 episodes were identified in the postintervention period. Time from blood culture collection to organism identification was significantly reduced in the prospective cohort compared with historical controls (18.8 vs 43.7 hours, respectively). A total of 73 ASP interventions were made on the treatment of BSIs in the postintervention period. Combined use of MALDI-TOF and ASP significantly reduced time to optimal therapy (77.0 to 54.2 hours, P &lt; .001). In the subgroup analysis of Gram-negative bacteremia, time to effective and optimal therapy were significantly reduced (2.0 vs 0.7 hours and 146.8 vs 48.0 hours, respectively). There were no significant differences in clinical outcomes. The combined use of MALDI-TOF and ASP allows early optimization of antimicrobial therapy in pediatric inpatients with BSIs.

Manufacture of JE-VAX, the mouse brain-derived vaccine against JEV, was discontinued in February 2011. IXIARO, an inactivated cell culture-derived vaccine, was approved in 2009 for use in adult patients. Although IXIARO was not licensed for pediatric patients until 2013, our clinic routinely used this vaccine in at-risk children starting in 2011. The purpose of this study was to review our experience as to the tolerability of the new IXIARO vaccine in children. We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients less than 18 years of age who received at least 1 dose of IXIARO in our Family Travel Clinic from November 2011 through August 2014. Subjects' electronic medical records were reviewed for any documented medical visits within 3 months after vaccination. Each visit was assessed for possible adverse events with relationship to vaccine administration as determined by the reviewer. Ninety-two patients less than 18 years of age received a total of 145 doses of IXIARO between November 2011 and August 2014. Seven adverse events were documented. Only 1 was deemed to be possibly related. No serious adverse events were found on chart review. Our study reinforces the recent decision to expand IXIARO vaccination to the pediatric population. The experience in our clinic since vaccine introduction shows it to be overall tolerable when used in routine clinical practice. Practitioners should feel comfortable recommending vaccination against JEV for any pediatric traveler to an area of risk.

Although athletes have a higher risk of infection with S. aureus than the general population, most studies in athletes have not assessed colonization. We conducted a prospective cohort study of Vanderbilt University varsity athletes from August 2008 to April 2010. We assessed nasal and oropharyngeal colonization with methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains by obtaining swabs at enrollment and monthly thereafter until the end of the study. The athletes were also monitored for skin and soft tissue infections. We enrolled 377 athletes and trainers (224 in contact sports and 153 in noncontact sports). The total S. aureus colonization prevalence ranged from 34% to 62%, and for MRSA it ranged from 8% to 29%. The colonization rate in the summer was significantly higher than that in the winter (odds ratio for MRSA [ORMRSA], 1.70 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-2.35]; ORMSSA, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.05-1.82]). Of 603 MRSA isolates, 75% carried the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type IV, and 5% carried the genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin. Nine symptomatic S. aureus infections occurred, 7 of which were between July and September. The S. aureus colonization rate is higher than previously reported and fluctuated over time in this prospective cohort of athletes. The higher colonization prevalence during summer might explain the infectious outbreak during the summer months and may represent a key intervention time for preventing S. aureus disease in athletes. ","765":"Although Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) are increasingly diagnosed in children, many children diagnosed with CDI lack classic risk factors. Frequent use of highly sensitive tcdB polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing in low-risk patients leads to CDI misdiagnosis and unnecessary CDI antibiotic use in children with C difficile carriage. For this quasi-experimental study, we developed and implemented an educational intervention (EI) to inform healthcare providers (HCPs) about tcdB PCR test limitations. We provided HCP didactic education and built an electronic notification into the tcdB PCR test order that describes scenarios in which carriage is more likely than CDI. Segmented regression analysis assessed changes in level (ie, overall rates) and trend of C difficile testing rate ([TR] number of tests performed per 1000 patient encounters) and test positivity rate ([PR] number of positive tests per 1000 patient encounters) between the pre- (August 2009-August 2013) and postintervention (February 2014-July 2015) periods. Hospital-wide, absolute TR reduction was 0.71 (P[level] = .0067; P[trend] = .0042) and absolute PR reduction was 0.14 (P[level] = .22; P[trend] = .018). In the outpatient setting, absolute TR reduction was 0.30 (P[level] = .0015; P[trend] &lt; .001) and absolute PR reduction was 0.09 (P[level] = .0069; P[trend] = .046). The incidence density of healthcare facility-associated CDI did not significantly change after the EI. The EI was associated with avoidance of 574 tests and 113 positive tests (and subsequent antibiotic courses) during the postintervention period, which saved approximately $250 000 in patient charges related to CDI testing and treatment. Healthcare provider education can cost-effectively reduce the frequency of C difficile testing and CDI misdiagnosis by improving test utilization among low-risk children.

Because of overlapping signs and symptoms and expensive and inefficient testing methods, the etiology of pediatric diarrhea is rarely established. We identified children &lt;18 years of age who were evaluated for diarrhea at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, between October 2010 and September 2012. Stool specimens submitted for testing were evaluated by using the FilmArray gastrointestinal diagnostic system, which is a rapid multiplex polymerase chain reaction platform that can simultaneously detect 23 bacterial, viral, and protozoal agents. A pathogen was detected in 561 (52%) of 1089 diarrheal episodes. The most commonly detected pathogens included toxigenic Clostridium difficile (16%), diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (15%), norovirus GI\/GII (11%), and adenovirus F 40\/41 (7%). Shiga toxin-producing E coli were detected in 43 (4%) specimens. Multiple pathogens were identified in 160 (15%) specimens. Viral pathogens (norovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, and sapovirus) were more common among children &lt;5 years old than among those 5 to 17 years old (38% vs 16%, respectively; P &lt; .001). Bacterial pathogens were identified most commonly in children 2 to 4 years of age. Children with 1 or more underlying chronic medical conditions were less likely to have a pathogen identified than those without a chronic medical condition (45% vs 60%, respectively; P &lt; .01). Viral pathogens were detected more commonly in the winter, whereas bacterial pathogens were detected more commonly in the summer.

We noted a trend toward reduction of acute otitis media. This trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00839254), nested within a cluster-randomized double-blind invasive pneumococcal disease effectiveness study in Finland (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00861380), assessed the effectiveness of the 10-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D-conjugated vaccine (PHiD-CV or PCV10) against bacterial nasopharyngeal carriage and acute otitis media (AOM). Infants (aged 6 weeks to 6 months) received the PHiD-CV or a control vaccine (hepatitis B) (schedule 3+1 or 2+1). Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 4 time points post-vaccination from all of the infants and at pre-vaccination from a subset. Parent-reported physician-diagnosed AOM was assessed from first vaccination until last contact (mean follow-up, 18 months). Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was derived as (1 - relative risk)*100, accounting for cluster design in AOM analysis. Significant VE was assessed descriptively (positive lower limit of the non-adjusted 95% confidence interval [CI]). The vaccinated cohort included 5093 infants for carriage assessment and 4117 infants for AOM assessment. Both schedules decreased vaccine-serotype carriage, with a trend toward a lesser effect from the 2+1 schedule ( VE across timpoints 19%-56% [3+1] and 1%-38% [2+1]). Trends toward reduced pneumococcal carriage (predominantly vaccine serotypes 6B, 14, 19F, and 23F), decreased carriage of vaccine-related serotype 19A, and small increases at later time points (ages 14-15 months) in non-vaccine-serotype carriage were observed. No effects on nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Moraxella catarrhalis carriage were observed. There were non-significant trends toward a reduction in the number of infants reporting AOM episodes (VE 3+1: 6.1% [95% CI, -2.7% to 14.1%] and 2+1: 7.4% [-2.8% to 16.6%]) and all AOM episodes (VE 3+1: 2.8% [-9.5% to 13.9%] and 2+1: 10.2% [-4.1% to 22.9%]). PHiD-CV was immunogenic and had an acceptable safety profile. We observed reduced vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage, a limited increase in non-vaccine-type carriage, and a trend toward AOM reduction. ","774":"In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), chikungunya (CHIK) viral infection has emerged as a significant arboviral disease. This rapidly expanding vector-borne viral illness is associated with a substantial burden of disease in terms of acute illness and also in terms of long-term sequelae. In addition, this viral pathogen has the ability to impact different populations including pregnant women and newborns. Despite the growing threat of this arboviral infection to the region, there are insufficient reports or studies attempting to delineate the clinical and epidemiological features of congenital and neonatal cases of CHIK in LAC. In this study, we present a case of congenital CHIK and a case of neonatal CHIK infection identified in Santander, Colombia. We discuss the potential neurological impact and sequelae of CHIK infection acquired during the neonatal period. There is an urgent need for further epidemiological and clinical studies to better understand the impact of CHIK in endemic areas in LAC. ","775":"A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) seems to be associated with a reduction of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. To explore the link between PCV13 implementation and children' visits in emergency departments (EDs) for pneumonia, we analyzed mandatory Electronics Emergency Department Abstracts (EEDA), in 7 EDs, located in southern France, from 2009 to 2014. Diagnosis related to visits were coded using International Classification Diseases-10 codes. All codes available for EEDA were used to define bacterial pneumonia (BP), viral pneumonia (VP), and nonspecific pneumonia (NSP). For adjustment, we also used codes related to influenza and bronchiolitis. Comparisons between periods (pre-PCV13, transitional, early post-PCV13, and late post-PCV13) were made by logistic regression. On daily aggregated data, a general linear model was constructed with daily proportion of BP as dependent variable, period as fixed factor, and daily proportion of viral respiratory infections (flu plus bronchiolitis) as covariate. Among 718 758 visits, 7284 were coded as CAP. A significant decline in CAP was noted only for children between 2 and 5 years of age. In contrast, the proportion of BP was dramatically reduced: 2.49 vs 5.17\/1000 visits (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.55), whereas the proportion of VP was similar and NSP increased. After adjustment on influenza plus bronchiolitis, the decrease of BP remained significant. Electronics Emergency Department Abstracts analysis confirms an important reduction in children ED visits for BP after PCV13 implementation. The EEDA also allow a real-time surveillance of pneumonia and an adjustment on confounding factors, such as viral respiratory infections.

In previous studies, we showed that HCMV adversely affects infant development in Africa, particularly with maternal HIV exposure. In this study, we analyzed infants risks for acquisition of HCMV infection from breastfeeding and compared HIV-positive and HIV-negative mothers. Two cohorts were studied in Zambia. (1) Two hundred sixty-one HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected mothers were compared for HCMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) loads and genotypes (glycoprotein gO) in milk from birth to 4 months postpartum. (2) Maternally HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants were compared for HCMV infection risk factors. The second cohort of 460 infants, from a trial of micronutrient-fortified complementary-food to breastfeeding, were studied between 6 and 18 months of age. Human cytomegalovirus seroprevalence was assayed, and logistic regression was used to calculate risk factors for HCMV infection, including maternal HIV exposure and breastfeeding duration. Human cytomegalovirus was detected in breast milk from 3 days to 4 months postpartum, with significantly raised levels in HIV-positive women and independent of genotype. In infants, HCMV antibody seroprevalence was 83% by 18 months age. Longer breastfeeding duration increased infection risk in maternally HIV-unexposed (odds ratio [OR] = 2.69 for 18 months vs &lt;12 months; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-8.59; P = .03) and HIV-exposed infants (OR = 20.37 for &gt;6 months vs never; 95% CI, 3.71-111.70; P &lt; .001). Prolonged breastfeeding, which is common in Africa, increased risk of HCMV infection in infants. Both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women had extended milk HCMV secretion. Women who were HIV-positive secreted higher HCMV levels, and for longer duration, with their children at increased infection risk. Human cytomegalovirus control is required to maintain health benefits of breastfeeding.

Declining transmission of malaria in many regions, combined with the increasing use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria, has led to the increasing recognition of leptospirosis, rickettsioses, respiratory viruses, and arboviruses as etiologic agents of fevers. However, clinical discrimination between these etiologies can be difficult. Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs is common, even in the setting of a negative test result, as is overtreatment with empiric antibacterial drugs. Viral etiologies remain underrecognized and poorly investigated.

Measles cases and contacts were investigated by Illinois public health officials. Cases were isolated for 4 days after rash onset. Exposed healthcare workers and child care center staff were required to provide documentation of receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or laboratory evidence of immunity to return to work. Susceptible contacts were actively monitored for 21 days after exposure and provided postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) if certain criteria were met. Fifteen confirmed measles cases were identified; 12 (80%) occurred in infants who were attendees of a child care center. Clinical misdiagnosis of 1 case allowed for continued transmission within the center. Twelve (86%) of 14 exposed infants at the child care center were diagnosed with measles; no other attendees or staff were infected. Five cases visited outpatient pediatric clinics during their infectious period, exposing 33 infants. Six exposed child care center staff and 3 healthcare workers did not have documentation of immunity available and were excluded from work until this was obtained. No healthcare-associated transmission was identified. Ninety-one contacts were actively monitored and 20 received PEP.

Close contacts of patients with such severe and rapidly progressive disease often strongly appeal to the treating clinicians for antimicrobial treatment to prevent additional cases. We aimed to use an approach based on pharyngeal culture testing of contacts and targeted antibiotic prophylaxis. A large throat swab survey including 105 contacts was undertaken after a fulminant and fatal case of GAS necrotizing fasciitis. GAS strains were characterized by emm typing and antimicrobial susceptibility to 7 antibiotics. The presence of 30 virulence determinants was determined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The GAS isolate recovered from the index patient was an M1T1 GAS clone susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested. The same clone was present in the throat of 36% of close contacts who had exposure to the index patient (family households and classroom contacts) for &gt;24 hours\/week, whereas the strain was present in only 2% of the other contacts.

Retention in Care is associated with positive clinical outcomes and a decrease in HIV transmission risk behaviors. We evaluated the clinical and demographic characteristics of non-perinatally HIV (nPHIV)-infected youth associated with retention 1 year after initiating care and in the 2 years thereafter. We also assessed the impact retention in year 1 had on retention in years 2 and 3. This was a retrospective analysis of treatment-naive nPHIV-infected 12- to 24-year-old youth presenting for care in 16 US HIV clinical sites within the HIV Research Network between 2002 and 2008. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with retention. Of 1160 nPHIV-infected youth, 44.6% were retained in care during the first year, and 22.4% were retained in all 3 years. Retention in the first year was associated with starting antiretroviral therapy in the first year (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.47 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.57-4.67]), Hispanic ethnicity (AOR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.08-2.56]), men who have sex with men (AOR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.07-2.36]), and receiving care at a pediatric site (AOR, 5.37 [95% CI, 3.20-9.01]). Retention in years 2 and 3 was associated with being retained 1 year after initiating care (AOR, 7.44 [95% CI, 5.11-10.83]). A high proportion of newly enrolled nPHIV-infected youth were not retained for 1 year, and only 1 in 4 were retained for 3 years. Patients who were Hispanic, were men who have sex with men, or were seen at pediatric clinics were more likely to be retained in care.

","796":"Rhinovirus is the most common cause of viral respiratory tract infections in children. Virologic predictors of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), such as viral load and the presence of another respiratory virus (coinfection), are not well characterized in pediatric outpatients. Mid-nasal turbinate samples were collected from children presenting for care to the Seattle Children's Hospital emergency department (ED) or urgent care with a symptomatic respiratory infection between December 2011 and May 2013. A subset of samples was tested for rhinovirus viral load by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were collected by chart reviews. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between viral load and coinfection and the risk for LRTI. Rhinovirus was the most frequent respiratory virus detected in children younger than 3 years. Of 445 patients with rhinovirus infection, 262 (58.9%) had LRTIs, 231 (51.9%) required hospital admission and 52 (22.5%) were hospitalized for 3 days or longer. Children with no comorbidities accounted for 142 (54%) of 262 rhinovirus LRTIs. Higher viral load was significantly associated with LRTI among illness episodes with rhinovirus alone (OR, 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24-3.58). Coinfection increased the risk of LRTI (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.01-3.32). Rhinovirus was the most common pathogen detected among symptomatic young children in a pediatric ED who had respiratory viral testing performed, with the majority requiring hospitalization. Higher rhinovirus viral load and coinfection increased disease severity. Virologic data may assist clinical decision making for children with rhinovirus infections in the pediatric ED. ","797":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and Plasmodium falciparum malaria are 2 of the gravest health threats in sub-Saharan Africa. Multiple repeat infections with the malaria parasite as seen in endemic areas are necessary to develop specific malaria immunity. HIV is an immunosuppressive virus and in children aged &lt;5 years, development of malaria-specific immunity may be impaired and malaria parasite clearance in theory will be delayed; hence the predisposition to increased incidence of asymptomatic malaria or severe malaria. This cross-sectional study was carried out to examine associations between immunosuppression and asymptomatic malaria parasitemia (ASMP) in HIV-infected children aged &lt;5 years in Benin City. One hundred seventy-nine asymptomatic HIV-1-positive and 179 age- and sex-matched HIV-1-negative children aged &lt;5 years were recruited. The malaria parasite was determined by Giemsa-stained blood film by certified microscopy while concomitant CD4(+) count was estimated in the HIV-infected children. The prevalence of ASMP in those who were HIV-infected of 34.1% was significantly higher than 17.3% in the HIV uninfected (P = .001). The prevalence of ASMP was highest (59.3%) among subjects who were severely immunosuppressed (CDC immunologic category 3). The prevalence of ASMP significantly increased with advanced immune disease in the subjects (P = .011). Severe (World Health Organization) clinical staging was also significantly associated with increased prevalence of ASMP (P = .031). The prevalence of ASMP is significantly higher among subjects not receiving cotrimoxazole, associated with threefold risk of having ASMP (P = .003: odds ratio = 3.5). ASMP is more common in HIV-positive children aged &lt;5 years and is significantly associated with declining CD4(+) T-cell count and severe clinical disease. There is a need for integration of HIV- and malaria-control programs for stronger case management. Malaria-control programs may consider malaria prevention interventions and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for preschool children who are HIV-infected and living in malaria-endemic regions.

T-cell immunity may be important for controlling CMV replication in congenital CMV-infected infants. We describe the natural history of CMV-specific T-cell evolution and CMV replication in infants with congenital CMV infection. Cytomegalovirus viral load, CMV urine culture, and CMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses were assessed in a prospective longitudinal cohort of 51 infants with congenital CMV infection who were observed from birth to 3 years of age. We found a kinetic pattern of decreasing urinary CMV replication and increasing CMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses during the first 3 years of life. We also found higher CMV-specific CD8 T-cell responses were associated with subsequent reduction of urine CMV viral load. For infants with congenital CMV infection, our data suggest an age-related maturation of both CMV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell immunity that is associated with an age-related decline in urinary CMV replication.

Infection can result in a full range of respiratory illness, including bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia. The recognized human subtypes of PIV are numbered 1-4. This study calculates estimates of PIV-associated hospitalizations among U.S. children younger than 5 years using the latest available data. Data from the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System were used to characterize seasonal PIV trends from July 2004 through June 2010. To estimate the number of PIV-associated hospitalizations that occurred annually among U.S. children aged &lt;5 years from 1998 through 2010, respiratory hospitalizations from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample were multiplied by the proportion of acute respiratory infection hospitalizations positive for PIV among young children enrolled in the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. Estimates of hospitalization charges attributable to PIV infection were also calculated. Parainfluenza virus seasonality follows type-specific seasonal patterns, with PIV-1 circulating in odd-numbered years and PIV-2 and -3 circulating annually. The average annual estimates of PIV-associated bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia hospitalizations among children aged &lt;5 years in the United States were 3888 (0.2 hospitalizations per 1000), 8481 per year (0.4 per 1000 children), and 10,186 (0.5 per 1000 children), respectively. Annual charges for PIV-associated bronchiolitis, croup, and pneumonia hospitalizations were approximately $43 million, $58 million, and $158 million, respectively. The majority of PIV-associated hospitalizations in young children occur among those aged 0 to 2 years. When vaccines for PIV become available, immunization would be most effective if realized within the first year of life.

Overall, only 5% of the mothers had detectable OPV (16 of 304) despite high infant shedding rates. OPV shedding was similar between HIV-infected mothers and those who were uninfected (11 [6.4%] of 171 vs 5 [3.8%] of 133, respectively) and between mothers of HIV-infected infants and those of uninfected infants (2 [3.5%] of 57 vs 9 [6.3%] of 144, respectively).

However, postdischarge morbidity in children with CM or SMA has not been well established. Children 18 months to 12 years of age, enrolled on admission to Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda (CM, n = 162; SMA, n = 138), and healthy children recruited from the community (CC) (n = 133) were followed up for 6 months. The incidences of hospitalizations and outpatient clinic visits for illness during the follow-up period were compared between children with CM or SMA and the CC. After adjustment for age, sex, and nutritional status, children with SMA had a higher incidence rate ratio (IRR) than CC for hospitalization (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.81 [2.48-174.68]), hospitalization with malaria (17.29 [95% CI, 2.02-148.35]), and clinic visits for any illness (95% CI, 2.35 [1.22-4.51]). Adjusted IRRs for children with CM were also increased for all measures compared with those for CC, but they achieved statistical significance only for clinic visits for any illness (2.24 [95% CI, 1.20-4.15]). In both groups, the primary reason for the clinic visits and hospitalizations was malaria. In the 6 months after initial hospitalization, children with SMA have an increased risk of repeated hospitalization, and children with CM or SMA have an increased risk of outpatient illness. Malaria is the main cause of inpatient and outpatient morbidity. Malaria prophylaxis has the potential to decrease postdischarge morbidity rates in children with SMA or CM. ","816":"Antimicrobial use is decreasing across freestanding children's hospitals, predominantly in institutions with antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) in place. A highly effective ASP should effect a greater decrease in use than predicted by existing trends. Antimicrobial stewardship programs depend on clinician adherence to program recommendations, but little is known about factors associated with adherence. Parenteral antimicrobial-use data for our institution and 43 additional freestanding children's hospitals were obtained and normalized for patient census. Segmental linear regression was used to compare rates of change of parenteral antimicrobial use before and after ASP implementation. Time-series models were developed to predict use in the absence of intervention. The odds of adherence to ASP recommendations were determined based on provider characteristics and recommendation type. In the 38 months before ASP implementation, parenteral antimicrobial use was decreasing at our hospital by 3.7%\/year, similar to the 3.4%\/year found across children's hospitals. The rate of change after implementation of the ASP at our hospital was 11.1%\/year, compared to 5.6%\/year for other hospitals over the same period. Of 643 interventions, teams adhered with recommendations in 495 cases (77.0%). According to adjusted analysis, primary service was not associated with adherence (P = .356). There was an association between adherence and the role of the clinician receiving a recommendation (P = .009) and the recommendation type (P = .009). Understanding factors associated with adherence to ASP recommendations can help those who administer such programs to strategize interventions for maximizing efficacy. Our findings reveal the value of a formal ASP in reducing use when controlling for secular trends.

A simplified once-daily regimen of ceftriaxone and metronidazole (CTX plus MTZ) is cost effective in perforated patients. The goal of this evaluation is to compare a historic regimen of cefoxitin (CFX) in nonperforated cases and ertapenem (ERT) in perforated and abscessed cases with CTX plus MTZ for all cases in terms of efficacy and cost. A retrospective review compared outcomes of nonperforated, perforated, and abscessed cases who received the historic regimen or CTX plus MTZ. Length of stay, time to afebrile, time to full feeds, postoperative abscess, and wound infection rates, inpatient readmissions, and antibiotic costs were evaluated. There were a total of 841 cases reviewed (494 nonperforated, 247 perforated, and 100 abscessed). Overall, the CTX plus MTZ group had a shorter time to afebrile (P &lt; .001). Treatment groups did not differ in length of stay. Postoperative abscess rates were similar between groups (4.1% vs 3.3%, not significant). Other postoperative complications were similar between groups. Total antibiotic cost savings were over $110 000 during the study period (from November 2010 to June 2013). Both CFX and\/or ERT and CTX plus MTZ result in low abscess and complication rates, suggesting both are effective strategies. Treatment with CTX plus MTZ results in a shorter time to afebrile, while also providing significant antibiotic cost savings.

Little is known about the presentation, clinic course, epidemiology, and genetics of blastomycosis in children. A retrospective review of children with blastomycosis confirmed by culture or cytopathology between 1999 and 2014 was completed. Blastomyces sp. isolates were genotyped by using microsatellite typing, and species were typed by sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (its2). Of the 114 children with blastomycosis identified, 79% had isolated pulmonary involvement and 21% had extrapulmonary disease. There were more systemic findings, including fever (P = .01), poor intake (P = .01), elevated white blood cell count (P &lt; .01), and elevated C-reactive protein level (P &lt; .01), in children with isolated pulmonary disease than in children with extrapulmonary disease. Children with extrapulmonary disease had more surgeries (P = .01) and delays in diagnosis (P &lt; .01) than those with isolated pulmonary infection. Of 52 samples genotyped, 48 (92%) were Blastomyces gilchristii and 4 (8%) were Blastomyces dermatitidis. This is the first large-scale study of the clinical, epidemiologic, and genetic features of blastomycosis in children. The majority of the children had isolated pulmonary disease with systemic findings. Patients with extrapulmonary disease were less likely to have systemic symptoms or additional laboratory evidence of infection, which made delays in diagnosis more common. More than 90% of the pediatric cases were caused by B gilchristii.

The last published summary of US measles epidemiology was during 2001-2008. We summarized US measles epidemiology during 2009-2014. We compared demographic, vaccination, and virologic data on confirmed measles cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during January 1, 2009-December 31, 2014 and January 1, 2001-December 31, 2008. During 2009-2014, 1264 confirmed measles cases were reported in the United States, including 275 importations from 58 countries and 66 outbreaks. The annual median number of cases and outbreaks during this period was 130 (range, 55-667 cases) and 10 (range, 4-23 outbreaks), respectively, compared with an annual median of 56 cases (P = .08) and 4 outbreaks during 2001-2008 (P = .04). Among US-resident case-patients during 2009-2014, children aged 12-15 months had the highest measles incidence (65 cases; 8.3 cases\/million person-years), and infants aged 6-11 months had the second highest incidence (86 cases; 7.3 cases\/million person-years). During 2009-2014, 865 (74%) of 1173 US-resident case-patients were unvaccinated and 188 (16%) had unknown vaccination status; of 917 vaccine-eligible US-resident case-patients, 600 (65%) were reported as having philosophical or religious objections to vaccination. Although the United States has maintained measles elimination since 2000, measles outbreaks continue to occur globally, resulting in imported cases and potential spread. The annual median number of cases and outbreaks more than doubled during 2009-2014 compared with the earlier postelimination years.

However, treatment outcomes for lower respiratory tract infections among HIV-EU children remain poorly defined. We conducted a hospital-based, prospective cohort study of N = 238 children aged 1-23 months with pneumonia, defined by the World Health Organization. Children were recruited within 6 hours of presentation to a tertiary hospital in Botswana. The primary outcome--treatment failure at 48 hours--was assessed by an investigator blinded to HIV exposure status. Median age was 6.0 months; 55% were male. One hundred fifty-three (64%) children were HIV-unexposed, 64 (27%) were HIV-EU, and 20 (8%) were HIV-infected; the HIV exposure status of 1 child could not be established.

Stored sera collected from the cross-sectional National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2003-2004 cycle were tested for EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 antibody. Demographic information was obtained through self-reported questionnaires. Statistical analysis included logistic regression and multivariate analysis adjusting for the multistage cluster design. Overall, 36% of children had antibody against 2 or more of the viruses. Coprevalence with EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 was higher in females, in non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, compared with non-Hispanic whites, and in those without health insurance. Antibody prevalence was associated with (1) lower household income and education and (2) greater crowding. Nearly all children with CMV antibody or HSV-1 antibody had been infected with EBV. There was a disproportionately high prevalence of EBV, CMV, and HSV-1 antibody among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks, groups with a lower poverty income ratio, and those with less household education.

We analyzed data collected retrospectively from a probabilistically linked national database of pediatric (aged 1 month-18 years) in-patients with a microbiologically confirmed HA-BSI in England between January and March 2009. A time-dependent Cox regression model was fit to determine the presence of any effect. Furthermore, a multistate model, adjusted for the time to onset of HA-BSI, was used to compare outcomes in patients with HA-BSI to those without HA-BSI. We further adjusted for patients' characteristics as recorded in hospital admission data. The dataset comprised 333 605 patients, with 214 cases of HA-BSI. After adjustment for time to HA-BSI and comorbidities, the hazard for discharge (dead or alive) from hospital for patients with HA-BSI was 0.9 times (95% confidence interval [CI], .8-1.1) that of noninfected patients. Excess length of stay associated with all-cause HA-BSI was 1.6 days (95% CI, .2-3.0), although this duration varied by pathogen. Patients with HA-BSI had a 3.6 (95% CI, 1.3-10.4) times higher hazard for in-hospital death than noninfected patients.

Diagnoses, medications, comorbid conditions, antibiotic allergy, and demographic data were obtained from a shared electronic health record and validated by manual review. Practice-specific antibiotic prescription and acute respiratory tract infection diagnosis rates were calculated to assess across-practice differences after adjusting for patient demographics and clustering of encounters within clinicians. A total of 102 102 (28%) of 399 793 acute visits by 208 015 patients resulted in antibiotic prescriptions. After adjusting for patient age, sex, race, and insurance type, and excluding encounters by patients with chronic conditions, antibiotic prescribing by practice ranged from 18% to 36% of acute visits, and the proportion of antibiotic prescriptions that were broad-spectrum ranged from 15% to 58% across practices, despite additional exclusion of patients with antibiotic allergies or prior antibiotic use.

We performed a retrospective cohort study among 10 698 children with new-onset acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) from 41 US children's hospitals between January 1999 and September 2011. Influenza-related hospitalizations were identified using ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes, excluding hospitalizations during low-prevalence influenza periods. Follow-up was censored at the earliest of 5 events: end of study period, expected end of chemotherapy, last known hospitalization, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, or death. Data were collected on hospitalization characteristics and resource utilization. Hospitalization rates were calculated using season-adjusted person-time. Crude attributable in-hospital mortality was calculated using baseline mortality for noninfluenza hospitalizations during the same period. Subgroup analysis was performed by time from ALL diagnosis and by age category. The rate of influenza-related hospitalizations was 618.3 per 100 000 person-months. Rates were similar by time from ALL diagnosis and across age categories. Overall attributable in-hospital mortality was 1.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3%-2.3%) and was highest for children &lt;6 months from diagnosis (1.6%; 95% CI, 0.4%-4.5%) and children &lt;2 years of age (6.7%; 95% CI, 1.3%-22.7%). Total length of stay, days of broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, and duration of intensive care were significantly greater for influenza-related hospitalizations compared with noninfluenza hospitalizations.

Of these patients, 114 met criteria for a diagnosis of encephalitis, and 76 of these patients (representing 77 hospitalizations) had complete data available. Forty-nine (64%) patients were available for follow-up. Patients admitted to the intensive care unit were more likely to have abnormal EEG results (P = .001). The presence of seizures on admission was associated with ongoing seizure disorder at follow-up. One or more years after hospitalization, 78% of the patients had persistent symptoms, including 35% with seizures. Four (5%) of the patients died. Abnormal MRI findings and the number of abnormal findings on initial presentation were associated with lower quality-of-life scores. Encephalitis leads to significant morbidity and death, and incomplete recovery is achieved in the majority of hospitalized patients. Abnormal EEG results were found more frequently in critically ill children, patients with abnormal MRI results had lower quality-of-life scores on follow-up, and the presence of seizures on admission was associated with ongoing seizure disorder and lower physical quality-of-life scores.

We aimed to determine whether the rotavirus cases during the 2012-2013 rotavirus season were of types not included in licensed vaccines. Microbiology laboratories of 3 children's hospitals in St. Louis provided samples that were positive using rapid antigen tests from 2010 to 2013. The majority of samples were from St. Louis Children's Hospital. We determined rotavirus genotypes by polymerase chain reaction tests and further characterized a subset of viruses by genome sequencing and comparative sequence analysis. Eighty-six percent (24 of 28) of typed viruses analyzed from the 2012-2013 rotavirus season were G12. We performed whole genome sequencing on 8 G12 viruses, all of which were VP4 type P[8]. The sequenced viruses showed differences from vaccine strains in major antigenic epitopes on the VP7 protein, but most epitopes on VP4 were conserved. Rotavirus vaccine histories were available for 11 G12 cases, of whom 10 had not been vaccinated. G12 was a dominant community-wide genotype in 2013. Most of the G12 cases for whom vaccine histories were available had not received rotavirus vaccine.

This systematic review clearly delineates both the near- and long-term morbidities that can occur after, and persist beyond, the period of acute illness. Although rare, invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) continues to be a health concern in high-income countries because of its severe morbidity and relatively high case fatality rate, especially in young children. However, studies measuring sequelae of IMD across the spectrum of invasive syndromes have not been systematically reviewed. We conducted a systematic review of sequelae attributable to IMD and quality of life (QoL) in IMD survivors in high-income countries. We searched Medline, Embase, and HealthSTAR for primary studies that assessed sequelae or QoL in individuals of any age with and without IMD. Two independent reviewers screened articles, abstracted data, and performed quality appraisal. The findings were summarized qualitatively. Of 1884 citations screened, 17 studies were included. The most commonly assessed sequelae were hearing impairment, cognitive impairment, and psychological problems. In general, children with IMD had a greater incidence of hearing loss and psychological disorders, including attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder. However, its effects on intelligence in children remain unclear. No statistical differences in overall cognitive function in adults were reported. The odds of death were significantly increased with IMD at hospital discharge and up to 30 years after disease. Lower overall QoL was observed in those who had IMD versus controls. The results of this systematic review delineate both the short- and long-term morbidities that can occur after, and persist beyond, the period of acute illness.

Retention of a CVC was associated with an increased risk of death after adjusting for age and complexity of care at candidemia onset. Although there is likely persistence of unmeasured confounding, given the strong association between catheter retention and death, our data suggest that early CVC removal should be strongly considered.

We now update data on varicella healthcare utilization with 10 years of additional data, during a period of stabilizing first-dose coverage and rapidly increasing second-dose coverage. We performed a retrospective cohort study using claims data from 1994-2012 Truven Health MarketScan databases. We examined trends in rates of varicella-related outpatient visits and hospitalizations for MarketScan enrollees aged 0-49 years, including outpatient laboratory testing, outpatient antiviral use, and pediatric strokes, with 1994-1995 as the prevaccination period and 2006-2012 as the 2-dose varicella vaccination period. Varicella outpatient visits declined 84% in 2012 versus the prevaccination period, with a 60% decline during the 2-dose period. Varicella hospitalizations declined 93% in 2012 versus the prevaccination period, with a 38% decline during the 2-dose period. The proportion of those with a varicella outpatient visit having varicella laboratory testing increased from 6% in 2003 to 17% in 2012. There were 21 445 (17%) with a claim for antivirals, which was relatively stable over time. There was no reduction in pediatric strokes during 1994-2012.

","948":"With malaria declining, other causes of fever may account for a substantial portion of severe childhood illness in sub-Saharan Africa. We determined prevalence, etiologies, and correlates of bacteremia among children in Western Kenya. In a cross-sectional study, febrile children aged 6 months to 15 years presenting to Kisii (low malaria endemicity) and Homabay (high malaria endemicity) Hospitals were enrolled and screened for malaria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and bacteremia. Correlates of bacteremia were evaluated using logistic regression. Among 1476 children enrolled, 48 (3.3%) had bacteremia (23 of 734, 3.1% in Kisii and 25 of 734, 3.4% in Homabay). Salmonella spp (19 typhi and 21 nontyphoidal salmonella) accounted for 83% (40 of 48) of isolates. The distribution of Salmonella spp was similar between sites. Bacteremia was associated with incomplete vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-4.1), before treatment with antimalarials (aOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-4.1), having sought care elsewhere (aOR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-4.0) and lower education of caregiver (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-4.8). Nontyphoidal salmonella bacteremia was associated with HIV (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI, 1.1-35.1) and anemia (hemoglobin &lt;8 g\/dL) (aOR = 5.2; 95% CI, 1.4-18.9).

","949":"The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for colonization with extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant (ESC-R) Escherichia coli in daycare center (DCC)-attending children. This is a prospective cohort study including 44 DCCs in the Netherlands, combining DCC characteristics and monthly collected stool samples from their attendees, and was performed in 2010-2012. During a 22-month study period, 852 stool samples were collected and screened for ESC-R E coli. Risk factors were studied using logistic regression analysis. In DCC-attending children (&lt;4 years old), the overall prevalence of ESC-R E coli was 4.5%, and it was 8% in &lt;1-year-old attendees. Among the 38 children carrying ESC-R E coli, the most common types were blaCMY-2 (26%), blaCTX-M-1 (16%), and chromosomal AmpC type 3 promoter mutants (13%). Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E coli was less common in DCCs where stricter hygiene protocols were enforced, eg, not allowing ill children to enter the DCC (odds ratio [OR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.84), performing extra checks on handwashing of ill children (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.87), and reporting suspected outbreaks to local health authorities (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.11-0.69). The distribution of ESC-R E coli types in DCCs differs from that of the general population. Extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E coli carriage in DCC-attending children is associated with the hygiene policies enforced in the DCC. Although our results are not conclusive enough to change current DCC practice beyond ensuring compliance with standing policies, they generated hypotheses and defined the degree of ESC resistance among DCC attendees, which may influence empiric antibiotic therapy choices, and tracked the increasing trend in ESC resistance.

In Africa, there are limited studies on the prevalence of AOM and its sequelae in children. Study subjects were children aged 2 to 15 years and were enrolled from randomly selected preprimary and primary schools. After parental or guardian consent, subjects had a questionnaire administered, otoscopy and tympanometry were done, and audiometry was performed on those with ear problems detected on these examinations. A total of 9825 (75%) children was from rural schools. The prevalence of CSOM was 15 of 1000, OME was 15 of 1000, and AOM was 7 of 1000 children. Rural Rift Valley schoolchildren had the highest prevalence of CSOM (24 of 1000) compared with other regions (12 of 1000; P &lt; .0001). Ear discharge occurred before 3.5 years in 50% of 901 children with ear discharge.

Current World Health Organization guidelines recommend antibiotics for children in non cholera-endemic areas only in the presence of dysentery, a proxy for suspected Shigella infection. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of the syndromic diagnosis of Shigella-associated diarrhea, we enrolled children aged 6 months to 5 years presenting to 1 of 3 Western Kenya hospitals between November 2011 and July 2014 with acute diarrhea. Stool samples were tested using standard methods for bacterial culture and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for pathogenic Escherichia coli. Stepwise multivariable logit models identified factors to increase the sensitivity of syndromic diagnosis. Among 1360 enrolled children, median age was 21 months (interquartile range, 11-37), 3.4% were infected with human immunodeficiency virus, and 16.5% were stunted (height-for-age z-score less than -2). Shigella was identified in 63 children (4.6%), with the most common species being Shigella sonnei (53.8%) and Shigella flexneri (40.4%). Dysentery correctly classified 7 of 63 Shigella cases (sensitivity, 11.1%). Seventy-eight of 1297 children without Shigella had dysentery (specificity, 94.0%). The combination of fecal mucous, age over 23 months, and absence of excessive vomiting identified more children with Shigella-infection (sensitivity, 39.7%) but also indicated antibiotics in more children without microbiologically confirmed Shigella (specificity, 82.7%). Reliance on dysentery as a proxy for Shigella results in the majority of Shigella-infected children not being identified for antibiotics. Field-ready rapid diagnostics or updated evidence-based algorithms are urgently needed to identify children with diarrhea most likely to benefit from antibiotic therapy.

Details of presenting history, physical examination, and course in the hospital were recorded. Stool samples were characterized using a 15 pathogen polymerase chain reaction assay. There were 671 participants with a median age of 8.3 months; 77 (11%) had severe acute malnutrition. Only 74 children had bloody stools, of whom 48 (65%) had a detectable bacterial pathogen, compared to 195 of 592 (33%) of those without. There were 26 deaths (3.9%). Covariates associated with death in multivariable logistic regression were the detection of any of Campylobacter\/Shigella\/enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-6.17), severe acute malnutrition (OR 4.34, 95% CI 1.79-10.5), and antibiotic therapy (OR 8.82, 95% CI 2.03-38.2). There was no significant association between bloody stools and death, and the effect of Campylobacter\/Shigella\/enterotoxigenic E. coli infection on death was not modified by the presence of bloody stools. Detection of bacterial enteropathogens is associated with increased mortality in children in sub-Saharan Africa.

We sought to measure the clinical and economic burden of HMPV infection in hospitalized children. We conducted a retrospective cohort study from 2007 to 2013 at Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. Children &lt;18 years of age with laboratory-confirmed HMPV infection were included. Demographic, clinical, and financial data were abstracted from the electronic medical record. During the study period, 815 children were hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed HMPV infection: 16% &lt;6 months, 50% 6-23 months, 23% 2-4 years, and 11% 5-17 years of age. A complex chronic condition was identified in 453 (56%) children hospitalized with HMPV infection; this proportion increased with increasing age (P &lt; .001). There was marked variation in annual HMPV hospitalization rates, ranging from 9 of 100 000 person-years in 2012-2013 to 79 of 100 000 in 2009-2010. Hospitalization rates were highest among children &lt;2 years (200 of 100 000 person-years) and lowest among children 5-17 years of age (5 of 100 000).

We aimed to examine the collective pool of all systemic antibiotics prescribed to children hospitalized for surgical conditions and identify common surgical conditions with highly variable and potentially unnecessary antibiotic use, because these conditions may represent antimicrobial stewardship priorities. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of surgical inpatients discharged in 2012 at 37 freestanding children's hospitals. We captured all systemic antibiotic use as days of therapy (DOT), and we reported surgical conditions by frequency and contribution to overall antibiotic use. We used multivariable logistic and Poisson regression with marginal standardization to estimate (1) the standardized proportion and (2) DOT of condition-specific targeted antibiotic use among top surgical condition patients. Among 151 345 surgical inpatients, 82.9% received antimicrobials for a median 2 DOT per subject (interquartile range, 1-5; range, 1-958). The most commonly received antibiotics were cefazolin (16.7% of all DOT), vancomycin (12.5%), and piperacillin\/tazobactam (6.9%). The top 10 conditions contributing most to antibiotic use accounted for 51.3% of all antibiotic use.

From 2000 to 2009, the annual rates of perinatal CHBV reported by PHBPP (0.8%-2.4%) were consistently lower than expected rates from CDC models (3.0%-4.1%), suggesting that rates of CHBV might be higher among infants whose outcomes were not identified by PHBPP. To better understand the factors impacting modeled expected number and rates of perinatal CHBV, we examined historic CDC models, applied updated inputs to the 2009 CDC model, and performed sensitivity analyses over a range of parameter values. Models employed estimates of the annual number of births to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive pregnant women, and data from PHBPP and National Immunization Surveys. Published literature provided prenatal HBsAg screening rates, efficacy of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), and perinatal HBV transmission rates. The updated 2009 model predicted 952 perinatal CHBV infections, equivalent to a baseline rate of 3.84%, among infants of HBsAg-positive women. Sensitivity analyses yielded a possible range of perinatal CHBV rates between 0.60% and 15.41%. The proportion of infants receiving timely PEP, the efficacy of PEP, and perinatal HBV transmission rate were major \"drivers\" of CHBV rates. Three-way sensitivity analysis yielded possible perinatal CHBV rates between 0.79% and 13.64%.

Although these agents hold promise for amelioration or cure of this disease, they have the potential to facilitate infectious complications. There are limited data regarding the prospective assessment of infectious risks with these agents in trials of this nature. Pediatric subjects may be at greater risk due to the higher likelihood of primary infection.

The goals of these recommendations are to provide a structured approach to monitor for infections, to identify specific laboratory testing and surveillance methods, and to consider therapies for treatment of these potential complications. Prospective evaluations of these infectious risks allow for greater scientific rigor in the evaluation of risk, which must be balanced with the potential benefits of these therapies.

Success with vector control strategies has led to a relative increase in the burden attributable to congenital transmission of T cruzi. In endemic settings, approximately 5% of infected pregnant women transmit to their offspring. Congenital T cruzi infection is generally asymptomatic and parasitological and serological testing is required for diagnosis. This review highlights research gaps with a focus on (1) improving screening, diagnostic, and treatment options and (2) designing epidemiologic studies to understand risk factors for congenital T cruzi. ","996":"Toxoplasmosis is caused by infection with the parasite Toxoplasma gondii. It is one of the most common parasitic infections in humans and is most typically asymptomatic. However, primary infection in a pregnant woman can cause severe and disabling disease in the developing fetus. Recent developments have included increased understanding of the role of parasite genotype in determining infectivity and disease severity. Risk factors for acquisition of infection have been better defined, and the important role of foodborne transmission has been further delineated. In addition, strategies have emerged to decrease mother-to-child transmission through prompt identification of acutely infected pregnant women followed by appropriate treatment. Refined diagnostic tools, particularly the addition of immunoglobulin G avidity testing, allow for more accurate timing of maternal infection and hence better decision making during pregnancy. Congenitally infected children can be treated, beginning in utero and continuing through the first year of life, to ameliorate the severity of disease. However, despite these many advances in our understanding of congenital toxoplasmosis prevention and treatment, significant areas of study remain: we need better drugs, well defined strategies for screening of pregnant women, improved food safety, and improved diagnostic tests.

CMV persists indefinitely in its human host, and MTCT can occur if the mother was infected in the past or during the current pregnancy. The goal of efforts to prevent MTCT of CMV is to prevent congenital infection, an important cause of disability due to hearing loss, impaired vision, cognitive impairment, and neuromotor deficits. Vaccines for prevention of maternal and congenital CMV infection are being developed but will not likely be available for at least a decade. Rather than waiting for an effective vaccine to solve the problem, more effort must be devoted to defining the potential for public health measures to prevent congenital CMV infection by reducing rates of maternal infection during pregnancy. ","999":"Infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2), both alpha herpesviruses, are highly prevalent worldwide. Both HSV types commonly cause genital infection, which, when acquired or reactivated during pregnancy, carries with it the risk of transmission to the fetus or neonate. Women who acquire primary or first-episode genital herpes during pregnancy are at greater risk for transmitting the infection than are women with recurrent genital herpes. Because viral infection and reactivation are frequently asymptomatic, many affected women are unaware of their infection and risk of transmission to their infants. Neonatal HSV infection can have devastating long-term consequences, especially when the central nervous system (CNS) is involved. Treatment of affected neonates with intravenous acyclovir has improved outcomes but there is room for further improvement, especially in regard to CNS disease.

We conducted a pilot study to assess feasibility of home self- (or parent-) collection of nasal swabs (NS). Cystic fibrosis patients aged 6-18 years with new respiratory illness participated. In clinic, a deep nasal flocked swab was collected by research staff and compared with an anterior foam NS obtained after instillation of saline spray. At home, up to 2 self-collections of paired foam NS (with and without saline) were collected and mailed for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Paired swabs were collected from 28 patients: 18 sets in clinic (deep nasal vs saline foam NS) and 43 sets at home (saline vs dry foam NS) with 9 (50%) and 35 (81%) virus detections, respectively. Home-collected NS were obtained closer to illness onset, with a mean difference in symptom days of -2.3 between home and clinic collections (95% confidence interval [CI] -3.5, -1.2; P &lt; .001). Rhinovirus comprised 73% of virus detections; the difference in mean PCR cycle threshold values for rhinovirus between swabs collected at home versus clinic was -3.8 (95% CI -6.8, -0.9; P = .014), indicating significantly higher viral load for home-collected swabs. Home-collected foam NS had a higher positivity rate compared with clinic-collected swabs, likely because collection was closer to illness onset. Home self-collection is feasible and well tolerated for timely respiratory virus diagnosis and provides a novel approach for clinical diagnostics and surveillance of respiratory virus infections among CF patients.

We evaluated the seroprevalence of both viruses among healthy, HIV-uninfected children and HIV-infected children in the Kilimanjaro region of northern Tanzania. HBV and HCV markers were assessed using serum and plasma samples from HIV-negative children ages 1 month to 18 years, recruited primarily from 2 hospital vaccination clinics; and HIV-infected children 1-16 years of age, enrolled in care and on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HBV markers included hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody, and hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). Evidence of any prior HBV infection was defined as a single positive HBsAg or HBcAb result; presumed chronic hepatitis B infection was defined as a single positive HBsAg result. HCV infection was assessed by anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Samples from 547 children were tested. Of 157 children infected with HIV, 9.6% (95% CI: 4.9, 14.2) showed evidence of any HBV infection, compared to 2.1% (95% CI: .6, 3.5) of HIV-negative children. Children with HIV were much more likely to show evidence of HBV infection than children without HIV (odds ratio [OR] = 5.0, P &lt; .0001). Prevalence of presumed chronic HBV infection was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.5, 4.3) overall. Again, prevalence was higher among HIV-infected children (7.0% [95% CI: 3.0, 11.0]) compared to HIV-negative children (1.3% [95% CI: .2, 2.4]; OR = 5.8 [P = .0003]). Of 546 samples tested for anti-HCV antibody, none were positive. HBV seroprevalence is high among children in the Kilimanjaro Region, with a significantly higher prevalence among children who are infected with HIV. Routine screening for HBV is needed among HIV-infected children. Patients with coinfection require closer monitoring of liver transaminases due to potential for hepatic toxicities, and they may need HAART regimens that will target both viruses.

","1067":"Our objectives were to describe the incidence of return visits for children with Group A Streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis (ie, clinical treatment failure) and to assess whether initial treatment with amoxicillin or penicillin was associated with the rate of retreatment for GAS pharyngitis. This analysis was a retrospective cohort study of 5533 children 0-17 years from a multisite practice. Eligible visits (n = 6585) were associated with a positive test for GAS, receipt of antibiotics within 7 days, no allergies to penicillins or cephalosporins, and no codiagnoses requiring antibiotic treatment. Retreatment for GAS pharyngitis was defined as an index visit followed by another visit within 1-4 weeks. Five hundred episodes (250 treatment failures and 250 controls) were randomly selected for chart review to validate cases. Amoxicillin or penicillin was the initial antibiotic treatment at 76.1% of visits, and retreatment for GAS pharyngitis occurred after 5.8% of initial visits. Children initially prescribed amoxicillin or penicillin had higher odds of retreatment of GAS pharyngitis even after adjusting for age, sex, symptoms, and community-level covariates such as race, income, and education (odds ratio, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.13). Retreatment for GAS pharyngitis was uncommon and associated with receipt of amoxicillin or penicillin, although the impact of GAS carriage is unknown.

Patients with a history of CHD and S aureus infection were identified from a surveillance study of S aureus infections at Texas Children's Hospital. Clinical and laboratory data from medical records were reviewed. All isolates were screened for the presence of the antiseptic tolerance gene qacA\/B. Dichotomous variables were compared with Fisher's exact test and continuous variables with Mann-Whitney U tests, and two-tailed P values of &lt;.05 were considered significant. Two hundred forty-eight S aureus infections developed in 216 patients with CHD. Methicillin resistance was seen in 53.6% of isolates. Surgical site infections accounted for 28.2% of cases and bacteremia accounted for 20.4% of cases. Bacteremia was associated with IE in 29.5% of the episodes. Infective endocarditis was more often associated with prolonged bacteremia, thrombocytopenia, and a higher C-reactive protein (CRP) compared with uncomplicated bacteremia. The qacA\/B gene was found in 16.9% of isolates and was associated with bacteremia and prolonged hospitalization. Staphylococcus aureus is an important cause of morbidity among children with CHD.

Children were followed in the main hospital TB clinic or in 1 of 2 hospital-run neighborhood clinics. Those completing and not completing medical treatment were compared based on demographic and history variables, clinic location, and distance to clinic. Propensity score techniques were used to match children treated at the main hospital and neighborhood clinics on collected demographic and history variables. Of 1516 children evaluated, 1184 (78.1%) initiated medical therapy and returned for at least 1 visit.

Neighborhood and main hospital clinic children did not differ in rates of completion when propensity score-matched groups were compared. Country of origin was the most important factor in determining both initiation and completion of therapy. Obstacles remain for successful initiation and treatment of children from identified geographic regions.

To promote medical homes and increase immunization rates, we conceptualized and implemented a 3-year, 8-school pilot school-located vaccination collaborative program. We sought community, parent, and school nurse input the year prior to implementation. We selected schools with predominantly Medicaid-enrolled or Medicaid-eligible students to receive Vaccines For Children stock vaccines. Nurses employed by a mass immunizer delivered these vaccines at participating schools 3 times a year. Over 3 years, we delivered approximately 1800 vaccines at schools. School administrators, health centers, and neighboring private physicians generally welcomed the program. Parents did not express overt concerns about school-located vaccination. School nurses were not able to participate because of multiple school assignments. Obtaining parental consent via backpack mail was an inefficient process, and classroom incentives did not increase consent form return rate. The influenza vaccine had the most prolific uptake. The optimal time for administering vaccines was during regular school hours. Although school-located vaccination for adolescents is feasible, this is a paradigm shift for community members and thus accompanies challenges in implementation. High principal or school personnel turnover led to a consequent lack of institutional memory. It was difficult to communicate directly with parents. Because we were uncertain about the proportion of parents who received consent forms, we are exploring Internet-based and back-to-school registration options for making the consent form distribution and return process more rigorous.

The overall incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis declined in the postvaccine period, from 26.6 to 5.2 cases per 10 000 person-years for Salt Lake County residents. The largest decrease in the incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis was among children &lt;12 months (-87%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 79-93). Older children (12-23 months) also experienced significant decreases (-81%; 95% CI, 72-88), as did those 24-59 months (-61%; 95% CI, 51-71). In 2009, 3 years after rotavirus vaccine introduction, there was a 79% decrease in emergency department visits and a 78% decrease in hospitalizations across both hospitals. The cost of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for rotavirus gastroenteritis decreased by 79% and 72%, respectively, resulting in annual savings of $790 000 at a children's hospital and $140 000 at a community hospital. Rotavirus vaccination in infants has dramatically decreased the clinical burden and direct medical costs of rotavirus gastroenteritis in both infants and young children.

NVP resistance in breast milk persisted for at least 8 months postpartum and was apparently transmitted to at least 1 infant. NVP resistance was detected less often in women who also received zidovudine. ","1114":"The incidence of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in children has increased over the past decade. In recent years, new and intriguing data on pediatric CDI have emerged. Community-onset infections are increasingly recognized, even in children who have not previously received antibiotics. A hypervirulent strain is responsible for up to 20% of pediatric CDI cases. Unique risk factors for CDI in children have been identified. Advances in diagnostic testing strategies, including the use of nucleic acid amplification tests, have raised new questions about the optimal approach to diagnosing CDI in children. Novel therapeutic options are available for adult patients with CDI, raising questions about the use of these agents in children. Updated recommendations about infection prevention and control measures are now available. We summarize these recent developments in pediatric CDI in this review and also highlight remaining knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future research efforts. ","1115":null,"1116":"Herpes simplex virus resistance to acyclovir is well described in immune-compromised patients. Management of prolonged infection and recurrences in such patients may be problematic. A patient with neuroblastoma developed likely primary herpes gingivostomatitis shortly after starting a course of chemotherapy, with spread to the eye during treatment with acyclovir. Viral isolates were serially obtained from separate sites after treatment was begun and tested for susceptibility to acyclovir and foscarnet by plaque reduction and plating efficiency assays. The thymidine kinase and DNA polymerase genes from each isolate were sequenced. Initial isolates from a throat swab, an oral lesion, and conjunctiva were resistant to acyclovir within 13 days of treatment. Subsequent isolates while on foscarnet were initially acyclovir-susceptible, but reactivation of an acyclovir-resistant isolate was subsequently documented while on acyclovir suppression. Genotypic analysis identified a previously unreported UL23 mutation in some resistant isolates. None of the amino acid changes identified in UL30 were associated with resistance. Phenotypic and genotypic antiviral resistance of herpes simplex isolates may vary from different compartments and over time in individual immune-compromised hosts, highlighting the importance of obtaining cultures from all sites. Phenotypic resistance testing should be considered for isolates obtained from at-risk patients not responding to first-line therapy. Empiric combination treatment with multiple antivirals could be considered in some situations. ","1117":"Invasive aspergillosis (IA) can cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised children. The galactomannan (GM) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) has been shown in adult studies to be a useful adjunct in diagnosing IA. Data on this assay in children are limited by small sample sizes and conflicting results; false-positive assays were a concern in historical studies. We sought to evaluate the GM EIA in a large cohort of children who received intensive chemotherapy and\/or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. A focus was placed on evaluating the assay specificity, and the potential of measuring GM antigen in urine. A multicenter prospective observational study in children with anticipated prolonged neutropenia was performed. Serum specimens were collected twice weekly, and urine was collected once weekly during neutropenic periods. Operating characteristics were calculated using the GM EIA optical density index cutoffs of 0.5 and 1.0 for both serum and urine specimens. At least one serum or urine specimen was tested from 198 patients. Ten patients had one or more repeatedly positive serum specimens, while 37 patients had one or more repeatedly positive urine specimens. The specificity of serum and urine testing was 95% and 80%, respectively. Although the urine test resulted in a higher false positivity rate, it successfully identified the only case of probable IA. Data suggest that the serum GM EIA does not provide frequent false-positive results as previously reported. Screening for galactomannan, or a related antigen in urine, needs to be further evaluated as it may be amenable to development of surveillance strategies. ","1118":"Infant laboratory abnormalities have been associated with exposure to antiretrovirals and to trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole (TMP\/SMX). We analyzed data from International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT) Protocol P1025, a prospective cohort study of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV)-infected women and their infants. Live-born, singleton, HIV-uninfected infants with at least 6 months of follow-up who represented the first pregnancy on study of HIV-infected mothers with at least 1 prenatal visit, CD4 count, and viral load during pregnancy and who used at least 1 antiretroviral during pregnancy were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. The study population comprised 1524 infants. During the first 6 months of life, 7.4% of laboratory serious adverse events (SAEs) were related to glucose, 7.2% were related to hemoglobin, 8.7% were related to absolute neutrophil count, and 4.0% were related to total lymphocyte count. The likelihood of laboratory SAEs decreased with increasing age for hemoglobin, absolute neutrophil count, and glucose. Infant preterm birth and current receipt of antiretroviral(s) were the factors with the strongest associations with laboratory SAEs. The overall frequency of laboratory SAEs was low and decreased with age. Preterm infants are at higher risk of hemoglobin- and total lymphocyte count-related SAEs. ","1119":"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) can mutate and cause outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis with prolonged replication. After poliovirus eradication, global use of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) may be needed until all OPV stops circulating. Mexico, where children receive routine IPV but where OPV is given only during biannual national immunization weeks (NIWs), provides a natural setting to study duration of OPV circulation in a community primarily vaccinated with IPV. One-liter sewage samples from four separate arroyos (creeks) near Orizaba, Mexico, were collected monthly for 12 months. Concentrated sewage underwent RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect OPV serotypes 1, 2, and 3 and their variants containing the serotype-specific point mutation in the 5' untranslated region associated with neurovirulence. OPV was detected 3, 4, 5, and 7 months after the May 2010 NIW, but was not detected at 6 or 8 months. A second and third NIW occurred in February 2011 and May 2011, and OPV was detected in the sewage monthly after both of these NIW through July 2011 when collection stopped. The OPV detected was primarily serotype 2 and predominantly contained the point mutations in the 5' untranslated region associated with increased neurovirulence. OPV was detected in sewage as late as 7 months after an NIW in a Mexican community primarily vaccinated with IPV, but was not detected at 8 months, suggesting that OPV circulation may have ceased. These data suggest that in communities with high vaccination rates, 1 or 2 years of IPV administration after OPV cessation could be sufficient to prevent outbreaks of paralytic poliomyelitis from vaccine-derived strains.

This preterm infant developed abdominal distention and tachycardia, and a clinical diagnosis of NEC was made. Acute bowel obstruction occurred 20 days later. Biopsy specimens of the ileum obtained during laparotomy showed extensive CMV inclusion bodies and positive immunoperoxidase staining for CMV. Urine culture and polymerase chain reaction from the blood were also positive for CMV. The patient was treated with ganciclovir and recovered. Thirty-two similar cases of CMV enterocolitis and intestinal obstruction in premature and full term babies are reviewed here.

","1128":"","1129":"Central nervous system (CNS) vasculopathy has been reported in human immunodeficiency virus-infected (HIV+) adults and children. In children, it often presents with HIV encephalopathy, stroke, or intracerebral aneurysms. The etiology, incidence, and risk factors of HIV-associated CNS vasculopathy in children are unknown. We identified HIV+ children with a diagnosis of vasculopathy or other cerebrovascular events among children enrolled between 1993 and 2004 in 2 prospective, multicenter cohort studies. Demographic and laboratory data, history of antiretroviral use, and signs, symptoms, and diagnostic studies pertaining to the CNS event were reviewed. Among the 3338 HIV+ children, 51 had diagnoses that suggested CNS vasculopathy. Of these, 12 (24%) were included in this analysis, after excluding those with alternative diagnoses and those from closed sites. Among these 12, 4 (33%) were female, 4 (33%) were white, and 10 (83%) had perinatal HIV. Their average age at the event was 10.8 years with a median CD4 count of 22 cells\/mm(3) and median HIV-1 viral load of 94 304 copies\/mL. Fifty-eight percent of subjects had a history of opportunistic infections before the CNS event. Fifty percent had cerebral aneurysms on imaging. The overall incidence among HIV+ subjects was 3.4 cases per 10 000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 1.8-6.0). CNS vasculopathy in HIV+ children is uncommon but more common than in the general pediatric population. Cerebral aneurysms are the most common manifestation. Although the pathogenesis remains unclear, older children and those with low CD4 counts and high HIV viral loads are at the highest risk.

The extent to which SA virulence determinants contribute to the severity of pediatric infections is poorly understood. The study objective was to describe the genetic population of invasive SA (ISA) isolates from children in the Central New York (CNY) area and the prevalence of selected virulence genes. Clinical and demographic information for hospitalized children &lt;19 years of age with community-onset or community-associated ISA infections, determined from clinical microbiology records, was extracted from medical records from Upstate Golisano Children's Hospital in CNY. Antibiotic susceptibility was assessed, and available isolates were genotyped and tested for the presence of selected virulence determinants. Associations between clinical and laboratory findings were evaluated using standard statistical techniques. Ninety patients with ISA disease diagnosed between 2007 and 2010 were included in the study; 74% were due to methicillin-susceptible SA (MSSA). The most common clinical diagnosis was bacteremia. Fifty-seven of 90 isolates were available for further testing. The SA pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type, agr type, and clonal complexes most commonly isolated were USA300 (n = 25, 44%), agr1 (n = 30, 52%), and CC8 (n = 25, 44%), respectively. USA300 strains were more likely to be associated with deep abscesses (P = .007), whereas non-USA300 strains were associated with medical device infections (P = .018). Isolates from patients with deep abscesses and pneumonia were more likely to carry luk-PV genes (P = .023 and P = .051, respectively).

A case-control study was conducted, comparing case patients (defined as children &lt;36 months of age with acute gastroenteritis of any severity whose stool tested positive for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay) with age- and municipality-matched controls. Information was obtained through face-to-face interviews on clinical outcome, demographics, breastfeeding history, rotavirus immunization status, and indicators of socioeconomic status. Eighty-five case patients and 170 controls were enrolled. Factors associated with lower risk of rotavirus gastroenteritis included current breastfeeding, owning a refrigerator, and being immunized with 1 or 2 doses of a live-attenuated monovalent rotavirus vaccine. History of previous diarrheal episodes and living with 7 or more people in the same household were associated with higher risk of developing rotavirus gastroenteritis. During this outbreak, dietary, socioeconomic, and environmental factors were independently associated with risk of developing rotavirus disease.

However, there are no published national data for England that describe the pathogen profile and antibiotic resistance rates of HA-BSI in children. Probabilistic matching methods were used to link national data on microbiologically confirmed BSI to hospital in-patient admissions data for the period of January 2009-March 2010. HA-BSI was defined as a positive blood culture drawn from a child aged 1 month-18 years 2 or more days after admission (and before discharge). A total of 8718 episodes of BSI was reported during the study period. Linkage allowed 82% of records to be matched, of which 23% (1734) were HA-BSI, giving a rate of 4.74 per 1000 admissions. The median age of infection was 1 year, and 54% of infections were in males. Methicillin resistance was seen in 83% and 17% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Penicillin resistance was rare in pyogenic streptococci but more common in viridans streptococci (39%). Among Gram-positive organisms, only 3% were vancomycin-resistant.

A qualitative description of the development and implementation of an ASP is provided. In addition, 2 years after the implementation of a prospective-audit-with-feedback ASP, an electronic survey was administered to clinicians to assess their attitudes toward the ASP. A 5-step process for developing this ASP included the following: team development; selecting the stewardship strategy(ies) and antimicrobials to monitor; establishing a method to identify patients; program evaluation; and implementation. Of 365 participants surveyed, 205 (56%) responded, and 80% (160 of 199) had never worked with an ASP before its implementation. Clinicians agreed that the ASP decreased inappropriate use of antibiotics (84%, 162 of 194), improved the quality of patient care (82%, 159 of 194), and provided knowledge and education about appropriate antibiotic use (91%, 177 of 194).
