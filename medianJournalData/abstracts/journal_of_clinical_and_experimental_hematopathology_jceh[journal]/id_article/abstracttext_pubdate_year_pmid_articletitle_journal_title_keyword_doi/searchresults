thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis, renal insufficiency, and organomegaly (TAFRO) syndrome was first proposed in 2010, there has been considerable progress in this area, particularly regarding its association with idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD). TAFRO syndrome is a heterogeneous category with a constellation of symptoms that can develop in the setting of infection, rheumatologic disorder, malignancy, and iMCD. Now, iMCD with TAFRO symptoms is subtyped as iMCD-TAFRO. However, confusion between TAFRO syndrome and iMCD-TAFRO remains. In this article, we discuss the current understanding and future research agenda of TAFRO syndrome and iMCD-TAFRO from the perspective of its new validated international definition.","1":"Castleman disease consists of several lymphoproliferative subtypes that share some histological features in the lymph nodes. On the other hand, numerous clinical findings and etiologies make the disease challenging to understand. The origin of the disease is the hyaline vascular-type unicentric Castleman disease (UCD), first reported by Benjamin Castleman et al. in 1954. Although UCD is characterized by localized lesions and lack of symptoms, multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) with multiple lesions and systemic symptoms was reported by Frizzera in 1983. MCD is further divided according to KSHV\/HHV8 infection status. In KSHV\/HHV8-related MCD, viral infection signals lead to excessive cytokine production, and cause clinical and pathologic abnormalities. Some cases of plasma cell-type KSHV\/HHV8-negative MCD can be found in association with POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-proteins, and skin changes), which is a paraneoplastic syndrome. The others are idiopathic MCD, which are currently considered a heterogeneous group of diseases with overlapping pathological and clinical features. In this article, we summarize the historical evolution of Castleman disease to help understand the disease concept. We also review the latest ideas and definitions of the subtypes within the MCD spectrum and summarize the histopathological findings.","2":"Lymphomatoid gastropathy (LyGa)\/natural killer (NK)-cell enteropathy (NKCE) is recognized as a benign NK-cell lymphoproliferative disease. Due to its histological similarity to NK\/T cell lymphoma, it is easy to misdiagnose, leading to unnecessary chemotherapy and poor quality of life. This disease is typically observed in the small and large intestines in North America, whereas almost all cases in Japan occur locally in the stomach. Only 11 LyGa\/NKCE cases involving both gastric and intestinal lesions have been reported, and there are few reports providing endoscopic images throughout the gastrointestinal tract. We report a case of LyGa\/NKCE involving both the stomach and small and large intestines with detailed upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy and pathology images. Its pathogenesis currently remains elusive, but most patients with LyGa\/NKCE in Japan have Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Our patient was also positive for H. pylori infection at disease onset, but after receiving eradication therapy, ulcerative lesions in both stomach and intestine regressed and no recurrence was observed. This case suggests a link between the pathogenesis of LyGa\/NKCE and H. pylori infection.","3":"Immune evasion mediated by PD-L1 plays an important role in the development of B-cell malignancies. However, PD-L1 expression is infrequently observed in tumor cells of extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS). Other than copy number alterations, PD-L1 is aberrantly upregulated by structural variations in the 3'-UTR of PD-L1. We report four cases with PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, including two with structural variations in the 3'-UTR of PD-L1 and two without. Our report demonstrates the presence of a small number of \"immune evasion-type\" extranodal DLBCL, NOS cases.","4":"Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) is a systemic disorder characterized by systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction associated with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Some patients with iMCD are positive for autoantibodies, although their significance and relationship with specific associated autoimmune diseases are unclear. This study retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features of iMCD patients focusing on autoantibodies. Among 63 iMCD patients in our database, 19 were positive for at least one autoantibody. Among the 19, we identified five with plasma cell type (PC)-iMCD lymph node histopathology and positive anti-phospholipid antibodies. These patients were likely to have thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis or renal insufficiency, organomegaly (TAFRO) symptoms, and thrombotic events. The present study suggests that patients with undiagnosed or atypical autoimmune diseases, including anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS), were treated for iMCD. APS may present with thrombocytopenia or even multi-organ failure, which overlap with clinical presentations of iMCD. Due to differences in the treatment regimen and follow-up, recognition of the undiagnosed autoimmune disease process in those suspected of iMCD is essential. Our study highlights the importance of complete exclusion of differential diagnoses in patients with iMCD in their diagnostic workup.","5":"Bendamustine-rituximab (BR) therapy has been established as a highly effective regimen for indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, patients who receive BR therapy exhibit persistent hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia, resulting in an increased incidence of infections. As a sustained immunosuppressive state is a risk factor for infections, early predictive biomarkers for infections related to BR therapy need to be identified. We retrospectively analyzed 61 patients with indolent NHL who were followed up for 2 years after the end of BR therapy. Progression-free survival was significantly influenced by the incidence of infections. Patients with infections related to BR therapy exhibited persistent hypogammaglobulinemia and lymphopenia. In addition, we determined the cutoff values of serum IgG values and lymphocyte counts for infections using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Minimum serum IgG and lymphocyte counts at the first BR treatment cycle were significantly associated with the incidence of infections during and after BR treatment. Furthermore, the development of skin reactions during BR therapy was significantly associated with the incidence of infections after BR therapy. Our study suggested that these values and symptom are predictive biomarkers for infections related to BR therapy. Based on these findings, better management of indolent NHL patients will be possible.","6":"Bendamustine is now recognized as a key drug for indolent B-cell lymphoma (iBCL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Skin toxicity associated with bendamustine is one of the characteristic adverse effects. We retrospectively examined the relationship between bendamustine-associated drug rashes and disease prognosis of iBCL and MCL at our institution. Between January 2011 and August 2019, 65 patients (39 men and 26 women, median age 68, range 41-84 years) were treated with bendamustine alone (n=11, 120 mg\/m2 on days 1 and 2) or a combination of rituximab and bendamustine (n=54, 90 mg\/m2 on days 1 and 2). Of these patients, 47 had follicular lymphoma (FL), 10 had MCL and 8 had other iBCLs. Drug rash occurred in 27 (41.5%). Eight cases (29.6%) were grade 1, 5 (18.5%) were grade 2 and 14 (51.9%) were grade 3. The onset was in the first course in 17 (63.0%), 2nd course in 5 (18.5%), 3rd course in 2 (7.4%), 4th course in 1 (3.7%) and 5th course in 2 (7.4%). No treatment was administered in 1 case (3.7%), topical steroid was applied in 10 (37.0%), antiallergic drug was administered in 2 (7.4%), topical steroid and antiallergic drug were administered in 5 (18.5%), and oral and topical steroid and antiallergic drug were administered in 9 (33.3%). The 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with rash development were 80.0% and 85.5%, respectively, and those in patients without development were 36.4% and 54.0%, respectively (p=0.009 and 0.02, respectively). By multivariate analysis, the development of rash was associated with a better PFS and a diagnosis of iBCL was associated with a better OS. This study revealed that bendamustine-induced rash is associated with a favorable prognosis among patients with iBCL.","7":"Adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) is a malignancy caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Aggressive ATLL is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and has a poor prognosis. Better therapeutic approaches, including cancer immunotherapy, are required to improve survival and prognosis. The genetic landscape of ATLL reveals frequent genetic alterations in genes associated with immune surveillance, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, CD58 antigen, and programmed cell death ligand 1. Clinicopathological investigations also revealed tumor immunity mechanisms in ATLL, including immune checkpoint molecules, MHC molecules, tumor-associated macrophages, and chemokines. However, the tumor microenvironment of ATLL remains complex because ATLL itself originates from T-cells, usually expressing regulatory T-cell markers. In this review, we discuss the recent literature describing the tumor microenvironment of ATLL.","8":"","9":"Histiocytic neoplasms, such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) and disseminated juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), can involve the liver and sometimes cause liver failure. We aimed to classify non-LCH histiocytic proliferating disorders that do not exhibit typical disseminated JXG histology. We examined four pediatric patients who presented with liver failure and splenomegaly. Two patients with liver cirrhosis without cholestasis underwent liver transplantation (LT). The other two patients presented with giant cell hepatitis causing neonatal\/infantile acute liver failure (ALF). The infantile ALF patient also underwent LT. Liver dysfunction developed after LT in all three transplant cases and the grafts exhibited massive sinusoidal infiltration of histiocytes with hemophagocytosis, similar to the native liver. The neonatal ALF patient was treated with an LCH-type chemotherapy regimen, and is alive and well at 18 months. Infiltrating histiocytes were positive for CD68 and CD163, and negative for CD1a, CD207, and S-100 protein. The BRAF V600E mutation was not present. Liver histological findings were not consistent with conventional disseminated JXG or LCH, although the histological findings in other organs overlapped those of well-known histiocytic neoplasms. The histological and immunohistochemical findings of infiltrating histiocytes suggest that these four cases constituted a disseminated JXG-like systemic disease.","10":"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare lymphoma characterized by the selective growth of lymphoma cells within the lumen of vessels. We describe the case of a 69-year-old male who presented with marked pain in the left facial region. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed a swollen left trigeminal nerve (TN) and positron emission tomography\/computed tomography demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose-only uptake at the same site. The patient had high serum lactate dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels. As random skin biopsy and bone marrow biopsy detected no abnormal pathogenesis, open biopsy of the TN was performed, revealing diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, ground glass opacities rapidly developed in both lung fields with severe respiratory failure. The patient died of progressive disease before the initiation of chemotherapy. Postmortem examination revealed widespread lymphoma cells in the lumen of vessels in multiple organs, including the lungs, excluding the bone marrow and skin. Lymphoma cells formed a mass in the TN and left lumbar plexus. A diagnosis of IVLBCL was made based on the postmortem pathological analysis. DLBCL of abnormal sites, such as the peripheral nervous system, should be considered in cases of IVLBCL as a differential diagnosis.","11":"Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) arising from the anterior mediastinum is rare. In the majority of reported cases, the tumor was incidentally discovered, reflecting its indolent clinical features. We present a 38-year-old woman who had no medical history, and presented with a bulky anterior mediastinal tumor complicated by life-threatening compression of the vasculature and bronchi. Biopsy specimens of the neoplasm suggested transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) from MZL. To our best knowledge, this is the first case report of anterior mediastinum MZL associated with an aggressive clinical course and life-threatening complications likely due to transformation to DLBCL.","12":"Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) is a coinhibitory receptor that plays an essential role in maintaining immune system homeostasis by suppressing T-cell activation. We report a sporadic case of CTLA4 haploinsufficiency in a patient with Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and subsequent benign lymphadenopathy. A missense mutation in exon 2 of the CTLA4 gene (c.251T&gt;C, p.V84A) was found in the patient's peripheral blood and buccal cell DNA, but not in her parents' DNA. CTLA4 expression decreased in the peripheral regulatory T cells upon stimulation, whereas CTLA4 and PD-1-positive T cell subsets increased, possibly to compensate for the defective CTLA4 function. This case suggests that some adult lymphoma patients with no remarkable medical history have primary immune disorder. As immune-targeted therapies are now widely used for the treatment of malignancies, it is increasingly important to recognize the underlying primary immune disorders to properly manage the disease and avoid unexpected complications of immunotherapies.","13":null,"14":"We report a case of mantle cell lymphoma mimicking Castleman disease. A 76-year-old man presented with generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anemia, polyclonal gammopathy, and pulmonary infiltrations. Lymph node biopsy revealed histological features of hyaline vascular Castleman disease. Treatment with prednisolone induced lymphocytosis with immunophenotypic and genetic features of mantle cell lymphoma. A detailed immunohistochemical study of the lymph node demonstrated a mantle cell lymphoma-mantle zone growth pattern. Glucocorticoid-induced distribution lymphocytosis has not been reported in mantle cell lymphoma. Careful observation of circulating lymphocytes during steroid treatment may enable diagnosis of the underlying occult lymphoma in a subset of patients exhibiting clinical manifestations of Castleman disease.","15":"After a long period of endeavor, immunotherapy has become the mainstream of cancer therapies. This success is mostly ascribed to immune checkpoint blockade, chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cell therapies, and bispecific antibodies. However, these methods have been effective or applicable to only a limited proportion of patients so far. Thus, further development of broadly applicable and effective immunotherapies is eagerly anticipated. Given that innate immunity is key to the induction of robust adaptive immunity and that the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is a major hurdle to overcome, intratumoral immunotherapy in which delivery of immunostimulatory microbial agents to the tumor site triggers innate immunity in situ is a rational strategy. There has been a plethora of preclinical and clinical trials conducted involving the delivery of either mimetics of viral nucleic acids or oncolytic viruses intratumorally to trigger innate immunity via various nucleic acid sensors in the tumor site. Many of these have shown significant antitumor effects in mice, particularly in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. Oncolytic herpes simplex virus type 1 has been approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma in the United States and Europe and of glioblastoma in Japan. Whereas direct intratumoral administration has mainly been chosen as a delivery route, several promising compounds amenable to systemic administration have been developed. Intratumoral delivery of immunostimulatory agents will become an important option for cancer immunotherapy as an off-the-shelf, broadly applicable, and rational strategy that exploits the physiology of immunity, namely anti-microbial immunity.","16":null,"17":"","18":"We compared the two methods of assessing CD30 protein expression in DLBCL and TCL specimens routinely employed at our hospital, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry (FCM), using the same clone of the anti-CD30 antibody (Ber-H2) in 123 patients with DLBCL and 28 patients with TCL. FCM was more sensitive than IHC, especially in cases with low expression. In three cases of TCL and two cases of DLBCL, there was discordance between these two methods. Two of these TCL cases were ALCL and one was peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS, but ALCL was unable to be excluded. One of two cases of DLBCL was an anaplastic variant of DLBCL. The data suggested that CD30 was undetectable, though rare, by FMC in several cases. Based on this study, a combination of IHC and FCM is recommended for the reliable and quantitative detection of CD30.","19":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of malignant lymphoma with biologically and clinically heterogeneous features. Recently, the tumor microenvironment of this disease has been recognized as an important biological aspect of tumor development and therapeutic targets. Recurrent genetic alterations play significant roles in immune recognition of lymphoma cells. In particular, novel genetic alterations promoting phagocytosis were identified, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy targeting the \"don't eat me\" signal.","20":"The programmed cell death 1 (PD1)\/PD1 ligand (PD-L1) axis plays an important role in tumor cell escape from immune control and has been most extensively investigated for therapeutic purposes. However, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry is still not used widely for diagnosis. We review the diagnostic utility of PD-L1 (by clone SP142) immunohistochemistry in large-cell lymphomas, mainly consisting of classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Neoplastic PD-L1 (nPD-L1) expression on Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells is well-established among prototypic CHL. Of note, EBV+ CHL often poses a challenge for differential diagnosis from peripheral T-cell lymphoma with EBV+ non-malignant large B-cells; their distinction is based on the lack of PD-L1 expression on large B-cells in the latter. The nPD-L1 expression further provides a good diagnostic consensus for CHL with primary extranodal disease conceivably characterized by a combined pathogenesis of immune escape of tumor cells and immunodeficiency. Compared with CHL, the nPD-L1 expression rate is much lower in DLBCL, highlighting some specific subgroups of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, and EBV+ DLBCL. They consist of nPD-L1-positive and -negative subgroups, but their clinicopathological significance remains to be elucidated. Microenvironmental PD-L1 positivity on immune cells may be associated with a favorable prognosis in extranodal DLBCL. PD-L1 (by SP142) immunohistochemistry has helped us to understand the immune biology of lymphoid neoplasms possibly related by immune escape and\/or immunodeficiency. However, knowledge of these issues remains limited and should be clarified for diagnostic consensus in the future.","21":"Neoplastic programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, activated by PD-L1 gene alterations, is strongly associated with classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL). This association enabled a diagnostic consensus for lymphocyte-depleted CHL (LD-CHL), a previously enigmatic disease. We describe two patients with LD-CHL and primary extranodal disease. One patient was a 92-year-old female (Case #1) with a large mass that involved the uterus combined with swollen lymph nodes in the pelvic cavity. The second patient was a 76-year-old female (Case #2) with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) who initially exhibited massive bone marrow involvement without peripheral lymphadenopathies. Biopsies of these tumors from the cervix uteri and bone marrow, respectively, revealed lesions rich in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells and diminished populations of other cell populations. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that these H-RS cells expressed CD30, BOB1, and fascin, but not CD15, CD20, PAX5, or OCT2. They also expressed PD-L1, which led to our preferred diagnosis of LD-CHL in both patients. Epstein-Barr virus was associated with LD-CHL in Case #1, but not in Case #2. Both patients were deemed too frail for treatment. They died of disease at 1 (Case #1) and 15 months (Case #2) after the diagnosis. These findings highlight the abnormal biological behavior of this immune-escape-related lymphoid neoplasm in patients with immunodeficiency due to immune senescence and HTLV1 infection.","22":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (OIIA-LPD) are iatrogenic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD) that develop in association with immunosuppressive treatment in the setting of organ transplantation and autoimmune disease, respectively. Each has a spectrum of pathologies ranging from lymphoid hyperplasia to lymphoma. To clarify the characteristics of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subtype in a cohort of 25 patients with PTLD or OIIA-LPD from our institute, we selected 13 with a histological subtype of DLBCL, including 2 cases of PTLD and 11 of OIIA-LPD. The median patient age at diagnosis was 70 years, with a female predominance. Both PTLD cases developed after kidney transplant. Of the patients with OIIA-LPD, 10 had rheumatoid arthritis, 1 had mixed connective tissue disease, and 8 were treated using methotrexate. Both of the PTLD patients and 6 of the OIIA-LPD patients had extranodal manifestations. All patients except for one were classified as having the non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) subtype according to the Hans algorithm. Tissue samples from 8 patients were positive for CD30 and 8 were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA. Seven patients had MYC-positive tissue samples, but none had MYC translocation. Our study suggests that extranodal manifestations and the non-GCB subtype are common, that EBV is associated with the DLBCL subtype of PTLD and OIIA-LPD, and that anti-CD30 therapy is applicable. In addition, our patients with the DLBCL subtype of PTLD and OIIA-LPD exhibited MYC overexpression without MYC translocation, suggesting an alternative mechanism of MYC upregulation.","23":"We established an IL-2 and IL-4 (IL2\/4) - dependent adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) cell line (YG-PLL) by adding poly-L-lysine (PLL) to the culture medium. YG-PLL originates from lymphoma cells and contains a defective HTLV-I proviral genome. Although YG-PLL cannot survive without IL-2\/4, the follicular dendritic cell (FDC)-like cell line HK expressing OX40-ligand gene (OX40L+HK) inhibited their death in the presence of soluble neutral polymers. After the prevention of cell death, YG-PLL proliferated on OX40L+HK without IL2\/4 in the presence of two kinds of positively or negatively charged polymers. In particular, dermatan sulfate and poly-L-histidine supported growth for more than 4 months. Therefore, the original lymphoma cells proliferated transiently in the presence of IL2\/4, and their growth arrest was inhibited by the addition of PLL. Furthermore, YG-PLL lost IL2\/4 dependency by the following 3-step procedure: preculture with IL2\/4 and neutral polymers, 3-day culture with neutral polymer on OX40L+HK to inhibit cell death, and co-culture with OX40L+HK in the presence of the positively and negatively charged polymers. The extracellular environment made by soluble polymers plays a role in the growth of ATLL in vitro.","24":"It is widely accepted that the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the progression of lymphoid malignancies. Interaction between the tumor and its surrounding immune cells is considered a potential therapeutic target. For example, anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody stimulates the surrounding exhausted immune cells to release PD-1\/PD-L1, thereby leading to the regression of PD-L1-positive tumors. Recently, biological phenomena, such as trogocytosis and exosome-mediated transport were demonstrated to be involved in establishing and maintaining the tumor microenvironment. We found that trogocytosis-mediated PD-L1\/L2 transfer from tumor cells to monocytes\/macrophages is involved in immune dysfunction in classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Exosomes derived from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoma cells induce lymphoma tumorigenesis by transferring the EBV-coding microRNAs from the infected cells to macrophages. In this review, we summarized these biological phenomena based on our findings.","25":"The optimal combined chemotherapy regimen with rituximab has yet to be established for elderly patients with advanced-stage indolent B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL). A multicenter study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of R-THP-COP therapy in elderly patients (aged 70-79 years) with newly diagnosed advanced-stage indolent B-NHL using the complete response rate (%CR) as the primary endpoint. Patients with newly diagnosed, clinical stage III\/IV, indolent B-NHL, aged 70-79 years, with a performance status of 0-2 were eligible for this study. R-THP-COP consists of 375 mg\/m2 of rituximab, 50 mg\/m2 of pirarubicin, 750 mg\/m2 of cyclophosphamide, 1.4 mg\/m2 of vincristine, and 100 mg\/day of oral prednisolone for 5 days. This study was discontinued due to poor accrual after the enrollment of 18 patients, although the planned sample size was 40 patients. The numbers of patients with follicular lymphoma, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma were 16, 1, and 1, respectively. The median age was 73 (range, 70 to 79) years. The %CR including unconfirmed CR was 45% (95% confidence interval: 25-66%) and the overall response rate was 72%. The estimated 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 55% and 28%, respectively. The major toxicity observed was grade 4 neutropenia (94%). Grade 4 non-hematological toxicities were not observed and no patients developed grade 3\/4 cardiac toxicities. This phase II study provides useful information regarding the efficacy and toxicity of R-THP-COP therapy for patients aged 70 years or older with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage, indolent B-NHL, although the sample size was small.","26":"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive disorder accounting for &gt;30% of all lymphomas. Its prognosis is poor due to a high relapse rate. Spontaneous regression (SR) in DLBCL is rare, with only a few reported cases. Moreover, almost all of these were low-grade lymphomas with an average SR duration of 13 mo. As the cause of SR is unknown, there are many theories such as trauma, infection, medication, and an antitumor immune response. We present a patient with progressive DLBCL who demonstrated SR for &gt;42 mo. Although treatment for lymphoma usually starts soon after diagnosis, insights into SR of lymphomas may lead to new treatment strategies.","27":"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification as one type of extranodal large B-cell lymphoma and it is characterized by the selective growth of lymphoma cells within blood vessels with minimal extravascular invasion. According to the criteria, however, several reported cases of IVLBCL with significant extravascular invasion cannot be classified as IVLBCL. The purpose of the present study was to assess the clinicopathological significance of the WHO criteria for IVLBCL. We characterized clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical features of 11 patients with extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with significant intravascular invasion (DLBCL-IV), and statistically compared their features with those of 11 patients with IVLBCL and 15 patients with extranodal DLBCL with virtually no intravascular invasion (DLBCL-noIV). When compared with the DLBCL-noIV group, the DLBCL-IV group was characterized by significantly higher rates of splenomegaly, hemophagocytosis, advanced stage disease, and CD5 expression; higher average platelet count, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and serum ferritin level. Progression-free survival was significantly shorter in the DLBCL-IV group than the DLBCL-noIV group. In contrast, there were no significant differences in clinicopathological features between the DLBCL-IV and the IVLBCL groups. Our study suggests that DLBCL-IV should be regarded as IVLBCL-related.","28":null,"29":"There are limited real-world data on the treatment practices and healthcare resource utilization associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in Japan. In this study (CLIMBER-DBR), we performed retrospective analyses of the Japanese Medical Data Vision database, and extracted data for 2562 patients with newly diagnosed CLL (CLL-1 cohort) and 930 patients receiving CLL treatment (CLL-2 cohort) registered between March 1, 2013 and February 28, 2018. The median follow-up in the CLL-1 cohort was 721 (quartile 1-3: 363-1267) days and the median time to initial (first-line) treatment was 1331 (quartile 1-3: 189-not reached) days. In the CLL-2 cohort, the most frequently used regimens were fludarabine alone (17.7%), cyclophosphamide alone (13.7%), and bendamustine\/rituximab (8.2%). The median (quartile 1-3) times to second-line and third-line treatments were 1066 (273-not reached) and 1795 (631-not reached) days, respectively. The CLIMBER-DBR was the first database research study to assess current treatment practices for CLL in Japan, where the treatment patterns were driven by the approval\/reimbursement status of drugs in the study period. Our study provides an important benchmark for future studies of CLL in Japan.","30":"Thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, reticulin fibrosis\/renal failure, and organomegaly comprise TAFRO syndrome, which was proposed as a distinct clinical entity from iMCD without TAFRO syndrome (iMCD-NOS) due to its aggressive clinical course, refractoriness to corticosteroids, presence of thrombocytopenia, increased level of alkaline phosphatase, and normal level of gammaglobulin. However, diagnosing TAFRO syndrome in its early stages is challenging because it is rare and its diagnostic criteria are complicated. We describe a patient with TAFRO syndrome and adrenal hemorrhage who demonstrated a rapid decline in her clinical condition and did not respond to steroid pulse therapy, resulting in a fatal outcome. In the early stage of her clinical course, she developed unilateral adrenal hemorrhage with mild thrombocytopenia and normal clotting times, suggesting adrenal hemorrhage as a unique manifestation of TAFRO syndrome. In general, patients with TAFRO syndrome exhibit a more aggressive clinical course and poorer outcome than those with iMCD-NOS. To ameliorate this poor prognosis, it is important to diagnose the disease early and immediately start powerful immunosuppressive agents such as tocilizumab. Based on this case, adrenal hemorrhage may suggest TAFRO syndrome, and facilitate the rapid diagnosis of this complicated and rare disease.","31":null,"32":null,"33":"Lymphoma-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) has a significantly poor prognosis among secondary HLH. We describe the rare case of a 74-year-old female with secondary HLH presenting with a rapidly fatal course. Post-mortem examination revealed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We were unable to make a definite antemortem diagnosis because the patient did not exhibit lymphadenopathy and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated hemophagocytosis without evidence of lymphoma. She died of multiple organ failure on the twelfth day of hospitalization despite a temporary response to steroids. Autopsy revealed diffuse lymphoma cell infiltration of the bone marrow, liver and spleen, suggesting \"bone marrow-liver-spleen\" (BLS)-type large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). BLS-type LBCL is a rare and clinically aggressive lymphoma, usually associated with fever, cytopenia and HLH. The disease has a high mortality rate due to the delay in diagnosis and a highly aggressive clinical course. Further studies are required to improve our understanding of this rare extranodal DLBCL.","34":"Acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP) is a rare acute lung injury featuring pathological intra-alveolar fibrin balls and organizing pneumonia without hyaline membranes or eosinophils. AFOP forms acute and subacute patterns; the former often has a poor prognosis, whereas the latter has better survival. Secondary hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a cytokine-related and potentially lethal disorder induced by various diseases, and pulmonary involvement in HPS is not rare. However, to our knowledge, no report has addressed the association between secondary HPS and AFOP development. We report two cases of subacute AFOP following HPS in hematological malignancies.","35":"For this study, we investigated comprehensive expression of conjoined genes (CGs) in non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (B-NHL) cell line KPUM-UH1 by using paired-end RNA sequencing. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of these transcripts in an additional 21 cell lines, 37 primary samples of various malignancies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four normal individuals. Seventeen CGs were detected in KPUM-UH1: CTBS-GNG5, SRP9-EPHX1, RMND5A-ANAPC, OTX1-EHBP1, ATF2-CHN1, PRKAA1-TTC33, LARP1-MRPL22, LOC105379697-BAK1, TIAM2-SCAF8, SPAG1-VPS13B, WBP1L-CNNM2, NARS2-GAB2, CTSC-RAB38, VAMP1-CD27-AS1, LRRC37A2-NSF, UBA2-WTIP and ZNF600-ZNF611. To our knowledge, 10 of these genes have not been previously reported. The various characteristics of the CGs included in- and out-of-frame fusions, chimeras involving non-coding RNA and transcript variants. A finding of note was that LARP1-MRPL2 was characterized as in-frame fusion and was recurrently expressed in B-NHL samples. In this study, variety of CGs was expressed both in malignant and normal cells, some of which might be specific to lymphoma.","36":"The clinical characteristics of B-cell lymphoma (BCL) were studied through the combined analysis of six clinical trials conducted by the Japan Clinical Oncology Group - Lymphoma Study Group (JCOG-LSG) for aggressive lymphoma in the 1990s, before the introduction of rituximab. Through a central pathological review, 829 patients were diagnosed with BCL according to the World Health Organization classification and treated with doxorubicin-containing combination chemotherapies. Of these patients, 642, 104, 30, and 24 patients were diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), respectively. The overall survival (OS) of FL and MZL patients was higher than that of patients with DLBCL and MCL. The OS of the MCL patients was higher than that of DLBCL patients in the first 5 years, but MCL had the lowest survival after 5 years. The OS of DLBCL patients was clearly stratified by the international prognostic index and showed data compatible with that of aggressive lymphoma in the pre-rituximab era. These results established the clinical aspects of BCL in a large number of patients treated in prospective studies during the pre-rituximab era in Japan.","37":"The diagnostic criteria for IgG4-related disease were previously published and serum IgG4 measurement has been reimbursed by national health insurance in Japan since 2012. Eight patients diagnosed with IgG4-related disease based on lacrimal gland masses were retrospectively reviewed. The 8 patients were 3 men and 5 women ranging in age from 52 to 77 (median, 63) years at the initial visit and their follow-up period ranged from 0.25 to 11 (median, 7) years. Bilateral and unilateral involvement were noted in 4 patients each; 2 on the right side and 2 on the left side in those with unilateral involvement. Serum IgG4 was high in 5 of 8 patients at the initial visit. Five patients with no systemic signs were followed without treatment, whereas oral steroids were administered and tapered in the other 3 patients who exhibited systemic signs. One patient with a history of radiation for MALT lymphoma in bilateral lacrimal glands developed IgG4-related disease in the left lacrimal gland 10 years later and was followed without treatment. Nine years later, her serum IgG4 level increased to 1500 mg\/dL and paracardiac lesions, found on positron emission tomography, were confirmed to be MALT lymphoma by needle biopsy, leading to systemic chemotherapy. The other 7 patients had neither local recurrence nor additional systemic signs. Serum IgG4 monitoring may be useful to detect systemic complications in IgG4-related ophthalmic disease and markedly high serum IgG4 levels may indicate new lymphoma at other sites.","38":"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS) includes various diseases. Attempts have been made to identify distinct properties of disease within the PTCL, NOS classification and evaluate their significance to prognosis. Comprehensive gene expression analysis and evaluation of genomic abnormalities have successfully identified specific diseases from heterogeneous PTCL, NOS cases. For example, cases with properties of T follicular helper cells have been identified and classified as an entity resembling angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), based on both immunohistochemistry and genomic features. Here, we focus on the molecular pathology of PTCL, NOS and discuss recent changes relevant to its classification.","39":null,"40":null,"41":"Femoral marrow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive, non-irradiated and useful modality for evaluating bone marrow (BM) conditions. Human adult femoral BM is almost uniformly fatty marrow and has the largest volume of a single bone. MRI has an extremely high resolution for fat and water, which allows high-contrast imaging of cellular infiltration into fat tissue. In hematological diseases, femoral BM MRI can clearly detect cell infiltration, which is symmetrically imaged from the proximal to the distal direction of abnormal signal areas. Thus, we investigated the significance of femoral MRI for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We analyzed the data of 69 NHL patients who received femoral MRI at diagnosis in this single-center retrospective cohort study. The median patient age was 73 years. MRI patterns were mainly classified as uniform patterns or nonuniform patterns. We also classified the range of cellular marrow as high-grade or low-grade based on whether it had spread to over half of the femur. Both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were significantly influenced by abnormal femoral marrow MRI. In particular, the patients with cellular femoral marrow lesions had a worse OS and PFS based on log-rank tests. Multivariable analyses with the Cox proportional hazards model revealed that OS and PFS were significantly influenced by cellular marrow diagnosed by femoral MRI. We concluded that femoral marrow MRI is a useful tool for detecting BM involvement and an independent prognostic factor in NHL patients.","42":null,"43":"High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and\/or BCL6 rearrangements, also known as double-hit lymphoma, has been reported as refractory to R-CHOP therapy and requires more intensive regimens. However, intensive and safe regimens for patients with renal dysfunction are unknown. Herein, we report the successful use of DA-EPOCH-R therapy for double-hit lymphoma in a 64-year-old man with renal dysfunction. The patient had lymphoma-induced bilateral ureteral obstruction. Although renal dysfunction remained after removing the obstruction using R-CHOP therapy, we completed six cycles of DA-EPOCH-R therapy without any major adverse events. DA-EPOCH-R therapy may be a safe regimen for renal dysfunction patients.","44":null,"45":null,"46":"Tumor flare reaction (TFR) is a unique immune-mediated tumor recognition phenomenon presenting as rapid enlargement of the tumor, which mimics disease progression, developing in the early stage of treatment using immunomodulatory drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors. A 59-year-old man with follicular lymphoma had residual tumor burden in the left hilar lymph nodes after R-CHOP therapy, and received lenalidomide and rituximab (R2) therapy. He developed respiratory distress on day 11 of R2 therapy. Chest X-ray and CT demonstrated left lung atelectasis due to left hilar lymph node swelling. We performed transbronchial lung biopsy on day 20 of R2 therapy. The biopsied left bronchus tissue exhibited extensive necrosis, which had a B-cell phenotype consistent with that of follicular lymphoma. Neither NK cells nor cytotoxic T cells were detected. It was unclear whether the immune effector cells disappeared at the time of transbronchial lung biopsy. Atelectasis in our patient improved by continuing R2 therapy beyond TFR.","47":"","48":"","49":"Some patients diagnosed with methotrexate-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) develop spontaneous regression upon the discontinuation of MTX, whereas others require chemotherapy. The mechanisms underlying this differential response and the capacity to spontaneously regress are not clearly understood. We evaluated numerous clinicopathological features in 63 patients diagnosed with MTX-LPD, with a special focus on those with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive mucocutaneous lesions (EBVMCL). The diagnosis of EBVMCL included cases of both EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCU) and diffuse gingival swelling associated with proliferation of EBV-positive large B-cells. Of the four subgroups of MTX-LPD, one-year treatment-free survival (TFS) after the discontinuation of MTX was achieved among those with EBVMCL (100%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (57%), Hodgkin-like lesions (60%), or classical Hodgkin lymphoma (29%); a significant difference in TFS was observed when comparing the responses of patients with EBVMCL to the those diagnosed with other subtypes. Multivariate analysis revealed predictive factors for prolonged TFS that included EBV-positive lesions and comparatively low levels of serum LDH. Taken together, our study suggests that a diagnosis of EBVMCL is related to the overall clinical outcome after the discontinuation of MTX.","50":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia in Western countries and is characterized by the clonal expansion of mature CD5+ B cells. There have been substantial advances in the field of CLL research in the last decade, including the identification of recurrent mutations, and clarification of clonal architectures, signaling molecules, and the multistep leukemogenic process, providing a comprehensive understanding of CLL pathogenesis. Furthermore, the development of therapeutic approaches, especially that of molecular target therapies against CLL, has markedly improved the standard of care for CLL. This review focuses on the recent insights made in CLL leukemogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","51":"Treatment outcomes of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have improved since chemoimmunotherapy and novel drugs became available for CLL treatment; therefore, more sensitive methods to evaluate residual CLL cells in patients are required. Measurable residual disease (MRD) has been assessed in several clinical trials on CLL using flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) with allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) primers, and high-throughput sequencing. MRD assessment is useful to predict the treatment outcomes in the context of chemotherapy and treatment with novel drugs such as venetoclax. In this review, we discuss major techniques for MRD assessment, data from relevant clinical trials, and the future of MRD assessment in CLL treatment.","52":"Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a non-Langerhans form of histiocytosis that occurs in systemic organs, such as bone, the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, lungs, and kidneys. We report the case of a 68-year-old woman with a cranial pharyngeal tumor and a bone lesion in the tibia. The case was diagnosed as ECD. Pathological analysis showed the typical feature of foamy macrophage accumulation. The macrophages were positive for CD68, and negative for CD1a and S100. The BRAF V600E mutation was identified. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed for the detailed characterization of the macrophages. The macrophages had low proliferative activity and an M2-like phenotype, and they expressed colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) on the cell surface.","53":"In situ mantle cell neoplasia (isMCN) and leukemic non-nodal mantle cell lymphoma (nnMCL) are classified as an indolent subtype of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The tumor cells of isMCN are restricted to the inner layer of the lymphoid tissue mantle zone, exhibiting an in situ pattern histologically. On the other hand, nnMCL is distributed in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and sometimes the spleen, but lymphadenopathy or systemic organ involvement is rare. We report a case of isMCN in a submandibular lymph node resected from a 65-year-old Japanese male. The tumor cells were positive for cyclin D1 (CCND1) and SOX11 expression, and were restricted to the mantle zone area of the lymph node. However, tumor cells were also detected in the stomach mucosa, bone marrow tissue and peripheral blood, suggesting nnMCL. isMCN and nnMCL may have a partly overlapping disease spectrum, although the correlation between these two subtypes has not been well described. This present case demonstrated characteristics overlapping between isMCN and nnMCL.","54":"MYC is a transcriptional factor that regulates growth and proliferation through cell cycle pathways. MYC alterations, in particular MYC rearrangements, are important in assessing the prognosis of aggressive B-cell lymphoma. In this study, we focused on the impact of nine major cell cycle genes for MYC-driven aggressive mature B-cell lymphoma and analyzed the mutational status using targeted next generation sequencing. Our 40 cases of aggressive mature B-cell lymphomas included 5 Burkitt lymphomas, 17 high-grade B-cell lymphomas and 18 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas with MYC breaks in 100%, 88% and 11%, respectively. Our data allowed a molecular classification into four categories partially independent from the histopathological diagnosis but correlating with the Ki-67 labelling index: (I) harboring TP53 and CDKN2A mutations, being highly proliferative, (II) with MYC rearrangement associated with MYC and\/or ID3 mutations, being highly proliferative, (III) with MYC rearrangement combined with additional molecular changes, being highly proliferative, and (IV) with a diverse pattern of molecular alterations, being less proliferative. Taken together, we found that mutations of TP53, CDKN2A, MYC and ID3 are associated with highly proliferative B-cell lymphomas that could profit from novel therapeutic strategies.","55":"","56":"We report an autopsy case of acute myocarditis, in which the mediastinal lymph nodes exhibited unique findings. A 15-year-old Japanese boy was diagnosed with the secondary onset of acute myocarditis. No viruses were identified. Autopsy confirmed acute lymphocytic myocarditis. Lymphadenopathy was observed, especially in pulmonary hilar\/mediastinal areas. Microscopically, interfollicular areas were uniformly filled with medium-sized, round cells that resembled lymphocytes. They were immunohistochemically CD3- CD5- CD19+ CD20- CD79a- Pax-5- CD138+ MUM1+ LMP1- EBNA2- cytoplasmic IgG+ IgA- and IgM-. No monotypia was observed for kappa and lambda light chains, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction analyses of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region diversity demonstrated oligoclonal peaks, suggesting reactive change. IgG+ or VS38c+ cells frequently co-expressed Ki-67 (up to 80%). We considered these cells abundantly present in lymph nodes to be reactive plasmablasts because they were early plasma cells with proliferative activity.","57":"The relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) usually involves the bone marrow, with the central nervous system being the most frequent extramedullary site. The relapse of ALL in the female genital organs, particularly the uterus, is markedly rare. We report such a patient who developed relapse in the bone marrow and uterus. The uterine lesion, which presented as abnormal uterine bleeding, consisted of a mass on MRI and proliferation of ALL cells on histology. MRI revealed a heterogeneous high-intensity mass (T2-WI\/D-WI) with a diameter of 6.8 cm, a notable decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and mild enhancement by contrast enhancement study. Histological findings of the uterine cervix demonstrated the infiltration of ALL. The patient achieved remission by allogeneic haplo-identical hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, but died of complications of the transplantation. This case suggested that attention should be paid to the uterus as a site of extramedullary relapse. In addition, abnormal uterine bleeding, which is a common sign of hormonal imbalance and hormone replacement therapy after chemotherapy, may be an initial sign of extramedullary recurrence. To confirm uterine relapse as an intractable disease, the accumulation of more cases is required.","58":"Although some patients with COVID-19 develop only mild symptoms, fatal complications have been observed among those with comorbidities. As patients with cancer are immunocompromised, they are thought to have a high risk of severe illness associated with COVID-19. We report a COVID-19 patient with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) who was treated using favipiravir. A 69-year-old woman with lymphoma-type ATL was treated using cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone and mogamulizumab (M-CHOP) with substantial efficacy. However, in cycle 4 of M-CHOP therapy, she developed fever with mild cough. The patient was admitted to the hospital and CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Considering severe immunosuppression caused by ATL, we initiated favipiravir therapy. Subsequently, the fever improved without antipyretics and her C-reactive protein level decreased rapidly. SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative on days 17 and 18 of favipiravir therapy, and the patient was discharged without residual disease on the final CT. This is the first documented case of COVID-19 in a patient with ATL. Although severe immunosuppression caused by ATL was present, severe COVID-19 pneumonia did not develop. The immunosuppressed condition caused by hematological malignancy may not always be a risk factor for severe illness associated with COVID-19. Further accumulation of data regarding COVID-19 in patients with hematological malignancies is warranted to clarify the risk factors for severe illness, the best-in-class antiviral agent, and the optimal treatment strategy in this population.","59":null,"60":"The safety and feasibility of oral fluoroquinolone monotherapy in patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN) were demonstrated in recent studies. Levofloxacin (LVFX) is a commonly prescribed antibiotic; however, evidence for its efficacy against FN is limited. Therefore, in this study, we retrospectively investigated the efficacy of LVFX against low-risk FN in patients with malignant lymphoma at our institution. Treatment success was defined as recovery from fever and neutropenia without alteration of the initial regimen. We recruited 29 patients between January 2013 and December 2018. The median age of the cohort was 64 (range: 21-87) years; 13 (44.8%) were aged over 65 years. In total, 22 patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Therapy was successful in 24 (82.8%) patients, whereas 5 had treatment failure requiring a change from LVFX to intravenous broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. No deaths related to FN were observed. Two patients required FN-related chemotherapy dose reduction in subsequent cycles. Although this cohort comprised many elderly patients, our study confirmed the efficacy of LVFX in patients with low-risk FN. This may improve the treatment of low-risk FN and malignant lymphoma.","61":"A 47-year-old male with macroglossia presented with dyspnea on effort and chest pain at rest. Cardiac MRI revealed diffuse global subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement below the left ventricular endocardium and a dark blood pool of intracardiac contrast medium. Tongue biopsy revealed amyloid deposition, which was limited in the myocardium. He was diagnosed with primary light chain amyloidosis. His condition was stage I according to the Mayo Clinic staging system. He underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. On Day 10, he developed chest pain and died suddenly on Day 11. Postmortem examination revealed amyloid deposition throughout the heart.","62":"","63":"Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) is a lymphoid neoplasia characterized by the presence of large tumor cells, referred to as Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, originating from B-cells in an inflammatory background. As the clinical significance of B-cell markers has yet to be fully elucidated, this study aimed to clarify the clinicopathological significance of CD79a in 55 patients with CHL. They were immunohistochemically divided into two groups, comprising of 20 CD79a-positive and 35 CD79a-negative patients. There was no significant correlation between CD79a and CD20 expression (rs = 0.125, P = 0.362). CD79a-positive patients were significantly older at onset (P = 0.011). There was no significant correlation between CD79a-positivity and clinical stage (P = 0.203), mediastinal involvement (P = 0.399), extranodal involvement (P = 0.749), or laboratory findings, including serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (P = 1) and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (P = 0.251). There were significant differences in overall survival (OS) (P = 0.005) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.007) between CD79a-positive and CD79a-negative patients (5-year OS: 64.6% and 90.5%; 5-year PFS: 44.0% and 76.6%, respectively). Five patients in whom the majority (&gt; 80%) of HRS cells expressed CD79a consisted of 4 males and 1 female aged between 52 and 81 years; 4 of them were in a limited clinical stage. We concluded that CD79a-positive CHL may have unique clinicopathological features.","64":"","65":"Nodal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma (CTL) is a primary nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) characterized by a cytotoxic phenotype and EBV on the tumor cells. This disease reportedly accounts for 21% of PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS). However, few nodal EBV+ lymphomas have been documented in detail. Nodal EBV+ CTL and nasal-type NK\/T-cell lymphoma (NKTL) both exhibit cytotoxic molecule expression and EBV positivity on the tumor cells; however, nodal EBV+ CTL is characterized as a systemic disease without nasopharyngeal involvement, and exhibits a CD8+\/CD56- phenotype distinct from NKTL. The clinicopathological uniqueness of nodal EBV+ CTL is further supported by its T-cell origin in most reported cases. In the 2008 WHO classification, it was unclear whether nodal EBV+ CTL should be classified as PTCL or NKTL. However, based on additional data, the 2017 revision classifies nodal EBV+ CTL as PTCL. In the present review, we focus on the clinicopathological characteristics of nodal EBV+ CTL, discuss the relationship between chronic active EBV infection and nodal EBV+ lymphoma, and highlight future perspectives regarding the treatment of this disease.","66":"","67":null,"68":"Treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is becoming more individualized due to the recent introduction of novel molecularly targeted therapies into the therapeutic armamentarium. Genomic and molecular risk factors in CLL patients determine the individual risk for disease progression and response to therapy, and can impact survival. In this review article, we discuss current treatment strategies for CLL patients in Japan, where the novel targeted agents, the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib and BCL2 antagonist venetoclax, now are available and increasingly used in clinical practice. We also discuss the importance of CLL risk factors for making therapy decisions, focusing on immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutation status, 11q deletion, and 17p deletion. Treatment approaches for CLL have rapidly changed in the past few years because of these new targeted agents. They are highly effective, well tolerated, and have been demonstrated in a series of large randomized clinical trials to improve survival when compared with conventional chemotherapy-based treatment. Therefore, for most patients, especially high-risk CLL patients, BTK inhibitor and BCL2 antagonist therapies are preferred over chemo-immunotherapy. Currently ongoing studies seek to determine the best sequence for these new agents and whether a combination therapy approach is beneficial. With these developments, a new era of chemotherapy-free treatment for CLL patients is expected.","69":null,"70":null,"71":"Methotrexate, hydrocortisone, vincristine, sobuzoxane, and etoposide (MTX-HOPE) chemotherapy was originally reported in 2007 as a salvage regimen for relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To clarify the safety and efficacy of this regimen, we retrospectively analyzed patients at our institute. We analyzed 18 patients, including 16 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), one with follicular lymphoma (FL), and one with T-cell lymphoma. The median age at MTX-HOPE therapy was 79 (range: 68-87). Ten patients received more than 3 previous chemotherapy regimens. The median period from the initial treatment to the first MTX-HOPE administration was 53 months. No patient had severe renal dysfunction. The overall response rate was 78%, with 39% achieving CR and 39% achieving PR. The median OS and PFS after the initiation of MTX-HOPE were 10 months (range: 0.5-86 months) and 7 months (range: 0.2-86 months), respectively. The one-year OS rate was 44% and the two-year OS rate was 22%. The median number of treatment cycles was 7 (range: 1-46), and 6 patients received more than 10 cycles. Among eight patients who were over 80 years of age, 7 responded to the therapy, and the median OS and PFS of this subgroup were 19 months and 11 months, respectively. All patients tolerated the treatment well, mostly on an outpatient basis, except for one who died from infection and one who developed intracranial hemorrhage. MTX-HOPE may be a promising treatment option for elderly patients with refractory or relapsed malignant lymphoma.","72":"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL\/SLL) accounts for approximately 1% of all lymphomas in our department. In this article, we describe the differential diagnosis of CLL\/SLL from other indolent lymphomas, with special reference to follicular lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma, although the latter is considered to be aggressive. CLL\/SLL often exhibits proliferation centers, similar to follicular lymphoma. Immunohistological examination can easily distinguish these two lymphomas. The most important characteristic of CLL\/SLL is CD5 and CD23 positivity. Mantle cell lymphoma is also CD5-positive and there are some CD23-positive cases. Such cases should be carefully distinguished from CLL\/SLL. Some marginal zone lymphomas are also positive for CD5 and such cases are often disseminated. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma should also be a differential diagnosis for CLL\/SLL. It frequently demonstrates MYD88 L265P, which is a key differential finding. By immunohistological examination, the expression of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 is specific for CLL\/SLL and can be a good marker in the differential diagnosis.","73":"Successful treatment of indolent T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (ITLPDGI) by chemotherapy is rare and watchful waiting is often performed for asymptomatic patients. We report a case of ITLPDGI successfully treated by involved field radiotherapy (IFRT). The patient presented with slow ITLPDGI localised to the stomach with mild symptoms. IFRT (30 Gy\/20f) was administered, after which endoscopy revealed resolution of lesions and blood vessel appearance, and absence of proliferating abnormal lymphocytes was confirmed by biopsy. The patient remains lymphoma-free 1 year post-treatment. Although long-term follow-up and additional cases are essential for the evaluation of IFRT as a treatment option for localised ITLPDGL, complete remission after relatively low-dose IFRT is promising, particularly as this has been rarely achieved by chemotherapy.","74":"","75":"","76":"","77":"Other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders induced by immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate (MTX-LPD), exhibit numerous pathological findings. We report the case of an 81-year-old Japanese woman diagnosed with MTX-LPD exhibiting two distinct pathological features from two different sites. Excisional biopsy of the left cervical lymph node revealed EBV-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and biopsy of a pharyngeal ulcer revealed EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer. She was treated using an R-CHOP regimen and maintained complete remission for years. This case demonstrates the heterogeneous pathology of MTX-LPD and suggests the necessity of multiple biopsy.","78":null,"79":"","80":null,"81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":"As opportunistic infections among human T-lymphotrophic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) carriers and patients with adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATL) pose a serious problem, it is necessary to clarify their clinical characteristics and outcomes in these patients. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of opportunistic infections in 127 HTLV-1 carriers and 153 ATL patients between 2006 and 2016. The cumulative incidence rates of opportunistic infections among HTLV-1 carriers and ATL patients were 1.5% (2\/127) and 6.5% (10\/153), respectively. The etiology of opportunistic infections was as follows: fungal infections (3 cases), pneumocystis pneumonia, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Even after aggressive treatment, the prognosis of opportunistic infections was poor (50% of overall survival at 28 days). Regarding prognostic factors affecting the OS of opportunistic infections, higher SOFA scores (especially the respiratory subscore) and higher LDH values were identified by univariate analysis. Moreover, 3 out of 6 patients achieved spontaneous remission of ATL as the short-term outcome after the development of opportunistic infection. However, 5 out of 6 surviving patients exhibited ATL progression or relapse after a median of 194 days (133-226) after contracting an opportunistic infection as the long-term outcome of ATL. In conclusion, opportunistic infections should be carefully followed among HTLV-1 carriers and ATL patients because of their aggressive clinical course and poor outcomes. Furthermore, early diagnosis and subsequent prompt treatment are necessary in clinical practice.","85":"Methotrexate (MTX) is known as a first-line synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although the risk of LPD development increases by RA inflammation itself, observation of spontaneous regression of LPD after MTX discontinuation lead to the theory of lymphomagenic role of MTX. In this review, we focused on the several immune response involved in LPD that developed under MTX administration in RA patients.","86":"","87":"Castleman disease is a polyclonal lymphoproliferative disease which is clinically classified into unicentric (UCD) and multicentric (MCD). TAFRO syndrome is a relatively new concept that partly overlaps with MCD. Due to their rarity, their incidence remains unknown. This study investigated the incidence and prevalence of UCD, MCD, and TAFRO syndrome in Japan using a fixed-point observation method based on their incidence in Ishikawa prefecture. The annual incidences of MCD, UCD, and TAFRO syndrome in Japan were 309-731, 71-542, and 110-502, respectively, yielding annual incidence rates per million individuals of 2.4-5.8, 0.6-4.3, and 0.9-4.9, respectively, and nationwide prevalence of 4,180-14,900, 1,350-10,300, and 860-7,240, respectively. In conclusion, MCD, UCD and TAFRO syndrome may not be as rare as previously estimated in Japan.","88":"Primary intraocular lymphomas frequently develop into central nervous system lymphomas and vice versa. This study reviewed 22 consecutive patients with primary intraocular lymphoma diagnosed by immunostaining of vitrectomy cell blocks, and examined whether they developed central nervous system lymphoma. Seventeen patients developed central nervous system lymphoma: 3 patients developed intraocular and central nervous system lymphoma simultaneously, 9 patients developed central nervous system lymphoma 1 month to 5 years (median, 3 months) after intraocular lymphoma, and 5 patients developed central nervous system lymphoma preceding the diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma by 3 months to 9 years and 8 months (median, 1.5 years). In contrast, 5 patients did not develop central nervous system lymphoma: 2 patients did not develop local recurrence or central nervous system lymphoma in the follow-up period of 5 years and 11 years, respectively, after vitrectomy alone without additional local or systemic treatment. The remaining 3 patients with intraocular lymphoma had insufficient follow-up periods to determine the prognosis. The results of CD5 immunostaining of vitrectomy specimens were found in pathology reports of 8 patients: 3 patients with CD5-positive large cells and 4 patients with CD5-negative large cells developed central nervous system lymphoma. In summary, only a small number of patients did not develop central nervous system lymphoma based on long-term follow-up after vitrectomy alone. CD5 was not a marker of central nervous system involvement in this study population.","89":null,"90":"We examined 13 patients with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) diagnosed between 2007 and 2018 at a single center in a metropolitan area non-endemic for human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-1). The median age of the patients (eight male, five female) was 65 years (range, 48-83). The time from onset of symptoms to referral to our center was relatively short (median, 2 months; range, 1-9 months). Upon referral, all patients were suspected to have lymphoma, five were examined for soluble IL-2 receptor and two were examined for anti-HTLV-1 antibody. In ten of the 13 (77%), the patient themselves or their relatives were born in Kyushu. The birth places of the remaining three patients were unknown. Three patients (23%) had family histories of lymphoma. They all exhibited aggressive ATL (five acute, eight lymphoma type); however, the disease status was generally stable, with relatively stable performance status and low scores for prognostic indices. After combination chemotherapy, eight (62%) achieved remission. However, long-term remission was achieved in only one patient with localized lymphoma-type ATL and one young patient after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In conclusion, at a center in a metropolitan and HTLV-1 non-endemic area in Japan, patients with ATL were relatively young and mainly presented with aggressive subtypes. At initial referral to our center, all 13 patients were suspected of having lymphoma but only two of having ATL. For centers in similar areas of Japan, prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of ATL patients will become increasingly necessary following the recent migration of HTLV-1 carriers to non-endemic areas.","91":"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare type of extranodal large B-cell lymphoma, and initial or predominant presentation in the lungs is uncommon. The synchronous occurrence of IVLBCL and malignant tumors is less frequent, and no such reports have described pulmonary presentations. We report a rare case of pulmonary IVLBCL accompanying lung cancer and interstitial lesions. A 73-year-old man with a history of pneumonia underwent a follow-up examination. Computed tomography revealed diffuse, bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGO) with a partial solid mass. Histologically, the mass consisted of adenocarcinoma. However, two other types of interstitial lesions were scattered throughout the resected lung: 1) peribronchovascular thickening with the aggregation of macrophages and anthracosis, and 2) alveolar septal thickening in the centrilobular area with atypical CD20-positive large cells in the capillaries. These two types of lesions were not mixed. Computed tomography and positron emission tomography demonstrated no other organ involvement. The patient was considered to have the synchronous occurrence of pulmonary IVLBCL and lung cancer (adenocarcinoma). After R-CHOP therapy, GGO on CT disappeared. Lung cancer often accompanies benign background lesions, and the combination of these lesions with lung cancer may make it difficult to detect the presence of pulmonary IVLBCL. However, the histological distribution pattern of IVLBCL may be a clue to the correct diagnosis.","92":"t(14;20)(q32;q11)\/IGH-MAFB is a rare chromosomal abnormality in plasma cell myeloma (PCM), accounting for 1-2% of PCM cases. Patients with this translocation may have a poor prognosis. However, the clinicopathological features and response to novel agents have not been well clarified. We present a 63-year-old Japanese female with PCM positive for t(14;20). The tumor responded well to a proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, and the patient achieved complete remission. Six months after remission, tumor relapse was noted in the left cerebellum and the right frontal lobe of the cerebrum. After whole brain radiation therapy, the tumor masses decreased in size. The patient was followed up with best-care support, but died of the disease 29 months after the initial PCM diagnosis. t(14;20)-positive PCM responded well to bortezomib at the time of the initial treatment. The CNS tumor involvement, which is rare in PCM, may be associated with the clinical aggressiveness of the t(14;20)-positive form of this myeloma.","93":"Hodgkin-like adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) is a rare variant of ATLL, which represents the early neoplastic phase of ATLL that follows an indolent clinical course compared with typical ATLL. Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy\/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM\/TSP) is a neurological disorder characterized by the paralysis of lower limbs and urinary disturbance. Although these diseases are caused by HTLV-1 infection, there are no reports describing the coexistence of Hodgkin-like ATLL and HAM\/TSP. Here, we report the first case of Hodgkin-like ATLL complicated by HAM\/TSP. The patient was a 56-year-old man with right inguinal lymphadenopathy who had been using the neurology outpatient service for 13 years after being diagnosed with HAM\/TSP. He was unable to receive intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation due to a poor performance status, but his condition was stable for approximately two years.","94":null,"95":null,"96":"The present study investigated histological subtypes of lymphoma in patients newly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma in the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) endemic area of Japan, and further analyzed the clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes of patients with primary sinonasal lymphoma. We retrospectively examined 151 patients aged 18-90 years in Fukuoka, Japan. Subtypes of lymphoma were determined according to the WHO classification. Among the 151 patients, 104 were diagnosed with malignant lymphoma, including 96 at the time of initial diagnosis. Ninety-two of the 96 lymphomas (96%) were non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Mature B-cell neoplasms comprised 78% (n = 75). Primary lymphoma of the sinonasal cavity was found in six patients (6%). The histological subtype of sinonasal lymphoma was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in all six tumors. Furthermore, overall survival was significantly different among three distinct DLBCL patient groups, including primary sinonasal lymphoma patients (p = 0.0016; 3-year overall survival: sinonasal DLBCL group, 53%; DLBCL of the CNS group, 0%; other DLBCL group, 83%).

Several factors, including autoimmune disease (AID) activity, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, ISD usage, and aging, influence the development of OIIA-LPD, resulting in complicated clinical courses and outcomes. Most OIIA-LPD develops in patients with rheumatoid arthritis using methotrexate (MTX-LPD). The management of MTX-LPD is based on the clinical course, i.e., with\/without regression, with\/without relapse\/regrowth event (RRE), LPD subtype, and ISDs for AIDs after LPD development. There are three clinical courses after ISD withdrawal: regressive LPD without relapse\/regrowth (R-G), regressive LPD with RRE (R\/R-G), and persistent LPD (P-G). The majority of EBV+ diffuse large B-cell lymphomas are classified in R-G, whereas classic Hodgkin lymphoma is generally classified in R\/R-G. Polymorphic LPD (P-LPD) in MTX-LPD develops with heterogeneous pathological features similar to monomorphic LPD. Chemotherapy for MTX-LPD is selected according to that for de novo LPD, although the strategy for aggressive P-LPD and non-specific LPD is not well established. The absolute lymphocyte count in the peripheral blood has been suggested as a candidate marker for MTX-LPD development and RRE. Several clinical issues, including correct diagnosis among overlapping clinicopathological features in MTX-LPD and clinical management of LPD by ISDs other than MTX, require further investigation.","101":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive mucocutaneous ulcers (EBVMCUs) were first described as a lymphoproliferative disorder in 2010. Clinically, EBVMCUs are shallow, sharply circumscribed, unifocal mucosal or cutaneous ulcers that occur in immunosuppressed patients, including those with advanced age-associated immunosenescence, iatrogenic immunosuppression, primary immune disorders, and HIV\/AIDS-associated immune deficiencies. In general, patients exhibit indolent disease progression and spontaneous regression. Histologically, EBVMCUs are characterized by the proliferation of EBV-positive, variable-sized, atypical B-cells. According to conventional histopathologic criteria, EBVMCUs may diagnosed as lymphomas. However, EBVMCUs are recognized as pseudomalignant lesions because they spontaneously regress without anti-cancer treatment. Therefore, overtreatment must be carefully avoided and multilateral differentiation is important. In this article, we reviewed previously reported EBVMCUs focusing on their clinical and pathological aspects in comparison with other EBV-positive B-cell neoplasms.","102":"Other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (OIIA-LPDs) with a T- or NK-cell phenotype are markedly rare, with only a limited number of cases having been reported thus far. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most common agent used for OIIA-LPD patients, and 43 cases of MTX-associated T-LPDs (MTX T-LPDs) and five cases of MTX-associated NK\/T-LPDs (MTX NK-LPDs) have been described. In addition to MTX T-LPDs and MTX NK\/T-LPDs, T-LPD and NK\/T-LPDs have been reported in patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents such as thiopurines, TNF antagonists, and cyclosporine. Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) is specifically associated with iatrogenic immunodeficiency, and 10% of HSTL cases develop in patients receiving thiopurines and\/or TNF antagonists for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In this review, we focused on MTX T-LPD, MTX NK\/T-LPD, and HSTL in patients with IBD. These T- and NK\/T-cell associated OIIA-LPDs are the most common in daily medical practice.","103":"In the current revised 4th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, 'other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (Oii-LPDs)' is listed in the last section in the chapter on immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders. Oii-LPDs cover a broad spectrum from benign lesions to lymphoma, and correspond to one of the subtypes in the WHO classification for immunocompetent patients.The WHO classification does not clearly indicate the histological subtype of this disease category; however, the framework of subtype classification is similar to the classification of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, and recent studies have attempted to subcategorize Oii-LPDs that fit this unique disease type. In this review, we provide an overview of B-cell-type Oii-LPDs regarding their histopathology and immunophenotype, genetics and clinical behaviors.","104":"","105":"","106":"Composite lymphoma (CL) is defined as the occurrence of two distinct types of lymphoma within the same patient. Most cases of CL involve Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas or two distinct types of B-cell lymphomas; true CL is a composite B-cell and T-cell lymphoma, and is rare. We herein report a case involving concurrent extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which has not been previously reported. As the mechanisms and treatments of composite B-cell and T-cell lymphomas are unclear, further studies are required to improve the prognosis.","107":"Hypercalcemia due to malignant tumors including malignant lymphomas is relatively common. Among cancer patients with hypercalcemia, humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is the most common and accounts for about 80% of all cases with hypercalcemia. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25(OH)2D3)-mediated hypercalcemia is relatively rare. Although malignant lymphoma has been also reported to cause 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated hypercalcemia, it is not known whether there is any association between 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated hypercalcemia and any specific histological type of malignant lymphoma. We herein report a case of an anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -negative with 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated hypercalcemia, which has never been previously reported. An 80-year-old Japanese man was admitted to our department due to acute exacerbation of hypercalcemia. He was diagnosed with ALCL, ALK-negative. Serum 1,25(OH)2D3 level was high and seemed to be associated with the lymphoma because the serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 levels improved in response to chemotherapy. Histological findings showed that many CD68 positive macrophages were observed in the microenvironment of tumor cells. Lymphoma cells or tumor microenvironmental cells may produce 1,25(OH)2D3 because several previous reports showed the source of 1,25(OH)2D3 can be either lymphoma or tumor microenvironmental cells. Moreover, because 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated hypercalcemia has been reported regardless of the specific histological type of lymphoma, tumor microenvironmental cells may be involved in this condition. However, we could not identify the source of 1,25(OH)2D3 in this case. The association between 1,25(OH)2D3 production and prognosis in malignant lymphomas is yet unknown; further studies are needed to elucidate the clinical characteristics of malignant lymphoma with 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated hypercalcemia.","108":"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is classified as an aggressive lymphoma due to its poor prognosis regardless of the treatment. Almost all cases of DLBCL are treated using rituximab-combination chemotherapy, but spontaneous regression without any therapeutic modalities may rarely occur. A 35-year-old man complained of abdominal pain and discomfort. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) demonstrated abnormal accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the thickened wall of the small intestine and multiple lymphadenopathy. Laparoscopic lymph node biopsy was performed, and the diagnosis of DLBCL was made based on the biopsy findings. Soon after the laparoscopic biopsy, the patient felt free from any symptoms. Approximately three months later, no abnormal accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the entire body was found on PET-CT. He has remained in complete metabolic remission for over three years according to PET-CT. We discuss the mechanism of this rare phenomenon.","109":null,"110":null,"111":"The c-fms proto-oncogene is also known as macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR) or colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R), and is expressed on several types of malignant tumor cells and myeloid cells. In the present study, we found that overexpression of M-CSFR was present in adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) cases. M-CSFR signaling was associated with lymphoma cell proliferation, and M-CSFR inhibition induced apoptosis in lymphoma cells. The ATLL cell line ATL-T expressed M-CSF\/CSF-1 and interleukin (IL)-34, which are both M-CSFR ligands. M-CSF and IL-34 expression was seen in ATLL cases, and co-expression of these ligands was detected in 11 of 13 ATLL cases. M-CSFR inhibition suppressed programmed death-1 and -2 ligand in ATL-T cells and macrophages stimulated with conditioned medium from ATL-T cells. Thus, an M-CSFR inhibitor may be useful as additional therapy against ATLL due to direct and indirect mechanisms.","112":"","113":"We report a 40-year-old woman who presented with multiple osteolytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia, which are rarely caused by chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL\/SLL). Although receiving intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic transplantation, the patient had a poor outcome with an overall survival of 2 years. To our knowledge, this presentation is extremely rare for B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and new treatment strategies may be needed for long-term control of the disease.","114":null,"115":"","116":"Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis, is characterized by the infiltration of foamy CD68+ and CD1a- histiocytes into multiple organ systems.

We report the case of a 66-year-old Japanese patient with ECD involving the CNS who harbored the BRAF V600E mutation and also concomitantly developed polycythemia vera with the JAK2 V617F mutation. We confirmed 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (cladribine) therapy to be effective for the patient in this case.","117":"","118":null,"119":"Because there are limited clinical reports on the impact of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) on organ transplantation, its effects on the development of adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM) or atypical HAM after organ transplantation remain unclear.We retrospectively analyzed the impact of HTLV-1 in 54 allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) cases and 31 renal transplantation cases between January 2006 and December 2016.Among the 54 allo-HSCT cases, nine recipients with ATL tested positive for HTLV-1, and one was found to be an HTLV-1 carrier. All donors tested negative for HTLV-1. Only one HTLV-1 carrier did not present with ATL or HAM development after allo-HSCT. Among nine ATL cases after allo-HSCT, four eventually relapsed due to proliferation of recipient-derived ATL cells. However, in one ATL case, atypical HAM developed rapidly at 5 months after allo-HSCT.Among the 31 renal transplantation cases, all donors tested negative for HTLV-1, and only recipients tested positive. Only one HTLV-1 carrier recipient did not present with ATL or HAM development after renal transplantation. However, one HTLV-1-negative recipient developed PTLD in the brain 10 years after renal transplantation.In clinical practice, careful follow-up of HTLV-1 infected recipients after organ transplantation is important because atypical HAM can develop in ATL patients after allo-HSCT. Furthermore, to clarify the risk of ATL or HAM development in HTLV-1 infected recipients, we prospectively followed up our cohort.","120":"","121":"Recently, an in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemical study demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection may be involved in tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis in children and young adolescents. The present study was based on 630 consecutive specimens from tonsillectomies performed at the Dokkyo University School of Medicine between 2002 and May 2017. Clinical findings were obtained from hospital records. Histologically, a \"pale clear zone\" was characterized by hyperplastic germinal centers with ill-defined borders and interfollicular expansion. Immunohistologically, the majority of immunoblasts were CD20-positive, whereas medium to large lymphoid cells usually expressed CD3. Among 14 lesions, numerous EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER)-positive cells were detected in 10. In 7 of these 10 lesions, EBER-positive cells were detected in germinal centers as well as in the interfollicular area. Based on our results, the \"pale clear zone\" suggests asymptomatic EBV infection of the tonsil. The present study demonstrated that \"pale clear zones\" should be taken into consideration when diagnosing asymptomatic EBV-associated LPDs in the tonsils of children and young adolescents as well as in middle-aged patients.","122":"Ibrutinib (IBR) covalently binds to the active site of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is used for the treatment of relapsed\/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Approximately 5-10% of CLL is complicated by autoimmune cytopenia (AIC), such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Several cases of AIC have reportedly demonstrated improvement during IBR treatment. However, in our case, the patient developed AIHA during oral IBR treatment. As AIHA is exacerbated by the increased number of CLL cells in the peripheral blood, it may have developed because of disease progression rather than IBR use. This phenomenon may also be attributed to the production of autoantibodies due to increased number of CD5+ B cells. In this case, withdrawal of IBR and administration of rituximab improved hemolysis. If AIHA develops during treatment, its etiology must be examined to confirm the effects of treatment.","123":"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is genetically characterized by BCL2\/IGH translocation. Some FL cases histologically transform to high-grade lymphoma, and the majority of cases transform to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We report herein an unusual FL case that transformed to plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) with MYC gene rearrangement as early as 12 months after FL diagnosis. IGH\/MYC translocation, the most common cytogenetic abnormality seen in de novo PBL, was also detected in the transformed tumor (double-hit lymphoma). The patient became resistant to chemotherapy and died 4 months after transformation. We speculate that the \"second hit\" of MYC rearrangement played a crucial role in PBL transformation (PBL-T) in this case. Highly specific three-color FISH analysis demonstrated the presence of BCL2\/IGH\/MYC triple fusion signals on a single chromosome as we expected, but BCL2\/IGH and IGH\/MYC fusion signals also coexisted in a single nucleus. The PBL-T tumor was genetically heterogeneous, despite being histologically quite homogeneous PBL. Surprisingly, three-color FISH analysis revealed that the preceding FL tumor was also genetically heterogeneous, simultaneously harboring BCL2\/IGH, IGH\/MYC and BCL2\/IGH\/MYC fusion signals (i.e. double-hit lymphoma), despite being histologically quite homogeneous FL. This suggests that MYC rearrangement played a partial role in PBL-T. Genetic instability including MYC rearrangement in the preceding FL tumor would contribute to PBL-T and poor outcome in this case. This study will broaden our understanding of the pathogenesis of high-grade transformation of FL and help improve patient outcome.","124":"Recent progress in anti-tumor immunotherapy has focused on the significance of the tumor microenvironment in tumor progression and resistance to chemo\/radio-therapy. Myeloid cells such as macrophages are predominant stromal components in hematological malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of programmed death-1 (PD-1) ligand expression in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) using PCNSL cell lines and human monocyte-derived macrophages. TK PCNSL cell line-derived soluble factors induced overexpression of PD-1 ligands, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1), and several other cytokines in macrophages. The expression of PD-1 ligands was dependent on the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. PD-L1 and IDO1 were overexpressed by macrophage\/microglia in PCNSL tissues, and gene expression profiling indicated that IDO1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of macrophage and lymphocyte markers. Macrophage-derived factors did not influence the proliferation or chemo-sensitivity of cell lines. These data suggest that the expression of immunosuppressive molecules, including PD-1 ligands and IDO1, by macrophage\/microglia may be involved in immune evasion of lymphoma cells.","125":"Bone marrow failure (BMF) is a rare but life-threatening disorder that usually manifests as (pan)cytopenia. BMF can be caused by a variety of diseases, but inherited BMF (IBMF) syndromes are a clinically important cause, especially in children. IBMF syndromes are a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by BMF, physical abnormalities, and predisposition to malignancy. An accurate diagnosis is critical, as disease-specific management, surveillance, and genetic counselling are required for each patient. The major differential diagnoses of IBMF syndromes are acquired aplastic anemia (AA) and refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC). These diseases have overlapping features, such as BM hypocellularity and\/or dysplastic changes, which make the differential diagnosis challenging. RCC has been defined as a histomorphologically distinct entity. Therefore, understanding the BM histopathology of these diseases is essential for the differential diagnosis. However, the BM histopathological features have not been characterized in detail, as descriptions of BM histopathology are very limited due to the rarity of the diseases. This review provides a detailed description of the BM histopathology in cases of RCC, AA, and the four most common IBMF syndromes: Fanconi anemia (FA), dysketatosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS). An overview, including the clinical features and diagnosis, is also provided.","126":"Myeloma is characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells. A diagnosis of myeloma is based on the criteria proposed by the International Myeloma Working Group and the pathological findings.Myeloma cells are classified into four types: mature, immature, pleomorphic, and plasmablastic. There are three patterns in which myeloma infiltrates bone marrow - nodular, interstitial, and diffuse. Dutcher bodies are highly specific to neoplastic myeloma cells. On immunohistochemical staining, the specificity of CD138 is high for plasma cells. As a clear image is often not obtained from the immunohistochemical staining of the immunoglobulin light chain, in situ hybridization is recommended. Abnormal expression of CD56 is seen in 70-80% of cases by flow cytometry analysis. CD56 expression definitively indicates myeloma, suggesting its high diagnostic value. Evaluation of the infiltration pattern, monoclonality, and abnormal antigen expression of plasma cells is more important than the plasmocytic ratio to determine whether a case is reactive or neoplastic.Multiple gene abnormalities function in the onset and progression of myeloma. In our department, we analyze CCND1, FGFR3, MAF, and del (17p13) by FISH for all myeloma cases. None of the cases with genetic abnormalities were recognized by G-banding. Therefore, FISH is more effective than G-banding for the evaluation of genetic abnormalities in myeloma.","127":"","128":"In 2017, the revised World Health Organization was published.

Reports of this peculiar disease, do not commonly address the PD-L1 expression on IVLBCL tumor cells. Here, we describe a 51-year-old Japanese woman who presented with rapidly progressive cognitive decline and higher brain dysfunction. CT scan and MRI revealed multiple ischemic foci in the cerebral hemispheres, ground-glass opacity in the lungs, and splenomegaly. Random skin biopsy for IVLBCL diagnosis yielded negative results. The patient experienced a rapidly deteriorating clinical course with no treatment, and died from the disease after 3 months of hospitalization. Post-mortem examination revealed systemic intravascular plugging of lymphoma cells, without mass lesions in the central nervous system or in visceral organs such as the lungs, liver, pituitary gland, ovaries, and uterus. The tumor cells were positive for CD10, CD20, BCL2, BCL6, and MUM1, but not other lineage-specific markers. Notably, the tumor cells showed strong PD-L1 expression. Our case was diagnosed as IVLBCL with neoplastic PD-L1 expression. These findings suggest that PD-L1 is associated with immune evasion of IVLBCL and may play a role in the pathogenesis and peculiar biological behavior of this unique disease. Additionally, PD-L1 may represent a possible therapeutic target for immune check-point inhibitors.","135":"","136":null,"137":"Recent studies have revealed the clinical and biological features of stage I follicular lymphoma (FL), but information about patients with stage I FL who underwent total resection after tissue biopsy is limited. Among 305 FL patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2013, clinical stage I disease was observed in 36 patients. Of these, 18 patients underwent total resection after diagnostic tissue biopsy. We used 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission CT for staging assessment in 13 of 18 patients (72.2%). The median age was 56.5 years. Six patients (33.3%) were male. The soluble interleukin-2 receptor alpha concentration was significantly lower than in patients with residual disease. Among these 18 patients, 7 patients (38.9%) were treated with a \"watch-and-wait\" (WW) policy, 7 (38.9%) were treated with involved-field irradiation, and 4 (22.2%) received systemic chemotherapy. Patients with resected disease were treated with significantly different strategies from those with residual disease (p = 0.0026). Five patients experienced relapse during follow-up (median follow-up: 48.2 months). All relapses were distant from the primary site, irrespective of treatment strategy. Among all stage I patients, disease resection was not a significant factor for survival (p = 0.9294). Collectively, the choice of treatment strategy was significantly influenced by patient status. Resection status was not significantly associated with survival after several treatment strategies.","138":"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) neoplasm (BPDCN) is a relatively rare hematological malignancy with significantly complex clinicopathological features that are still unclear. This study aimed to analyze the clinicopathological data of BPDCN and evaluate immunohistochemical detection of minimal bone marrow (BM) involvement. In this study, we examined skin and BM lesions from 6 patients with BPDCN. Neoplastic cells tested positive for CD303 (polyclonal, 100%; monoclonal, 40%) in the skin lesions and for CD303 (polyclonal, 100%; monoclonal, 67%) in the BM clots. Although immunostaining of CD4, CD56, CD123, CD303, and TCLl detected minimal BM involvement in 3 patients, morphological identification was challenging in the BM clots stained with hematoxylin-eosin. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the significance of observing BM smears to detect neoplastic cells and that immunohistochemical examination, including CD303 antibodies, is useful to detect minimal BM involvement. This study is the first to report the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and its receptor in BPDCN cells. Therefore, the TSLP\/TSLP receptor axis may be associated with the proliferation of BPDCN, and consequently, the survival of patients.","139":"Lymph node infarction is very rare, and is frequently associated with neoplasms, such as malignant lymphoma and non-neoplastic disease, or interventions such as fine-needle aspiration (FNA). A 76-year-old-man presented with cervical lymph node swelling. Although FNA was performed, the findings were insufficient for a definitive diagnosis. Consequently, surgical biopsy of the cervical lymph node was performed, which revealed total infarction; a diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma was made later. Both lymphoma itself and FNA may cause total lymph node infarction, which makes diagnosis confusing. Therefore, it is important to repeat the biopsy rather than repeat FNA to correctly diagnose malignant lymphoma, including Hodgkin lymphoma.","140":"","141":"","142":"A 42-year-old man with eosinophilia and high serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) developed a lacrimal gland mass on the left side. Excisional biopsy revealed hyperplasia of lymphoid follicles, and infiltration with lymphocytes and eosinophils around lacrimal gland acini, leading to the pathological diagnosis of Kimura disease. IgE-positive cells were mainly found along follicular dendritic cells, and a small number of IgG4-positive cells was present. One month after oral prednisolone was started at 40 mg daily and tapered to 10 mg daily, he developed lower leg edema on both sides and marked proteinuria (10.8 g\/day). Renal biopsy showed no glomerular abnormalities, no immunoglobulin deposition, and no tubulointerstitial infiltration with eosinophils, leading to the diagnosis of minimal change nephrotic syndrome. Proteinuria subsided in response to an increased dose of prednisolone to 30 mg daily. Proteinuria relapsed three times in the following 5 years when oral prednisolone was tapered. In conclusion, Kimura disease manifested as an orbital mass and did not relapse. However, nephrotic syndrome relapsed frequently with background eosinophilia and high serum IgE. This study reviewed the clinical features of 10 Japanese patients with Kimura disease associated with proteinuria.","143":"Adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) is a peripheral T-cell lymphoma caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 infection. Although conjunctival lymphoma is commonly reported with B-cell lymphoma, it rarely occurs in cases of ATLL. A 73-year-old Japanese female patient was admitted to our institution with evidence of abnormal lymphocytes, lymphadenopathy, and lung nodular lesions. Acute type ATLL was diagnosed, and therapy following the mLSG15 protocol was initiated. At the end of the second course, new bone lesions were detected. A modified treatment regimen was scheduled, but was postponed due to the appearance of gastrointestinal symptoms. Close observation resulted in a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus enteritis. One month after the diagnosis, the patient developed pain and discomfort in her left eye, which was determined to be due to a bulbar conjunctival tumor. Pathological findings revealed conjunctival infiltration of ATLL. Mogamulizumab treatment was initiated and was successful in eradicating the conjunctival lesions after the first course. However, at the end of the third course of therapy, pancytopenia was noted. Therefore, mogamulizumab therapy was discontinued, and the patient was on follow-up observation. Although there was no relapse of the conjunctival lesions, the patient died 1 year after the initial diagnosis, following therapy resistance.","144":"Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was first described in 1985 as a large-cell neoplasm with anaplastic morphology immunostained by the Ki-1 antibody, which recognizes CD30. In 1994, the nucleophosmin (NPM)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion receptor tyrosine kinase was identified in a subset of patients, leading to subdivision of this disease into ALK-positive and -negative ALCL in the present World Health Organization classification. Due to variations in morphology and immunophenotype, which may sometimes be atypical for lymphoma, many differential diagnoses should be considered, including solid cancers, lymphomas, and reactive processes. CD30 and ALK are key molecules involved in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of ALCL. In addition, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3)-mediated mechanisms are relevant in both types of ALCL, and fusion\/mutated receptor tyrosine kinases other than ALK have been reported in ALK-negative ALCL. ALK-positive ALCL has a better prognosis than ALK-negative ALCL or other peripheral T-cell lymphomas. Patients with ALK-positive ALCL are usually treated with anthracycline-based regimens, such as combination cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) or CHOEP (CHOP plus etoposide), which provide a favorable prognosis, except in patients with multiple International Prognostic Index factors. For targeted therapies, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody linked to a synthetic antimitotic agent (brentuximab vedotin) and ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, and ceritinib) are being used in clinical settings.","145":"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) has been classified as a subtype of mature T-cell neoplasms. The recent revision of the WHO classification proposed a new category of nodal T-cell lymphoma with follicular helper T (TFH)-cell phenotype, which was classified into three diseases: AITL, follicular T-cell lymphoma, and nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma with TFH phenotype. These lymphomas are defined by the expression of TFH-related antigens, CD279\/PD-1, CD10, BCL6, CXCL13, ICOS, SAP, and CXCR5. Although recurrent mutations in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, RHOA, and CD28, as well as gene fusions, such as ITK-SYK and CTLA4-CD28, were not diagnostic criteria, they may be considered as novel criteria in the near future. Notably, premalignant mutations, tumor-specific mutations, and mutations specific to tumor-infiltrating B cells were identified in AITL. Thus, multi-step and multi-lineage genetic events may lead to the development of AITL.","146":"","147":"A 69-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and treated with dasatinib.

Nilotinib and imatinib were started but stopped due to an increase in pleural effusion. Thoracentesis was performed and he was diagnosed with human herpesvirus 8-unrelated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL)-like lymphoma. Complex chromosomal abnormality, including BCL6 rearrangement, was found on chromosome analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of PEL-like lymphoma following tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment for CML.","148":null,"149":"Many patients with immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy remain asymptomatic and, consequently, untreated; however, few studies have evaluated the clinical course and prognosis of these patients. Using the screening procedures at our hospital, 74 patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy were selected. We excluded 11 patients in whom the treatment for lymphoid neoplasms had been initiated at the time of IgM monoclonal protein detection. The remaining 63 patients were considered to be the patient population with IgM MGUS and asymptomatic WM, and were analyzed. In these patients, the median overall survival was longer than 14 years. More than half of these patients died from causes other than lymphoid neoplasm. The cumulative incidence of lymphoid neoplasm requiring treatment was 17.5%. In five of eight patients requiring treatment for lymphoid neoplasms, the causes of death were related with these lymphoid neoplasms. Our study suggests that not all patients with IgM monoclonal gammopathy require uniform treatment for prolonged survival; however, most lymphoid neoplasms requiring treatment are refractory diseases. Our findings may help manage patients with macroglobulinemia.","150":"Herein, we describe a 61-year-old man diagnosed with pulmonary hemosiderosis following chemotherapy for acute adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL).

A 48-year-old man presented with painless left scrotal swelling. He was diagnosed with PTL after orchiectomy, and the histological type was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For staging of lymphoma, positron emission tomography was performed, which revealed uptake in the right atrium and early cardiac metastasis within just 2 months after orchiectomy. He underwent 6 cycles of systemic chemotherapy that consisted of rituximab, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP). He also received central nervous system prophylaxis 4 times with weekly IT-MTX during the first 2 cycles of R-CHOP. He achieved complete response after 6 cycles of R-CHOP, and underwent HDT-ASCT and radiotherapy as consolidation therapy without irreversible adverse effects. He is currently doing well, with a progression-free survival of 31 months. The above treatment strategy including HDT-ASCT may be one of the treatment options for advanced stage PTL with cardiac metastasis in patients younger than 65 years old.","153":null,"154":"Extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL), is a form of lymphoma characterized by preferential extranodal involvement, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association, and geographic diversity in incidence. ENKL tumor cells express P-glycoprotein, which is related to multidrug resistance (MDR). This MDR phenomenon is thought to be the major reason why ENKL is resistant to anthracycline-containing chemotherapies and has led researchers to explore novel therapeutic strategies. Since the early 2000s, next-generation therapies, including upfront radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or concurrent chemoradiotherapy using non-MDR-related drugs, have markedly changed the management of ENKL. However, a recent large retrospective study in Japan revealed several limitations of next-generation therapies, in particular that they resulted in almost no improvement of early disease progression. This review will summarize the current management of ENKL, primarily based on clinical trial results, and provide clues for better future management.","155":"","156":null,"157":null,"158":null,"159":"Recent studies have indicated the significance of immune checkpoint molecules including programmed death-1 (PD-1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4, and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 for anti-tumor immune responses. We previously investigated PD-1 ligand 1\/2 (PD-L1\/2) expression in lymphoma cell lines, and found that PD-L1\/2 is expressed on the adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATL-T) and B-cell lymphoma (SLVL) cell lines. In the present study, we investigated whether the Stat3 inhibitor WP1066 abrogated PD-L1\/2 expression in lymphoma cell lines. Incubation with WP1066 inhibited lymphoma cell growth and induced cell apoptosis. PD-L1\/2 expression in the ATL-T, SLVL, and human brain malignant lymphoma (HKBML) cell lines was significantly abrogated by WP1066 treatment. These data indicated that a Stat3 inhibitor abrogated PD-L1\/2 expression in lymphoma cells. Such an inhibitor is therefore considered to be useful for additional immunotherapy in patients with advanced lymphoma.","160":"Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) is a cell adhesion molecule that is expressed in brain, liver, lung, testis, and some kinds of cancer cells including adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL). Recent studies have indicated the involvement of CADM1 in cell-cell contact between cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and virus infected cells. We previously reported that cell-cell interaction between lymphoma cells and macrophages induces lymphoma cell proliferation. In the present study, we investigated whether CADM1 is associated with cell-cell interaction between several human lymphoma cell lines and macrophages.CADM1 expression was observed in the ATLL cell lines, ATN-1, ATL-T, and ATL-35T, and in the B cell lymphoma cell lines, TL-1, DAUDI, and SLVL, using western blotting. Significant cell-cell interaction between macrophages and ATN-1, ATL-T, ATL-35T and MT-2, DAUDI, and SLVL cells, as assessed by induction of cell proliferation, was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis of human biopsy samples indicated CADM1 expression in 10 of 14 ATLL cases; however, no case of follicular lymphoma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was positive for CADM1. Finally, the interaction of macrophages with cells of the CADM1-negative ED ATLL cell line and CADM1-transfected ED cells was tested. However, significant cell-cell interaction between macrophage and CADM1-transfected ED cells was not observed. We conclude that CADM1 was not associated with cell-cell interaction between lymphoma cells and macrophages, although CADM1 may be a useful marker of ATLL for diagnostic procedures.","161":null,"162":null,"163":"","164":"We report a patient who developed orbital MALT lymphoma after autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for follicular lymphoma as relapse of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A 54-year-old woman with systemic lymphadenopathy was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by left supraclavicular lymph node biopsy, and underwent 6 courses of R-CHOP chemotherapy with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone, leading to complete response. Five years later in the follow-up, an abdominal mass with abnormal uptake was found by whole-body 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography, and computed tomography-guided biopsy demonstrated follicular lymphoma. She underwent 4 courses of R-IDEA chemotherapy with rituximab, ifosfamide, dexamethasone, etoposide, and cytarabine, resulting in partial response, and then, underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation with myeloablative conditioning with R-MCEC chemotherapy (rituximab, ranimustine, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and carboplatin). She was well for the following 3 years with no treatment until the development of a right orbital mass. The excisional biopsy this time revealed MALT lymphoma. She underwent 3 courses with rituximab monotherapy and local orbital radiation at the total dose of 30 Gy. She had no relapse for the following three years. Relapse as MALT lymphoma after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for relapsed and refractory lymphoma may not be a poor prognostic sign.","165":"Recently, attention has been focused on methotrexate-induced lymphoproliferative disease (MTX-LPD), and atypical phenotypes are occasionally documented. We encountered two patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were diagnosed with non-specific LPD (LPD-nos). Biopsy samples were not obtained during the initial examination when the LPD development was discovered, and the patients achieved a complete response after MTX cessation (case 1) or steroid pulse therapy (case 2). However, the tumors flared up 1.5 years later, and LPD-nos was determined following biopsies of the lymph node (LN, case 1) and liver (case 2). Prednisolone was subsequently administered instead of chemotherapy; however, multiple masses, including in the spine (case 1), and severe icterus with liver dysfunction (case 2) were exacerbated within a few months. Although the re-biopsy of LN proved the presence of HL and radiation followed by aggressive chemotherapy rescued the patient (case 1), the superficially accessible biopsy site was not found, and autopsy finally revealed HL (case 2). In both cases, the underlying pathogenesis along with the B symptoms and laboratory abnormalities suggested MTX-LPD, HL in particular. Therefore, even if the pathological diagnosis does not confirm the specific LPD subtype, the administration of aggressive chemotherapy should be considered if the LPD activity flares severely.","166":"Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is a rare, tick-borne infectious disease caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Herein, we report a rare case of human granulocytic anaplasmosis associated with cytopenias and clonal expansion of gamma\/delta T-cells in the bone marrow. A 77-year old man presented multiple times to the emergency department complaining of muscle weakness. Complete blood count detected cytopenias and peripheral blood smear showed pseudo Pelger-Huet neutrophils. These findings prompted bone marrow evaluation with ancillary studies including flow cytometry, karyotyping and T-cell rearrangement studies. Careful examination of peripheral blood smear revealed very rare neutrophils with intracytoplasmic inclusions, suggestive of ehrlichiosis\/anaplasmosis. Bone marrow evaluation showed dyserythropoiesis, dysmegakaryopoiesis and prominence of hemophagocytic histiocytes. Furthermore, an increased number of T-cells was seen in the bone marrow and flow cytometry showed excess of gamma\/delta T-cells, while T-cell rearrangement studies detected a T-cell clone. Serologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of anaplasmosis. This case nicely illustrates hematologic sequelae of infection with Anaplasma and potential diagnostic pitfalls, such as myelodysplastic syndrome and T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of clonal expansion of gamma\/delta T-cells associated with anaplasmosis. Pathologists should be careful and vigilant when screening peripheral blood smears, as they are often the first to raise the suspicion of anaplasmosis.","167":null,"168":"Ten-eleven translocation-2 (TET2) mutation is frequently observed in myeloid malignancies, and loss-of-function of TET2 is essential for the initiation of malignant hematopoiesis. TET2 mutation presents across disease entities and was reported in lymphoid malignancies. We investigated TET2 mutations in 27 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients and found a frameshift mutation in 1 case (3.7%). TET2 mutation occurred in some populations of DLBCL patients and was likely involved in the pathogenesis of their malignancies.","169":"Although a humanized CCR4 antibody (mogamulizumab) was reported to be effective for refractory adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), several reports regarding the use of mogamulizumab before allo-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) strongly indicated a high incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and treatment-related mortality (TRM). We retrospectively analyzed nine aggressive-type ATL patients who underwent allo-HSCT at a single institution in Miyazaki from 2006.1.1 to 2015.7.31. Among nine ATL patients, three had used mogamulizumab before treatment with allo-HSCT because of the poor control of refractory ATL. All three patients were treated with four to eight cycles of mogamulizumab. The interval from last administration of mogamulizumab to allo-HSCT was two to five months. All three patients with prior mogamulizumab treatment developed mild-moderate acute GVHD (grade 2) 28, 34, or 40 days after allo-HSCT. Acute GVHD was controlled by prednisolone treatment. Two patients in complete remission before allo-HSCT exhibited relatively prolonged survival (survival rate, 66%). Moreover, one patient developed human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy-mimicking myelitis at five months after allo-HSCT. In contrast, two of six ATL patients without a history of mogamulizumab use survived (survival rate 33%). Thus, in cases of mogamulizumab use before treatment with allo-HSCT for refractory ATL, an appropriately long interval from the last administration of mogamulizumab to allo-HSCT may be one of factors to reduce TRM by acute GVHD, and to subsequently enhance graft-versus-tumor effects in ATL cases. Furthermore, caution is needed when administering mogamulizumab before allo-HSCT for severe GVHD and TRM.","170":"CD20 is a differentiation related cell surface phosphoprotein that is expressed during early pre-B cell stages until plasma cell differentiation, and is a suitable molecular target for B-cell malignancies by monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab and others. CD20 expression is confirmed in most B-cell malignancies; however, the protein expression level varies in each patient, even in de novo tumors, and down-modulation of CD20 expression after chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab, resulting in rituximab resistance, has been recognized in the clinical setting. Recent reports suggest that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms are correlated with aberrantly low CD20 expression in de novo tumors and relapsed\/refractory disease after using rituximab. Furthermore, some targeting drugs, such as lenalidomide, bortezomib and ibrutinib, directly or indirectly affect CD20 protein expression. CD20-negative phenotypically-changed DLBCL after rituximab use tends to show an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome with resistance to not only rituximab, but also conventional salvage chemo-regimens. Understanding of the mechanisms of CD20-negative phenotype may contribute to establish strategies for overcoming chemo-refractory B-cell malignancies. In this manuscript, recent progress of research on molecular and clinical features of CD20 protein and CD20-negative B-cell malignancies was reviewed.","171":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) comprises a heterogeneous group with pathophysiological, genetic and clinical features. Many patients can be cured with R-CHOP therapy, which is the current standard regimen. Despite recent progress in improving patient survival, the 40% survival of DLBCL patients remains poor. Therefore, the most important issue for patients with DLBCL remains the development of a new front-line therapy. Several studies have reported that intensified chemotherapy with dose-adjusted EPOCH-R or R-ACVBP was superior to R-CHOP. Gene expression profiling has identified two distinct forms of DLBCL: activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) types. ABC DLBCL exhibits a worse prognosis than GCB DLBCL by molecular diagnosis after R-CHOP therapy. Next-generation sequencing has identified unique oncogenic mechanisms and genetic complexity, which has provided rational therapeutic targets. There are also a number of biomarkers, including CD5, and prognostic factors. Efforts to distinguish many biomarkers will be crucial for individualized treatment in the future.","172":null,"173":"","174":"","175":"Epstein-Barr virus-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH) is a serious disorder in which monoclonal growth of T cells infected with EBV and macrophage activation cause pancytopenia, high fever and acute liver failure. Patients with chemotherapy- or immunosuppression-resistant EBV-HLH require allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), but patients who have no sibling donors may not have time to wait for an unrelated donor. In pediatric patients, there are some reports on allogeneic cord blood transplantation (allo-CBT) for the treatment of EBV-HLH; however, in adult patients, reports of allo-CBT for EBV-HLH are quite limited. The present case of a 20-year-old woman with chemotherapy-resistant EBV-HLH and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who underwent allo-CBT following reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC-CBT). She achieved and maintained a complete donor type and the EBV-DNA load, and the titers of anti-double stranded DNA and antinuclear antibodies became negative. It is therefore considered that RIC-CBT is an effective treatment option for adult onset HLH. However, because the effectiveness of allo-HSCT for SLE remains unclear and transplant-related mortality is high, it is recommended that allo-HSCT for SLE is restricted to patients concomitant with oncohematological disease as with our present case.","176":"Adult T-cell leukaemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) is a neoplasm originating in mature CD4+ peripheral T cells. However, rare cases of CD20+ ATLL have been reported. Here, we describe six cases of CD20+ ATLL diagnosed in our department. The median age was 79 years (range, 54-90 years); two patients were men, and four were women. Elevated lactate dehydrogenase was observed in four cases. All cases were lymphoma type and positive for human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 proviral DNA was detected in four cases. The Ann Arbor stage was I, II, or IV in one patient each and III in three patients. The clinical course was poor in almost all cases. Tumour cells were large in all cases, and flow cytometry revealed CD20+ lymphoma cells in five of six cases. Immunohistochemistry revealed lymphoma cells positive for CD20, CD3, CD4, and CCR4 and negative for CD8, CD79a, and PAX5 in all cases. CD20 expression was lower than that in normal B cells. One case was initially misdiagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Thus, combined use of an antibody panel and molecular genetic studies is important to avoid misdiagnosing ATLL as B-cell lymphoma.","177":"Langerhans cell (LC) histiocytosis (LCH) and LC sarcoma (LCS) are proliferative processes consisting of cells having morphologic and phenotypic features of Langerhans cells (LCs), although the latter may have lost some of these features. Because neoplastic nature of LCH as well as LCS is more likely by recent studies, a category of LC hyperplasia can be better characterized. LCH and LCS are rarely seen in daily pathology practice, but it is important to accurately characterize these lesions. For this purpose, an outline covering proliferations of LC and related cells was constructed. The scheme of this outline is based especially on evaluating borderline lesions, neoplastic trans-differentiation, and degree of similarity with the normal counter-parts. In addition, the organization and update of the current classification scheme for histiocytic and dendritic-cell proliferations is presented.","178":"High-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cell support\/transplantation (HDT\/ASCT) has been a standard of care over the last two decades in patients with relapsed or refractory(R\/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is sensitive to salvage chemotherapy. HDT\/ASCT for high-risk DLBCL in upfront setting remains controversial, so it is not recommended for clinical practice. Various promising salvage chemotherapy regimens have been reported in phase 2 studies; however, two large randomized phase 3 studies showed similar efficacy of R-ICE vs. R-DHAP and R-GDP vs. R-DHAP. Since the registry data shows feasibility and efficacy of HDT\/ASCT in elderly R\/R DLBCL patients, older age (&gt; 65 years) itself is not a contraindication for HDT\/ASCT. Rituximab maintenance failed to demonstrate a significant benefit compared with observation only after HDT\/ASCT. While sensitive R\/R DLBCL might be cured by HDT\/ASCT even in third-line therapy, the prognosis of insensitive R\/R DLBCL is extremely poor. Further study to establish treatment strategies for high-risk patients defined by prognostic factors or biomarkers, and insensitive patients is warranted.","179":"We hereby report a case of acute myeloid leukemia with translocation t(2;3) and involvement of the ectopic virus integration site-1 (EVI1) gene. Like most other 3q26-related disorders reported thus far, we describe a phenotype with elevated platelet counts and dysmegakaryopoesis. The clinical course of our patient was complicated by symptomatic thrombophilia and chemoresistance. In addition, our case exhibited FLT3 (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) internal tandem duplication. Although anagrelide was successful in controlling elevated platelet counts, allogeneic stem cell transplantation failed to overcome chemoresistance due to simultaneous graft-versus-host-disease and relapse of acute myeloid leukemia. Given the dismal outcome of our case and previously reported cases, we propagate the implementation of targeted therapies to newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia t(2;3). Preclinical models indicate drugs that plausibly target the EVI1-related molecular vulnerability as candidates for basket trials. Anagrelide exhibited a hopeful signal of activity in 3q26-related thrombocytosis and should be evaluated for implementation as supportive care.","180":"We report an incidental case of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) coexisting with an ovarian carcinoma in a 76-year-old woman. She visited our hospital with difficulty in defecation. Magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography scan revealed a solid and cystic mass probably arising from the left ovary. Gross examination of the tumor obtained by an exploratory surgery showed a solid area in a simple cyst. The ovarian tumor was diagnosed as a high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC). Early in the post-operative course, this patient developed fever of unknown origin with central nervous system manifestations. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed multiple space-occupying lesions. When we reviewed the histological sections, atypical lymphocytes were found in the lumina of small vessels of almost the entire ovary. These cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a by immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of IVLBCL coexisting with HGSC was finally made. Although radiation therapy for brain lesions was performed and rituximab was administered, she died two months after the operation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of IVLBCL incidentally identified in HGSC through microscopic examination. This case serves to create awareness of the rare event where IVLBCL may involve the ovary of patients who also have carcinoma in the organ.

We report a case of a composite follicular lymphoma (FL) and CD5-positive nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL) in a resected inguinal lymph node of a 72-year-old Japanese male. Histologically, multiple follicles had reactive-germinal centers with tingible body macrophages, a thin mantle zone and a wide marginal zone. The wide marginal zone consisted of medium-sized cells having slightly indented nuclei and clear cytoplasm, indicating monocytoid cells with CD5-positive B-cells. Several follicles had germinal centers filled with many centrocytes, with CD10-positive B-cells. Polymerase chain reaction\/sequence analysis of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene obtained from microdissected regions of CD5-positive NMZL and FL showed different sequences within the CDR3 region. To our knowledge, this is the first report of FL and CD5-positive NMZL. ","182":"A dose modified ifosfamide, epirubicin, and etoposide (IVE) regimen was prospectively assessed for its efficacy in mobilizing peripheral blood stem cells for autologous transplantation. Two patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and two with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who were undergoing stem cell therapy were studied. All patients had a history of multiple treatments with insufficient stem cell mobilization. The dose modified IVE regimen consisted of ifosfamide 3 g\/m(2) intravenously (IV) administered on days 1-2 in combination with epirubicin 50 mg\/m(2) IV on day 1 and etoposide 200 mg\/m(2) (100 mg\/m(2) in two patients with complete remission) IV on days 1-3. The ifosfamide dosage was reduced to two-thirds of the original protocol. A substantial high yield of CD34(+) cells was achieved when patients were treated with a dose-modified IVE regimen, compared with that during the previous regimen (two with the ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide [ICE] regimen, one with high-dose cyclophosphamide and one with the original IVE regimen). Two patients who had refractory and residual disease received a 200 mg\/m(2) dose of etoposide, which resulted in tumor reduction (one patient with complete remission and one with further reduction in tumor size). After the IVE regimen, all four patients had a sufficient yield of CD34(+) cells in total, which was available for stem cell transplantation. Hematological and non-hematological toxicities were comparable in all regimens. This single-center prospective study demonstrated that the dose-modified IVE regimen can be used as a safe treatment with high mobilizing efficacy in heavily pretreated lymphoma patients.

We retrospectively analyzed 51 CML patients treated with TKIs at a single institution between 2002 and 2014. The patients (median age: 53.8 years) were classified as having chronic (n = 48), accelerated (n = 2), or blastic phase (n = 1) CML. Our treatments included both 1st generation TKIs (60.8%) and 2nd generation TKIs (39.2%). We found that the overall response rates of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), major molecular response (MMR), and MR4 (molecular response 4) were 90.2%, 78.4%, and 64.7%, respectively. Second line 2nd generation TKIs had response rates equivalent to those of 1st line 1st generation TKIs. Moreover, 1st line 2nd generation TKIs tended to achieve an early response rate. Overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 93.2%. Sudden blastic crisis (BC) occurred in 2 CML patients receiving TKI with CCyR status. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed for BC (n = 1) and sudden BC (n = 2). Side effects of all grades (1-3) and grade 3 alone were 64.7% and 11.8%, respectively. Dose reduction, replacement with another TKI, or low dose TKI treatment may be useful methods to control side effects. Further reasons of TKI discontinuation were economic problems (n = 3) and pregnancy (n = 1). Consequently, our treatment strategy for CML demonstrated good response rate and OS. Currently, treatment discontinuation due to intolerance, resistance, economic problems, pregnancy, and sudden BC remains a concern in clinical practice. ","185":"Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There are limited reports on allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in patients with LBL. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of 15 adult patients with LBL who received allo-SCT at our institution. The median age at allo-SCT was 29 years (range, 18-42). Disease status at the time of transplantation was complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and advanced disease in 4, 4, and 7 patients, respectively. The median follow-up duration of survivors was 25 months (range, 6-106). The probabilities of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years after allo-SCT were 37% and 24%, respectively. The respective 2-year OS and PFS rates of the 8 patients with CR or PR at the time of transplantation were 57% and 45%, while those with advanced disease were 14% and 0%. In conclusion, the treatment outcomes of allo-SCT in patients with LBL were unsatisfactory. Although outcomes were promising in patients with CR or PR at the time of transplantation, they were dismal in patients with progressive disease. Further advances in chemotherapy, both induction and salvage therapies, are needed to improve the clinical outcomes of patients with LBL. ","186":"The introduction of novel agents, such as bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide, into daily practice has dramatically improved clinical outcomes and prolonged survival of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). However, despite these advanced clinical benefits, MM remains an incurable hematological malignancy. Therefore, development of new agents and novel therapeutic strategies is urgently needed. Recent advances toward understanding the mechanism of myeloma cell growth and drug resistance in the bone marrow milieu have provided clues for the development of next-generation agents aimed at improving patient outcomes. In this review article, we discuss new possible agents for the treatment of MM based on recent advances in the understanding of signaling pathways in myeloma cells. ","187":"The microenvironment of follicular lymphoma (FL) is composed of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells, follicular regulatory T cells, lymphoma-associated macrophages and mast cells, follicular helper T cells, follicular dendritic cells, and follicular reticular cells, all of which have been reported to have relevance in the prognosis of FL patients. In addition, some of these cells play a role in the histologic transformation of FL. Macrophages contribute to a poor prognosis in FL patients treated in the pre-rituximab era, but are associated with good prognosis in those treated in the rituximab era. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein (TIM) 3 are markers of T-cell exhaustion, and T cells co-expressing programed death 1 (PD1) in peripheral blood and lymph nodes secrete interleukin (IL)-12 in the serum. Serum CXCL9, IL-2 receptor, and IL-1 receptor agonist are associated with shorter survival of FL patients. Agents for manipulation of the microenvironment surrounding FL cells include the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, immune check-point inhibitors, and cyclophosphamide prior to rituximab. To battle FL and to improve the outcomes of FL patients, understanding the relationship between neoplastic cells and the various microenvironmental cellular components is crucial for developing therapeutics against the microenvironment. ","188":"The t(8;21)(q22;q22) translocation is specifically observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M2 subtype, whereas del(5q) is one of the most common cytogenetic aberrations in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Thus, t(8;21)(q22;q22) and del(5q) appear to be mutually exclusive, and the association between them has not been characterized yet. Here, we report an 81-year-old woman with coexistent t(8;21)(q22;q22) and del(5q) at initial diagnosis. The bone marrow was infiltrated with 18.4% myeloblasts, and showed marked myeloid and erythroid dysplasia. Myeloblasts were positive for CD19 and CD56 as well as CD13, CD33, CD34 and HLA-DR. G-banding and spectral karyotyping showed 46,XX,del(5)(q?),t(8;21)(q22;q22)[18]\/46,XX[2]. Both del(5)(q?) and t(8;21)(q22;q22) were present in a single clone. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase spreads detected a RUNX1\/RUNX1T1 fusion signal on the der(8)t(8;21)(q22;q22), and confirmed deletion of CSF1R signaling at 5q33-q34 on the del(5)(q?). Furthermore, FISH on interphase nuclei revealed that the RUNX1\/RUNX1T1 fusion signal and deletion of CSF1R signaling were found in 66.0% and 58.0% of interphase cells, respectively, suggesting that del(5)(q?) occurred in cells with RUNX1\/RUNX1T1. These results indicated a diagnosis of AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22)\/RUNX1\/RUNX1T1 rather than MDS, even though the percentage of bone marrow myeloblasts was less than 20%. Based on these findings, together with those of other reported cases, del(5q) seems to be an extremely rare but recurrent secondary aberration in AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22).","189":"We report the first case of a nodal marginal zone large B-cell lymphoma and the first with MYC rearrangement. This high proliferation rate lymphoma (40% of cells) occurred in the bilateral cervical, axillary, and para-aortic lymph nodes of an 82 year old woman. It involved extensively her bone marrow, and was lethal. Malignant B-cells were CD10 negative, harbored Burkitt translocation, and multiple chromosomal changes including trisomies of chromosomes 3 and 18, and three copies of 8q with an intact q24 cytoband (in addition to MYC rearrangement), associated with overexpression of BCL6, BCL2, and MYC respectively. We suggest that in aggressive nodular marginal zone lymphomas (clinical picture or high proliferation rate of lymphoma cells), fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for MYC rearrangement, with break-apart probe, and for MYC\/IGH translocation, in addition to chromosome analysis, should be performed. MYC rearrangement associated with a more rapid progression of the neoplasia, might warrant a more aggressive treatment.","190":null,"191":"Severe acute lung injury is a rare but life-threatening complication associated with bortezomib.

Rechallenge with bortezomib was performed without recurrent DAH. In patients with multiple myeloma who manifest abnormal pulmonary shadow, we should be aware of early-onset severe DAH after bortezomib administration, which might be due to pulmonary involvement of myeloma cells.","192":"We report a case of intraocular relapse of extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphoma with anterior chamber hypopyon and retinal infiltrates. A 55-year-old man developed fever, malaise, anorexia, and hepatosplenomegaly, and was diagnosed with NK\/T-cell lymphoma by liver biopsy. He underwent 2 courses of SMILE (dexamethasone, methotrexate, ifosfamide, L-asparaginase, and etoposide) chemotherapy, followed by myeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, donated by his brother. Two months later, he developed high-grade fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and peritoneal lymphadenopathy, and the relapse with hemophagocytic syndrome was diagnosed by bone marrow biopsy. He underwent 2 courses of SMILE salvage chemotherapy, followed by non-myeloablative peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, donated by his son. Two months later, he noticed blurred vision in both eyes. The right eye had aqueous cells and keratic precipitates, but no retinal lesions. The left eye had hypopyon in the anterior chamber with numerous aqueous cells, and retinal white infiltrates with retinal hemorrhages. The aqueous cells, obtained by anterior chamber paracentesis, were positive for CD3, CD56, and Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA, but negative for CD20 by immunocytochemical staining. Head magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated white matter lesions in the anterior to parietal lobes on the right side. The patient underwent intrathecal methotrexate injection and external beam radiation at 40 Gy, covering the entire brain and both eyes. The retinal lesions and hypopyon disappeared. Two months later, the patient died of renal failure, and autopsy demonstrated multi-organ involvement of lymphoma cells.

Relapse of IVLBCL with pulmonary involvement occurred 27 mon after first presentation. She underwent R-CHOP therapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. She is currently alive and without lymphoma. Immunostaining by anti-ssDNA suggested that spontaneous regression may have been due to apoptosis of the lymphoma cells.","194":null,"195":"The t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation is the most common chromosomal translocation in plasma cell myeloma (PCM), but the cytogenetic and immunophenotypic features of PCM with t(11;14)(q13;q32) remain to be fully elucidated. To address the issue, we retrospectively analyzed 21 newly diagnosed PCM patients with the t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation in our institute. CD20 is a B-cell-specific transmembrane protein that is the topic of much focus as a potential target in immunotherapy. We observed a low incidence of CD20 expression (2 of 21 patients, 11%), although the expression of CD20 was previously reported to be associated with t(11;14)(q13;q32). PAX5 is an essential transcriptional factor involved in B-cell development and commitment, and is down-regulated upon plasma cell differentiation. We observed one patient (6%) with expression of PAX5. The expression of CD19, CD56, and CD138 was detected in one (0.7%), nine (60%), and 13 patients (87%), respectively. Cyclin D1, CD38, and BCL2 were detected in all patients; on the other hand, neither BCL6 nor SOX11 was detected in any of the evaluated patients. Abnormalities of chromosome 13 were detected in six patients (38%), but deletion of TP53 was not observed in any of the evaluated patients.

The clinical and prognostic value of immunophenotyping in PCM remains questionable. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic and prognostic significance of CD200 expression in newly diagnosed PCM. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 107 patients newly diagnosed with PCM at Showa University Hospital between January 2004 and September 2013. Expression of CD200 was studied by immunohistochemistry. Clinical and pathological parameters were compared between CD200-positive and CD200-negative cases. CD200-positive PCM cases had lower serum albumin (p = 0.0001) compared to those without CD200 expression. Our results showed no significant difference in median overall survival between patients with CD200-positive and CD200-negative PCM. However, there was a strong correlation between CD200 expression and serum albumin level. In the CD200-negative group, median overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received new drug treatment. These findings suggest that CD200 expression is a useful marker for evaluation of the severity of PCM and that lack of CD200 expression may improve the sensitivity of PCM to therapy with new drugs.","198":null,"199":"In allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) recipients with liver dysfunction, it is often difficult to determine the cause.

Allo-SCT recipients commonly require frequent red blood cell transfusions during the course of treatment and transplantation, leading to significant iron overload, which could be one of causes of liver dysfunction. Here we report an allo-SCT recipient with chronic deteriorating liver dysfunction due to iron overload, despite maintaining transfusion independence for more than four years. Using magnetic resonance-based liver iron concentration (MR-LIC), iron overload-related liver dysfunction was diagnosed. It drastically improved with monthly phlebotomy and has not recurred following its termination. The observations from our case suggested that iron overload should be recognized as a cause of chronic liver dysfunction even in patients who remain transfusion-independent for several years and that MR-LIC analysis is a useful and reliable method for detecting iron overload and monitoring the effect of iron-reduction therapy.","200":"Castleman disease is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that may have a unicentric or multicentric clinical presentation. Herein we present the case of a 49-year-old female with a 3-year history of progressively worsening lymphadenopathy associated with fevers, chills and night sweats. Laboratory studies showed anemia and mildly elevated sedimentation rate. A computed tomogram scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis showed multiple enlarged bilateral axillary, supraclavicular, subpectoral, submental, retroperitoneal, and para-aortic lymph nodes. A right axillary lymph node biopsy was performed and found to display histopathologic features compatible with the plasma cell type of Castleman disease. The patient was found to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, with a viral load of 104,000\/mL and a CD4 cell count of 84 cells\/mm(3). Molecular studies on the lymph node specimen revealed an incomplete monoclonal DH-JH rearrangement in the IgH gene. The patient was initially treated with antiretroviral therapy with a combination of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir that improved her fatigue and malaise. As treatment for Castleman disease, she was administered a combination of rituximab and etoposide, which led to a reduction in lymphadenopathy. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of multicentric Castleman disease with monoclonal incomplete IgH gene rearrangement in an HIV-positive patient.","201":null,"202":"Although graft failure (GF) is a fatal and life-threatening complication of umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT), the standard treatment has not been established. We describe the case of a 28-year-old man diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes harboring a normal karyotype. This patient underwent 2 courses of idarubicin and cytosine arabinose therapy, and 3 courses of high-dose cytosine arabinose therapy. Subsequently, he underwent high-dose chemotherapy (total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide) followed by first CBT. Primary GF occurred after post-immunological reaction and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, and was diagnosed on day 27 after the first CBT. Therefore, the patient underwent secondary CBT for GF treated with a modified one-day conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (30 mg\/m(2), 3 days), cyclophosphamide (2 g\/m(2)), and total body irradiation (2 Gy), and graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis consisting of mycophenolate and tacrolimus. Consequently, the patient achieved neutrophil engraftment on day 17 after the second CBT. During the clinical course of the second CBT, the main complications were sepsis, BK virus-associated cystitis, and acute graft-versus-host disease (skin, grade 2, stage 3). After these treatments, the patient was disease-free for 39 months. Our case suggests that these treatments may be feasible, safe, and effective for the treatment of patients with GF. This case study may be helpful to physicians who directly care for GF patients, and may provide a future direction for a more efficient treatment modality.","203":"A 60-year-old male patient suffered from mild exertional dyspnea, wheezing, and systemic blisters. He was diagnosed with paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) with follicular lymphoma in the pancreas head and pelvic cavity. He was first treated with eight cycles of rituximab; his blisters and erosions gradually improved and highly elevated levels of auto-antibodies related to PNP gradually decreased to normal levels. However, obstructive and restrictive respiratory failure still progressed. Computed tomography of the inspiratory and expiratory phases revealed obstructive pulmonary disorder, leading to a diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). The patient underwent plasma exchange and was repeatedly treated with rituximab monotherapy and rituximab-containing chemotherapies, but died 7 months after the diagnosis of BO. Early introduction of rituximab-containing regimens may be necessary to prevent the development of BO accompanying PNP. However, when a diagnosis of PNP-related BO is made, lung transplantation may also be considered for patients in whom rituximab-containing regimens are effective for PNP.","204":null,"205":null,"206":"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is considered to originate from follicular helper T (TFH) cells. Currently, neoplastic cells in AITL are considered to express CXCL13 as a tumor marker. However, the identification of CXCL13(+) cells remains unclear in terms of whether they are neoplastic cells (or TFH cells) or follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in both AITL and normal germinal centers. Therefore, the exact identification of CXCL13(+) cells was performed using 33 cases of AITL and normal germinal centers. Single-labeling immunohistochemistry and double-labeling immunofluorescent microscopy first confirmed that CXCL13 was expressed mainly in FDCs in the normal germinal centers. In 28 of 33 AITL cases, CXCL13 was expressed mainly in FDCs as a meshwork pattern, which was associated with CXCL13(+) neoplastic cells. In the other five cases, CXCL13 was expressed mainly in neoplastic cells, which were densely distributed in and around the FDC meshwork. These findings indicate the abundance of CXCL13(+) cells in the FDC meshwork irrespective of the cell type. Triple-labeling immunofluorescent microscopy showed that the CXCL13(+) FDC meshwork in AITL harbored both neoplastic cells and B cells. CXCR5, the cognate receptor of CXCL13, was expressed in neoplastic cells in AITL. The present study suggests that neoplastic cells in AITL preserve a certain level of TFH-cell function since neoplastic cells and B cells are closely enmeshed in the CXCL13(+) cell-rich FDC meshwork in a similar way as in normal germinal centers.","207":"The identification of eosinophils by flow cytometry is difficult because most of the surface antigens expressed by eosinophils are shared with neutrophils. Some methods have been proposed, generally based on differential light scatter properties, enhanced autofluorescence, lack of CD16 or selective positivity of CD52. Such methods, however, show several limitations. In the present study we report a novel method based on the analysis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked molecules. The combination of CD157 and FLAER was used, since FLAER recognizes all GPI-linked molecules, while CD157 is absent on the membrane of eosinophils and expressed by neutrophils. Peripheral blood samples from normal subjects and patients with variable percentages of eosinophils (n = 31), and without any evidence for circulating immature myeloid cells, were stained with the combination of FLAER-Alexa Fluor and CD157-PE. A FascCanto II cytometer was used. Granulocytes were gated after CD33 staining and eosinophils were identified as CD157(-)\/FLAER(+) events. Neutrophils were identified as CD157(+)\/FLAER(+) events. The percentages of eosinophils detected by this method showed a very significant correlation both with automated counting and with manual counting (r = 0.981 and 0.989, respectively). Sorting assays were carried out by a S3 Cell Sorter: cytospins obtained from CD157(-)\/FLAER(+) events consisted of 100% eosinophils, while samples from CD157(+)\/FLAER(+) events were represented only by neutrophils. In conclusion, this method shows high sensitivity and specificity in order to distinguish eosinophils from neutrophils by flow cytometry. However, since CD157 is gradually up-regulated throughout bone marrow myeloid maturation, our method cannot be applied to cases characterized by immature myeloid cells.","208":"","209":"We report a 16-year-old male with histiocytic sarcoma (HS) originating in the lung. Partial resection of the lung was performed for a 3-cm mass with a clear boundary detected in the right inferior pulmonary lobe on a health checkup.

The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD68 and CD163, indicating histiocytic lineage and the MIB-1-positive rate was low. Spindle cell morphology of HS is quite rare and only 3 cases of pulmonary HS have previously been reported.

Serum proteinase-3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was positive. Abnormal lymphocytes were found in the cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow. Skin biopsy revealed large atypical lymphoid cells with CD20 positivity lodged in the small vessels and neutrophilic infiltration into the arterial vascular wall with fibrinoid degeneration. A diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma complicated by ANCA-associated vasculitis was made, and rituximab-containing chemotherapy followed by prednisolone was quite effective for both lymphoma and ANCA-associated vasculitis.

This disease usually involves the lymph nodes and, rarely, extra-nodal sites. We report a 62-year-old man presenting skin nodules in the head, body, and extremities, as well as bone marrow involvement. Morphologic analysis of a biopsied specimen from the skin lesion was consistent with IDCS. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the tumor cells were positive for IDCS-associated antigens such as CD4, CD45, CD68 (KP-1), and S-100 protein. Complete remission was achieved by treatment with 6 cycles of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy. Although the optimal treatment of IDSC remains unknown, the experience in the current case supports the notion that ABVD chemotherapy may be effective for IDCS, and further extends this idea to rare patients presenting multiple skin lesions.

In this case of AML after chemotherapy for ATL, we considered that the AML was probably associated with previous chemotherapy for ATL. Although the ATL remained in remission, the therapy-related AML with complex chromosomal abnormalities proved resistant to chemotherapy, and the patient died from complications associated with AML.

Histopathological examination of the lymph nodes revealed reactive lymphadenopathy. He visited our hospital three years after the initial diagnosis because of enlarged left cervical lymph nodes. Histopathologically, both Hodgkin\/Reed-Sternberg (H\/RS) and lymphocyte-predominant (LP) cells were found in the lymph node. We first suspected nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL), because these cells were CD15(-) and CD30(-). However, the diagnosis of lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma (LRCHL) was finally confirmed, because these cells were found to be CD20(-), Bob.1(+), Oct.2(-), and BCL6(-) by additional immunostaining. The patient was treated with six cycles of ABVD chemotherapy, and a complete response was achieved. However, he underwent autologous stem-cell transplantation after high-dose chemotherapy owing to a relapse 10 months after primary treatment. Distingushing LRCHL from NLPHL was difficult in this patient, because histopathological examination showed both H\/RS and LP cells, and immunostaining revealed these cells to be triple negative (CD15(-), CD30(-) and CD20(-)). Accumulation of such cases are necessary to establish better criteria for the differential diagnosis and assessment of clinical behavior.

ATLL is classified into four clinical subtypes based on the clinical manifestation: acute, lymphoma, chronic and smoldering. Approximately half of chronic type ATLL cases progressed to the acute type. We previously demonstrated that genomic alterations related to the cell cycle de-regulation such as CDKN2A and immune escape such as CD58 alteration can serve as predictive biomarkers for acute transformation of the chronic type. Although alteration of TP53, which is known to be a major regulator of cell cycle, has been identified in several types of cancers including acute type ATLL, no copy number alteration of TP53 was found in the chronic type by array comparative genomic hybridization. In the present study, mutation of TP53 was further analyzed by sequencing for these cases as well as HTLV-I carriers with oligo-clonality. However, no TP53 mutation was identified. These results suggested that TP53 mutation plays a role for the later stage of ATLL development.

Of a total of 309 consecutive cases, the following incidences were observed: mature B-cell neoplasms, 77% (n = 239); mature T- and NK-cell neoplasms, 20% (n = 63); classical Hodgkin lymphomas, 0.7% (n = 2); and lymphoblastic lymphomas, 2% (n = 5). Lymphomas were most frequently (57%) detected in the oropharynx. The majority of cases (89%) were mature B-cell neoplasms (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 60%; follicular lymphoma, 10%), and 10% of cases were mature T-cell neoplasms. Six cases of plasma cell neoplasm (4 primary and 2 secondary involvement) and 2 cases of plasmablastic lymphoma in the upper aerodigestive tract were observed. Two out of 3 cases of extraosseous plasmacytoma with available biopsy material were positive for EBER1. All 3 patients received irradiation and achieved complete response; 1 had not relapsed after 17 months and the remaining 2 relapsed as plasma cell myeloma and solitary plasmacytoma of the bone. Of 47 extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type cases in the upper aerodigestive tract, 38 (81%) were present in the sinonasal region and the remaining 9 (19%) were in the oropharynx (n = 4), nasopharynx (n = 3), and oral cavity (n = 2). In conclusion, since both primary lymphoma and secondary involvement of lymphoma are often diagnosed using biopsied materials from the upper aerodigestive tract, pathologists and hematologists should recognize the characteristics of lymphoma in this tissue.

Decrease of genomic hmC is postulated to confer a risk for myeloid-lineage as well as T-cell neoplasms, based on the fact that loss-of-function mutations in the TET2 gene were frequently identified in these diseases. The relationship between hmC and aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that hmC content decreased with age in the peripheral blood T cells of 53 human volunteers. We further identified that the mRNA expression levels of TET1 and TET3 decreased with age, while those of TET2 were not influenced by age. The genomic hmC content was correlated with the mRNA expression level of TET3, but not those of TET1 and TET2.

Despite acyclovir administration, her general condition deteriorated rapidly and she died. Serum varicella zoster virus (VZV) DNA level was shown to be elevated and a diagnosis of disseminated VZV infection was established postmortem.

","220":"In anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is rearranged with diverse partners due to variant translocations\/inversions. Case 1 was a 39-year-old man who developed multiple tumors in the mediastinum, psoas muscle, lung, and lymph nodes. A biopsy specimen of the inguinal node was effaced by large tumor cells expressing CD30, epithelial membrane antigen, and cytoplasmic ALK, which led to a diagnosis of ALK(+) ALCL. Case 2 was a 51-year-old man who was initially diagnosed with undifferentiated carcinoma. He developed multiple skin tumors eight years after his initial presentation, and was finally diagnosed with ALK(+) ALCL. He died of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization using an ALK break-apart probe revealed the rearrangement of ALK and suggested variant translocation in both cases. We applied an inverse cDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) strategy to identify the partner of ALK. Nucleotide sequencing of the PCR products and a database search revealed that the sequences of ATIC in case 1 and TRAF1 in case 2 appeared to follow those of ALK. We subsequently confirmed ATIC-ALK and TRAF1-ALK fusions by reverse transcriptase PCR and nucleotide sequencing. We successfully determined the partner gene of ALK in two cases of ALK(+) ALCL. ATIC is the second most common partner of variant ALK rearrangements, while the TRAF1-ALK fusion gene was first reported in 2013, and this is the second reported case of ALK(+) ALCL carrying TRAF1-ALK.

The diagnoses of these patients included 5 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 3 LPD, and 1 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. At initial diagnosis, 6 patients had advanced-stage RA, and half of these underwent total knee arthroplasty. All patients with RA received methotrexate (MTX) and low-dose prednisolone. Biologics were administered to 4 of 9 patients. After the development of immunodeficiency-associated LPD, MTX discontinuation resulted in 5 complete remissions (CR), 1 partial remission, and 3 cases of stable disease. Relapse was observed in 3 of 5 CR patients in the MTX-withdrawal remission group. Subsequently, conventional chemotherapy, rituximab, and radiation were administered to 4, 3, and 1 patient, respectively. These treatments induced a second CR. In the chemotherapy group, 1 patient developed acute myocardial infarction and another experienced ileus and pulmonary abscess. In the rituximab group, no severe complications were observed. Consequently, all patients remained disease-free during the median 23-month follow-up period. Our results indicate that, depending on the RA disease stage, performance status, and extent of treatment response, less intensive treatments than those commonly indicated for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, involving MTX discontinuation and subsequent therapy containing rituximab, might be an efficient therapeutic strategy for immunodeficiency-associated LPD.

We retrospectively investigated 31 PCNSL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2013 at the University of Miyazaki Hospital. These cases accounted for 4.4% of all nodal or extranodal malignant lymphomas. Histologically, most of these cases were diagnosed as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, while only two cases were considered to be low-grade and high-grade B-cell lymphoma (not otherwise specified). No T-PCNSL was found in this series. In addition, Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs were not detected by in situ hybridization in any of the cases. Overall, no T-PCNSL cases were found in 18 years in a region with a high frequency of HTLV-1 seropositivity, namely, Southwestern Japan.

He also had irregularly shaped masses with low tissue density in the orbital apex on both sides. Bilateral conjunctival biopsy showed subepithelial infiltration with lymphoid cells, positive for CD20, CD5, and cyclin D1, but negative for CD3, CD10, and CD23. Immunohistochemical restaining of the previous bone marrow biopsy specimen demonstrated lymphoid cells positive for cyclin D1, confirming the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma with leukemic presentation. As the case presenting stage IV lymphoma with systemic lymphadenopathy, he underwent 3 courses of combination chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, and then 6 courses of bendamustine with rituximab, leading to complete remission for the following 3 years.

Using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, histological and immunohistochemical analyses, and in situ hybridization (ISH) were performed. AIFH was identified in the tonsils in 12 (2.0%) cases. These included 7 males and 5 females, aged 3 to 19 years (mean, 7). Histologically, there was expansion of the interfollicular areas by polymorphous infiltration resulting in distortion, but not obliteration of the normal tonsillar architecture. In some areas, the lymphoid follicles had hyperplastic germinal centers with ill-defined borders surrounded by sheet-like proliferation of polymorphous infiltrate showing a marginal zone distribution pattern. The infiltrate was composed of small to medium-sized (transformed) lymphocytes and immunoblasts accompanied by numerous plasma cells and plasmacytoid cells, and resembling monocytoid B cells. The numerous immunoblasts were MUM1(+), CD10(-), BCL-6(-). An ISH study demonstrated EBV-encoded small RNA-1 (EBER-1)(+) cells in 9 lesions. Moreover, in 3 lesions, numerous EBER-1(+) cells were present in germinal centers as well as in interfollicular areas. The present study indicated that EBV may cause at least a portion of tonsillar AIFH in children and adolescents.

Based on histological analysis, a diagnosis of CD was made. At four-month follow-up, no additional signs of CD were present and fibrinogen levels returned to the normal range. This report, therefore, signifies the importance for physicians to consider unicentric CD in the differential diagnosis when patients present with elevated levels of plasma fibrinogen.

Recent advances in comprehensive genomic analyses in acute myeloid leukemia have revealed prevalent mutations in regulators of epigenetic phenomena including global DNA methylation status. The examples include mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), IDH2, and ten-eleven translocation 2. These mutations are proposed to inhibit conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5 mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5 hmC), leading to global accumulation of 5 mC. These changes in global DNA methylation status can be visualized immunohistochemically using specific antibodies against 5 mC and 5 hmC. We examined the global DNA methylation status of B-cell lymphomas and that of their normal counterparts by immunohistochemistry for 5 mC and 5 hmC. Non-tumor lymphoid cells inside germinal centers (GC) in reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) were stained positive for 5 mC, but they were negative for 5 hmC. Similarly, follicular lymphomas, whose postulated normal counterparts are centrocytes in GCs, were 5 mC-positive but 5 hmC-negative by immunohistochemistry. This immunostaining pattern was also observed in Burkitt lymphoma. In contrast, non-tumor lymphoid cells in mantle zones were stained positive for 5 mC as well as for 5 hmC. Likewise, most mantle cell lymphomas, whose postulated normal counterparts are mantle zone B cells in RLH, were stained positive for 5 mC as well as for 5 hmC. This immunostaining pattern was also observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/small lymphocytic lymphoma.

CD206 is also considered a marker of alternatively activated macrophages. However, no studies have investigated CD206 and TAMs. In the present study, we investigated the significance of CD204(+) and CD206(+) TAMs in ATLL tissue samples. We also investigated the correlations with the Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67LI) and the number of CD31(+) vessels. We found that the number and ratio of CD204(+) TAMs were closely associated with the Ki-67LI, which reflects lymphoma cell proliferation.

These options can provide prolonged progression-free survival. However, they cannot cure advanced FL. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) remains the sole curative therapy for FL. Allo-SCT has had a major impact with the use of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens because of its lower associated nonrelapse mortality compared with myeloablative regimens. Autologous SCT (auto-SCT) shows high response rates and extends progression-free survival in patients with chemosensitive relapse. In the rituximab era, however, associated comorbidities, risk of secondary cancers, and presence of refractory disease have become problematic in the auto-SCT population. On the basis of results from large-scale randomized trials, upfront auto-SCT is not recommended. Novel conditioning regimens including radioimmunotherapy followed by either auto-SCT or allo-SCT are likely to show efficacy even in chemorefractory disease. Consequently, the optimal timing for SCT remains a matter of opinion, except for patients in first remission. However, the outcomes of allo-SCT and auto-SCT keep on improving. Physicians should note that there is no therapy with a track record equivalent to that of SCT for relapsed or refractory FL.","246":"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common subtype of indolent lymphomas. Several lines of evidence suggest that the prognosis of patients with FL has improved since the introduction of rituximab, although cure cannot be achieved. Although the treatment paradigm for FL has changed over the past decade with the introduction of rituximab and other agents, there is still no standard therapy to fit all patients. Instead, treatment decisions are made taking into consideration disease status (stage, tumor burden, and presence of symptoms) and patient factors including patient preferences. Rituximab-containing chemotherapy such as R-CHOP, R-CVP, and bendamustine plus rituximab is usually recommended for symptomatic patients. However, optimal rituximab-containing chemotherapy has not been established. Rituximab maintenance is one of the post-induction options for patients responding to first-line chemoimmunotherapy. For patients without symptoms and low-tumor burden, both expectant management (watchful waiting) and rituximab monotherapy are reasonable options. A very limited proportion of patients with FL are diagnosed at stage I with rigorous staging using bone marrow biopsy and whole-body imaging with computed tomography (CT) and\/or positron emission tomography\/CT. Although local radiotherapy has been the standard approach for these patients, its role is being questioned. Patients with FL who achieve remission eventually relapse and require salvage therapy.

Further understanding of the pathogenesis of FL is expected to contribute to the development of novel treatment approaches for this disease.","248":"Indolent B-cell lymphomas include follicular lymphoma (FL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia\/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL\/SLL) and marginal zone lymphomas (MZLs). They are a diverse group of disorders with different clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic and genetic features. However, because of several histological similarities, such as in cell size and nodular structure, it may sometimes be difficult to differentiate them and to make a definitive diagnosis. In this review article, we summarize the histopathology of indolent B-cell neoplasms excluding FL and including hairy cell leukemia, and briefly mention recent genetic findings useful for their differential diagnosis. In addition, a provisional subtype of low-grade B-cell lymphoma, \"prolymphocytic\/paraimmunoblastic lymphoma\", is described.","249":"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a heterogeneous disease, and there are many different subgroups, such as in terms of age of onset, involved organ (especially extranodal sites such as gastrointestinal tract) and genetic abnormality. Grade 3B is currently regarded as a distinct entity by molecular genetic analyses, but the independence of Grade 3A remains unclear. Variations of clinical course are known in FL. Some cases are very indolent, but others are not. The latter cases show histological transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (high-grade transformation) and an aggressive course. Histological transformation to DLBCL is reported to occur in about 30-40% of patients, at a rate of about 3% each year. However, it reaches a plateau at about 16 years, so the stratification of patients in whom transformation would or would not occur is very important for the therapeutic strategy. From genome-wide analysis by next-generation sequencing, EZH2, CREBBP and MLL2, which are histone-modifying genes, have been shown to be frequently mutated in FL and to have an important role in lymphomagenesis. IGH-BCL2 translocation and CREBBP mutations are early events, whereas MLL2 and TNFSFR14 mutations represent late events during disease evolution. In the 2008 WHO classification, three new variants: (1) pediatric follicular lymphoma, (2) primary intestinal follicular lymphoma and (3) in situ follicular lymphoma, are included. Pathologists and clinicians should consider these new developments when deciding on the diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.","250":"","251":"","252":null,"253":null,"254":"Granulocytic sarcoma is a rare disease that is rarely curable with conventional chemotherapy.

According to bone marrow assessment and imaging studies, the patient remained in complete remission at 5 years after transplantation. This case suggests that high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation is a therapeutic option for granulocytic sarcoma.","255":null,"256":"Neurolymphomatosis (NL) is a rare clinical entity defined as peripheral nervous system infiltration by lymphoma. The diagnosis is difficult and often elusive. Whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW MRI) was developed to enhance the detection of vaguely delineated tumors. Here, we describe the case of a 71-year-old male with secondary NL of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that was successfully detected by whole-body DW MRI. The patient was diagnosed with DLBCL extending from the ethmoidal sinus to the nasal cavity, orbital cavity, and anterior cranial fossa. Although he was administered R-THP-COP chemotherapy and the tumor remarkably decreased in size, he developed painful paresthesia and weakness in the left upper and bilateral lower extremities during treatment. Because lymphoma cells were detected in his spinal fluid, high-dose methotrexate (MTX) and weekly intrathecal MTX and cytarabine injections were administered. Test results for lymphoma cells in the spinal fluid became negative ; however, the neurological disorders progressed. Whole-body DW MRI was performed as whole-body screening and could localize NL at the left cervical and bilateral lumbar nerve roots. Both cervical spine plain MRI and enhanced computed tomography performed around the same time could not detect the cervical lesion. Our case report suggests that whole-body DW MRI is a useful diagnostic imaging procedure, especially as whole-body screening in facilities where PET\/CT is not available.","257":"We report a rare case of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with mass lesions of skull vault and ileocecum. The patient was an 82-year-old Japanese woman who exhibited a painless subcutaneous scalp tumor in the right parietal region associated with no neurological abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head demonstrated a mass in the skull vault with iso- to hypointense signals on both T1- and T2-weighted imaging. Biopsy of the mass revealed that the tumor comprised large cells that were immunoreactive for CD20 (L-26) and CD79a. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was therefore diagnosed. Further investigation could not identify any other evidence of systemic lymphoma other than ileocecal lesions. She was treated by irradiation (45 Gy) of the mass on the parietal bone and with rituximab, pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine. The patient achieved complete remission after 3 cycles of systemic chemotherapy.

Mild hepatosplenomegaly was the only positive finding on computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography at that time. In May 2012, slight impairment of the liver function was detected again in the patient; an abdominal CT at this time revealed a tumor mass in the right hepatic lobe, so subsegmentectomy of the right hepatic lobe was performed. On the basis of the findings of the resected specimen, primary hepatic circumscribed Burkitt's lymphoma (sporadic form), stage IA, was diagnosed. Multiple cycles of hyper-CVAD\/MTX-Ara-C therapy with concomitant rituximab were administered, under which the patient was successfully maintained in complete remission. To date, at least 15 cases of primary hepatic Burkitt's lymphoma have been reported in the literature; all of the 11 patients without concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had the sporadic form of the disease. Asians were relatively common (7 patients) among these patients, and patients in their childhood or adolescence accounted for a considerable proportion. Therefore, the present case may be regarded as rather typical. The presence of hepatitis virus infection as a background disorder other than HIV is considered to be of profound interest etiologically.","264":null,"265":"Richter syndrome (RS) involves the development of an aggressive lymphoma in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of RS. Extranodal RS occasionally occurs; however, isolated lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) of RS are rarely seen and the features have not been well described. We describe a Japanese patient who developed isolated involvements of the parenchyma of the CNS as a manifestation of RS two years after the initial diagnosis of CLL. DLBCL in the cerebrum was confirmed to be clonally related to the CLL cells by immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) gene analysis, utilizing the identical VH-D-J regions with additional mutations in the IGH variable region.","266":"Portal vein thrombosis is a rare, aggressive and life-threatening complication of liver cirrhosis (LC). Eltrombopag is effective for the treatment of chronic hepatitis with thrombocytopenia, and portal vein thrombosis at this time has rarely been reported. We describe the case of a 78-year-old woman who suffered from LC due to hepatitis C viral infection. The patient developed immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) that was diagnosed on the basis of nasal bleeding, progressive severe thrombocytopenia, elevation of platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG), no response to the transfusion of platelets and no abnormal findings on bone marrow biopsy. Although we first administered prednisolone (0.5 mg\/kg\/day), there was no recovery of platelet function and the nasal bleeding persisted. Subsequently, we administered eltrombopag for refractory ITP at a dose of 12.5 mg\/day, and the thrombocytopenia gradually improved. Fifty-four days after the start of eltrombopag therapy, she developed portal vein thrombosis. Eltrombopag was stopped immediately, and antithrombin III was administered for prophylaxis against further portal vein thrombosis. Despite these treatments, there were subsequent deep vein and pulmonary artery thromboses. We then administered heparin for recanalization of the thrombi. One month after the initiation of heparin, there was recanalization as well as improvements of the portal vein, deep vein and pulmonary artery thromboses. There was no further thrombosis progression after switching from heparin to warfarin therapy. Our case suggests that eltrombopag may increase the risk of portal vein thrombosis ; therefore, this drug must be used carefully in the treatment of ITP in patients with LC due to hepatitis C viral infection.","267":"Here, we report a rare case of double-hit lymphoma, demonstrating t(6;14;18)(p25;q32;q21), suggesting two independent dual-translocations, c-MYC\/BCL-2 and IRF4\/BCL-2. The present case had a rare abnormal chromosome, t(6;14;18)(p25;q32;q21), independently, in addition to known dual-hit chromosomal abnormalities, t(14;18)(q32;q21) and t(8;22)(q24;q11.2). Lymph node was characterized by a follicular and diffuse growth pattern with variously sized neoplastic follicles. The intrafollicular area was composed of centrocytes with a few centroblasts and the interfollicular area was occupied by uniformly spread medium- to large-sized lymphocytes. CD23 immunostaining demonstrated a disrupted follicular dendritic cell meshwork. The intrafollicular tumor cells had a germinal center phenotype with the expression of surface IgM, CD10, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, and MUM1\/IRF4. However, the interfollicular larger cells showed plasmacytic differentiation with diminished CD20, Bcl-2, Bcl-6, and positive intracytoplasmic IgM, and co-expression of MUM1\/IRF4 and CD138 with increased Ki-67-positive cells (&gt; 90%). MUM1\/IRF4 has been found to induce c-MYC expression, and in turn, MYC transactivates MUM1\/IRF4, creating a positive autoregulatory feedback loop. On the other hand, MUM1\/IRF4 functions as a tumor suppressor in c-MYC-induced B-cell leukemia.

In patients with malignant lymphoma, an increased number of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages is closely associated with poor clinical prognosis. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) is an important molecule related to tumor development. Previously we demonstrated that Stat3 activation in primary central nervous system lymphoma cells was significantly associated with the number of M2 TAMs present. Here we report that direct contact with macrophages in culture was required for proliferation of B-cell lymphoma cell lines, and that M2 macrophages induced more proliferation than did M1 macrophages. Stat3 activation in lymphoma cells was involved in this cell-cell interaction. Cytokine array analysis demonstrated that complement 5a (C5a) was detected in supernatants of M2 macrophages, but not in those of M1 macrophages or lymphoma cells. Although we demonstrated M2 macrophage-derived C5a is one of growth factors and a Stat3 activator, C5a was not a predominant molecule associated to lymphoma cell activation induced by M2 macrophages. However, these findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism related to M2 macrophages and lymphoma cell interaction.","270":"The introduction of rituximab (R) has measurably improved the outcome of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). To evaluate the outcome of patients with FL and DLBCL under R plus CHOP therapy, we performed a retrospective analysis in Yokohama City University Hematology Group in Japan. Five hundred and twenty-six patients (158, FL ; 368, DLBCL) were scheduled to undergo primary therapy with 6 cycles of full-dose R-CHOP therapy with curative intent. The median observation periods in living patients with FL and DLBCL were 45 months and 43 months, respectively. The complete response, 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 86%, 50%, and 92% in the FL group, and 89%, 72%, and 80% in the DLBCL group, respectively. Although PFS was significantly better in the DLBCL group than in the FL group, OS was significantly better in FL patients. We also found that the OS and PFS of grade 3 FL patients were not statistically different from those with grade 1-2. These findings indicate that all grades of FL should be categorized simply as \"FL\" with regard to R-CHOP therapy.

The vast majority of previously reported HSs are now generally recognized to be misdiagnosed examples of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, predominantly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The recognition of such tumors parallels the development and widespread use of immunohistochemical techniques, along with the development of molecular genetic methods to detect immunoglobulin (IG) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. The 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) definition of HS requires the absence of clonal B\/T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. However, the 2008 WHO classification no longer strictly requires the absence of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) or TCR gene rearrangement for the diagnosis of HS. Recent studies demonstrated that HSs that occur subsequent to or concurrent with B- or T-lymphoblastic lymphoma\/leukemia or mature B-cell neoplasms generally show clonal IgH and\/or TCR gene rearrangement. These findings suggest the possibility of transdifferentiation of the two otherwise morphologically and immunohistochemically distinctive neoplasms. In addition, a recent study suggested clonal IG gene rearrangements may be detected at a high frequency in sporadic HS, indicating that a large subset of sporadic HSs may inherit the B-lymphocyte genotype.

Finally, the patient was diagnosed with CD5-negative MCL (marginal zone-like variant). As MALT lymphoma and MCL sometimes show similar histological features, they are difficult to distinguish from each other.

We detected scattered Ly6C(+)F4\/80(-) macrophage precursors in the extramedullary hematopoietic foci and liver tissue around the HS lesions. We also showed that certain populations of HS cells express the Ly-6C antigen. These findings suggest that Ly-6C(+) macrophage progenitor cells are a possible cellular origin of murine hepatic HS. Our study identified a novel phenotype of murine HS in two of 18 cases. These cases showed the nodular accumulations of tumor cells with cohesive cytoplasm mimicking the features of epithelioid granuloma. In agreement with the expression of CD204 in epithelioid cells in granulomatous diseases, these HS cells hardly expressed CD204, although the common type HS cells were strongly positive for this antigen. These data suggest that hepatic HS may stem from Ly-6C(+) macrophage precursors. Furthermore, a subset of hepatic HS cases can possibly differentiate into epithelioid cell-like phenotypes.","295":"IgA nephropathy (IgAN), the common primary glomerulonephritis, is a tonsillar focal infection characterized by the qualitative abnormality of IgA in circulation and IgA deposition in the renal mesangium. Mesangial deposition of IgA, which is composed predominantly of poorly galactosylated polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1), seems to be the initiating event in the pathogenesis of IgAN. The origin of poorly galactosylated IgA, however, remains unclear. Recent studies suggest that the mesangial polymeric IgA1 deposition could be derived from mucosally primed plasma cells. B cells may undergo IgA class switching to acquire the expression of IgA via T-cell-dependent or T-cell-independent pathways in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and then differentiate to IgA plasma cells or home in on systemic sites. Dendritic cells, including plasmacytoid dendritic cells and another type of antigen-retaining cell, follicular dendritic cells, have an irreplaceable role in IgA class-switch mechanisms by producing IgA-inducing signals. Furthermore, an increased number of pIgA1-secreting plasma cells in the bone marrow and tonsil, as well as increased IgA class switching, have been found in IgAN, providing a link between the mucosal immunity and IgAN. The favorable effect of tonsillectomy on patients with IgAN showed that tonsillar focal infection may be closely related to pIgA1 deposition in glomerular mesangium of patients with IgAN and at least a part of pIgA1 may originate from affected tonsils. Therefore, the indication for tonsillectomy should be considered in patients with IgA nephropathy, especially at a mild or early stage, to prevent future renal deterioration. In this paper, we focus on IgA class switching and the role of tonsils with focal infection in IgAN.","296":"Multiple myeloma (MM) has been the most intractable hematological disease for many years. Recently, basic and clinical research has advanced remarkably and a new therapeutic strategy has been established. The introduction of high-dose melphalan with autologous stem-cell transplantation and the availability of molecular-targeted novel agents such as immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors have dramatically changed the treatment strategies for MM. Achievement of a high response rate resulted in the extension of overall survival, but further research and the development of more multimodality therapeutic approaches is warranted to cure this disease.","297":"","298":"","299":"","300":null,"301":null,"302":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a clonal neoplasm that shows diverse clinical manifestations and courses of disease progression. The etiology and pathophysiology of LCH remain uncertain. We describe the clinical course of a 23-year-old Japanese woman with multi-system LCH, who showed rapid progression after steroid reduction and developed multi-organ failure. Liver biopsy showed LCH infiltration with fatty degeneration. She was treated with cytarabine, vincristine, and prednisolone according to the Japan LCH study group 02 protocol, without any clinical improvement. Low expression of Ki67 and bcl-2 failed to explain the rapid clinical course. Panhypopituitarism and hypothalamic dysfunction may have caused nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and liver failure. This case indicates that some multi-system LCH patients with hypopituitarism and hypothalamic dysfunction show very rapid progression and are difficult to treat.","303":"We describe a 65-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma (FL), grade 1, stage IV, which occurred concurrently with B lymphoblastic leukemia\/lymphoma. Through the evaluation of FL, the cells that were morphologically suspected of having undergone transformation were found in the bone marrow, and flow cytometric and cytogenetic analyses detected the transformed population that suggested concomitant t(8;22) with typical t(14;18) FL cells. Repeated analyses of the lymph nodes demonstrated the typical morphological, phenotypic, and cytogenetic features of FL. The patient received several multiagent chemotherapy regimens, but the disease gradually became resistant, and the patient died of leukemic progression. In B-cell malignancies, cases involving both BCL2 and MYC translocations simultaneously, so-called \"double-hit leukemia\/lymphoma (DHL)\", have occasionally been reported. Patients with this type of translocation have a very poor clinical outcome, and no standard therapy has been established. In our case, FL was supposed to have transformed into B lymphoblastic leukemia via Burkitt's lymphoma-like phase. Our case is unique in that the transformed DHL cells, derived from clonally related FL cells, showed ongoing transformation from Burkitt-like feature to B lymphoblastic leukemia exclusively in the bone marrow, which suggests that the bone marrow may provide a preferable milieu for malignant transformation. Similar cases should be accumulated and analyzed carefully.","304":null,"305":"Aggressive natural killer cell leukemia (ANKL) is a rare malignant disease of NK cells that has a median survival of less than 2 months and a strong association with the Epstein-Barr virus. Herein, we report three Japanese cases of the disease. A 21-year male patient, a 31-year female patient, and a 76-year female patient presented with high fever, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe liver damage. All three cases had granular lymphocytes in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. The phenotype of these cells was CD2(+)CD3(-)CD56(+)HLA-DR(+). All cases had a high copy number of serum Epstein-Barr virus DNA in the peripheral blood and were diagnosed with ANKL. Case 1 and Case 2 were treated with chemotherapy, but suffered from gross intestinal bleeding or massive bleeding in the cerebellum, resulting in death. Although not treated with chemotherapy, Case 3 also suffered gross bleeding from an atypical duodenal ulcer and died from hemorrhagic shock 15 days after admission. There have been no previous reports of such acute lethal hemorrhagic complications with ANKL. The present cases suggest that patients with ANKL need a sufficient supply of coagulation factors, and that chemotherapy for this disease should be carefully designed with promising agents. [J Clin Exp Hematopathol 52(2) : 101-106, 2012].","306":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although many investigations have been performed on the prognostic factors of DLBCL, no reports have focused on localized nodal DLBCL. We examined the prognostic significance of 39 Japanese patients with localized nodal DLBCL with special reference to the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) versus non-germinal center B-cell-like (NGCB) types. The median age was 65 years with 23 males and 16 females. Using Hans algorithm of immunohistochemistry, 18 patients (46%) exhibited GCB type and 21 (54%) exhibited NGCB type. Twenty-nine patients (74%) presented with disease in the neck (neck group) and 10 (26%) had disease in non-neck regions (non-neck group). Comparing Hans, Choi, and Muris algorithms, patients with GCB type showed statistically significant progression-free survival (PFS) only with Hans algorithm (P = 0.022, P = 0.100, and P = 0.130, respectively). Patient survival analyses revealed that GCB-type patients by Hans algorithm had a better PFS (P = 0.012), and neck-group patients had better PFS and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.018 and P = 0.012, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that only neck vs. non-neck exhibited a significant difference in terms of OS (P = 0.026). Multivariate analysis revealed that GCB type by Hans algorithm and neck vs. non-neck were significantly different in terms of PFS (P = 0.025 and P = 0.033, respectively). Therefore, the subclassifications of GCB type vs. NGCB type and neck vs. non-neck are important predictive prognostic factors in localized nodal DLBCL.","307":"Polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by low serum total cholesterol despite its association with vascular events such as myocardial and cerebral infarction. Serum cholesterol level has not been used as a diagnostic criterion for PV since the 2008 revision of the WHO classification. Therefore, we revisited the relationship between serum lipid profile, including total cholesterol level, and erythrocytosis. The medical records of 34 erythrocytosis patients (hemoglobin : men, &gt; 18.5 g\/dL ; women, &gt; 16.5 g\/dL) collected between August 2005 and December 2011 were reviewed for age, gender, and lipid profiles. The diagnoses of PV and non-PV erythrocytosis were confirmed and the in vitro efflux of cholesterol into plasma in whole blood examined. The serum levels of total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Ch), and apolipoproteins A1 and B were lower in PV than in non-PV patients. The in vitro release of cholesterol into the plasma was greater in PV patients than in non-PV and non-polycythemic subjects. Serum total cholesterol, LDL-Ch, and apolipoproteins A1 and B levels are lower in patients with PV than in those with non-PV erythrocytosis. The hypocholesterolemia associated with PV may be attributable to the sequestration of circulating cholesterol into the increased number of erythrocytes.","308":"","309":"","310":"","311":"It has recently been reported that hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in patients with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative lymphoma during or after cytotoxic therapy occurs after the use of rituximab and stem cell transplantation for hematologic malignancies. However, clinical data on HBV reactivation in multiple myeloma patients have not been extensively reported. This is the first reported case of HBV reactivation in an HBsAg-negative myeloma patient treated with bortezomib (BOR) as salvage therapy and not stem cell transplantation. By closely monitoring HBV-DNA and early administration of entecavir, severe hepatitis was avoided and BOR therapy was continued. We suggest the importance of close monitoring of HBV-DNA for transplant-ineligible myeloma patients treated with BOR as salvage therapy.","312":"A retrospective analysis of 71 patients newly diagnosed with refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD) revealed that 12 developed refractory anemia with an excess of blasts or acute myeloblastic leukemia. Before the diagnosis of RCUD was made, phenotypes of cells in the bone marrow (BM) blast region were analyzed using flow cytometry. Patients with RCUD were divided into two groups ; those with no progression (Group A) and those with disease progression later on (Group B). The cell composition in the BM blast region differed significantly between the groups : Group A showed higher percentages of B lymphoid cells but lower percentages of myeloid cells. A cut-off value of 20 for the CD33\/CD10 ratio in the BM blast region clearly separated Group A from Group B. These results suggest that cell composition in the BM blast region evaluated by flow cytometry may indicate the progression of RCUD.","313":null,"314":"IgG4-related disease is a recently proposed clinical entity with several unique clinicopathological features. A chronic inflammatory state with marked fibrosis, which can often be mistaken for malignancy, especially by clinical imaging analyses, unifies these features. In the present report, we describe a case of IgG4-producing mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma mimicking IgG4-related disease. The patient was a 55-year-old male who was being followed for right orbital tumor over 1.5 years. The lesion had recently increased in size, so a biopsy was performed. Histologically, the lesion was consistent with IgG4-related disease ; however, IgG4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt; plasma cells showed immunoglobulin light-chain restriction and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement was detected in the lesion. Therefore, the lesion was diagnosed as IgG4-producing mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. In conclusion, in histological diagnosis of IgG4-related disease, it is important to examine not only IgG4-immunostain but also immunoglobulin light-chain restriction.","315":"In February 2002, a 42-year-old woman developed ocular adnexal extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), MALT lymphoma, in the bilateral orbits involving lacrimal glands. She underwent 30 Gy external beam irradiation to the orbital lesions on both sides. She was well until November 2008 when she developed abdominal lymphadenopathy and transabdominal excisional biopsy showed mixed cellularity classical Hodgkin lymphoma at stage II. She underwent standard combination chemotherapy. In July 2010, she developed systemic lymphadenopathy and was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by cervical lymph node biopsy. She underwent rituximab monotherapy and finally allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in October 2010, but died of renal failure in February 2011. Amplification by polymerase chain reaction of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene gave rise to dominant discrete fragments of the same size between the orbital lesion with MALT lymphoma in 2002 and the cervical lymph node lesion with DLBCL in 2010. The sequential development of MALT lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and DLBCL in the long-term course of this patient suggests the common origin of the neoplastic cells, changing their pathological faces in response to irradiation and combination chemotherapy.","316":"Among lymphoproliferative disorders, lymph node infarction appears to be most frequently seen in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, followed by follicular lymphoma, with other types being rare. We experienced one such case, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL) associated with lymph node infarction, in which Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells were positive for CD15, CD30, fascin, PAX-5, p53, latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1), Bcl-2, and EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated RNAs. Furthermore, RS cells in the infarcted area were still positive for CD30, fascin, p53, and Bcl-2. For definitive diagnosis of nodal lymphomas including Hodgkin's lymphoma, identification of the effacement of normal nodal architecture is essential. Although this could not be evaluated in our case because of predominant reactive follicular hyperplasia with interfollicular distribution of RS cells, the presence of large cells with RS cell-related molecules together with the distorted distribution of cCD3-positive cells and CD20-positive cells led us to make a definitive diagnosis of cHL. It is, therefore, considered that immunohistochemical evaluation of the infarcted lymph node is, at least on some occasions, still informative for more accurate diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasia. Hodgkin's lymphoma should also be considered when one encounters lymph node infarction.","317":"Tuberculous meningoencephalitis is a rare disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. We report a patient with hairy cell leukemia in complete remission who, after a single cycle of chemotherapy with cladribine, presented fever and neurological deficits. Laboratory diagnosis of tuberculous meningoencephalitis was made by polymerase chain reaction testing for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in cerebrospinal fluid. Despite the prompt institution of antitubercular-therapy, patient's general condition did not improve and he died. Mycobacterial infection should be considered in patients with intra-cranial lesions, affected by hematological malignancies and persistent immunosuppression.","318":"Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a clinically aggressive tumor derived from the precursor of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We describe two cases of BPDCN. In case 1, the patient presented with multiple erythema on the trunk and arms. Histopathology of a skin biopsy specimen and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the tumor cells were small to medium-sized with a blastoid morphology and positive for CD4, CD56, CD123 and T-cell leukemia-1 (TCL-1). In case 2, the patient presented with a solitary skin nodule and rapidly developed involvement of the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Although immunohistochemistry of the infiltrating tumor cells demonstrated positivity for CD4, CD56, CD123 and TCL-1, the cells were large with a distinct nucleolus, and different from those of typical BPDCN. The atypical morphological features of BPDCN may be diagnostically problematic, and should therefore be recognized correctly.","319":"CADM1\/TSLC1 (Cell adhesion molecule 1\/Tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1) is a cell adhesion molecule that was originally identified as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer. CADM1\/TSLC1 expression is reduced in a variety of cancers via promoter methylation, and this reduction is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic potential. In contrast, we observed that CADM1\/TSLC1 is highly and ectopically expressed in all primary adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma (ATLL) cells and in most human T-cell leukemia virus type (HTLV)-1-infected T-cell and ATLL cell lines. No expression, however, was detected in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt; T cells or in several other non-HTLV-1-infected leukemia cells. Moreover, we identified that high CADM1\/TSLC1 expression plays an important role in enhanced cell-cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium, tumor growth and the ability of ATLL cells to infiltrate organs. We developed various antibodies as diagnostic tools to identify CADM1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt; ATLL cells. Using flow cytometry, we determined that CADM1\/TSLC1 is present on the surface of ATLL cells. The percentage of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt;CADM1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt; cells in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients was highly correlated with the DNA copy number of HTLV-1 in lymphocytes. In particular, we identified the soluble form of CADM1\/TSLC1 in the peripheral blood of HTLV-1 carriers and ATLL patients. Therefore, measurements of soluble CADM1\/TSLC1 serum levels and the detection of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt;CADM1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;\/sup&gt; cells in the blood, when combined with standard diagnostic methods, would be useful for identifying and monitoring disease progression in HTLV-1 carriers. Such tests would provide increased accuracy and may aid in early diagnosis and in determining the effects of ATLL treatments.","320":"In this review, representative types of granulomatous lymphadenitis (GLA) are described. GLA can be classified as noninfectious GLA and infectious GLA. Noninfectious GLA includes sarcoidosis and sarcoid-like reaction. The cause of sarcoidosis remains unknown, but it has good prognosis. Sarcoid-like reaction, which is considered to be a biological defense mechanism, is observed in regional lymph nodes with many underlying diseases. Infectious GLA can be classified as suppurative lymphadenitis (LA) and nonsuppurative LA. Suppurative LA generally shows follicular hyperplasia and sinus histiocytosis in the early phase. In tularemia and cat scratch disease, monocytoid B lymphocytes (MBLs) with T cells and macrophages contribute to the formation of granuloma. However, none of the epithelioid cell granulomas of Yersinia LA contains MBLs like in cat scratch disease. In addition, almost all have a central abscess in granulomas induced by Gram-negative bacteria. In terms of the lymph nodes, tularemia and cat scratch disease are apt to affect the axillary and cervical regions while Yersinia LA affects the mesenteric lymph node. Nonsuppurative LA includes tuberculosis and BCG-histiocytosis. These are induced by delayed allergic reaction of M. tuberculosis. Tuberculosis LA mainly appears in the cervical lymph node. Organisms are histologically detected by Ziehl-Neelsen staining in the necrotic area. Toxoplasmosis is also a nonsuppurative protozoan infection (Toxoplasma gondii). In toxoplasma LA, MBLs can also be seen, but round and organized, well-formed granulomas are not found in this disease. Furthermore, necrosis is not induced and there are no accompanying neutrophils, eosinophils and fibrosis. GLA described above is associated with characteristic histological findings. An accurate pathological diagnosis using the above findings can lead to precise treatment.","321":"","322":"","323":"Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 20 (del 20q) has been observed in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or myeloid malignancies. We experienced an MDS female case of del 20q accompanied by clusters of plasmacytic cells in bone marrow. Her bone marrow cells showed morphological abnormalities in three lineages and the chromosomal abnormality of 46, XX, del (20) (q11.2q13.3). Although the percentage of plasma cells was low in free cells, such cells showed nuclear abnormalities. In bone marrow clots, we also observed clusters of anti-CD38 and anti-CD138 antibody-positive cells. According to the FAB or WHO classification, the diagnosis was unclear. Therefore, we were obliged to term this case as MDS with plasma cell dysplasia. This patient was considered to be a rare case of MDS related to abnormalities in myeloid and B-lymphoid cells.","324":null,"325":null,"326":null,"327":"Fournier's syndrome is the fulminant necrotizing fasciitis of the external genitalia. The occurrence of Fournier's syndrome in patients with hematologic malignancies has been reported. Here we report a case of an intravascular lymphoma complicated with Fournier's syndrome due to multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP). A 71-year-old Japanese man received intensive chemotherapy for recurring intravascular lymphoma. Blood culture revealed MDRP, and physical examination led to the diagnosis of Fournier's syndrome. Aggressive treatment that comprised granulocyte transfusion, granulocyte stimulating factor, endotoxin filtration, appropriate antibiotic coverage, and aggressive surgical therapy was administered, and this lead to the successful recovery from sepsis and Fournier's syndrome.","328":"The prognosis of adult Burkitt lymphoma (BL) has improved in western countries since the introduction of high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)-containing chemotherapy. Here we analyzed nine consecutive Japanese patients diagnosed with BL at our institution. All except for the three elderly (&gt; 70 years) patients were treated with a regimen including 13 g\/m(2) HD-MTX in total, divided into 3 cycles. The median follow-up period was 56 months (range 38-118). All the nine patients achieved complete remission and have not shown any disease progression, including the three elderly patients who received reduced doses or alternative treatments. These observations suggest that chemotherapy including 13 g\/m(2) HD-MTX in total is tolerable and effective in Japanese adult BL patients aged &lt; 70 and that BL is curable even if developed in those who are &gt; 70 years.","329":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a clinical entity with high mortality and is characterized by multiple organ failure caused by activation of systemic intravascular coagulation. Although a standard treatment for DIC has not been established owing to the absence of randomized controlled trials, recent reports have indicated that recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) is effective against DIC. To elucidate the clinical characteristics and outcomes of DIC, we retrospectively analyzed 35 DIC patients treated with rTM at our institution over a 2-year period (infectious disease: 21 cases; hematological disease: 14 cases). Diagnosis of DIC was based on the diagnostic criteria for DIC of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare. In addition to the treatment of underlying diseases, we administered rTM for 6 consecutive days. Twenty-one (60.0%) of the DIC patients attained resolution of DIC at 7 days after administration (infectious disease: 61.9%; hematological disease: 57.1%). Furthermore, 7 of the remaining 14 DIC patients (who did not attain resolution at 7 days) attained resolution at an average of 12.1 days. Consequently, 28 (80.0%) of the 35 patients were alive with resolution of DIC after a 28-day observation period (infectious disease: 76.2%; hematological disease: 85.7%). Among them, for 7 (70%) of the 10 DIC patients with severe life-threatening bleeding symptoms without hemorrhagic shock, treatment with heparin was contraindicated; these patients were successfully treated with rTM without the progression of hemorrhage. In the majority of DIC patients, rTM administration may be an effective, safe, and feasible therapeutic modality producing a good outcome.","330":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is one of the most aggressive malignant lymphomas with a median survival of less than 20~40 months. Interest in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) has increased during the past decade because Stat3 activation was found to contribute to tumor progression by inducing angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and metastasis. We previously demonstrated a significant correlation between Stat3 activation in tumor cells and infiltrating anti-inflammatory (M2) macrophages. Here, we focused on the phenotypes of infiltrating macrophages\/microglial cells and Stat3 activation in PCNSL cells. The correlation of Stat3 activation or density of M2 macrophage infiltration with patient prognosis was also evaluated. We performed immunostaining for CD68, CD163, CD204, and pStat3 using paraffin-embedded PCNSL specimens obtained from 43 patients. CD163 and CD204 served as markers of the M2 phenotype. Dense infiltration of CD68(+) macrophages was found in all samples. High numbers of CD163(+) and CD204(+) M2 macrophages\/microglial cells were observed in 29 and 25 cases, respectively. Stat3 activation in lymphoma cells was enhanced in the patients who showed denser infiltration of CD163(+) macrophages\/microglial cells in tumor tissues. In vitro co-culture experiment to investigate cell-cell interactions between macrophages and lymphoma cells found that Stat3 in lymphoma cells was strongly activated by co-culture with macrophages. Numbers of CD68(+), CD163(+), and CD204(+) tumor-associated macrophages\/microglial cells (TAMs) and Stat3 activation in lymphoma cells were not correlated with prognosis. However, because Stat3 involvement in tumor development was demonstrated in several malignant tumors, our present finding that cell-cell interactions of M2 macrophage\/microglial cells with lymphoma cells induced Stat3 activation may provide novel insights into PCNSL pathogenesis.","331":"Toll like receptor (TLR), one of the key functions of innate immune system, can recognize not only exogenous pathogen-associated molecular patterns, namely PAMPs, but also endogenous molecules created upon tissue injury, sterile inflammation and degeneration. Endogenous TLR ligands are called as damage-associated molecular patters (DAMPs), including endogenous molecules released by activated and necrotic cells, and extracellular matrix molecules. DAMPs are also known as alarmins. TLR research has brought about new insights in the rheumatic diseases. Previous reports suggest that TLRs and the signal pathways intensively contribute to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other arthritic conditions with interaction of various TLR ligands. Accumulated knowledge of TLR system is summarized to overlook TLRs and the signaling pathway in arthritis conditions, with special reference to RA.","332":"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is associated with organ failure and it is often fatal condition. The main underlying diseases are infection, hematological malignancy and solid cancer. DIC is subclassified into overt DIC and non-overt DIC. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) published the diagnostic criteria for DIC after several recent clinical trials. These diagnostic criteria are modified versions of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (JMHLW) criteria. The JAAM diagnostic criteria demonstrated excellent sensitivity for mortality but low specificity. The mechanisms of onset of DIC vary based on the underlying diseases, and depend on tissue factor, cytokines, etc. Early diagnosis and early treatment for DIC are important, and the use of hemostatic molecular markers is necessary to successfully make an early and rapid diagnosis. The mortality of DIC might be improved by the administration of recombinant activated protein C or recombinant thrombomodulin. Further investigation to improve the mortality of DIC is required, including new methods for diagnosing and treating the disease.","333":"","334":"We present a case of life-threatening Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with severe hepatitis that was successfully treated by allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor. A 26-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with a high fever and liver dysfunction. Laboratory tests, including bone marrow aspiration, revealed severe HLH that occurred after EBV infection. High-dose methylprednisolone and etoposide therapy did not control the disease. We could control the HLH, but the EBV viremia continued following the CHOPE (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and etoposide) chemotherapy regimen. Therefore, the patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched, unrelated donor. The patient has remained in good condition without disease recurrence for 2 years after bone marrow transplantation. Although there is no consensus regarding allogeneic stem cell transplantation for EBV-HLH, it is the treatment of choice for aggressive EBV-HLH when the patient is refractory to intensive chemotherapy.","335":"The purpose of this study is to report on a patient who developed conjunctival lesions of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) after radiation to skin lesions of the same pathological type. A 79-year-old man developed salmon-pink lesions in the lower fornix of the conjunctiva of both eyes and biopsy revealed BPDCN. One and a half years previously, he noticed an erythematous plaque with a 30-mm diameter, which later became multiple, on the left chest, and the biopsy revealed BPDCN. The bone marrow was negative for CD56-positive cells, but fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of peripheral blood cells revealed a group of cells positive for CD4 and CD56, or CD4 and CD123. The monocyte fraction, in an increased percentage of white blood cell counts, did contain atypical cells positive for the three markers. Whole-body 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography demonstrated no abnormal uptake lesions. He received 30 Gy of radiation to the chest lesions, and later, the same dose of radiation to novel skin lesions on the back, waist, and chest, and also to pharyngeal lesions. In conclusion, the conjunctiva could be involved with BPDCN and pathological differential diagnosis by biopsy is mandatory to establish the correct diagnosis.","336":"Double-hit lymphoma (DHL) is a rare and extremely unfavorable type of lymphoma with concurrent chromosomal translocations of BCL2 and MYC. It is considered that BCL2 translocation precedes MYC events in lymphomagenesis of DHL. In fact, most cases of DHL arise de novo or following FL. We describe a very rare case of DHL arising from Burkitt-like lymphoma according to the revised European-American classification of lymphoid neoplasms. A 67-year-old Japanese male presented with persistent fever. [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography revealed multiple abnormal accumulations in the bone marrow, pancreas, and periphery of the left kidney. The patient was diagnosed with Burkitt-like lymphoma according to a bone marrow biopsy. At the disease onset and the first relapse, chemotherapy was effective and the patient experienced sustained and complete remission. At the second relapse, however, the clinical presentation and morphology of lymphoma cells were nearly identical, but a high level of chemoresistance was acquired, and the patient succumbed almost 1 month after hospitalization. Chromosomal analyses revealed a complex karyotype with concurrent t(14;18) and t(8;22) translocations, which have not been previously detected. It is therefore important to note that DHL cannot be diagnosed without chromosomal analysis. Cytogenetic analyses should thus be performed for patients with high-grade B-cell lymphoma and who experience a recurrence of this lymphoma.","337":"B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma (iDLBCL\/BL) is a newly categorized lymphoma in the WHO Classification of Tumors of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues v4. This lymphoma has characteristics of both DLBCL and BL, morphologically and genetically. We report a case with therapy-resistant iDLBCL\/BL, which used to be categorized as BL in the WHO Classification v3. This case showed strong BCL2 staining, otherwise exhibiting features of BL. The case was treated with intensive chemotherapy containing high-dose methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and cytarabine. However, soon after the chemotherapy, the lymphoma relapsed in the central nervous system and was resistant to whole-brain radiation therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient died 37 days after the transplantation. The clinical course was different from that of typical BL in terms of resistance to intensive chemotherapy, in agreement with the characteristics of iDLBCL\/BL.","338":"To clarify the clinical outcome of peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs), we conducted a retrospective review comparing the outcomes of patients with PTCL (nodal peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified, n=34 ; angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, n=12) to those with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n=48). All patients received CHOP-based chemotherapy without rituximab. PTCL patients presented at a more advanced clinical stage (91% vs. 65%, P&lt;0.002) with a poorer performance status (26% vs. 17%, P&lt;0.002) than DLBCL patients. The complete response rate among PTCL patients was significantly lower than among DLBCL patients (39% vs. 67%, P&lt;0.008), as was the 3-year overall survival rate (26% vs. 50%, P=0.005), and Cox multivariate analysis revealed immunophenotype, performance status, and extranodal site involved to be significantly associated with shorter overall survival (P=0.045, P=0.007, and P=0.034, respectively). Our findings suggest that PTCL patients tend to have a poor prognosis associated with several initial risk factors. Moreover, the T-cell phenotype itself appears to have a significant impact on overall survival. Thus, standard CHOP chemotherapy may be inadequate for PTCLs, especially in patients with high-risk factors. The development of newly stratified therapies for the treatment of PTCLs would be highly desirable.","339":"Natural killer (NK) cell lymphomas are rare malignancies. They are classified as extranodal NK\/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, and aggressive NK cell leukemia. NK cell neoplasms are prevalent in Asian and South American populations, but are extremely rare in the West. They can be classified clinically into nasal, non-nasal, and aggressive lymphoma\/leukemia subtypes. For nasal NK cell lymphomas, combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy are indicated for stage I\/II disease. Chemotherapy is the main treatment for stage III\/IV nasal NK cell lymphomas, as well as the non-nasal and aggressive subtypes. Regimens containing drugs not affected by the P-glycoprotein, particularly in combination with L-asparaginase, have resulted in much improvement in treatment outcome for high-risk, refractory or relapsed patients. Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation should be considered for selected patients. Epstein-Barr virus DNA load as a surrogate marker for prognostication, and clinical stratification of patients should be incorporated in clinical management algorithms.","340":null,"341":"Translocation of the BCL2 gene on the chromosome band 18q21.3 results in consistent expression of the Bcl2 protein, an apoptosis inhibitor. BCL2 usually translocates to the immunoglobulin (IG) heavy chain (IGH) gene as t(14;18)(q32;q21.3) and rarely to IG light chain (IGK, IGL) loci as t(2;18)(p11;q21.3) or t(18;22)(q21.3;q11). The t(14;18) translocation is observed in 70-95% of follicular lymphoma cases and 20-30% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases. The MYC gene on chromosome band 8q24 acts as an accelerator of cell proliferation. MYC translocates to 14q32\/IGH as t(8;14)(q24;q32) or less commonly to 2p11\/IGK as t(2;8)(p11;q24) or 22q11\/IGL as t(8;22)(q24;q11). The 8q24\/MYC translocation is detected in nearly all Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and up to 10% of DLBCL cases. Both translocations rarely occur in an identical cell and this lymphoid malignancy is termed BCL2 and MYC dual-hit lymphoma\/leukemia (DHL). The pathological diagnosis in most cases of DHL with BCL2-IG and MYC-IG translocation is B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL, although DLBCL is most common in DHL with BCL2-IG and MYC-nonIG translocation. The frequency of DHL with BCL2 and MYC translocation is estimated at around 2% of all B-cell malignancies. The condition is characterized by elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, the presence of B symptoms, bone marrow involvement, advanced disease stage, extranodal involvement, and central nervous system (CNS) involvement at presentation or disease progression. Despite treatment strategies including CNS-targeted therapy, the prognosis for DHL is extremely poor. In this review, the current knowledge of the clinicopathological status of DHL is summarized and discussed.","342":"CHOP therapy combined with rituximab (R-CHOP) is currently a standard chemotherapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, relapse is detected despite R-CHOP in approximately 30% of patients. Treatment results should be further improved. Previously, second- and third-generation therapies such as MACOP-B, m-BACOD, and ProMACE-CytaBOM were performed to improve the results of DLBCL treatment. However, dose intensity (DI) enhancement increased treatment-associated toxicity, and the treatment results did not improve. Recently, the entity of the relative dose intensity (RDI) was proposed as an index of the intensity of chemotherapy. In this method, the ratio of actual DI to the DI designed per specific period is numerically evaluated. The purpose of calculating the RDI is to achieve chemotherapy as scheduled while maintaining the DI, and not to improve the DI. Previous studies reported that the maintenance of the RDI during CHOP therapy improved the treatment results. In this paper, we review DI and RDI in studies of DLBCL, and revisit the significance of these indicators.","343":"","344":"A 70-year-old female with a long history of progressive leukocytopenia and giant splenomegaly is described. She had no clinically manifested rheumatoid arthritis, although she complained of slight arthralgia in the digital joints, wrists and ankles at irregular intervals. Repeated bone marrow aspirations showed no cellular atypism, chromosomal abnormalities, or phenotypical abnormalities. Just before splenectomy, both anti-neutrophil antibody positivity and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody positivity were shown. Histology of the splenectomized spleen showed follicular hyperplasia with plasmacyte infiltration and extramedullary hematopoeisis. After splenectomy, leukocyte counts returned to normal with normal leukocyte differentials and anti-neutrophil antibodies disappeared. She was almost free of arthralgia one year after splenectomy, although the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody titers remained high.","345":"We report two cases of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) with CD20(+) B-cell lymphoma. They were treated by several courses of CHOP-based chemotherapy containing rituximab. We confirmed by flow cytometric analysis that both of them completely lost CD19(+) and CD20(+) B-cells from their peripheral blood after the first course of chemotherapy. They were successfully treated with Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) after the diagnosis of PCP by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We overviewed CD20(+) B-cell lymphoma patients treated with CHOP-based regimens from 1997 until 2005 in our hospital. We treated 114 patients with and 121 patients without rituximab. Five patients in the group with rituximab developed interstitial pneumonia (IP). Two of them were confirmed to have PCP and the other three were suspected cases ; however, no patients with IP were seen in the group without rituximab. We strongly suggest the necessity of PCP prophylaxis with oral TMP-SMX when treating B-cell lymphoma patients with chemotherapy containing rituximab.","346":"We report a case of primary pulmonary classical Hodgkin lymphoma (CHL) in a 58-year-old woman. Twelve years ago, the patient complained of slight fever and weight loss. A mass of about 5 cm in diameter was seen in the right lung on radiography and computed tomography (CT). Right total pneumonectomy and resection of mediastinal lymph nodes were performed. A pathological examination led to a strong suspicion of Hodgkin disease (HD) (now referred to as CHL), but a definite diagnosis could not be made at the time. Six years later, a chest CT showed a tumor around the ascending aorta, which was treated successfully by radiation therapy. Six years later, the chest CT revealed a tumor in the anterior mediastinum. CHL was diagnosed based on an immunohistochemical re-examination of lung specimens resected 12 years earlier and CT-guided fine needle tumor biopsy specimens of the second recurrent tumor in the anterior mediastinum were compatible with the recurrence of CHL. Therefore, we diagnosed this case as primary pulmonary CHL that later relapsed in the mediastinum. The tumor size was reduced by radiation therapy and the patient is currently under observation as an outpatient.","347":"Mediastinal gray zone lymphoma (MGZL) represents a range of tumors possessing characteristics of both nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma (NSHL) and mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLBCL). Here we report two patients with MGZL. Patient 1 was a 30-year-old woman and patient 2 was a 22-year-old man. Both patients had a mediastinal mass, were initially diagnosed with NSHL and exhibited resistance to first-line chemotherapy. Re-biopsy of the relapsed tumors or the residual lesion was performed and based on the findings the tumors were diagnosed as MGZL. In patient 1, the morphological features of the tumor resembled those of NSHL, but the immunophenotypic features indicated MLBCL. In patient 2, the tumor was a composite lymphoma with both NSHL and MLBCL components. Both the patients received high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation. Although there is an overlap in the biological and morphological features between NSHL and MLBCL, the therapeutic approaches to NSHL and MLBCL are quite different. The development of effective therapies for MGZL is therefore extremely critical.","348":"The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship of ocular adnexal benign or reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, including orbital pseudotumor, with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-related diseases. Medical charts of 9 consecutive patients with ocular adnexal benign lymphoid lesions, seen in the Department of Ophthalmology, Okayama University Hospital, were reviewed, and pathological sections were restained immunohistochemically for IgG4-, IgG-, and CD138-positive plasma cells. The diagnosis of IgG4-positive lesions was based on 10 or more IgG4-positive plasma cells in a high-power field and greater than 40% ratios of IgG4-positive plasma cells\/CD138-positive plasma cells and IgG4-positive plasma cells\/IgG-positive plasma cells. IgG4-positive lesions were determined as absent in 5 patients (4 with bilateral lacrimal\/orbital lesions and one with a unilateral conjunctival lesion), none of whom showed systemic manifestations. In contrast, IgG4-positive lesions were present in 4 patients (3 with bilateral lacrimal\/orbital lesions and one with a unilateral lacrimal\/orbital lesion), who showed systemic manifestations : one with Hashimoto thyroiditis, one with IgG4-positive bilateral interstitial lung disease and hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor, one with bilateral interstitial lung disease, and one with systemic lymphadenopathy and antiphospholipid syndrome. In conclusion, IgG4-positive ocular adnexal benign lymphoid lesions might be used as a benchmark for the probable presence of other systemic lymphoid lesions.","349":"B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) is one of three known receptors for BAFF. BAFF-R is required for B-cell maturation and survival. We tried to determine the normal pattern of BAFF-R expression in non-neoplastic and neoplastic B- and T-cells. We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression pattern of BAFF-R in non-neoplastic and neoplastic lymphoid tissues of routinely fixed paraffin-embedded samples, and examined the relationships among BAFF-R and expressions of CD10, bcl-6, MUM-1, and MIB-1. BAFF-R expression was detected on B-cells of the mantle zones, some cells within germinal centers, and scattered cells in the interfollicular areas of reactive lymph nodes. BAFF-R expression was only found in B-cell lymphoma (60\/120, positive samples\/examined samples), but not in T\/NK cell lymphoma (0\/10) or Hodgkin lymphoma (0\/10). The proportions were as follows : follicular lymphoma (14\/16), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (27\/61), mantle cell lymphoma (4\/4), and Burkitt lymphoma (0\/4). According to Hans' criteria, DLBCLs were subclassified into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and non-germinal center B-cell-like (non-GCB) types. Interestingly, in nodal lymphomas, in the GCB subgroup (n=12), 9 of 12 (75%) were positive for BAFF-R, while 6 of 20 (30%) were positive in the non-GCB subgroup (n=20) (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, expression of BAFF-R related to lower MIB-1 index was associated with GCB-type DLBCL. In conclusion, BAFF-R was only found in some B-cell lymphomas, which was closely associated with the expression pattern in normal counterparts, although BAFF-R expression on follicular lymphoma is different from that on germinal center cells, which is similar to bcl-2. BAFF-R was rather specifically related to low growth activity of GCB-type DLBCL of nodal origin.","350":null,"351":null,"352":"We investigated the priming effect and mechanism of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in chemotherapy with low-dose Ara-C and VP-16 for acute myeloid leukemia. We analyzed cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle in vitro using leukemia cell lines 32Dcl3, U937, HL-60, and Ba\/F3. Cell proliferation assays were performed using the Trypan Blue dye exclusion method. For detection of apoptosis, the Annexin V-binding capacity of treated cells was examined by flow cytometry. To evaluate the cell cycle, we used an FITC BrdU Flow kit and conducted analysis by flow cytometry. The combination of Ara-C and VP-16 significantly enhanced the observed effects compared with those of Ara-C or VP-16 alone. Concurrent administration of G-CSF further reduced the cell number and viability of 32Dcl3 and U937 cells, but not of HL-60 and Ba\/F3 cells. Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in number by the addition of G-CSF to 32Dcl3 and U937 cells, while G-CSF had no significant effect on HL-60 and Ba\/F3 cell lines. The addition of G-CSF significantly decreased the percentage of G0\/G1-phase cells and significantly increased that of S-phase cells among 32Dcl3 and U937 cells. No significant effect was observed for HL-60 and Ba\/F3 cells. An enhancement was confirmed for the combination of Ara-C, VP-16, and G-CSF for 32Dcl3 and U937 cells but not for HL-60 and Ba\/F3 cells. It was thought that this difference was a result of different responses to G-CSF. G-CSF potentiates Ara-C- and VP-16-induced cytotoxicities through apoptosis induction by mobilizing resting G0-G1-phase cells into S phase.","353":"Rearrangements of the MLL gene located at 11q23 are common chromosomal abnormalities associated with acute leukemia (AL), especially infant and secondary leukemia after previous treatment with DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors. 11q23\/MLL abnormalities have been widely recognized as an important prognostic factor in AL. Over 70 chromosome partners of 11q23 have been identified to date, at least 50 of which have been cloned and characterized at the molecular level. Recent studies showed that the prognosis of 11q23\/MLL AL varies widely according to the partner gene, the leukemia cell lineage, the age of the patient and the treatment administered. Special strategies are needed to treat 11q23\/MLL AL, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, according to the fusion partner. The development of novel methodologies, including new molecular therapeutic targets, is also needed to improve the prognosis of 11q23\/MLL AL. The present article provides an update on the current status of prognosis and treatment of 11q23\/MLL AL according to the fusion partner.","354":"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have unique characteristics such immune suppression by inhibiting T cell proliferation, tissue-repair ability and acceleration of hemopoietic stem cell engraftment. The cells are rare in bone marrow, but easily cultured under standard culture conditions. Soluble factors and cells are implicated in the MSC-mediated T cell suppression and numerous clinical trials using MSCs to prevent and treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have been reported. MSCs are suggested to suppress acute GVHD without impairing graft-versus-leukemia effects and increasing systemic infections. In this review, we focus on basic aspects of MSC-mediated T cell suppression and clinical trials using MSCs for GVHD and related conditions.","355":"","356":"A 61-year-old male who worked as a frozen chicken processor was referred to us with necrotizing skin ulcers on his hands and feet. Serum IgG and IgA levels were 4,355 mg\/dl and 605 mg\/dl, respectively. Serum immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated M-bows for anti-IgGlambda and anti-IgAkappa. Bone marrow aspirate revealed approximately 31% atypical plasma cells. Cryoglobulin was identified in his serum. Cryoglobulin immunoelectrophoresis revealed monoclonal IgGlambda paraproteins. The diagnosis was IgGlambda type multiple myeloma and concurrent IgAkappa type monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance with type I cryoglobulinemia. A skin biopsy taken from an involved site showed amorphous eosinophilic material occluding small vessel lumens. There was a good response after one cycle of chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, adriamycin and dexamethasone (VAD). There was a concurrent decrease in serum cryoglobulin levels ; this was associated with re-epithelialization of skin ulcers. Two years later, multiple myeloma progressed during a maintenance therapy of melphalan and prednisolone. Treatment with bortezomib following VAD resulted in a transient response. Serum IgG levels increased to 7,200 mg\/dl, in contrast to a decrease in IgA levels to 7 mg\/dl. The increase corresponded with the reappearance of skin ulcers. Shortly thereafter, the patient died of multiple myeloma.","357":"Nasal natural killer (NK)\/T cell lymphoma is an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, usually with a broad morphological spectrum, necrosis and angioinvasion, and is closely associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. We herein report a unique case of nasal NK\/T cell lymphoma with frequent complete remission and relapse 12 years of follow up. A 9-year-old girl was diagnosed as having nasal NK\/T cell lymphoma in 1995. The histological features were typical with diffuse lymphoid cell infiltration and angiocentric destruction. At the time of third relapse, however, biopsy showed infiltration of small sized lymphoid cells without necrosis and ulceration. These lymphoid cells were positive for both NK\/T cell phenotype and EBV-encoded small RNAs. The tumor regressed spontaneously after biopsy and her clinical symptoms subsided. When she was admitted to the hospital in 2006 she had an extensive destructive lesion in the nasal cavity. These findings represent a rare case, in which histological findings changed in each time of relapse.","358":"On rare occasions, secondary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B cell lymphoma can develop in a patient with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). We report a case of a 66-year-old Japanese woman who developed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in her small intestine after chemotherapy for AITL. She was found to have panperitonitis due to perforation of the small intestine. Partial ileectomy specimen showed DLBCL cells infiltrating into the intestinal wall. In situ hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA revealed positivity in the lymphoma cells. The lymph nodes diagnosed as AITL were negative for EBV infection and there was no coexistence of B cell neoplasms in them. We thought small bowel perforation in this case was caused by EBV-associated B cell lymphoma secondary to AITL. Our case showed a remarkable deficiency of cellular immunity after chemotherapy, which we postulate was related to the cause of occurrence of B-cell lymphoma.","359":"We report a case of acute mixed-lineage leukemia, as seen in a 65 year-old female with MLL gene amplification and biallelic loss of wild type p53 gene. The diagnosis was based on the findings that her bone marrow (BM) blasts expressed cytoplasmic CD3 (cyCD3), B-lineage antigens and myeloid antigens accompanied by clonal rearrangements of IgH gene. The BM blasts consisted of small-sized peroxidase-negative blasts (97%) and large-sized peroxidase-positive blasts (3%). The BM blasts showed a complex \"karyotype,\" including dic(17;20) (p11;q11), -5 and add (11q23). Add (11q23) abnormality was found in sideline karyotypes as well as the stemline abnormality of dic(17;20) (p11;q11). For the p53 gene, which is located at 17p13, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed the loss of one of two p53 alleles. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism and following nucleotide sequencing showed that the p53 gene was mutated at codon 215, leading to an amino acid substitution from Ser to Arg. For the MLL gene, southern blot analysis showed that the MLL gene locus was amplified but not rearranged at its breakpoint cluster region, which is usually rearranged in balanced translocations with many partner genes. These findings suggest that MLL gene amplification may in this case be based on the genetic instability caused by the preceding biallelic loss of the wild type p53 gene.","360":"Constitutive activity of nuclear transcription factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is observed in many pathological types of lymphoma that are associated with a poor clinical course. This suggests that NF-kappaB and pathways involving NF-kappaB are possible targets for successfully treating lymphoma. We examined 28 lymph nodes from 28 patients in whom follicular lymphoma was diagnosed from 1996 to 2006 at our institution, which were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded. The specimens were stained with an antibody that could recognize activated NF-kappaB and p65 to determine whether they were positive or negative for NF-kappaB activation. The clinical courses of the 28 patients were then correlated with the results of the NF-kappaB staining. The 10 men and 18 women had a mean age of 57.3 years (range, 25-87 years). By follicular lymphoma grade, 10 patients had grade 1, 16 had grade 2, and 2 had grade 3a. Ten patients died due to lymphoma. NF-kappaB was positive in 6 of the 28 cases. Analysis of the positive and negative staining groups while taking into account the clinical course, sex, age, grade of follicular lymphoma, prognostic index, CD10, CD23, Bcl-2, karyotype t(14;18), and survival showed that no significant differences. Six of the 28 lymph nodes (21.4%) exhibited consistent NF-kappaB activity. Three of the eleven cases that transformed to aggressive lymphoma were positive for activated NF-kappaB. Further research to clarify the significance of constitutive NF-kappaB activity in follicular lymphoma is therefore warranted.","361":"Localized Castleman's disease (CD) has been divided two types, the classical hyaline vascular (HV) type and the rare plasma cell (PC) type. Recently, we have reported two cases of IgG4-related disorder of the retroperitoneum showing PC type of CD. To further clarify the clinicopathological findings of CD of the retroperitoneum, eight such cases have been studied. A single lesion was located in the retroperitoneum (n=3), ureter (n=2) and renal hilum (n=2). One case had bilateral ureter lesions. The HV type of CD accounts for approximately 90% of cases. However, 50% (n=4) of our cases were the PC type of CD. Three of the four lesions of HV type had lymph node lesions, whereas all four PC type of CD were soft tissue masses. These clinicopathologic findings appear quite different from previous descriptions. Immunohistochemical study demonstrated numerous IgG4(+) plasma cells accounting for more that 50% of IgG4(+) cells in three cases of the four PC type of CD. Moreover, serum IgG4 concentration was increased in two of the four cases of PC type of CD that were examined. The serum interleukin-6 levels were within the normal range in two cases of PC type that were examined. The present study suggests that a majority of the PC type of CD arising in the retroperitoneum appears to be an IgG4-related disorder.","362":"The purpose of this study is to determine the same or different clonality between bilateral or recurrent lesions, or between or among ocular adnexal lesions and systemically multifocal lesions in 10 consecutive patients with ocular adnexal lymphoma : 8 had extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) and 2 had mantle cell lymphoma, observed from 1995 to 2008 at Okayama University Hospital. A discrete DNA fragment was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene from all samples except for two samples of bilateral orbital mantle cell lymphoma lesions and one sample of the scalp skin MALT lymphoma lesion. The size of DNA fragments were the same between bilateral orbital or conjunctival lesions of 5 patients, between original and recurrent conjunctival lesions of one patient, between the orbital lesion and the oral cavity lesion in one patient, and among bilateral orbital lesions, buccal, rectum, and stomach lesions of one patient. Sequencing of the DNA fragments showed the same sequence between bilateral or recurrent or multifocal lesions in 8 patients except for one : the bilateral orbital lesions, rectum, and stomach lesions shared the same sequence while the buccal lesion had one nucleotide difference compared to the sequence shared by the other 4 lesions. In conclusion, bilateral, recurrent, or systemically multifocal lesions of ocular adnexal lymphoma shared the clonality between or among the lesions.","363":"Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive malignant disease of CD4+ T-cells associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Prognosis of ATL patients is directly correlated to the subtype of ATL. Treatment of the aggressive forms (acute and lymphoma types) of ATL remains inadequate, as most ATL patients receive conventional chemotherapy without stem cell rescue. At present, LSG15 is the standard chemotherapy for the treatment of aggressive ATL, but the efficacy of LSG15 in most patients is transient. To prolong median survival time, additional therapies for maintenance of complete response (CR) are needed after achieving CR by induction chemotherapy. Improved outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT), despite a high incidence of graft-versus-host disease, has been reported. Thus, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and allogeneic peripheral blood SCT may have great potential for eradication of HTLV-1 and cure of ATL. Recently, reduced-intensity conditioning stem cell transplantation was also reported to be effective for ATL. Although several issues, including selection criteria for patients and sources of stem cells remain to be resolved, allo-SCT may be considered as a treatment option for patients with aggressive ATL. To evaluate whether allo-SCT is more effective than the standard chemotherapy (LSG15) for aggressive ATL, an up front phase II clinical trial of JCOG-LSG is now being planned. Novel innovative targeted strategies, such as antiretroviral therapy, arsenic trioxide, nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, several monoclonal antibodies including anti-CC chemokine receptor 4, anti-folate, purine nucleotide phosphorylase inhibitor, mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor, bendamustine, small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitors and Tax-targeted immunotherapy, should be promptly studied in order to develop curative treatments for ATL in the near future.","364":"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) was the first retrovirus shown to cause human diseases, such as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy\/tropic spastic paraparesis (HAM\/TSP). Despite extensive study for three decades, it remains elusive how HTLV-1 induces these diseases. HTLV-1 mainly infects CD4 T cells, inducing dysregulation of the host immune system. Recent studies have uncovered the mechanisms of differentiation and function of CD4 T cells at the cellular and molecular levels, extending our understanding of the pathological conditions associated with HTLV-1 infection. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the interaction between HTLV-1 and the host immune system, which should provide us a clue to the mechanisms of HTLV-1 mediated pathogenesis.","365":"We report an autopsy case of Fabry's disease with cardiac manifestations. Electron microscopic examination of rectal biopsy specimens revealed lamellar bodies and osmiophilic irregular bodies. Biochemical analysis showed low enzymatic activity of alpha-galactosidase A in plasma fluid. Microscopic examination on autopsy showed marked hypertrophy and vacuolation of cardiac muscle cells. Intracytoplasmic vacuolation was also found in glomerular epithelial or endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of renal arteries, Meissner's plexus in the submucosa of small and large intestines, and smooth muscle cells of arterioles in the cerebrum. The diagnosis of Fabry's disease was made. The patient died suddenly of cardiomyopathy.","366":"A 20-year-old man with a primary non-seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumor (yolk sac tumor and immature teratoma) developed hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) three months after surgical resection. Around the same time, the patient was found to have bone metastases of the germ cell tumor. No other hereditary or acquired diseases related to HPS were found. The thrombocytopenia was refractory to corticosteroid therapy but improved after chemotherapy performed for germ cell tumor progression. Only three cases of germ cell tumor associated with reactive hemophagocytosis have been previously reported. Successful treatment of the present case by chemotherapy for HPS suggests a close relationship between this rare complication and germ cell tumor.","367":"The assessment of residual tumors after treatment of malignant lymphoma (ML) is often difficult. Here we report a case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with a huge sacral tumor. After chemotherapy and following radiation therapy, a residual mass was detected on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, a hypermetabolic lesion in the sacrum disappeared on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)F-FDG-PET) and clinically the patient was considered to achieve complete remission. Seven months after the completion of radiation therapy, a new tumor-like lesion in the sacrum developed on MRI, but hypermetabolic lesions were not detected on (18)F-FDG-PET. Recurrence of lymphoma was denied by open biopsy of the lesion. (18)F-FDG-PET has been of widespread use not only for staging but for post-treatment assessment of ML. Although MRI is a standard imaging tool for the assessment of bone involvement of ML, there have been few reports documenting the results of comparative studies on the usefulness of (18)F-FDG-PET and MRI for the evaluation of residual mass in bone involvement of ML. The present case suggests that (18)F-FDG-PET is superior to MRI not only in the evaluation of a residual mass but in the judgment of recurrence after treatment of such patients.","368":"This study examined the relationship between external environmental factors and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in nasal natural killer (NK)\/T-cell lymphomagenesis. Archival paraffin sections from 134 cases of nasopharyngeal lymphomas in the northeast of China were investigated by in situ hybridization of EBV-encoded small RNA-1 (EBER-1) and by immunohistochemistry of the status of programmed cell death (PCD). The cases examined included 74 (55.2%) cases of NK\/T-cell lymphomas (NKTCL) in T-cell and NK-cell neoplasms as well as 32 (23.9%) cases of B-cell neoplasms (B-MLs) and 9 (6.7%) cases of carcinomas. These cases indicated a significant dominant occurrence of NKTCL in the nasal cavity and of B-MLs in the pharynx. Many EBV-associated NKTCLs were seen in the nasopharynx, all three cases of EBV-associated B-MLs were in the nasal cavity and all three cases of EBV-associated carcinomas were only seen in the pharynx. The low number of NKTCL cases showing little or no EBV association, together with the existence of EBER-1-free lymphoma cells in EBV-associated NKTCLs, suggested EBV-related lymphoma cell expansion during lymphomagenesis. Peculiar necrosis, frequently observed in NKTCLs, was due to accelerated PCD. This PCD was autophagic cell death as judged by labeling of Beclin-1 and LC3, which possibly occurred due to EBV infection, when apoptosis was suppressed by survivin. Very minute squamous carcinomas, observed in 10 of 23 cases of NKTCLs with residual epithelia that were survivin-positive but not EBV-associated suggested that carcinogenesis occurred before lymphomagenesis. These data suggest that external environmental oncogenic factors initiate nasopharyngeal carcinomas and lymphomas whereas EBV infection promotes them.","369":null,"370":"The purpose of this study is to report the role of whole-body 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography fused with computed tomography (PET\/CT) after immunocytochemical and clonal diagnosis of intraocular lymphoma with vitrectomy cell blocks. Eleven patients with intraocular lymphoma were involved in this study: 6 patients presented with vitreous opacity in both eyes and 5 patients presented with unilateral involvement. The concurrent retinal lesions were present in 6 eyes of 5 patients. Brain lymphoma was diagnosed in 7 of the 11 patients : simultaneous with eye lesions in one patient, following the eye lesions in 3, and prior to the eye lesions in 3. Vitrectomy was done in 17 eyes of the 11 patients, and vitrectomy cell blocks were processed for immunocytochemical staining and clonality analysis by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The 7 most recent patients were evaluated with fluorodeoxyglucose whole-body PET\/CT. Immunocytochemical staining of vitrectomy cell blocks in all patients showed large cells which were positive for CD20 and Ki-67 but negative for CD3, consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The size and sequence of amplified fragments of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were different between the lesions of both eyes in one patient while they were the same in another patient. PET\/CT after the diagnosis by vitrectomy revealed abnormal uptake in the cerebellum of two patients, in the eye as a recurrent lesion of one patient, and in both eyes as residual retinal lesions of one patient. In conclusion, PET\/CT could be considered as a method to confirm brain lymphoma or as a reference for initiating additional therapy in the case of eye recurrence or residual lesions after vitrectomy. The clonality of lymphoma cells was variable between the lesions in both eyes.","371":"Cladribine is approved to be used in 24-hour continuous infusion for the treatment of low-grade lymphoma by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the antitumor activity of cladribine by 2-hour infusion should be comparable to that given by continuous infusion. The safety and anti-tumor activity of short infusion of cladribine was shown in hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Europe. We therefore underwent a pilot study to confirm the safety and efficacy of cladribine given by 2-hour infusion for Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell lymphoma. Cladribine at a dose of 0.09 mg\/kg was administered in 2-hour intravenous infusion for 5 consecutive days. The treatment was repeated at a 28-day interval for at least 2 cycles, and its efficacy and toxicity were investigated. Fourteen patients were entered into this study. Eight patients (57%) responded to cladribine, including 2 (14%) complete response (CR) and 6 (43%) partial response (PR). The median duration of response was 20+ and 21+ months for CR, and 12 months ranging from 3 to 34 months for PR, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and lymphocytopenia occurred in 43% and 71% of patients, respectively, but there was no febrile neutropenia or opportunistic infection associated with cladribine treatment. No other adverse events greater than grade 3 were encountered. The tumor response and degree of toxicity were comparable with those observed in cladribine treatment given by continuous infusion at a same dose. Cladribine can be administered in 2-hour infusion in an outpatient clinic and is therefore quite convenient for patients.","372":"Pathogenetic roles of human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 in lymphoproliferative diseases have been of continued interest. Many molecular studies have tried to establish a pathogenic role for HHV-6 in lymphoid malignancies. However, whether HHV-6 plays a role in these pathologies remains unclear, as positive polymerase chain reaction results for HHV-6 in those studies may reflect latent infection or reactivation rather than presence of HHV-6 in neoplastic cells. A small number of studies have investigated HHV-6 antigen expression in pathologic specimens. As a result, the lack of HHV-6 antigen expression on neoplastic cells argues against any major pathogenic role of HHV-6. The role of HHV-6 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has also been of interest but remains controversial, with 2 studies documenting higher levels of HHV-6 antibody in ALL patients, and another 2 large-scale studies finding no significant differences in HHV-6 seroprevalences between ALL patients and controls. Alternatively, HHV-6 is increasingly recognized as an important opportunistic pathogen. HHV-6 reactivation is common among recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), and is linked to various clinical manifestations. In particular, HHV-6 encephalitis appears to be significant, life-threatening complication. Most HHV-6 encephalitis develops in patients receiving transplant from an unrelated donor, particularly cord blood, typically around the time of engraftment. Symptoms are characterized by short-term memory loss and seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging typically shows limbic encephalitis. Prognosis for HHV-6 encephalitis is poor, but appropriate prophylactic measures have not been established. Establishment of preventive strategies against HHV-6 encephalitis represents an important challenge for physicians involved with SCT.","373":"","374":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is one of the most important complications of solid organ transplantation or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Most PTLDs are associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Although post-transplant Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is included in PTLD, there have been no studies in the literature on adult cases of post-transplant HL after cord blood stem cell transplantation (CBSCT). This is due to the fact that EBV infection of cord blood cells usually does not occur, and EBV-infected lymphocytes of the recipient should be eradicated by preconditioning therapy. We report a 26-year-old woman case of post-transplant HL, which occurred after CBSCT for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Three years and eight months after CBSCT, the enlarged cervical lymph node was histologically diagnosed as EBV associated post-transplant HL, which showed immunophenotypes of classical HL and latency type II EBV infection. She underwent chemotherapy, and has survived 4 years and 6 months after CBSCT. Differential diagnosis of post-transplant HL with good prognosis and HL-like PTLD with aggressive behavior is important, and immunohistochemical methods were useful and essential for it. The source of EBV associated HL in this case will be discussed.","375":"There are several reports describing [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) findings in patients with lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG). We report a case of grade I LYG that showed increased uptake of FDG. The patient was a 63-year-old Japanese male who underwent an FDG-PET\/computed tomography (CT) scan in screening for a malignant lesion. Increased uptake of FDG [maximum standard uptake value (SUV(max)), 3.7] was observed in the right hilar region in FDG-PET and enhanced CT revealed a round, abnormal mass that also showed increased FDG uptake. The patient had no previous symptoms. A tumor biopsy was performed and the histological diagnosis was grade I LYG. Therefore, increased SUV(max) in FDG-PET might be useful for diagnosing of LYG.","376":"We describe a rare case of secondary malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) following Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). A 23-year-old Japanese male exhibited systemic lymphadenopathy, multiple lung tumors, and osteolytic changes in bilateral iliac bones in 1989. A biopsy specimen from the left iliac bone revealed an infiltration of S-100 protein-positive histiocyte-like cells intermingled with eosinophils, which confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic granuloma, a type of LCH. Although the patient was treated with prednisolone initially, the disease did not respond well and progressed gradually over time. The patient subsequently received multiple courses of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy with many kinds of anticancer agents for 6 years. He also received radiotherapy totaling 136.8 Gy for lung tumors and osteolytic lesions of the pelvis. In 1997, because of the LCH refractoriness, biopsy was performed again from the right inguinal lymph node. Microscopic examinations demonstrated a mixture of spindle-shaped cells and histiocyte-like cells, which appeared to be in a storiform pattern. The tumor cells were immunohistologically positive for CD68 and vimentin, but negative for CD1a and S-100 protein. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with MFH. Although chemotherapy was continued, the patient died of pneumonia during the neutropenic period following chemotherapy. Autopsy revealed systemic invasion of MFH and dissemination of mucormycosis. LCH was not detected histologically in any tissues.","377":"Until now, no method has been available to discriminate mature plasmacytoid DC (pDC) from myeloid DC (mDC) immunohistochemically. In this study, we report that these DC-subsets can be distinguished in routine pathological sections. Immature and mature monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) were S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B)+, while pDCs generated from pDC-precursors were S100B-. In contrast, both mature MoDC and pDC were fascin+. Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) were S100B+\/fascin-. Although the majority of DCs were S100B+\/fascin+ in the dermis with nonspecific inflammation, dermal DCs were mostly S100B-\/fascin+ in psoriasis vulgaris, in which type I interferon secreted by pDC-precursors is thought to play a major role. S100B+\/fascin+ DCs were accumulated in the superficial lymph node (LN), while they were scarce in the deep LN. In the superficial LN with dermatopathic lymphadenitis, a large number of S100B+\/fascin+ DCs were accumulated in the T-zones, where numerous LC-derived DCs are accumulated. In contrast, almost all DCs were S100B-\/fascin+ in the superficial LN with Kikuchi's lymphadenitis, in which numerous pDC-precursors are known to be present. In contrast to the superficial LN, the deep LN contained numerous S100B-\/fascin+ DCs and a few S100B+ DCs. Thus, the distributions of S100B+ DC or S100B-\/fascin+ DC correspond to the putative distribution of mDC or mature pDC, respectively.","378":"Previous reports emphasized that localized lymphoid hyperplasia (LLH) of the large intestine is usually histologically characterized by large lymphoid follicles with striking enlarged germinal centers, and a narrow surrounding mantle zone and marginal zone (MZ). To clarify the histological varieties of LLH of the large intestine, 16 such cases have been studied. The present study demonstrated histological diversity of the LLH of the large intestine including (i) reactive follicular hyperplasia (RFH) (n=8), (ii) RFH with progressive transformation of the germinal center (PTGC) (n=3), (iii) RFH with MZ hyperplasia (n=3) and (iv) RFH with PTGC and MZ hyperplasia (n=2). Overall histomorphological findings of the present series appear quite different from previous descriptions of LLH of the large intestine. The present study showed histological variety of the LLH of the large intestine. Moreover, LLH of the large intestine should be differentiated from extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma as well as follicular lymphoma. Immunohistological studies demonstrated the reactive nature of all 16 lesions. However, three cases showing RFH demonstrated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction study in 12 cases examined. It remains unclear whether these three cases showing RFH could be a sign of the prelymphomatous stage (incipient follicular lymphoma) or representing merely an exaggeration of normal B-cell clonal response in the germinal centers.","379":"To assess the humoral response to the influenza vaccine in patients undergoing R-CHOP therapy (rituximab combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and predonisolone) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the anti-hemagglutinin (HA) titer in 7 NHL patients undergoing therapy was compared with those in 10 control group subjects in the 2005\/2006 season. Four weeks after vaccination, the HA titers against the influenza type A H1N1 and type B antigens, the same antigens that had been used in the previous seasons, were elevated in all patients treated with R-CHOP. In contrast, there was no increase in the geometric mean titer for type A H3N2 antigen, which was newly included in 2005\/2006 season, in the patients treated with R-CHOP, while there was a significant increase in the 10 control subjects (p = 0.014). This study showed that vaccination against influenza virus generated an appreciable humoral response to recall antigens in NHL patients treated with R-CHOP therapy, but not to the primary antigen.","380":"CHOP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, vincristine, and prednisolone) therapy achieves a response in more than 60% patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). However, DLBCL shows a heterogeneous response to chemotherapy, and some patients are refractory to CHOP therapy. This difference in response to therapy is most likely due to differences in biological characteristics. We used cDNA microarray analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in anthracycline containing chemotherapy-resistant DLBCLs (7 patients) compared with anthracycline containing chemotherapy-sensitive DLBCLs (6 patients). Nine genes on the cDNA chip showed increased expression in anthracycline containing chemotherapy-resistant patients. We chose the preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma (PRAME) gene because it showed the highest expression in anthracycline containing chemotherapy-resistant DLBCLs on the cDNA chip, and it has been linked to prognosis of hematological malignancies. We also examined the relationship between PRAME gene expression and progression-free survival (PFS) in 45 patients with DLBCL. The progression-free survival of PRAME-positive patients (n=12) was significantly worse than that of PRAME-negative patients (n=33) (p=0.0373). Our results therefore indicate that PRAME expression in DLBCL correlates with response to anthracycline containing chemotherapy.","381":"","382":"","383":"Differential diagnosis between plasmacytoid dendritic precursor cell leukemia (pDC leukemia) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with monocytic differentiation is difficult due to shared clinicopathological features ; however, such diagnosis is critical because the two leukemias are treated differently. Here we report a peculiar case of AML mimicking pDC leukemia. A 22-year-old man presented with leukocytopenia and bone marrow involvement of atypical plasmacytoid cells with a prominent nucleolus. In spite of positive cytochemical staining for NaF-sensitive naphthyl butyrate esterase, this case was diagnosed as pDC leukemia because the abnormal cells were positive for CD4, CD56, and CD123, and negative for myeloperoxidase and lysozyme. The patient achieved complete remission after 4 courses of combination chemotherapy, but relapsed four months later with leukemic manifestation and skin involvement. The morphology of the leukemia cells became myelomonoblastic, and some were immunohistochemically positive for lysozyme, suggesting AML. Although the patient received allogenic stem cell transplantation twice, he died of progressive disease. This case demonstrates the importance of cytochemical staining for naphthyl butyrate esterase in differential diagnosis between AML and pDC leukemia coexpressing CD4, CD56, and CD123.","384":"Rhabdomyosarcoma is exceedingly rare in adults. A 62-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of general pain. Computed tomography revealed a solid tumor in the right nasal cavity. Histopathological examination showed solid proliferation of atypical small round cells, having cytologic features reminiscent of lymphomas, and lacking the fibrovascular stroma. The cells were CD56(+), desmin(+), vimentin(+), HHF35(+), myogenin(+) and MyoD1(+). The patient was positive for the PAX3-FKHR fusion gene. The patient was diagnosed as having alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. We conclude that rhabdomyosarcoma should be included in the differential diagnoses of CD56(+) small round cell tumor, and immunohistochemical and cytogenetic studies should be performed.","385":"We report here a case of idiopathic CD4(+) T-lymphocytopenia (ICL) associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)(+) lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) terminating in Burkitt lymphoma (BL). A 33-year-old Japanese male was admitted to the hospital showing severe CD4(+) lymphocytopenia and neutropenia that was diagnosed as ICL in 1993. Twenty months after the onset of disease, right cervical lymphadenopathy was detected. Biopsy of the specimen showed reactive lymph node hyperplasia and interfollicular B-cell hyperplasia. Ninety-one months later, polypoid tumors were resected from the bilateral nasal cavities and were diagnosed as BL. Immunohistological studies suggested the reactive nature of the initial lymph node biopsy specimen. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IgH) demonstrated a polyclonal pattern in the initial lymph node lesion. However, the subsequent BL demonstrated a clonal band in the PCR assay for the IgH gene. As demonstrated in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-patients, clonal expansion of EBV infected B-cells in the initial lymph node lesion may progress to BL in this patient. The present case did not associate with severe opportunistic infections during the course of disease. EBV(+) BL may be the first manifestation of severe immunodeficiency of the ICL in this patient.","386":"Here we describe two cases of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with monoclonal immunoglobulins (Igs). The first case was a 77-year-old man with primary lymphoma of the lung. Immunoelectrophoresis detected IgM-kappa in serum and kappa light chain excretion into urine. Three months after treatment with single-agent rituximab, a large amount of pleural fluid was found to have accumulated. The fluid contained CD5(-), CD10(-), CD19(+), CD38(+) and CD138(-\/+) lymphoma cells with lymphoplasmacytoid appearance. Although a small fraction of the cells were CD20(+), the majority of the lymphoma cells were negative and expressed surface-membrane IgM-kappa at low levels. The cells possessed a karyotype of 46, XY, t(11;18)(q21;q21). The second case was a 55-year-old man who underwent total gastrectomy due to gastric perforation. Surgical specimens demonstrated the histopathological features of MALT lymphoma associated with plasma cell differentiation. The lymphoma cells had a 46, XY, t(11;18)(q21;q21) karyotype. Monoclonal Igs detected were serum IgA (M)-kappa and urinary kappa light chain. The patient was subsequently treated with six cycles of R-CVP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone) ; however, serum monoclonal Ig levels were not affected. The lymphoma cells in both cases may have contained two populations, a rituximab-sensitive CD20(+) population and a rituximab-resistant population that had differentiated into the Ig-secreting plasma cell stage.","387":"Occasionally, the hyaline-vascular type of Castleman's disease (HVCD) contains numerous lymphoid follicles which usually occupy more than 50% of the lesion. Such lesions are called the follicular variant (FV) of HVCD. To clarify the histological and immunohistochemical findings of lymphoid follicles in the FV of HVCD, we examined 11 such cases. Histologically, five types of lymphoid follicles were delineated. Lymphoid follicles ; (i) with normal germinal centers (GCs) ; (ii) showing follicular lysis ; (iii) with progressive transformation of GC (PTGC) ; (iv) where the large nodule of mantle zone lymphocytes contained multiple small atrophic GCs (multiple GC pattern) ; and (v) where the large, often irregularly shaped nodules of mantle cells radically penetrated small vessels with inconspicuous GCs. These nodules somewhat resembled primary lymphoid follicles (primary follicular pattern). The majority of lymphoid follicles in all 11 cases were of the primary follicular pattern and\/or multiple GC pattern. However, three lesions also contained normal germinal GC, while two contained normal GC, follicular lysis and PTGC and one other contained normal GC and PTGC. Moreover, in 3 cases of primary follicular pattern, the majority of the lymphoid follicles were surrounded by a pale cuff of mantle cells. Because of the presence of numerous lymphoid follicles, the FV of HVCD should be sometimes differentiated from Hodgkin lymphoma and low-grade B-cell lymphomas showing follicular growth pattern. Recognition of the histological and immunohistochemical findings of the FV of HVCD is needed to avoid overdiagnosis.","388":"","389":"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVL) is rare aggressive disseminated lymphoma associated with poor outcomes. Rituximab is a novel molecular agent that can reportedly improve outcomes for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, the safety and efficacy of rituximab in patients with IVL are unclear. A 76-year-old woman was hospitalized due to altered consciousness, fever and respiratory abnormalities. Definitive diagnosis of IVL was obtained following repeated biopsies of bone marrow. The patient received chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisolone, and rituximab (R-CHOP), and achieved complete remission after 3 courses of treatment. She has remained in complete remission for over 3 years after diagnosis. This report suggests that rituximab-containing regimens could be safe and effective for elderly patients with IVL.","390":"The purpose of this study is to show that the histopathological type of an orbital lymphoma can differ from the systemic follicular lymphoma that precedes it. A 44-year-old man (Patient #1) and a 50-year-old man (Patient #2) presented with generalized lymphadenopathy due to grade 1 follicular lymphoma proven on lymph node biopsy. Patient #1 was followed without treatment for 16 years when he developed a right orbital mass. Patient #2 underwent several courses of combination chemotherapy as well as radiation but relapsed. The second biopsy of the lymph node nine years later showed the same histopathological type of follicular lymphoma. He developed an orbital mass on the right side 16 years after the initial presentation. In Patient #1, excisional biopsy of the orbital masses showed extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). In Patient #2, biopsy revealed the orbital mass to be T-cell\/histiocyte-rich diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In Patient #1, when comparing the original lymph node biopsy to the orbital biopsy obtained years later, no evidence for clonality was noted by polymerase chain reaction. In Patient #2, the amplification by polymerase chain reaction of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement in the lymph node lesion and the orbital lesion gave rise to a single discrete band with the same DNA sequence except for five nucleotide changes, indicating the same clonality in the presence of genomic changes. In conclusion, orbital lymphomas can occur as a second lymphoma with a different histopathological type in the long-term follow-up of systemic lymphomas. The original and subsequent lymphomatous lesions may or may not share neoplastic cell clonality and all genomics.","391":"The pathology of B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow of patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has not been well described, even though B-lymphocytes may be involved in the etiology of ITP. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 73 ITP patients between January 1997 and June 2005 with platelet counts of &lt; 50 x 10(9)\/L. Bone marrow clots were available for pathological review in 56 patients who were classified into 3 groups based on the results of the bone marrow clot examination : Group A (21 patients) had increased CD20+ lymphocytes (&gt; or =1% of nucleated cells) and megakaryocytes with morphologic changes ; Group B (21 patients) had morphologic changes but no increase in CD20+ lymphocytes ; and Group C (14 patients) had neither morphologic changes nor increased CD20+ lymphocytes. Multivariate analysis showed that, compared to Group A, Group B had a significant prognostic factor (p = 0.04 ; odds ratio, 6.65 ; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 40.54) for achieving complete response, while Group C had a significant prognostic factor for any treatment response (p = 0.04 ; odds ratio, 14.26 ; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 188.02). Thus, ITP patients can be classified with different clinical outcomes based on immunohistopathological examination of bone marrow clots.","392":"Proliferation, apoptosis and p53 protein expression in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells were investigated. Twenty peripheral blood tissue specimens (PBTS) comprising 7 cases of acute type ATL, 7 cases of chronic type ATL and 6 other leukemias were examined by means of antigen retrieval and the polymer method employing anti-Ki67 antigen (MIB-1), anti-cleaved caspase-3, anti-single stranded DNA and three kinds of anti-p53 protein antibodies including DO7. Most acute and chronic cases of ATL included more than 10% MIB-1-positive proliferating leukemia cells and more than 1% cleaved caspase-3-positive apoptotic cells. Some cells which were positive for both MIB-1 and anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody were observed in acute type ATL. Nuclear deposition of p53 protein labeled by DO7 was often found in acute type (p &lt; 0.05). Within the medium-sized population of ATL cell nuclei, DO7-positive ATL cells had a smaller nuclear area factor (long axis x short axis) than DO7-negative ATL cells. A few proliferating ATL cells entered apoptosis, and the appearance of a subclone of ATL cells with nuclear deposition of p53 protein labeled by DO7 characterized acute type.","393":"We report a case of a splenic inflammatory pseudotumor (myofibroblastic tumor) in a 43-year-old man with a 5-year history of chronic bronchitis and sleep apnea syndrome. The patient was hospitalized because of a screen-detected splenic mass lesion. His sputum cultures revealed Mycobacterium avium complexes on only one occasion. Imaging studies revealed a 7 cm solitary tumorous lesion, and differential diagnoses of splenic hamartoma, hemangioma, lymphoma, and angiosarcoma were obtained from the radiologist. A splenectomy followed by pathological investigations was performed. By histology, the lesion contained fibroblastic or myofibroblastic spindle cell proliferations, accompanied by variable degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration. Ziehl-Neelsen staining did not reveal acid-fast bacteria. Immunohistochemically, the fibroblastic or myofibroblastic spindle cells were positive for vimentin, human smooth muscle actin, and muscle actin, but negative for desmin, CD8, CD21, CD23, CD35, p80, Epstein-Barr virus LMP, and human herpesvirus type 8. The infiltrating lymphoid cells demonstrated a nonneoplastic pattern. The results of in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA were negative. The postoperative course was uneventful and he has had no recurrence in 22 months. His sleep apnea syndrome and chronic bronchitis have resolved spontaneously since the splenectomy.","394":"We report the case of a patient who showed spontaneous regression of bilateral conjunctival extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma). A 72-year-old man underwent excisional biopsy for salmon-pink lesions involving the whole circumference of the conjunctiva in the right eye and the lower fornix in the left eye. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry showed MALT lymphoma with immunoglobulin kappa monotype shared by the lesions in both eyes. Because the patient had recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis, radiation initially planned for the large residual lesion in the right eye was postponed. Over two years, including 6 mon with anti-tuberculous treatment, the large lesion in the right eye showed spontaneous regression. The spontaneous regression of conjunctival MALT lymphoma observed in this patient suggests that following excisional biopsy for histopathological diagnosis, observation is a treatment option.","395":"This report concerns a rare case of follicular lymphoma with features suggestive of primary hepatic lymphoma. At the disease onset, multiple nodular lesions in the liver and small para-aortic nodes were detected by abdominal magnetic resonance imaging without generalized lymphadenopathy. After careful observation for three months, lymphadenopathy was observed in the right occipital, para-aortic, and bilateral inguinal regions. The patient was treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) and achieved complete remission for more than 2 years. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ninth report of primary hepatic follicular lymphoma. Insufficient cases have been reported to determine the long-term outcome and clinical characteristics of primary hepatic follicular lymphoma. However, it seems that patients with primary hepatic follicular lymphoma that are treated with appropriate chemotherapy with or without surgical resection have favorable outcomes.","396":"In order to establish the method of generating powerful gammadelta T cells for anti-tumor immunotherapy, we investigated the effects of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) on anti-tumor cytotoxicity of expanded gammadelta T cells. Activation of gammadelta T cells co-cultured for 2-3 days with immature or mature mo-DCs was evaluated by CD69 expression and anti-tumor cytotoxicity using two assays : the 5- (and 6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester-based cytotoxicity assay and the calcein-AM-based Terascan assay. gammadelta T cells were used as effector cells and myeloma cell line (RPMI8226) or chronic myelogenous leukemia blastic crisis cell line (C2F8) were used as target cells. CD69 expression on gammadelta T cells was enhanced by co-culture with both immature and mature mo-DCs in a cell-number-dependent fashion. CD69 expression was enhanced after addition of mo-DCs of either autologous or allogeneic origin. Activation of gammadelta T cells with mo-DCs enhanced anti-tumor cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells against RPMI8226 and C2F8 in an effector-to-target ratio-dependent manner. Activation of gammadelta T cells by mo-DCs was associated with the enhancement of anti-tumor cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells. Potent gammadelta T cells activated by mo-DCs were considered to be applicable to an efficient gammadelta T cell-mediated immunotherapy for tumors.","397":"Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) treatment for lymphoma is a novel targeted therapeutic approach. Several years of development of radioimmunotherapeutic compounds came to fruition in February of 2002 when (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin, Y2B8) was approved in the USA and later in Europe, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory, low grade or transformed B-cell lymphoma. (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan utilizes a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody to deliver beta-emitting yttium-90 to the malignant B-cells. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy, which is largely independent of the intrinsic activity of the anti-CD20 antibody. A similar anti-CD20 radiotherapeutic compound, (131)I-tositumomab, was subsequently approved in the USA. The advantages of increased efficacy compared to the naked antibody are gained at the expense of myelotoxicity which is dose limiting but reversible. Studies exploring expanded applications of radioimmunotherapy have been recently completed or are under way. It is hoped that RIT will be an ideal agent for consolidation after chemotherapy for both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma as well as a useful addition to preparatory high dose regimens prior to transplant. RIT has been shown to be an effective and clinically relevant complementary therapeutic approach for patients with lymphoma.","398":"Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a common low grade B-cell lymphoma arising from a background of chronic inflammatory disease at a number of mucosal sites. Those originating in the stomach are causatively linked to Helicobacter pylori infection and eradication of the bacterium with antibiotics leads to long-term complete regression of the lymphoma in aproximately 70% of cases. Now, there is further evidence of linking Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi and Chlamydia psittaci infection with immunoproliferative small intestine disease, MALT lymphoma of the skin and ocular adnexa respectively. t(11;18)\/API2-MALT1, t(1;14)\/IGH-BCL10, t(14;18)\/IGH-MALT1 and t(3;14)\/IGH-FOXP1 occur at considerably variable incidences in MALT lymphomas of different sites. The first three chromosome translocations are specifically associated with the MALT lymphoma entity and the oncogenic products of these translocations have been shown to target a common molecular pathway, i.e. the nuclear factor-kappaB pathway. Here, I review the recent advances in our understanding of the association of microbial pathogens with MALT lymphoma of various sites and the molecular genetics underlying the lymphoma development.","399":"We report an elderly patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma harbouring Epstein-Barr virus that showed spontaneous regressions with subsequent relapses three times. The patient died of aspiration pneumonia without any anti-neoplastic treatment 5 years 10 months after the initial onset of lymph node swelling. In the literature, there are several reports of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cases that showed spontaneous regressions without relapse till the last observation. Over half of the cases were the extra-nodal type. The tendency toward regression of swollen lymph nodes detected by clinicians occurs within 2 weeks after biopsy. If the remaining lymph nodes show a tendency to decrease in size after biopsy without any anti-tumor therapies, the patient may develop spontaneous regression.","400":"Sea-blue histiocytosis is a rare disorder seen in patients with lipid metabolic or ceroid storage diseases. Sea-blue histiocytes are ceroid-laden macrophages detectable by May-Giemsa staining. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman diagnosed with Niemann-Pick disease at 2 or 3 years of age. To confirm this diagnosis, we examined her bone marrow, which revealed scattered foci containing aggregates of foamy macrophages. May-Giemsa staining identified blue-staining foamy macrophages, referred to as sea-blue histiocytes. In summary, we report the detection of sea-blue histiocytosis in an adult with Niemann-Pick disease.","401":"ID4 is a member of the inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) family, and inhibits the binding of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors to DNA. In some malignant tumors, ID4 is inactivated by promoter hypermethylation, and is thought to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG). We have found that the promoter region of the ID4 gene is frequently methylated in lymphoid cell lines (100%, 9\/9), primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (95%, 19\/20), and follicular lymphoma (100%, 10\/10). Somatic mutation of the ID4 gene was also examined, and no mutations were found. These findings suggest that the ID4 gene might be inactivated by DNA hypermethylation, and may function as a TSG in malignant lymphoma.","402":"We performed single cell polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the t (14 ; 18) translocation from paraffin embedded sections in a case of follicular lymphoma (FL) with subsequent development of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). The lymphoma cells of FL were positive for CD20, CD10 and BCL-2, and negative for CD3, CD30 and CD15. Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells of HL were positive for CD20, CD30 and CD15, and negative for CD3 and CD10. EBER-1 RNA in situ hybridization failed to stain with both lymphomas. HRS cells manipulated and FL cells micro-shaved from individual neoplastic follicles were subjected to single-cell PCR. The t (14 ; 18) translocation, a chimeric DNA containing portions of the bcl-2 and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes, was amplified from four of 27 isolated HRS cells and two individual FL follicles. All t (14 ; 18) PCRs yielded products of the same size, and an identical nucleotide sequence including the t (14 ; 18) translocation was found in both FL and HRS samples. Thus, the data demonstrate the common clonal origin of FL cells and HRS cells in subsequent HL, and that both FL and HL were derived from germinal center B cells with the t (14 ; 18) translocation.","403":"Two natural killer T (NKT)-cell hybridomas were established by fusing sorted NKT cells with BW1100 thymoma cells. The first hybridoma line, 1B6, was CD4(+)8(-), whereas the second one, 2E10, was CD4(low)8(-). Initial characterizations revealed that both cell lines expressed an invariant T cell antigen receptor, which could be readily detected with alpha-galactosylceramide-loaded CD1d : Ig fusion protein (alpha-GalCer\/CD1d). Sequence analyses of the alpha and beta chains of the T cell receptor V genes revealed that 1B6 and 2E10 cells expressed V alpha 14J alpha 18\/V beta 8.2D beta 2J beta 2.7 and V alpha 14J alpha 18\/V beta 8.1D beta 1J beta 1.1, respectively. When these hybridoma cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies, alpha-GalCer\/CD1d, or alpha-GalCer in the presence of antigen-presenting cells, they produced IL-4 and IFN-gamma. The expression levels of CD69, CD154, and CD178 were concomitantly up-regulated on both hybridomas upon stimulation. Because it is difficult to isolate a sufficient number of NKT cells, these hybridomas should provide useful platforms to study a variety of functions of NKT cells.","404":"In this study, we have categorized cord blood CD5(+) B cells, which were examined using the horseradish peroxidase-colloidal gold double labeling immunoelectron microscopy, into three subtypes based on their morphology and immunohistochemical characteristics. Type 1a cells and type 1b cells (9% and 17% of the CD5(+) B cells, respectively) had few cytoplasmic organelles, a high nuclear\/cytoplasmic (N\/C) ratio (0.66 +\/- 0.03 and 0.58 +\/- 0.04, respectively), and a low nuclear contour index (NCI) value (1.56 +\/- 0.30 and 1.50 +\/- 0.27, respectively), whereas type 2 cells (74% of the CD5(+) B cells) had a low N\/C ratio (0.44 +\/- 0.11) and a high NCI value (2.05 +\/- 0.68). Type 2 cells, which had many cytoplasmic organelles, frequently had several uropod-like processes that bound to the gold particles. The N\/C ratios clearly showed that there were significant differences among the three types of CD5(+) B cells (p &lt; 0.01), and between CD5(+) T cells and the three types of CD5(+) B cells (p &lt; 0.05). For the NCI values, only type 1b and type 2 cells showed a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that type 1a cells are transformed into type 1b cells, and then into type 2 cells.","405":"Germinal centers are highly organized anatomic structures essential for the clonal expansion of germinal center (GC) B-cells and associated somatic hypermutation, isotype switching, selection of the high-affinity B-cells (affinity maturation), and elimination of irrelevant or autoreactive clones. The identification of cellular interactions and regulatory mechanisms controlling apoptosis within GCs is essential for a complete understanding of the cellular and molecular dynamics of the GC reaction. We performed a kinetic analysis of the apoptotic activity occurring within GCs of draining lymph nodes of mice immunized with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) after secondary stimulation. The apoptotic activity of GC cells can be divided into three distinct phases : 1) initial phase (within the first days after immunization), 2) reactive phase (from the 5th day to 15th day after secondary immunization), and 3) late phase (after the 15th day). Apoptosis decreased shortly after secondary immunization followed by an increase to peak after an additional 10 days. Finally, apoptosis of GC cells decreased to basal levels. Administration of apoptosis inhibitors decreased the amount of apoptosis during the reactive phase. These results suggest that the reactive phase may be the critical period in which clonal selection and cellular differentiation to antibody forming cells take place.","406":"We report here the rare case of a family predisposed to adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). Six of seven siblings developed ATL with ages of onset of 77, 48, 60, 64, 72, and 62 years old. Although virological tests for human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 were unavailable for two of the six patients, all were diagnosed with ATL based on their clinical, hematological, and histopathological features. Two of the six patients were tested for HLA haplotypes using fresh blood samples, and both were carriers of the HLA-A*26 allele known in the southern Japanese population to be susceptible to ATL. This series of genetic traits may help explain the familial predisposition to ATL.","407":"Cytokines exert multiple biological functions through binding to their specific receptors that triggers activation of intracellular signaling cascades. The cytokine-mediated signals may produce variable and even opposing effects on different cell types, depending on cellular context that is also dictated by the differentiation stage of the cell. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal proliferative disorder of human plasma cells. Myeloma cells appear to include mixed subpopulations in accordance with the expression of their surface antigens, such as CD45. Although interleukin-6 (IL-6) is widely accepted as the most relevant growth factor for myeloma cells, only a few subpopulations of tumor cells, such as CD45(+) immature cells, proliferate in response to IL-6. The activation of both signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1\/2 is not sufficient for IL-6-induced proliferation of myeloma cells that requires the src family kinase activation associated with a rapid translocation of CD45 to lipid rafts. The CD45 expression renders myeloma cells competent for not only mitogenic but also apoptotic stimuli, resulting in either proliferation or apoptosis of CD45(+) myeloma cells dependently upon the circumstantial stimuli. In contrast, in CD45(-) myeloma cells highly expressing IL-6 receptor alpha chain (IL-6Ralpha), IL-6Ralpha and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I receptors exist on plasma membrane in close proximity, facilitating efficient assembly of two receptors in response to IL-6. The synergistic effects of IL-6Ralpha on IGF-I receptor-mediated signals provide a novel insight into a Jak-independent IL-6 signaling mechanism of receptor cross talk in human myeloma cells. Furthermore, the signaling cross talk between the cytokine receptor, IL-6Ralpha\/gp130 and the growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 3 appears in myeloma cells carrying t(4;14)(p16.3;q32). In this review we propose several mechanisms of the IL-6-induced cell proliferation that is strictly dependent upon the cellular context in myelomas.","408":"Chromosomal translocations affecting band 3q27, where BCL6 gene is located, are among the most common genetic abnormalities in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell type (B-NHL). The BCL6 gene encodes a BTB\/POZ zinc finger transcription factor, which exerts repressive activity by recruiting corepressor molecules. The 3q27\/BCL6 translocation is unique in that it can involve not only immunoglobulin (Ig) genes but also non-Ig chromosomal loci as a partner. To date, around 20 non-Ig partner genes have been identified. As a result of non-Ig ; BCL6 translocations, many types of regulatory sequences of each partner gene substitute for the 5' untranslated region of BCL6, and the rearranged BCL6 comes under the control of the replaced promoter. The introduction of non-Ig ; BCL6 constructs into transformed cells led to high-level Bcl-6 protein expression in the nucleus, while BCL6 mRNA levels in clinical materials of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with non-Ig ; BCL6 translocations were unexpectedly low. A comparative study suggested that non-Ig ; BCL6 translocation and a low level of BCL6 mRNA expression are concordant indicators of a poor clinical outcome in cases of DLBCL. The coexistence of a non-Ig ; BCL6 translocation with t(14 ; 18)(q32 ; q21) in a single clone did not significantly affect the clinical features of follicular lymphoma. The pathogenetic and clinical implications of non-Ig ; BCL6 translocations in B-NHL subtypes may not be identical to those of Ig ; BCL6.","409":"Dendritic cell (DC) activation is triggered by cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and microbe components, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS). During the initial stage of infection, the microbe components appear to be present at low concentration. To determine the role of low-dose microbe-components in DC activation during the initial stage of infection, we examined the effects of low-dose LPS on cytokine-induced maturation and function of DCs. Low-dose LPS (1 ng\/ml) treatment of DCs had only additive effects on the expression of CD86 and major histocompatibility complex class II induced by various cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1beta, TNF-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. IL-1beta alone significantly induced IL-12 production in DCs, whereas TNF-alpha or IFN-gamma induced modest levels of IL-12 production. When low-dose LPS (1 ng\/ml), which only slightly induced IL-12 production, was added to the culture, only an additive effect was seen on IL-1beta-induced IL-12 production. In contrast, low-dose LPS synergistically enhanced TNF-alpha- or IFN-gamma-induced IL-12 production. SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK, markedly inhibited TNF-alpha- or IFN-gamma-induced IL-12-production either in the absence or presence of LPS, but showed only modest effects on IL-beta-induced IL-12-production. These findings suggest that the p38 MAPK pathway is essential for the synergistic IL-12 production induced by TNF-alpha- or IFN-gamma in combination with low-dose LPS in DC.","410":"We investigated the relationship of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma tumorigenesis to Helicobacter pylori infection, the t (11;18) translocation, and alterations in cell cycle regulators. We sought to assess the implications of altered expression of p27(Kip1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, on high-grade transformation and responsiveness to eradication therapy. We used immunohistochemistry to examine p27(Kip1), p53, and Ki-67 expression in 23 MALT lymphomas, five diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), and four DLBCLs with associated MALT lymphoma. All of the MALT lymphomas were positive for p27(Kip1) expression and negative for p53 with a low Ki-67 index, regardless of the sensitivity of these cells to eradication. All DLBCLs were negative for p27(Kip1) and positive for p53, exhibiting a high Ki-67 index. In DLBCLs with MALT lymphoma, p27(Kip1) expression was absent from both the MALT and large cells components. In all of these lymphomas, the MALT components were negative for p53 and displayed a low Ki-67 index, while the large cell components were positive for p53 with a high Ki-67 index. The expression patterns of the DLBCLs differed significantly from those of the MALT lymphomas. p27(Kip1) was not detected in either component of DLBCL with MALT lymphoma, suggesting that decreased expression of p27(Kip1) in the MALT component may be related to high-grade transformation. Thus, p27(Kip1) expression in morphological MALT lymphomas could be useful tool to predict high-grade transformation to DLBCL.","411":"Human Vgamma2Vdelta2 T cells recognize nonpeptide antigens derived from pathogenic microbes in a TCR-dependent manner, such as pyrophosphomonoester compounds from mycobacteria and malaria parasite and alkyl amines from Proteus, suggesting that this subset of gamma delta T cells is involved in infectious immunity. The precise recognition mechanism has been delineated using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy based on crystal structure of gamma delta TCR. On the other hand, several lines of evidence indicate that human gamma delta T cells are involved in tumor immunity. Although activated gamma delta T cells exhibit a cytolytic activity against most of tumor cells, only a small fraction of tumor cells, like Burkitt lymphoma cells and multiple myeloid cells, is recognized by human gamma delta T cells in a TCR-dependent manner. This implicates that human gamma delta T cells have two distinct pathways for anti-tumor immunity. One is a natural killer-like pathway and the other is a TCR-dependent pathway. Recently, it was shown that treatment of human tumor cells with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, therapeutic drugs for hypercalcemia in malignancy, generated antigenic structure on the surface of tumor cells, which could be recognized by human gamma delta T cells in a TCR-dependent manner. This tumor labeling system may lead to a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy.","412":"In Japan, EBV positive rate in immunocompetent patients with nodal lymphomas is less than 10% in B-cell and 20-50% in T cell lymphoma. Among extranodal lymphomas, EBV positive rate is higher in pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL), nasal NK\/T-cell lymphoma, and adrenal lymphoma. PAL is non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that develops from chronic pyothorax resulted from artificial pneumothorax for the treatment of lung tuberculosis or tuberculous pleuritis. This disease was originally described by Dr. Aozasa as a distinctive clinicopathologic entity in 1987, and now listed as the disease entity in the WHO classification of Tumours, Pathology &amp; Genetics, Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart (2004).","413":"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a number of malignant lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphomas, Hodgkin lymphomas (HLS), immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs), and subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We have recently identified a series of elderly patients afflicted with EBV-associated (EBV-positive) B-cell LPDs in the absence of predisposing immunodeficiencies ; we have named these neoplasms \"senile\" EBV+ B-cell LPDs. The large series of patients with this disease (n=76) provided additional evidence that this neoplasia, with a median age of onset of 71 years, has the highest incidence in elderly patients aged &gt;50 years, suggesting that this disease may be related to the immunological deterioration that occurs during the aging process. These lesions were pathologically characterized by varying numbers of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS)-like giant cells, often posing a diagnostic problem differentiating this condition from HL. Recent studies, however, have indicated that HL and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) may be more closely related than previously implied, promoting the general consensus that HRS cells are derived from B cells in most HL cases. The relationship between EBV+ HL and EBV+ B-cell LPDs remains to be clarified. This review provides a unique opportunity to highlight the gray areas between EBV+ HL and EBV+ B-cell LPDs. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the interrelationship, including their overlapping morphological and biological features."},"articletitle":{"0":"International definition of iMCD-TAFRO: future perspectives.","1":"Historical and pathological overview of Castleman disease.","2":"Lymphomatoid gastropathy\/NK-cell enteropathy involving the stomach and intestine.","3":"PD-L1-expressing extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, NOS with and without PD-L1 3'-UTR structural variations.","4":"Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease with positive antiphospholipid antibody: atypical and undiagnosed autoimmune disease?","5":"Serum IgG and lymphocyte counts are useful for the early detection of infection in patients receiving bendamustine-rituximab therapy.","6":"Bendamustine-induced rash is associated with a favorable prognosis in patients with indolent B-cell lymphoma.","7":"Tumor microenvironment of adult T-cell leukemia\/lymphoma.","8":"Current progress of the tumor microenvironment in lymphoid malignancies.","9":"Pediatric liver failure with massive sinusoidal infiltration of histiocytes.","10":"Rapid deterioration of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma with mass formation in the trigeminal nerve and multiple organ infiltration: An autopsy case report.","11":"Transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from marginal zone lymphoma in the anterior mediastinum: A case report and review of the literature.","12":"A sporadic case of CTLA4 haploinsufficiency manifesting as Epstein-Barr virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","13":"t(9;14)(p13;q32)\/PAX5-IGH translocation as a secondary cytogenetic abnormality in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","14":"Glucocorticoid-induced redistribution lymphocytosis in mantle cell lymphoma with hyaline vascular Castleman disease-like features.","15":"Intratumoral cancer immunotherapy exploiting anti-viral immunity.","16":"Clinicopathological analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma lacking surface immunoglobulin light chain restriction on flow cytometry.","17":"A difficult case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with Epstein-Barr virus-negative large mononuclear atypical cells.","18":"Better method for detection of CD30: Immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry?","19":"The biology of the tumor microenvironment in DLBCL: Targeting the \"don't eat me\" signal.","20":"Diagnostic utility of programmed cell death ligand 1 (clone SP142) immunohistochemistry for malignant lymphoma and lymphoproliferative disorders: A brief review.","21":"Lymphocyte-depleted classic Hodgkin lymphoma with primary extranodal disease: Two cases that highlight the combination of immunodeficiency and immune escape in the pathogenesis.","22":"Increased MYC expression without MYC gene translocation in patients with the diffuse large B-cell-lymphoma subtype of iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders.","23":"Establishment of an ATLL cell line (YG-PLL) dependent on IL-2 and IL-4, which are replaced by OX40-ligand+ HK with poly-L-histidine and dermatan sulfate.","24":"Significance of trogocytosis and exosome-mediated transport in establishing and maintaining the tumor microenvironment in lymphoid malignancies.","25":"A multicenter, phase II study of R-THP-COP therapy for elderly patients with newly diagnosed, advanced-stage, indolent B-cell lymphoma.","26":"Long-term spontaneous regression of Stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","27":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with significant intravascular invasion.
