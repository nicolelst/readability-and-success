article discusses the nutritional needs of moderate and late preterm infants (born between 32+0weeks and 36+6weeks' gestation) and makes recommendations for best practice both while these infants are in hospital and when they are discharged into the community. These recommendations were derived following a roundtable meeting of a group comprising two neonatologists, three paediatric dietitians, a health visitor\/paediatric nurse and a midwife practitioner. The meeting and medical writing assistance was sponsored by Nutricia. None of the participants accepted honoraria for their contributions to the discussion.","1":"COVID-19 has had a significant impact on patient health and the delivery of healthcare within the UK. This article highlights perioperative considerations as elective work moves back to pre-pandemic levels.","2":"Delirium affects around 20% of older inpatients, increasing mortality and length of stay. Around 30% of cases are preventable. The authors sought to determine compliance of the admissions to the Older People's Unit of the Royal University Hospital Bath with the national and internal guidelines for delirium screening and improve its use on admission. A total of 60 patients' notes were inspected for compliance. Subsequently, the authors implemented teaching, changed the admission proforma and re-wrote the hospital guidelines for delirium. The notes were rescreened at 6 and 18 months. Initially, 25% of notes met the national standards and 63% met the hospital criteria. At 6 months this was 52% and 82% respectively, and at 18 months it was 41% and 87% respectively. The proportion of patients screened via multiple methods also increased. There was a sustained improvement in compliance with the national and hospital standards for delirium screening. There was some degradation in the national standard but the proportion of patients meeting the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence standard was still higher than pre-intervention.

Currently in surgery it can be difficult to identify when innovation is occurring because of inconsistent oversight and reporting. New ways of identifying, monitoring and reporting surgical innovation are called for in order to optimise the process.","5":"Cervical artery dissection is a major cause of ischaemic stroke in young adults. The diagnosis can be challenging as some patients may present with seemingly benign symptoms such as a headache, neck pain or dizziness. However, the neurological sequelae of a transient ischaemic attack, vision loss or ischaemic stroke are potentially devastating. All hospital clinicians must be able to recognise this diagnosis and organise timely and appropriate investigations as antithrombotic treatment reduces the risk of stroke recurrence. This article reviews the literature to provide practical information for clinicians to recognise key risk factors and features of history and examination which should raise suspicion of cervical artery dissection. Diagnosis can now be made using the non-invasive, commonly available modalities of computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. Timely treatment with antithrombotic agents is recommended to reduce the rate of an ischaemic stroke.","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"Following dislocation of the glenohumeral joint with an isolated greater tuberosity fracture, closed reduction in the emergency department can lead to fracture propagation or iatrogenic fractures. This article assesses the evidence regarding when anterior dislocations of the shoulder with an isolated fracture of the greater tuberosity can be safely reduced in the emergency department, as there is currently no clear guidance on this. A total of eight articles described 172 cases which underwent closed reduction, which resulted in 22 cases of iatrogenic fractures. Female sex, increased patient age and fragments of the greater tuberosity were associated with an increased risk of iatrogenic fractures. Closed reduction in the emergency department appears to be a safe option in younger patients and those with greater tuberosity fractures less than 40% of the width of the humeral head.","13":"Most life-threatening conditions form a coherent clinical picture, with examination findings confirming the patient's history. However, pain out of proportion to examination findings can also signify an emergency - acute compartment syndrome, bowel ischaemia, necrotising fasciitis and acute aortic dissection may all present in this way. A lack of situational awareness leads doctors to erroneously rely on examination findings to flag impending catastrophe, but in such cases misdiagnosis or delayed treatment can have dire consequences. Patients with unexplained pain risk significant morbidity and mortality, and doctors are vulnerable to litigation and reputational damage. This article addresses this danger, exploring the causes and pathology of pain that is out of proportion, and presenting an approach to mitigate risk and prevent catastrophe.","14":"Most international medical graduates obtain a non-training job, such as a trust grade role, when they first start work in the UK. This transition into a new healthcare system comes with many sociocultural and educational challenges. The aim of this study was to learn more about the different types of challenges and propose solutions where possible. Qualitative data from a cohort of current or previous trust grade international medical graduates were collected at a UK teaching hospital. This was achieved through the use of questionnaires, interviews and obtaining views through a monthly forum meeting. Findings showed that participants lacked insight into the system and lacked clarity in relation to the role of a supervisor, career pathways, and medicolegal and ethical issues. Discrepancies in study budgets and study leave days, compared to those available to doctors in trainee posts was another issue that was raised. Communication in complex clinical scenarios was also reported to be an issue for many participants. Suggested solutions included a tailored online induction for international medical graduates in trust grade roles and a setting up a buddy system with existing or previous trust grade doctors. This study highlighted the challenges faced by international medical graduates in trust grade roles and proposed solutions where possible. Although responses varied, educational barriers were the most widely highlighted concern. To understand the full extent of these hurdles, perceptions of other healthcare professionals should be explored.

They are a rare but increasingly recognised group of syndromes, so a high level of suspicion is needed so the diagnosis is not missed. The diagnosis is typically based on a combination of clinical history and advanced imaging investigations. Compression of the arteries may be static (only provoked by compression) or dynamic (exaggerated by movement), and this should be considered when selecting imaging studies. Symptoms resulting from vertebrobasilar insufficiency or ischaemia of areas supplied by the internal carotid artery are caused by compression of the vertebral artery and the internal carotid artery respectively. Surgical procedures are the preferred treatment for most of these syndromes.","19":"","20":"","21":"An arterial injury is a time-critical emergency and, when associated with a fracture or dislocation, its management requires joint specialist input from orthopaedic and vascular or plastic surgeons. Initial management involves haemorrhage control and stabilisation of the patient, reduction and splinting of the limb and careful reassessment. With ongoing vascular compromise, urgent surgery is indicated to restore arterial flow and stabilise the skeleton, and this should be performed at a centre with appropriate expertise. This article provides an evidence-based review of the British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma for the diagnosis and management of arterial injuries associated with extremity fractures and dislocations.","22":"Infective endocarditis is a rare but deadly disease, with a highly variable presentation. The clinical manifestations of the condition are often multisystemic, ranging from dermatological to ophthalmic, and cardiovascular to renal. Thus, patients with infective endocarditis may first present to the acute or general physician, who may have a variable knowledge of the condition. The diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be challenging, relying on clinical, imaging and microbiological features. Recent decades have seen a transformation in the epidemiology and microbiology of infective endocarditis and yet, despite advances in diagnostics and therapeutics, mortality rates remain high. This review outlines the emerging studies and guidelines on the assessment and management of infective endocarditis, focusing on the evolving epidemiology of the condition, the role of new imaging modalities, updated diagnostic criteria, the latest on antimicrobial and surgical management, and the role of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of patients with infective endocarditis.","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"NHS England is planning to abolish the long-standing 4-hour target for waits in emergency departments. The target has been criticised as an arbitrary management target that is unrelated to clinical outcomes, but waits much longer than 4 hours in the emergency department cause a notable increase in mortality for admitted patients, suggesting that the 4-hour target is clinically important and should not be abolished.","27":"Recent years have seen major advances in our understanding of primary biliary cholangitis, with the condition now renamed to reflect the majority of patients who do not have cirrhosis. Data from large multicentre studies have greatly increased our knowledge of the natural history of primary biliary cholangitis, making the identification of higher risk patients clearer and facilitating the development of new medications. Recent guidelines have emphasised the importance of risk stratification, targeted treatment of symptoms and early prioritisation for second line therapies. The review summarises recent major developments in our understanding of primary biliary cholangitis and its management.","28":"There is a paucity of literature analysing the importance of leadership within trauma and orthopaedics. However, such skills are essential to make an orthopaedic surgeon proficient in their various roles. This literature review on leadership within orthopaedics enables an understanding of current issues. A narrative literature review was conducted using Pubmed, Medline and The National Centre for Biotechnology databases. The search string used to conduct the narrative literature review was (orthopaedic) and (leadership[Title]). The articles were screened by title, abstract and full text. A reference search was subsequently conducted on these papers using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. The papers then underwent a thematic analysis to understand the issues surrounding leadership in orthopaedics. The critical themes recognised were quality improvement, training, women in leadership, inequality and traits of a leader. Through reviewing the themes in this article, a framework was developed to identify the current issues and potential avenues of advancing orthopaedic leadership. This narrative literature review has demonstrated a paucity of research in orthopaedic leadership. Further work would create a robust evidence base, outline ideal orthopaedic leadership and standardise training to create better orthopaedic leaders.","29":"","30":"Chemical burns represent a small number of burn injuries in the UK. They have the potential to be life-threatening with serious aesthetic and functional consequences, accounting for 30% of all deaths from burns. Chemical burns are caused by corrosive agents (acids and alkali) leading to extensive tissue damage. Understanding the pathophysiology of a chemical burn injury and identifying the nature of the offending agent is important for effective management. Prompt assessment and management of chemical injuries is vital to reduce the deleterious effect of the compound involved. This article reviews the pathophysiology of a chemical injury and the management of these burns.","31":"Rhinitis and rhinosinusitis are common conditions which have a significant burden on healthcare services and can lead to reduced productivity in patients across the entire age spectrum. Three disease-specific quality of life tools were analysed in hospital and community settings to explore prevalence, disease characteristics and financial costs to sufferers, and to compare these aspects between cohorts (young children, young adult and adults). These tools were Modified Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (MSNOT-20) questionnaire for adults, MSNOT-20 Young Persons Questionnaire (MSYPQ) for 11-16-year-olds and Sami's Rhinosinusitis Diagnosis and Impact questionnaire for 5-10-year-olds. One of the top three symptoms in children aged 5-10 years was cough, which is a much less common symptom in adults. These validated, disease-specific, quality of life questionnaires provide a fuller illustration of the patient experience, allowing comprehensive comparative analysis across the ages.","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":"","37":"","38":"Olecranon fractures are common injuries, making up 10% of all fractures of the upper limb. They usually result from a fall from standing height in older people, or from a direct blow in young people. The olecranon's superficial location, with poor soft tissue and muscle protection, make it liable to fracture following direct impact. Factors such as the degree of initial force and the quality of the patient's bone result in a range of injury patterns, from simple undisplaced fractures to complex open fracture dislocations. In the context of high energy trauma, the patient should first be assessed for life-threatening injuries. A thorough history and clinical examination including neurovascular assessment should then be completed. Antero-posterior and lateral X-rays are sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Initial management includes immobilisation in an above elbow backslab, a sling and analgesia. Owing to the pull of the triceps muscle which attaches to the tip of the olecranon, fracture displacement is common and surgical intervention is often required, usually with good outcomes. Surgical techniques include tension band wiring, open reduction internal fixation with a pre-contoured locking plate and tension band suture fixation. Undisplaced fractures or displaced fractures in older patients can be managed conservatively with an above elbow cast for 4 weeks. This article covers applied anatomy, initial presentation, clinical assessment and evidence-based management.","39":"","40":"Allergic rhinitis affects 20% of the population of the UK. It confers a significant health burden upon the individual as it affects the patient's quality of life and is associated with serious comorbidities including asthma, sinusitis and conjunctivitis. Owing to its prevalence, it has a significant economic impact through its effects on education, productivity and use of healthcare resources. This review focuses on the management of allergic rhinitis and potential future treatments, because of the lack of clear national guidelines and because this illness is often misdiagnosed and mismanaged. The article provides a comprehensive overview of allergic rhinitis and illustrates the assessment criteria for various subcategories.","41":"","42":"","43":"The specialised foundation programme, previously known as the academic foundation programme, is an alternate foundation training pathway for doctors that are interested in research, medical education and leadership. The programme is highly competitive, with competition ratios rising to 1:5 in some units of application. A series of courses is held each year out of goodwill to assist students with the application process, but little has been published with respect to evidence-based approaches to both the application process and interviews. This article provides a series of frameworks to simplify the challenges posed by the application process and the academic, personal and clinical interviews.","44":"The management of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis has substantially improved in the last decade. For the induction of remission, rituximab is increasingly used in place of cyclophosphamide, particularly for patients with proteinase 3 (PR3)-associated vasculitis or relapsing disease, and those wishing to preserve their fertility. A lower dose regimen of glucocorticoids, with a more rapidly tapering schedule, is preferable and is as effective and safer than the standard-dose regimen. Avacopan, the complement C5a receptor inhibitor, is effective in the treatment of associated vasculitis and may replace glucocorticoids in the future. Plasma exchange provides no additional benefit for patients with severe anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, although it is still used in selected patients on a case-by-case basis. Rituximab is preferred for the maintenance of remission, repeated at fixed time intervals. The duration for which immunosuppressive therapy should be given is uncertain, but is generally longer for patients with PR3 disease or persistent anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody positivity. The anti-interleukin 5 monoclonal antibody, mepolizumab, is effective for the treatment of non-severe eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Several other targeted therapies are in the pipeline and further progress is expected in the coming years.","45":"","46":"Rotator cuff repair is increasingly being performed, and this is likely to continue to given the ageing population. An improvement in functional outcome can be achieved, with the best results noted in those tendons that go on to heal. Failure of repair following surgery can be associated with debilitating symptoms that are not always amenable to non-operative measures, so further surgery may be indicated for these patients. Several operative strategies have been described, but careful evaluation is required to determine the most suitable option. This review describes the decision-making strategies and treatment options available during management of a failed rotator cuff repair.","47":"Intravenous lignocaine has an emerging role in the treatment of acute pain within the perioperative setting, as recent consensus guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists have shown.

The report looked at all four links in the 'chain of survival', covering the last link, in-hospital advanced life support and post-resuscitation care, in most detail.","49":"Extra-mammary Paget's disease is a rare cancer affecting the anogenital region and can present with a myriad of symptoms. In women, the diagnosis of Paget's disease can be challenging as it mimics several other vulval conditions. It is important to promptly recognise this disease because of its potential association with synchronous tumours, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma. The mainstay of treatment is with immunomodulating therapies or surgery, but unfortunately the risk of recurrence is high and appears to be independent of treatment choice and tissue margin status. There is growing evidence to move away from traditional surgical excision to using topical therapy, such as imiquimod, as surgery can often be extensive and disfiguring with a prolonged recovery time. There is considerable psychosexual and physical morbidity associated with Paget's disease, largely owing to multiple surgical recurrences. As recurrences can occur several years after the initial presentation, long-term follow up of patients is recommended.","50":"Breast cancer is the most common global malignancy and the leading cause of cancer deaths. Despite this, undergraduate and postgraduate exposure to breast cancer is limited, impacting on the ability of clinicians to accurately recognise, assess and refer appropriate patients.

Awareness of the latest advice and guidelines regarding its presentation, investigation and management is paramount to improve patient outcomes and reduce morbidity. Immediate management of acute urinary retention relies on timely bladder decompression by catheterisation. Knowledge of the routes and types of catheterisation, including the associated risks, complications and contraindications, is essential to allow rapid and early intervention, thus preventing further complications. Differences in the presentation of patients with acute urinary retention reflect varying aetiologies, the knowledge of which determines long-term management and prognosis.","59":"","60":"Chest pain is a common presenting complaint with a broad differential diagnosis. Even after the full array of special investigations, a cause cannot be found in some patients. Psychological factors can play a significant role in the perception of chest pain. Patients with such a psychological disturbance may not meet the full criteria for a diagnosable psychiatric illness, and thus cannot be assigned a specific diagnosis. Not knowing how to manage this situation can lead to poor rapport between doctor and patient. Through their clinical acumen, judicious use of special investigations and by forming a therapeutic alliance, clinicians can identify and help these patients.","61":"Wide awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet, also known as WALANT, is the practice of performing surgery under local anaesthetic in the absence of a tourniquet. This technique uses the vasoconstrictive effects of adrenaline and the local anaesthetic effects of lignocaine to establish a Bier block with haemostatic control. Permitting active patient participation intraoperatively, wide awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet surgery improves patient compliance with rehabilitation and yields higher patient satisfaction. With reduced cost and equipment requirements, this method improves accessibility for patients and productivity for healthcare institutions. This is of particular benefit within the current COVID-19 climate, as wide awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet technique provides a means of overcoming restrictions to theatre access and anaesthetic support. This review delves into the current uses of wide awake local anaesthesia no tourniquet surgery, outlining the initial conception of the practice by Canadian surgeons. The advantages and disadvantages are considered, and potential future applications of this technique are discussed.","62":"Much is known and reported about sharps injuries among healthcare workers, but there has been a lack of published evidence regarding the psychological impact of sharps injuries among medical students. The purpose of this narrative review was to discover the psychological impact of sharps injuries within the medical student population. Medical, health and psychology databases were searched for studies written in the English language and published between 1980 and 2021. The review identified six studies conducted in six countries which described the psychological impacts of sharps injuries among medical students as being fear, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The findings highlight the potential psychological issues created by sharps injuries, and highlights that further research is needed into this topic to aid the education and prevention of this harmful problem.","63":"There has been a dramatic improvement in mortality rates among children with congenital heart disease with advances in neonatal screening and surgical techniques, resulting in a significant increase in the prevalence of adults living with congenital heart disease. The most common simple lesions of congenital heart disease include atrial and ventricular septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus and coarctation of the aorta, which are typically detected and treated in childhood. However, they may also present in adulthood with non-specific symptoms or incidental findings, such as refractory hypertension. As the adult population of those living with congenital heart disease grows, it is imperative that all clinicians remain abreast of these common cardiac conditions, irrespective of their specialty, as patients may present with sequelae of their congenital heart disease or other non-cardiac conditions.","64":"This editorial discusses the 'Enhancing Junior Doctors' Working Lives' report from Health Education England and emphasises the importance of junior doctors reading it and engaging with the content.","65":null,"66":"Research carried out in 2016 by two of the authors of this article investigated the role that leadership 'theory' plays within an individual's leadership development and identified other components of clinical leadership programmes that are key to enabling the development of future leaders. While early career doctors identified leadership theories and concepts as important within their development as clinical leaders, these must be closely tied to real-life practices and coupled with activities that aim to develop an increased self-awareness, understanding of others, clinical exposure and leadership tools that they can use in practice. During a healthcare crisis, such as a global pandemic, maintaining a focus on leadership development (particularly for more junior clinicians) might not be seen as important, but leadership is needed to help people and organisations 'get through' a crisis as well as help develop leadership capacity for the longer term. This article, drawing from contemporary literature, the authors' own research and reflections, discusses how leadership development needs to continually adapt to meet new demands and sets out tips for those involved with clinical leadership development.","67":"The British Orthopaedic Association's Standards for Trauma for the management of supracondylar humerus fractures in children specify that: 'A documented assessment of the limb, performed on presentation, must include the status of radial pulse, digital capillary refill time and the individual function of the radial, median (including anterior interosseous) and ulnar nerves.' The documentation of cases of supracondylar humerus fractures over 1 year was retrospectively analysed. An electronic pro forma for supracondylar humerus fractures was introduced, with prompts for the pieces of documentation required to meet national standards. The use of this pro forma was audited after 6 months and 12 months use. Documentation ranged from 10% for anterior interosseous nerve to 53% for radial pulse. In the second reaudit, documentation ranged from 86% for anterior interosseous nerve to 95% for median nerve function. There were 17 patients for whom all documentation was present, and for these patients the pro forma had been used. Use of an electronic clerking pro forma improves adherence. Full documentation of neurovascular status in paediatric supracondylar fractures is vital to allow for effective preoperative and postoperative further assessment. With the move into paperless documentation, online pro formas can help clinicians with effective assessment and documentation.

Copious inhalation of nitrous oxide may increase intra-alveolar pressure, resulting in barotrauma secondary to alveolar rupture. Pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema are common clinical findings in nitrous oxide-associated barotrauma. Prolonged nitrous oxide misuse may inactivate vitamin B12 through the alteration of its metabolism, causing demyelination of the central and peripheral nervous system. A spectrum of neurological manifestations has been reported, including peripheral neuropathy, myelopathy and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Medical therapies and psychosocial interventions aiming at nitrous oxide cessation are important treatment steps to achieve partial or complete recovery from the adverse effects associated with inhalation of nitrous oxide.","71":"Knee joint dislocation is a relatively uncommon injury but its management is important because of the associated high risk of vascular, neurological and multi-ligamentous knee injuries. Clinicians must be aware that not all knee dislocations are diagnosed on plain X-rays; a high index of suspicion is required based on clinical evaluation. Multidisciplinary specialist care is required in all cases to achieve best outcomes. Early one-stage or multiple staged ligament repair and reconstruction offer better outcomes, but most patients have some long-term functional limitation.

During the pandemic mental healthcare services in many parts of the world have been reorganised to incorporate modern technology and maintain efficient service delivery. Mental health professionals are playing a major role in alleviating the suffering resulting from this pandemic. A selective survey of the literature, including narrative reviews, was carried out to study the implications of digital psychiatry. Historically, epidemics have had a substantial effect on mental health and general health services. Telehealth appears to be the right solution to the present mental health crisis, but technology cannot substitute for human presence and proximity in mental health services, so the newer interventions have advantages and disadvantages. Remote methods of therapy are likely to continue to be used and proper assessment of these new ways of working in psychiatry is required. In the post-pandemic period, the challenge will be to combine digital and in-person therapies. Discussions about digital revolution in the field of psychiatry should be modified to digital evolution.","74":"Delirium is a clinical syndrome characterised by a disturbance of perception, consciousness and\/or cognitive function, with an acute onset, fluctuating course and a severe deterioration arising over hours or days. Delirium is usually triggered by a combination of influences including acute illness, surgery, drugs and environmental factors. It is commonly seen in older people presenting to hospital, but can also develop during hospitalisation. There are three types of delirium: hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed. All patients over 65 years old presenting to hospital should be screened for delirium using the '4AT' tool. An alternate method for diagnosing hospital-acquired delirium is described. This article outlines a 10-stage method for diagnosing, managing and preventing delirium, with emphasis on which areas of the history and examination should be prioritised, what the salient investigations are and both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to preventing and treating delirium. Finally, this article explores which patients require specialist referrals or investigations and how to best follow up patients with delirium.","75":"","76":"","77":"","78":"","79":"","80":"Acute pancreatitis is a condition whereby erroneous activation of trypsin and zymogen results in pancreatic autodigestion. There are many aetiologies, with alcohol intake and gallstones being the most common. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder in which patients' reduced food intake and psychological aversion of weight gain can result in low body weight and malnourishment. The link between pancreatitis and anorexia nervosa is not well understood; this article explores the theorised pathophysiology connecting the two conditions, as well as the optimal management of patients when the conditions co-exist based on current literature. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases for all journal articles on the topic of presentations of acute or chronic pancreatitis in adults with anorexia nervosa. The literature proposes various links between anorexia nervosa and pancreatitis. It is theorised that pancreatitis may arise as a result of malnourishment itself or secondary to the refeeding process. Some explanations focus on the histopathological changes to the pancreas that malnourishment induces, while others focus on the enzymatic changes and oxidative damage that arise in the malnourished state. More mechanical mechanisms such as gastric dilatation, gastrointestinal ileus and compartmental fluid shift during refeeding have also been proposed as explanations for the link between the conditions. Some medications used in the management of anorexia nervosa have also been linked to pancreatitis.","81":"This editorial reviews the Safety for All campaign, which is calling for improvements in, and between, patient and healthcare worker safety to prevent safety incidents and deliver better outcomes for all.","82":"","83":"","84":"Recognition of autism and the associated co-occurring physical and mental health issues has increased over recent years. However, undergraduate and postgraduate curricula take time to adapt and to impact on what is delivered in training so healthcare professionals, including doctors, report little training on these topics. Doctors need to know when someone might be autistic in order to respond to them appropriately. This article sets out the reasons why recognition of autism is important and the positive impacts of recognising and understanding autism on health outcomes, service delivery and patient experience. The negative consequences of not recognising autism or understanding the impact of autistic traits on the person are also explored. A companion article then covers how practice can be made more appropriate for autistic people to improve outcomes.","85":"","86":"The accompanying article set out why it is important to identify autistic people and the negative consequences of not recognising or understanding autism, including more severe illness and premature death.

For the patient, recurrent urinary tract infections can be burdensome and detrimental to their quality of life. For the clinician, they can be challenging to manage, and the socioeconomic burden on healthcare systems can also be substantial. Investigations serve to rule out any underlying structural or pathological abnormalities. In conjunction with behavioural prevention methods, treatment strategies include antibiotic and non-antibiotic approaches and holistic management approaches. This article provides an overview of the investigation and treatment of urinary tract infections and includes algorithms which can be used in daily clinical practice.","88":"","89":"","90":"","91":"In recent years, the number of people pursuing a surgical career in the UK has decreased. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the cancellation of surgical placements for medical students and has affected surgical education. This study evaluates the perceptions and impact of a 1-day virtual surgical conference for medical students considering pursuing a surgical career. All delegates of the 2021 Barts and The London International Surgical Conference were invited to participate in two online surveys pre- and post-conference. Data were collected and analysed to evaluate delegates' reasons for attending the conference, and attitudes towards virtual conferences and a surgical career before and after the conference. Out of 132 participants, 106 (80.3%) completed both the pre- and post-conference surveys. Clinical students showed a statistically significant difference in interest in pursuing a surgical career after the conference than before (P=0.03), unlike pre-clinical students (P=0.12). Post-conference, 43 (40.6%) preferred a virtual to a face-to-face conference, which was a slight increase from 40 (37.7%) pre-conference, while 73 (68.9%) and 80 (75.5%) participants favoured virtual talks and presentations respectively. In contrast, only 12 (11.3%) and 21 (19.8%) students preferred workshops and networking virtually. Furthermore, delegates liked the global accessibility and environmentally-friendly nature of virtual conferences but found they can be less engaging and be disrupted by a poor internet connection. Virtual surgical conferences have many benefits and can help encourage medical students towards a surgical career. They could help bridge the surgical educational gap in medical school during these unprecedented times. Virtual conferences, which have a broader and more inclusive reach, could be an important complement to conventional conferences after the pandemic.

It is characterised by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations, which can affect multiple organs. Early diagnosis and management reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. There is a well-established hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia clinic in London, and excellent links across Europe via the European Reference Network. However, local coordinated care for patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia across the UK can be variable and often absent for children and young people. Some patients travel long distances to receive care in London, while others are referred to local clinicians or lost to follow up entirely. This article presents the experience to date from two regional UK centres (Liverpool and Dundee) where care for patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is being coordinated and streamlined. While there is still a lot to learn, this article highlights some of the successes and challenges identified so far, with suggestions for how these could be addressed. Collaborative regional networks such as these can facilitate the sharing of best practice and ensure that all patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia are able to access safe, high-quality care.","96":"Ergonomics is the scientific study of people and their working conditions, aiming to improve effectiveness.

Clinicians should be aware of the potential diagnosis of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and how to manage these patients both in the acute and chronic setting. Identifying these patients and optimising their management can help reverse the reduced life expectancy back to that of the normal population. The management of these patients is complex and often requires a multidisciplinary approach, with difficult discussions to be had around screening for arteriovenous malformations and genetic testing. The stepwise management ladder can be used in both the medical and surgical strategies; there are multiple pharmacological and surgical options available, all with their own side effects and risks. Patient education is key to help informed decision making.

Publications have shown widespread gaps in the care of patients with primary biliary cholangitis. This article reviews the literature regarding currently licensed first- and second-line therapies and evaluates therapeutic options for symptomatic management of primary biliary cholangitis. Ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended for all patients with primary biliary cholangitis, with obeticholic acid available as second-line therapy, both having demonstrated safety and efficacy. Potential disease-modifying therapies, such as fibrates and budesonide, require further investigation before licensing. Cholestyramine is first-line therapy for pruritus, albeit with limited evidence and common side-effects. There is no licensed therapy for primary biliary cholangitis-related fatigue; treating underlying causes where applicable is recommended. Disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies must be considered in tandem when managing patients with primary biliary cholangitis. Emerging therapies show initial promise but further randomised trials with long-term follow up are required to evaluate their efficacy as single or combination therapies.","100":"There is a vast number of wound dressings to choose from, which can make selecting the most suitable dressing for a wound a daunting prospect.

The risk of developing retinal detachment increases with advancing age, myopia and trauma. Pre-existing retinal degenerations can precipitate a pre-detachment symptomatic period of photopsia or floaters, allowing clinicians to intervene early and prevent detachments. Novel imaging techniques, such as spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and well-established topographic modalities, such as B scan, can help to elucidate the type of detachment and any underlying causes, and help with surgical management. The overarching goal of treatment is to identify and seal all retinal holes, relieve vitreoretinal traction and prevent further recurrence. Prompt prophylactic retinopexy of retinal holes and tears is crucial in preventing retinal detachment, the main treatments of which are pars plana vitrectomy, tamponading agents and silicone scleral buckle.","109":"","110":"","111":"The 2021 National report from IBD UK included responses from over 10 000 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, over 70% of whom reported having at least one flare in the last 12 months.

This article discusses the pathophysiology and common causes of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, and provides practical considerations for patient management in acute medical settings. Non-invasive ventilation for persistent acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is widely recognised to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality. National audits highlight a need to improve patients' overall care and outcomes through appropriate patient selection and treatment initiation. Multidisciplinary involvement is essential, as this underpins inpatient care and follow up after hospital discharge. New non-invasive ventilation modalities may offer better patient comfort and compensate better for sleep-related changes in respiratory mechanics. Emerging therapies, such as nasal high flow, may offer an alternative treatment approach in those who cannot tolerate non-invasive ventilation, but more research is required to completely understand its effectiveness in treating acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.","116":"","117":"Airway management is fundamental to anaesthesia, and technology may help with the safety of this procedure.

The aetiology varies with geographical region, with the USA and Europe having a higher incidence of sexual trauma and the Middle East having a higher rate of self-manipulation. Diagnosis is usually clinical, but numerous imaging modalities have been used to confirm the fracture site and to help plan appropriate surgical management. Clinical examination will find a detumescent penis with a diffuse penile swelling and ecchymosis: the classic eggplant sign. The penis will often deviate away from the side of the injury. A history of the patient's inability to pass urine after the injury or of blood at the urethral meatus suggests an associated urethral injury. Immediate surgical management is the mainstay of treatment, with many surgeons favouring a degloving approach. Penile fractures also carry a risk of urethral tears and urethral repair may be necessary. This article describes the aetiology, presentation and management of penile fractures to enable identification and treatment in daily clinical practice.","120":"Dwindling interest in pathology as a career is a notable concern among medical students and graduates.

The prophylactic prescribing of proton pump inhibitors post-cardiac surgery is currently a class IIa recommendation of the European Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. A retrospective review of patients who underwent cardiac surgery between July and December 2019 in the authors' hospital was carried out, using discharge summaries. New treatment charts were introduced with a pre-printed proton pump inhibitor included in the 'regular medication' section of the treatment chart and two reaudits were performed using the same methodology. Before the intervention, 47% were prescribed omeprazole postoperatively, compared to 74% (P&lt;0.001) and 66% (P=0.008) in the first and second reaudits respectively. Gastrointestinal bleeding was more common pre-intervention (4% vs 1% respectively; P=0.10). This intervention resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the prescription of postoperative omeprazole and a decrease in gastrointestinal bleeds. However, other risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, arteriosclerosis and procedure urgency may have contributed to the absence of statistical significance in the latter.

In most cases, syncope can be confirmed with a detailed history and simple bedside tests, but tilt table testing remains an invaluable diagnostic adjunct in more complex cases. Often misunderstood, the tilt table test is a useful way to reproduce a patient's symptoms in a safe and controlled environment. The tilt table test is considered positive if the patient experiences symptoms associated with a drop in blood pressure or postural tachycardia. The test can support a diagnosis and can direct therapeutic interventions.","124":"This year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Rudolf Ludwig Virchow, a pathologist and polymath who, among other things, coined the terms leukaemia, embolism and thrombosis.","125":"Listeriosis is an infective complication that primarily affects pregnant women, patients at extremes of age or those with weakened immune systems. Ingestion of food contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes is the most common source of infection, causing self-limiting illness in immunocompetent hosts but associated with invasive infection and high mortality in high-risk patient groups. Milder illness presents as gastroenteritis with fever, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting common in the 7 days post exposure. Invasive infection, characterised by bacteraemia and encephalitis, can develop in high-risk patients. Fetal loss is a major complication of listeriosis during pregnancy. Penicillin-based therapy (high dose penicillin or amoxicillin) in combination with gentamicin is advised for invasive infection; co-trimoxazole may be considered for patients intolerant to penicillin. Vulnerable individuals, notably pregnant women, should be counseled on appropriate preventative strategies including avoiding foods commonly contaminated with L. monocytogenes, such as soft ripened cheeses, pate, cooked chilled meats, unpasteurised milk, and ready to eat poultry unless thoroughly cooked.","126":"This project explored how the implementation of national guidance for investigation and management of patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome impacted on service provision. Retrospective analysis of patients with suspected cauda equina syndrome during 12 months before the implementation of the national guidelines were compared with data from the 21 months following. Monthly mean numbers of referrals for suspected cauda equina syndrome increased from 10.1 to 18.9 (P&lt;0.001). Statistically significant increases were also seen in the total number of magnetic resonance imaging scans for suspected cauda equina syndrome, and the number of magnetic resonance imaging scans performed out of hours. The mean time interval, from magnetic resonance imaging scan confirming cauda equina syndrome to starting emergency decompressive surgery, reduced from 14.87 hours to 9.57 hours.

This review discusses the anatomical basis and classifies the different pathologies into primary, secondary and iatrogenic. The key elements to differentiate the pathologies within each classification which could cause a patient to suffer with metatarsalgia are outlined. Further investigations are briefly covered, but a linked article discusses the investigations of metatarsalgia in more detail. The article gives an overview of metatarsalgia to help clinicians to investigate and manage these symptoms.","141":"Recently there has been increased interest in the use and development of virtual clinics, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The need to provide clinical care, while minimising patient interaction, has led to wider adoption of both telephone and online consultations, with the potential complications and pitfalls that accompany such a change in practice. A literature search was performed using the Pubmed, MEDLINE and Embase databases, from database inception up to 25 January 2021. A total of 21 papers were identified as discussing virtual clinical assessment and the medicolegal implications. The main areas of concern included consent, misdiagnosis, lack of physical examination, privacy and patient satisfaction. This article assesses these areas and suggests techniques to address them.","142":"Scaphoid fractures are common and can cause significant morbidity if treated incorrectly. Thus, a working knowledge of the initial assessment and management of scaphoid fractures by non-specialists is crucial to allow quick diagnosis and avoid potentially catastrophic complications of scaphoid fracture. This article summarises the anatomy of the scaphoid, discusses methods to assess for scaphoid fractures and delineates management plans (conservative or operative) for fractures of the scaphoid based on location of vascular compromise. This article can also help the clinician predict which fractures may not unite with conservative management and therefore need referral to a specialist orthopaedic surgeon for possible surgery.","143":"Ruptures of the extensor mechanism of the knee are serious injuries requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment. They can be divided into soft tissue and bony causes. Soft tissue tendon injuries can be either partial or complete. Rupture of the quadriceps tendon is an uncommon injury and is more frequent in patients over the age of 40 years. Patella tendon ruptures are even rarer and are more frequent in patients under the age of 40 years. Causes can be direct or indirect. Complete ruptures of the quadriceps tendon or patella tendon benefit from early surgical management, while partial ruptures may be managed non-operatively. This article gives an overview of the presentation, assessment and management of soft tissue extensor mechanism tendon ruptures for core surgical, acute care common stem and emergency medicine trainees.","144":"The trauma and orthopaedic surgery department needed to modify practices as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study quantitatively assessed the effects of changes in resource allocation on the efficiency of trauma, specifically the number of operations performed per defined trauma session. Trauma lists were reviewed pre-COVID, at the peak and at the tail of the first wave of COVID-19 infections at a hospital in the UK. Efficiency was calculated before and after the reallocation of resources and this was defined as the number of cases per trauma session as well as turnaround times for each part of the surgical patient journey. The mean trauma list efficiency was 1.73 cases per session in February 2020 compared to 1.89 in February 2019. It reduced to 1.21 during the COVID peak in April 2020 compared to 1.90 in April 2019 and improved to 1.48 per session in June 2020 vs 1.82 in June 2019. Measures introduced at the start of the pandemic are likely to continue for the foreseeable future. Increased allocation of resources would be needed to allow urgent trauma surgery to provide a timely and efficient service.

Simulation-based education is used to develop clinicians' human factors skills. This article discusses the evidence concerning the efficacy of simulation-based education for improving the recognition and management of the acutely deteriorating adult patient, and the limitations of simulation-based education. Findings demonstrated simulation-based education was the most effective educational method identified for training staff in recognising unwell patients. The evidence demonstrating the impact of simulation-based education on patient outcomes was equivocal. The quality of the evidence was low grade regarding the efficacy of simulation-based education on human factors.

Following a global reduction in elective orthopaedic treatment and an exponential rise in surgical waiting times, innovative strategies are desperately needed to mitigate against the harmful effects of delaying vital operations on both patients and the wider society. Day case shoulder arthroplasty is a safe alternative to a traditional inpatient approach, with evidence supporting substantial cost savings, improved outcomes and fewer complications. Rigorous patient selection and a multidisciplinary team approach are paramount when adopting a day case service to deliver joint replacement surgery. This review outlines the principles of day case total shoulder arthroplasty and highlights key considerations when transitioning to this approach.","150":"Anaesthetists' use of positive end-expiratory pressure during elective general anaesthesia via supraglottic airway devices varies. Positive end-expiratory pressure may help to maintain oxygenation and prevent atelectasis, but could worsen the risk of air leak, gastric insufflation and catastrophic aspiration.","151":"Trainees around the world have experienced significant challenges to their personal life and training as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many have felt the psychological and physical impacts of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training-specific challenges have included redeployment, cancellation of operative lists, cancellation of educational opportunities and loss of exposure to training as a result of shielding. This article describes the impact of infection with COVID-19 on psychological wellbeing and training. It discusses general measures the trainee can take to mitigate the challenges this has caused, categorised into personal, planning and educational resources, and measures focussed on certain challenges. Finally, the vital importance of support for trainees is described, including peer support, departmental resources and the growing array of online material.","152":"Topical medications are key agents in treating a range of skin conditions, as they allow affected areas to be targeted while avoiding systemic side effects.

Good intraoperative haemostasis by the surgeon is a key factor in ensuring a bloodless field and reducing intraoperative blood loss. There is a myriad of mechanical, thermal and energy-based techniques available to use, each of which has their own benefits and drawbacks. The decision of which to use will depend on patient and procedural factors as well as the surgeon's preference. This article reviews techniques commonly used in surgical practice to maintain intraoperative haemostasis.","157":"Patella dislocation is one of the most common knee injuries, accounting for 3% of acute knee injuries. Despite its prevalence, patella dislocation is often missed, with a haemarthrosis often the only sign, albeit a non-specific one. A thorough history and examination are necessary to identify patella dislocation and its potential causes. Investigations should include cross-sectional imaging to evaluate both osseous and soft tissue structures in order to guide management. Management in the acute setting is normally non-operative, but damage to structural supports, osteochondral defects or recurrent dislocation should prompt consideration of operative treatment. Operative treatment should address the soft tissue stabilisers and\/or osseus deformities that predispose to, or occur secondary to, patella dislocation.","158":"","159":"This year marks the 100th anniversary of the death of Sir Felix Semon, one of the fathers of modern laryngology.","160":"The upper limb consists of four major parts: a girdle formed by the clavicle and scapula, the arm, the forearm and the hand. Peripheral nerve lesions of the upper limb are divided into lesions of the brachial plexus or the nerves arising from it. Lesions of the nerves arising from the brachial plexus are further divided into upper (proximal) or lower (distal) lesions based on their location. Peripheral nerves in the forearm can be compressed in various locations and by a wide range of pathologies. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and clinical presentations of these compression neuropathies can lead to prompt diagnosis and management, preventing possible permanent damage. This article discusses the aetiology, anatomy, clinical presentation and surgical management of compressive neuropathies of the upper limb.","161":"The idea of patients drinking, eating and mobilising (DrEaMing) at 24 hours postoperatively is being used as a marker of functional recovery.

The level of severity can range from a minor ooze to a life-threatening bleed. The initial management is often the responsibility of junior doctors working in otolaryngology or the emergency department, so they must be familiar with the initial steps in treating this often distressing condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has complicated matters further as much of the management takes place in the upper airway. This article outlines the key considerations in the management of epistaxis, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","169":"Bronchiectasis is a common respiratory condition, characterised by abnormal bronchial dilatation, that often leads to recurrent airway infection and inflammation. It is an increasingly recognised respiratory condition, both as a primary lung disease but also co-existing with other respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Diagnosis can have important treatment implications. There are shared systematic approaches to treatment, such as sputum clearance techniques, prompt treatment of exacerbations and, in certain circumstances, regular antibiotic therapy. It is vital to target antibiotic therapy appropriately, and knowledge of the patient's airway microbiology can assist with this. Certain infective and colonising organisms, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, cause worse patient outcomes and so need prompt treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In addition to this general management approach, there are many different underlying causes of bronchiectasis that should be identified wherever possible, to support more targeted therapy and prevent disease progression. This article provides a guide to the key principles of diagnosing and managing bronchiectasis, and outlines situations where more specialist respiratory support is required.","170":"","171":"","172":"","173":"Lunate dislocation is an uncommon but serious wrist injury, often resulting from a high energy mechanism of trauma. Advanced trauma life support protocols should be followed to diagnose and treat concomitant life-threatening pathology. Thorough neurovascular and soft tissue examination is required to identify open wounds and median nerve dysfunction, including acute onset carpal tunnel syndrome. Imaging is undertaken to appreciate injury severity, which is graded by the Mayfield classification. Closed reduction in the emergency department is the initial management, which alleviates pressure on neurovascular structures. Definitive management is surgical, most commonly via open reduction and direct ligamentous stabilisation. The aims of surgery are to restore anatomical carpal alignment and maintain stability, allowing repair and healing of the important wrist ligaments. Medium-to long-term functional outcomes are adequate, with most patients returning to work within 6 months. However, progressive radiographic midcarpal arthrosis is common, as well as permanent loss of grip strength, range of motion and chronic pain.

This article discusses the diagnosis and management of common interstitial lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease associated-interstitial lung disease, sarcoidosis and drug-induced interstitial lung disease. A multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis of interstitial lung disease is the gold standard; key history and examination features, blood panel, pulmonary function tests, high resolution computed tomography imaging, and when required bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy results are discussed to reach a multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis. Advances, including the development of the disease-modifying anti-fibrotic medications nintedanib and pirfenidone, continue to shape the future management of interstitial lung disease. A holistic approach to the care of patients with interstitial lung disease is paramount, as they often have a high symptom burden and considerable palliative care needs.","177":"Lateral condyle fracture of the humerus is the second most common paediatric elbow fracture and is often missed, which can result in severe consequences including malunion, growth arrest and tardy ulnar nerve palsy. The difficulty in managing this fracture stems from a lack of awareness and the often subtle findings on radiographs. Patients can also present with quite vague symptoms; clinicians who do not have a high index of suspicion may not investigate beyond the initial clinical assessment and could miss vital cues. This article provides a guide to managing this common paediatric fracture, from initial presentation to definitive treatment, and discusses the complications that can ensue if managed incorrectly.","178":"Central venous catheters are sited for a variety of reasons in the adult critically ill patient.

Living with this disease imposes a huge physical and psychological burden upon the patient which requires a comprehensive, systematic and patient-focused assessment, using a wide range of clinical expertise from within the multidisciplinary team. This article describes a severe asthma systematic and multidimensional day case assessment, and the positive benefits that the authors perceive it offers for patient care. These benefits include a confirmed diagnosis, consideration of alternative diagnosis, enhanced adherence, medication optimisation, access to and gatekeeping of high-cost specialist medications, improved patient self-management skills and signposting to appropriate therapies. As a consequence, they believe that this facilitates better patient outcomes through a reduction in corticosteroid exposure, exacerbations and hospitalisation. This severe asthma multidisciplinary team day case approach offers more than just physical benefits when compared with the traditional medical model. Patient feedback reports an excellent patient experience, feeling listened to, understood, empowered and hopeful for the future.","181":"Pulmonary embolism remains a common and potentially deadly disease, despite advances in diagnostic imaging, treatment and prevention.

Hospital physicians manage a significant portion of acute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease admissions to hospital and readmissions after discharge. Optimal management of exacerbations requires controlled oxygen therapy and ventilatory support where necessary, and careful administration of bronchodilators, steroids and antibiotics. Holistic care for these patients includes nutritional supplementation and palliative support for those with advanced disease. To reduce the chance of readmission, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease care bundles can be used, along with a review of inhaled and oral therapies. Where available, hospital-at-home discharge schemes can safely facilitate early discharge. Most importantly, high quality evidence-based smoking cessation support must be offered to smokers. Exercise improves the physiological and psychological condition of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and should be encouraged, with referral to a pulmonary rehabilitation service if available.","184":"","185":"Pulmonary embolism remains a common and potentially deadly disease, despite advances in diagnostic imaging, treatment and prevention.

This study analysed the reporting at the authors' hospital. The authors analysed 204 reports submitted across 12 months to investigate the nature and pattern of the exception reports. The majority of reports (86%) were for 'hours and rest', 5% for education and 9% for both. On average doctors reported an additional 1.32 hours of work per report. The most common response was time off in lieu, but 13% of reports were never responded to. Qualitative analysis showed the most common reasons for reporting were 'work outside of rostered hours', 'workload' and 'staffing issues'. Over 10% of the reports discussed an educational issue. The data were not specific and there was fewer than one report per junior doctor in the period analysed. It is therefore unlikely that the reports submitted represent the additional work done by junior doctors at the hospital. Guardians should investigate local attitudes to exception reporting and educate both seniors and juniors on the importance of submitting accurate exception reports.

As such, there is an expectation that when undergoing invasive procedures patients with cirrhosis are at increased risk of bleeding. Standard practice is to optimise laboratory values with prophylactic transfusions of platelets, plasma and fibrinogen to reduce perceived bleeding risk. There has been a shift in thinking regarding coagulation in patients with chronic liver disease, whereby a rebalancing of haemostasis occurs with reduction in both procoagulants and anticoagulants. Guidelines for the preprocedural management of patients with chronic liver disease are inconsistent and may not account for this new paradigm. The risk of prophylactic transfusion should be measured against the risk of bleeding while considering the rebalancing of haemostasis. Future management may be guided by whole blood viscoelastic tests or use of thrombopoietin receptor agonists to optimise patients in these scenarios.","194":"Temporary epicardial pacing wires are used after cardiothoracic surgery to maintain a stable cardiac rhythm. They must be distinguished from the more commonly encountered transvenous temporary pacing wires, which are often used in coronary care units for the same purpose. Patients with temporary epicardial pacing wires may be transferred to hospital wards where these wires are not usually encountered, such as COVID wards, the general intensive care unit, the coronary care unit or general surgical wards if a laparotomy was required in the early period following cardiac surgery. Serious complications may arise in managing patients with temporary epicardial pacing wires, which are well known in the cardiothoracic unit but not so well known elsewhere in the hospital. This article discusses the dangers associated with the management of temporary epicardial pacing wires in adult patients, some of which are common to temporary transvenous pacing wires and others are unique to temporary epicardial pacing wires.","195":"Obesity is a worldwide epidemic and official figures demonstrate a rising prevalence, both in the UK and globally.

Inpatient falls also have financial implications for healthcare systems, including litigation costs. This article provides an approach to assessing a patient presenting with a fall, encompassing the cause and consequence of the event. It also highlights the need to consider both the acute and chronic factors that predispose a particular patient to fall. Chronic factors such as frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive impairment, and continence issues are often under-recognised and, as a result, not managed optimally. A comprehensive geriatric assessment is an ideal structure to identify modifiable risks. Practical interventions that can be of benefit to minimise a patient's risk of falling include a medication review, assessment of their mobility and their environment. In addition, continence review and visual assessment may be appropriate.","203":"Patient and public involvement involves ascertaining the opinions of and collaborating with patients and members of the public to holistically improve the quality of research. Patient and public involvement provides patients with a platform to use and share their lived experiences. This allows healthcare professionals to gain a deeper appreciation of the patient's perspective, which enables future research to be more patient centred and tailored to patients' requirements. Patient and public involvement aims to broadly encapsulate the opinions of the public, so ensuring diversity is recommended. This article provides a practical framework to increase diversity and engage hard-to-reach demographics in patient and public involvement. It highlights some common barriers to participation and methods for overcoming this, describes sampling frameworks and provides examples of how these have been adopted in practice.","204":"Despite epistaxis being a common presentation to emergency departments there is a lack of guidelines, both nationally and internationally, for its management. The authors reviewed the current management of epistaxis and then introduced a new pathway for management to see if care could be improved. The aims were to evaluate the impact of the pathway on reduction of emergency department breaches, emergency ambulance transfers and hospital admissions. The study was an interrupted time series analysis over 29 months and included 903 participants. A pathway for the management of adults with non-traumatic epistaxis was designed and implemented in a university teaching hospital with an emergency department annual attendance rate of 105 495 in 2019-20. The pathway led to a 14-minute longer stay in the emergency department, a 5% increase in emergency department breaches, an 8.2% reduction in admissions, a 3.6% reduction in emergency ambulance transfers, a 14.1% increase in nasal cautery and a 3.2% reduction in nasal packing. The authors calculate that these results equate to roughly 56 hospital bed days saved, providing better care closer to home for patients, in addition to beneficial knock-on effects for other emergency department and admitted patients. ","205":"","206":"Ventilatory support is vital for the management of severe forms of COVID-19. Non-invasive ventilation is often used in patients who do not meet criteria for intubation or when invasive ventilation is not available, especially in a pandemic when resources are limited. Despite non-invasive ventilation providing effective respiratory support for some forms of acute respiratory failure, data about its effectiveness in patients with viral-related pneumonia are inconclusive. Acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 infection causes life-threatening respiratory failure, weakening the lung parenchyma and increasing the risk of barotrauma. Pulmonary barotrauma results from positive pressure ventilation leading to elevated transalveolar pressure, and in turn to alveolar rupture and leakage of air into the extra-alveolar tissue. This article reviews the literature regarding the use of non-invasive ventilation in patients with acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 and other epidemic or pandemic viral infections and the related risk of barotrauma.","207":"Complications following surgery are common, predictable and often preventable.

The disease is characterised by chronic and relapsing inflammation, resulting in scarring and discharging sinuses. Granulomatous mastitis is considered to be idiopathic and the pathogenesis is poorly understood. An amplified immune response has been proposed as a likely cause and there is evidence linking Corynebacterium to some cases of granulomatous mastitis. The presentation is similar to bacterial mastitis or abscess and antibiotics are commonly commenced empirically. The cornerstone of diagnosis is histopathological evaluation on core biopsy; an index of suspicion based on demographic assessment can avoid delays in diagnosis. Management is difficult and there is no consensus on best treatment. Various treatment regimens are described, with high relapse rates relating to the nature of the condition. Watchful waiting is appropriate for mild presentations and steroids are the mainstay of treatment for more severe cases.

An assessment of ankle stability determines treatment, taking into account comorbidities and preoperative mobility which need special consideration. Non-operative management includes splint or cast, allowing for early weightbearing when the ankle is stable. Operative management includes open reduction and internal fixation, intramedullary nailing (of the fibula and hindfoot) and external fixation.

Burnt-out doctors self-report increased rates of medical errors and the provision of suboptimal patient care. Surgeons in training are particularly at risk of burnout and are also less likely to seek professional support. Female surgical trainees have especially high rates of attrition, potentially because of issues surrounding childcare and motherhood. Several strategies to reduce burnout and promote resilience have been trialled among doctors. Schwartz rounds and mindfulness training have been shown to be effective, but only in those motivated to participate. A reduction in working hours has conflicting results, particularly among surgical trainees, which may be linked to the subsequent reduction in training opportunities, such as operative time and the ability to complete assessments.

However, it is more frequently seen in older adults. It is a common geriatric syndrome, and its investigation should form part of a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Continence problems are usually ignored by patients and not reported to a medical professional, but with simple assessment and even simpler interventions, a significant improvement can be made for those living with incontinence. Most cases need a simple clinical assessment consisting of a good history and basic examination covering the abdomen, external genitalia and rectum. If no reversible causes are found, further investigations can be considered. The treatment for incontinence can be split into non-surgical and surgical management. Simple conservative measures, such as education around fluid intake, weight loss, managing constipation and pelvic floor exercises, can make a huge and positive impact on managing incontinence. If these are not effective, pharmaceutical therapies and surgical management can be considered, but there needs to be a careful consideration of the risk vs benefit in frail older adults.","235":"The number of paediatric anterior cruciate ligament injuries is rising at a greater rate than in the adult population, as a result of the increased participation of children and adolescents in sports. This review explores the key presentations, diagnostic and management plans, and prevention methods associated with paediatric anterior cruciate ligament injuries. This injury presents as an acute pop and effusion, with limitations in gait, and can be extremely debilitating. Clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging are used to diagnose the injury. The pivot shift and Lachman test remain the most valid exams when suspecting an anterior cruciate ligament tear. Management of the injury can be surgical or non-surgical depending on the severity of the tear and associated injuries. The surgical approach chosen is determined by the patient's Tanner classification, considering potential damage to the physes of the bone. Management plans should include rehabilitation consisting of strength, proprioception and neuromuscular training, to maximise the patient's recovery. Injury prevention programmes, consisting of strength training and neuromuscular training, should be followed by young athletes to reduce anterior cruciate ligament injuries. Compliance and earlier implementation coupled with an understanding of the biomechanics of anterior cruciate ligament injuries and verbal feedback maximise the benefit of neuromuscular training.","236":"This article discusses the joint guidance from the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine and Centre for Perioperative Care, which provides recommendations for establishing and delivering enhanced perioperative care services.","237":"","238":"Spinal cord stimulation is the main neuromodulation therapy for certain chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

This article gives a narrative review of the existing literature, biological rationales and current state of clinical evaluation for micronutrient therapies. The importance of vitamin A, the B vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, eicosapentaenoic acid, vitamin E, selenium, zinc and a range of combination therapies are discussed, looking at their effects on reducing rates of infection, reducing severity of infection and improved recovery from infection. Further discussion regarding the level of evidence required for nutritional interventions is included.","241":"Necrotising fasciitis is a severe, life-threatening and rapidly progressive soft tissue infection that often requires aggressive surgical management, with an estimated incidence of about 0.24-0.40 per 100 000 in the UK. Necrotising fasciitis can be classified based on its microbiology or the anatomy or body region affected. Initial signs of necrotising fasciitis can be minimal and non-specific but a patient often presents with pain out of proportion to clinical signs on examination, as well as erythema and oedema, in addition to systemic symptoms associated with sepsis. Diagnosis is often based on high clinical suspicion with biochemical and clinical imaging used as adjuncts. To aid with early diagnosis of necrotising fasciitis, a scoring system known as the Laboratory Risk Indicator for necrotising fasciitis was developed which has a positive predictive value of 92%. Once diagnosed, appropriate resuscitation and antibiotics, along with prompt and aggressive surgical debridement, is the mainstay of treatment.","242":"","243":"","244":"The Montgomery v Lanarkshire Health Board (2015) case set a precedent that has driven the modernisation of consenting practice. Failure to demonstrate informed consent is a common source of litigation. This quality improvement project aimed to provide pragmatic guidance for surgeons on consent and to improve the patient experience during decision making. Elective orthopaedic patients were assessed and the quality of documented consent was recorded. Data were collected over two discrete cycles, with cycle 1 used as a baseline in practice. The following criteria were reviewed: grade of consenting clinician, alternative treatment options, description of specific risks, place and timing of consent and whether the patient received written information or a copied clinic letter. Cycle 1 results were presented to clinicians; a teaching session was provided for clinicians on the standard of consent expected and implementation of a change in practice was established with a re-audit in cycle 2. There were 111 patients included in cycle 1, and 96 patients in cycle 2. Consent was undertaken mostly by consultants (54%). Specific patient risks were documented in 50% of patients in cycle 1 and 60% in cycle 2. Risks associated with a specific procedure were documented in 42% in cycle 1 and 76% in cycle 2, alternative options in 48% (cycle 1) and 66% (cycle 2). A total of 14% of patients in cycle 1 and 8% in cycle 2 had documented written information provision. Copied letters to patients was only seen in 12% of all cycles. Documentation from dedicated consenting clinics outperformed standard clinics. Highlighting poor documentation habits and refining departmental education can lead to improvements in practice. The use of consenting clinics should be considered and clinicians should individually reflect on how to address their own shortcomings. Other units should strongly consider a similar audit. This article provides stepwise advice to improve consent and specifics from which to audit.

A pilot study was carried out to evaluate the educational impact of peripatetic teaching in clinical medical education. There has been no previous evaluation of this form of teaching within medical education. A pilot study was carried out to evaluate small group clinical sessions encompassing peripatetic teaching. A total of 56 post teaching questionnaires were completed and evaluated (return rate ~95%). High levels of satisfaction (n~4.7\/5) were reported from this method of teaching. On average, a total of 1420 steps were taken during each teaching session, identifying additional exercise benefits for all. This article identifies educational and health benefits to peripatetic teaching. The authors present a simple framework to structure each teaching session using the mnemonic FIRM - Feedback, dIscussion, Reflection and Mentorship. From this pilot study, the authors conclude that there are perceived benefits for teacher and learner from this teaching method. ","248":"Knowledge of the aetiologies of large bowel perforation are fundamental to its management. Stercoral perforation is a rare cause associated with high mortality. Owing to the paucity of coverage of this condition in the literature, this review raises awareness of stercoral perforation among clinicians. A literature search of PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid and Cochrane was performed. Key search terms included 'stercoral, perforation', 'perforated', 'perforat*' and 'stercoral perforation'. Only literature published between December 2011 and July 2020 was included to avoid duplication. Twenty-nine papers were obtained giving an overall cohort of 58 patients. The median age was 58 years (range 2-83 years) and 72.4% (n=42) were female. Constipation was reported in 69% (n=40) and 20.7% (n=12) reported chronic opioid use. A computed tomography scan was performed in 94.8% (n=55) of cases and typically a Hartmann's procedure (n=40, 72.2%) was performed. The mortality rate was 17.2% (n=10). The median age of patients with stercoral perforation has decreased from that found in previous studies and the mortality rate has improved. Chronic opioid users have also emerged as an important cohort. Early recognition, diligent decision making and focused perioperative care form the backbone of the definitive management of stercoral perforation. ","249":"In view of the high morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19, early and honest conversations with patients about goals of care are vital. Advance care planning in its traditional manner may be difficult to achieve given the unpredictability of the disease trajectory. Despite this, it is crucial that patients' care wishes are explored as this will help prevent inappropriate admissions to hospital and to critical care, improve symptom control and advocate for patient choice. This article provides practical tips on how to translate decisions around treatment escalation plans into conversations, both face-to-face and over the phone, in a sensitive and compassionate manner. Care planning conversations for patients with COVID-19 should be individualised and actively involve the patient. Focusing on goals of care rather than ceilings of treatment can help to alleviate anxiety around these conversations and will remind patients that their care will never cease. Using a framework such as the 'SPIKES' mnemonic can help to structure this conversation. Verbally conveying empathy will be key, particularly when wearing personal protective equipment or speaking to relatives over the phone. It is also important to make time to recognise your own emotions during and\/or after these conversations.","250":"","251":"Given the critical physiological role of potassium, it is understandable that the development of severe hyperkalaemia requires effective management to reduce its effects, which include muscle weakness, paralysis and cardiac arrhythmias. Hyperkalaemia most often results from the failure of renal adaptation to potassium imbalance. Patients who are most susceptible to the development of hyperkalaemia include those with chronic kidney disease and those with heart failure. These patients are often treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II-receptor blockers, but the development of hyperkalaemia can require down-titration or cessation of RAAS inhibitors. This presents a significant challenge to nephrologists, cardiologists and healthcare professionals treating these patients as this can prevent them from receiving maximum guideline-directed RAAS inhibitor therapy. Panellists in this roundtable discussion shared their clinical experiences of using potassium binders to manage hyperkalaemia in patients with chronic kidney disease and patients with heart failure (illustrated with case studies) in Northern Ireland and considered recommendations for the implementation and maintenance of chronic potassium-lowering treatment.","252":"","253":"","254":"","255":"","256":"","257":"Lung-protective ventilation significantly reduces mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, but do the advantages of this approach transfer from the intensive care unit to the operating room?","258":"Infants born prematurely are often discharged from hospital before 37 weeks post-menstrual age. While breastfeeding will meet all the nutritional requirements of full-term infants, these preterm infants may need enhanced levels of protein, minerals and possibly energy to ensure optimum growth, bone mineralisation and neurological development. To meet these additional nutrient needs in the neonatal unit, it is currently recommended that multinutrient breast milk fortifier is added to maternal breast milk. There may also be benefits in continuing to provide fortified milk after discharge, potentially including improved growth and preserving breastfeeding, and this is increasingly becoming a recognised practice in some neonatal units. This article presents the discussion and consensus of a multidisciplinary panel of neonatologists, neonatal dietitians, a GP and a neonatal outreach sister. The aim is to develop guidance on providing safe and effective nutritional supplementation for preterm infants after discharge in order to maintain optimal growth. This guidance is aimed at community healthcare staff and is based on the limited evidence available, using shared best practice and expertise.","259":"","260":"The PARTNER 3 and Evolut LRT trials have provided the evidence base for transcatheter aortic valve implantation in low-risk patients.

Although a low dose is most often used, some clinicians opt to use higher dose creams with close monitoring of the patient. The committee should publish the evidence behind these statements or amend its official position.","263":"Pregnancy is a hypercoaguable state. As part of the multidisciplinary team on labour ward, the anaesthetist plays a role particularly in advising the women and the obstetric team regarding the timing and even choice of regional analgesia given the potential risk of complications, as this may be affected by the anticoagulation treatment pregnant women may be on. It is important to understand the type of anticoagulation regimens parturients might be on and what sort of risk assessment they must undergo, as this has obstetric and anaesthetic implications. Although a rare presentation, management of women with mechanical prosthetic heart valves who are pregnant requires detailed and highly specialised care in tertiary care centres with a well-developed multidisciplinary team and pathway. Despite their rare presentation, it is important to understand the intricate and complex management that these women require as they have a high morbidity and mortality rate.","264":"","265":"","266":"","267":"","268":"Management of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma should provide a holistic approach to a patient's wellbeing. Treatments depend on the stage of lymphoma. Patients with the early stages tend to have a near-normal life expectancy. Management should be aimed at improving the extent of disease and reducing symptoms with minimal therapeutic adverse effects. Skin-directed treatments are preferred and may be used in combination with treatments for symptom relief such as anti-pruritic medication. In advanced stages of disease where the median life expectancy is reduced the aims are also to prevent disease progression and prolong life, and this requires a multidisciplinary approach. Symptom control remains important as patients often have painful, itchy disfiguring lesions which greatly impact on health-related quality of life. National and international guidelines provide stage-related treatment options to be considered with first-line options followed by subsequent second-line therapies. All are listed in no particular order of preference and are chosen according to patients' needs and expertise of the treating centre. Several first-line options may be chosen before moving to the second-line options. Three drugs received European Medicines Agency approval in 2017 and 2018 (chlormethine gel, brentuximab and mogamulizumab) but there still remains an unmet need for more improved treatments or combinations. Most treatments only result in a partial response and there is no cure for early-stage disease; as such, patients live for a long time with their disease. In the advanced stages if a good response is achieved eligible patients will be considered for an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant.","269":"Antibiotics are one of the most widely used classes of drugs within hospitals in the UK. They have a wide range of uses within all surgical specialties, both as preoperative prophylaxis and for treatment of acute surgical conditions. Antimicrobial resistance has increasingly been seen as a major issue, as the production of new antibiotics has decreased and overall use worldwide has increased. With the COVID-19 pandemic increasing concerns about antimicrobial resistance, there is an ever-increasing need for action. This article examines the particular challenges of antibiotic stewardship in surgical departments within the UK, and outlines possible solutions for improving adherence and reducing the risk of antimicrobial resistance in the future.","270":"Globus is the sensation of a foreign body in the throat. Investigation and management of patients with globus is widely variable. Most investigations yield negative results yet incur varying patient morbidity and healthcare costs, while malignancy is vanishingly rare in the absence of red flag symptoms and ear, nose and throat examination findings. History taking is key and can help to identify possible causative pathology, directing further investigations and management if necessary. Treatment of globus mainly centres on patient reassurance and counselling, and may include reflux management, neuromodulation, or speech therapy in selected cases, and treatment of any identified cause.","271":"Major abdominal surgery is associated with significant morbidity, not least the development of acute kidney injury. As a common perioperative complication, acute kidney injury is associated with increased length of stay, increased risk of perioperative infection and the potential development of chronic kidney disease. Moreover, the development of acute kidney injury is independently associated with an increased risk of death. Perioperative acute kidney injury is not a single entity, but describes a clinical syndrome with multiple causes including physical causes related to the surgical procedure, ischaemia-reperfusion injury and the use of potential nephrotoxins. Currently, acute kidney injury is defined by changes in serum creatinine level and urine output criteria, which although robust in heterogenous populations, may not perform as accurately in the perioperative period. This article discusses these issues including the potential role of novel biomarkers for early detection of perioperative acute kidney injury, as well as the use of predictive modelling. Treatment is mainly supportive but evidence suggests that more targeted therapy may lead to improved outcomes.","272":"","273":"Ever-developing changes to the working hours of junior doctors by the European Working Time Directive, the junior doctor contract of 2019 and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the professional identity of doctors. There has been little investigation into its influence on the multifaceted aspects of postgraduate medical training, which feeds into how trainees consider themselves professionally and the concept of professional identity or 'being a doctor'. A review of the medical, socio-political and educational literature reveals that the impact on the professional identity development of trainees is influenced by several perspectives from the trainee, trainer and the public. Gross reduction in working hours has no doubt decreased the raw volume of clinical experiences. However, to counteract this, smarter learning processes have evolved, including narrative reflection, supervised learning events, and a greater awareness of coaching and training among trainers.","274":"","275":"Cervical radiculopathy is a neurological condition caused by dysfunction or compression of a cervical nerve root. Patients often report unilateral neck pain with radiation to the ipsilateral arm, often with sensory changes in a dermatomal distribution. Weakness and reflex changes are also commonly found and can be very troubling for patients. Careful history and examination is important to identify any more concerning features such as progressive symptoms and features of myelopathy, which could prompt surgical management. Although the majority of patients will see an improvement in their symptoms over time with conservative management, surgery is indicated in patients with debilitating pain, progressive neurology, significant weakness, instability or myelopathy. Advancements in surgical techniques offer a range of potential operations that should be considered carefully for each patient. This article outlines the clinical approach to presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management.","276":"Patient education is an important part of obtaining informed consent, but can also be used to educate patients about how to prepare for surgery and help them take responsibility for improving their own health to reduce their risk of perioperative complications.","277":"","278":"Electronic alerts can help with the early detection of acute kidney injury in hospitalised patients. Evidence for their role in improving patient care is limited. The authors have completed an audit loop to evaluate the impact of electronic alerts, and an associated acute kidney injury management pathway, on patient care. The audits were conducted at a large tertiary care hospital in the UK. Case notes were reviewed for 99 patients over two periods: pre-alert (in 2013; n=55) and post-alert (in 2018; n=44), using the same methodology. Patients for case note reviews were randomly chosen from the list of acute kidney injury alerts generated by the local laboratory information management system. Recognition of acute kidney injury, as documented in the case notes, increased from 15% to 43% between the two periods. Time to first medical review (following electronic alerts) improved by 17 minutes (median 4 hours 4 minutes in 2013 vs 3 hours 47 minutes in 2018). Completion of pre-defined acute kidney injury assessment tasks (review of vital signs, biochemistry and acid-base parameters, evidence of fluid balance assessment, consideration of possible sepsis, and examination or requesting urinalysis) improved in 2018. However, acute kidney injury management tasks (correction of hypovolaemia, addressing or investigating obstruction, medications review, renal referral, requesting of further biochemical tests, addressing possible sepsis) showed very little or no improvement. The introduction of acute kidney injury electronic alerts and management pathway resulted in improved recognition and initial assessment of patients with acute kidney injury. Further steps are needed to translate this in to improved patient management.

Acute care common stem is the core training programme for all emergency medicine trainees, 46% of anaesthetic trainees and a cohort of acute medicine trainees with more than 630 places nationally, the third highest of any core training programme. In their first 2 years of core training (CT1-2), trainees rotate through 6-month rotations in emergency medicine, acute medicine, anaesthetics and intensive care to gain core competencies in the assessment and management of acutely unwell patients, before completing 1 year (CT3) in their parent specialty. Acute care common stem trainees benefit from undertaking rotations in allied acute specialties, which is invaluable when treating complex and comorbid patients in an ageing population. Acute care common stem gives trainees core skills in management of acutely unwell patients, which can be built upon in higher specialty training.","285":"","286":"With the exit of the UK from the European Union and the European Union Regulation 201\/745 coming into effect on 26 May 2021, the regulatory landscape for medical devices is undergoing a substantial change, the implications of which will be felt by those procuring and using medical devices in clinical settings.

The study explored contemporary healthcare leadership culture and the role of followership from the perspective of early career doctors. It found that the leadership and followership challenges for these doctors in training were associated with issues of social and professional identity, communication, the medical hierarchy, and relationships with senior colleagues (support and trust). These challenges were exacerbated by the busy and turbulent clinical environment in which they worked. To cope with various clinical situations and forms of leadership, doctors in training engage in a range of different followership behaviours and strategies. The study raised implications for medical education and training and suggested that followership should be included as part of formal training in communication and team working skills. The importance of both leadership and followership in the delivery of safe and effective patient care has been brought sharply into focus by the COVID-19 pandemic. This article revisits these challenges in light of the pandemic and its impact on the experiences of doctors in training.","291":"Thomas Willis is known for the discovery and description of the circle of Willis, but his contributions to the development of medicine were much broader, including the first use of the term 'neurology'.","292":"Rosacea is a common cutaneous condition affecting predominantly the face. It is historically characterised into four subtypes: erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous and ocular rosacea. This article describes the pathophysiology, clinical features and current treatment options for rosacea, and discusses updated diagnostic criteria. General guidance is required on the need to avoid possible triggers including dietary and environmental triggers. The strongest evidence supports the use of 0.75% metronidazole, topical azelaic acid or topical ivermectin for inflammatory rosacea. Erythema should be treated with brimonidine tartrate gel, oral medication such as beta blockers or vascular laser and light-based therapy. Oral doxycycline 40 mg modified release can be used as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments for recalcitrant disease. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of rosacea could allow identification and targeted avoidance of triggers and the development of new treatment modalities.","293":"Heel pain and a history of a 'pop' or feeling 'something go' are the buzz phrases classically associated with Achilles tendon rupture. However, the diagnosis is often missed in clinical practice because of the assumption that this is a sporting injury suffered only by the young or middle-aged. In a sedentary older patient, the injury may be dismissed as an ankle sprain. If swelling is present but no injury is recalled then deep vein thrombosis is suspected, but Achilles rupture is not. The diagnosis of Achilles tendon rupture is clinical, based on history and examination. Radiological imaging (ultrasound scan) is useful to plan orthopaedic management and exclude concomitant deep vein thrombosis. In most cases, non-operative management with the ankle held plantar flexed in a boot is the current best practice.","294":"Atrial fibrillation is the most frequently occurring supraventricular arrhythmia in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction. It is associated with worse outcomes when it coexists with acute myocardial infarction and results in increased morbidity and mortality. Both conditions are closely related to each other and share similar pathophysiological pathways. The management of atrial fibrillation in patients with acute myocardial infarction is challenging since triple antithrombotic therapy is indicated, but this results in a markedly increased risk of bleeding events and mortality. This review addresses the interactions between both conditions including common risk factors, possible mechanisms through which acute myocardial infarction contributes to development of atrial fibrillation and vice versa, and the problem of using anticoagulation in the management of these patients.","295":"Gallstone disease is the most common gastrointestinal disease in developed countries and is present in up to 15% of the population. Owing to the increased risk factors for gallstones in pregnancy, it is the second most common non-obstetric emergency, affecting up to 12% of pregnant women with a risk of recurrence. Up to 3% of pregnant women in America require a cholecystectomy in the first year after delivery. Gallstone disease has a high risk of developing associated complications, and maternal mortality can be up to 37% if the patient develops gallstone pancreatitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and cholecystectomy can be performed safely in the second trimester when benefits outweigh the risks. However, if the patient is able to be managed conservatively, then a cholecystectomy should be performed in the postnatal period to avoid further recurrences and complications. Despite this, there is currently no national UK guidance on how to manage gallstones and related diseases during pregnancy.","296":"","297":"Diabetes mellitus is a growing epidemic and places a great burden on healthcare services in the UK. Trauma and orthopaedic surgeons find themselves dealing with patients with diabetes on an increasingly regular basis. Any level of surgical trauma can lead to a physiological stress response involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The resultant hormone releases can have negative effects on glucose homeostasis. General risks of operating on patients with diabetes include endothelial dysfunction, postoperative sepsis, impaired wound healing and cerebral ischaemia. Polytrauma patients with diabetes have a significantly greater risk of mortality than patients who do not have diabetes. Non-union of fractures is more common in patients with diabetes, as are deep-seated postoperative infections. National guidelines from the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care advise how to manage patients with diabetes in the perioperative period. Trauma and orthopaedic surgeons must be aware of these increased risks of operating and ensure that patients are involved in surgical decision making.","298":"","299":"Many doctors take time out of clinical practice, and then have decreased confidence and poor performance ratings on their return.

This may be because an endocrinopathy is thought to be aetiological in the presenting disease or suspected as an incidental occurrence by the clinician. Many patients, in addition to the pathology leading to admission, frequently have one or more comorbidities, a change in nutritional status and polypharmacy. Added to this, presentation with acute illness is a major life stress. All of these are likely to impact on one or more endocrine axes, although often only transiently. Endocrine evaluation in the vast majority of cases can be safely deferred to the outpatient setting. This article considers the most common endocrine anomalies discovered in hospital, the confounders, and provides guidance on how to investigate these further.","305":"The post-take ward round is often the first time that a senior clinician reviews a patient on the acute medical take. Despite this, there is no official guidance regarding structure or documentation of the post-take ward round. The aim of this quality improve project was to develop a ward round proforma specifically tailored to the care of the older people's service to improve quality of documentation and to encourage initiation of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. An initial audit was carried out assessing the documentation of key information and the initiation of the comprehensive geriatric assessment during the post-take ward round. A proforma was subsequently designed and implemented with the aims of improving the quality of documentation and increasing the number of patients for whom the comprehensive geriatric assessment was started. A repeat audit was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proforma. The results demonstrated an improvement in documentation of all key information criteria and an increase in the initiation of the comprehensive geriatric assessment. Use of a specifically tailored post-take ward round proforma improves the quality and consistency of documentation and encourages the initiation of the comprehensive geriatric assessment.

Anterior pelvic ring disruption causes a high incidence of bladder rupture and urethral injuries, and initial assessment requires urological tract imaging and emergent bladder drainage before subsequent surgical repair. Pelvic ring disruption requires urgent fixation and should be managed as an open fracture in the context of significant bladder and urethral injury with urinary leakage. Long-term outcomes are variable and genitourinary dysfunction is commonly reported among patients with pelvic fractures. Optimisation of patient outcomes relies heavily on collaborative management between orthopaedic and urological specialists and requires an appreciation of the anatomical intricacies of the pelvis.

The National Review of Asthma Deaths has identified multiple factors that have contributed to preventable asthma deaths and solutions to these factors, including a better understanding and implementation of asthma guidelines. The British Thoracic Society and Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network have recently updated their guidance on the management of asthma. This article outlines the guidelines for junior doctors managing patients with acute exacerbations of asthma. It highlights key areas of the initial assessment, establishing severity and initiating and escalating treatment. Furthermore, the discharge process from discharge criteria to promoting patient safety, education and ongoing self-management is discussed. This process, in particular education and personalised asthma action plans, can make a significant difference to the patient's outcomes and day-to-day burden of symptoms.","314":"Maintaining emergency eye services is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. This article describes the introduction of a new restructured referral pathway to reduce the burden on healthcare providers and create a safe environment. During January and February 2020 (group 1), all appointments were face-to-face with a walk-in eye casualty. The first audit cycle comprised all patients in group 1. The primary audit criteria were discharge rates, referral to subspeciality and reattendance. In April 2020, a remodelled system was implemented in which walk-in attendance ceased and was replaced with telephone triage coupled with digital imaging via NHS email for remote clinical review. Patients requiring further assessment following this triage were invited in for face-to-face appointments. A reaudit was conducted during April-July 2020 (group 2) following implementation of these COVID-19 protocol changes. In group 1, 2868 appointments (100.0%) were face-to-face and in group 2 4870 (100.0%) appointments were telephone consults that resulted in 2639 (54.2%) face-to-face appointments. The rate of discharge in the first cycle and second cycle were 55.3% and 76.9% respectively (P&lt;0.0001). Furthermore 2298 (47.2%) patients were able to be discharged following telephone consultation in group 2. Using this telephone and digital imaging review triage system, the authors have demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for face-to-face reviews. The reduction in avoidable patient face-to-face reviews allows the system to move from saturated to sustainable while increasing accessibility to services for patients who may not be able to present for face-to-face review. This complete audit cycle successfully charts interventions that maximise accessibility, reduce unnecessary hospital visits and deliver safe and prompt management during the pandemic.

Having a structured approach, including adequate history taking and clinical examination, in a multidisciplinary environment allows for effective management of patients with these complex symptoms. Hearing assessment is an integral part of the assessment of patients with dizziness, along with the occasional need for further testing. Identifying red flags, along with the ability to involve different medical specialties, are prerequisites for safe management and a successful outcome. While surgical intervention has a small role in the management of balance disorders, vestibular rehabilitation remains the cornerstone of treatment, along with different supportive measures. This article outlines the approach used in the authors' centre to manage patients with dizziness and balance disorders.","321":"","322":"","323":"This article gives a general overview of pressure ulcers, with a focus on secondary care. Pressure ulcers are damage to the skin or underlying tissue as a result of pressure, friction or shearing forces. They place a significant physical, psychological and financial burden on patients and healthcare systems which will be explored. This review also covers risk assessment, classification and management of pressure ulcers in the inpatient setting.","324":"There is an increasing trend towards dual surgeon operating in complex surgeries in various specialties. This is driven by regionalisation of services, increasing complexity of surgical procedures, the ageing population and challenges imposed by changes in surgical training. Dual surgeon cases have lower complication rates and better quality of patient care. This practice not only facilitates professional and personal development, but also provides valuable support to surgeons in the early part of their career. There is a paucity of literature to support this practice, however, and prospective studies are required to demonstrate the benefit of this approach.","325":"","326":"Intraoperative hypotension is associated with adverse outcomes. Although a causal relationship is yet to be fully established, proactive management of vulnerable patients and use of bispectral index monitoring is recommended to avoid deep anaesthesia.","327":"Major gynaecological oncology surgery can be complex and extensive, with correspondingly high requirements for postoperative analgesia. Multiple options are available including intravenous, neuraxial and regional techniques. This article discusses the pros and cons of different anaesthetic modalities for postoperative analgesia.","328":"The death of a patient is one of the most stressful situations a healthcare professional can face for the first time at work or during training. Palliative and end of life care education aims to impart appropriate awareness and understanding of key issues arising at the end of life, but also to develop learners' interpersonal skills in leadership, communication and management of their own emotional load. There is a pressing need to be explicit around death, dying and care at the end of life and to equip clinical staff with the ability to manage the emotions that are experienced by their patients, their teams and themselves. Emotional intelligence is considered as a framework for medical educators to use in this setting with presentation of a simulated patient vignette to contextualise this.","329":"Radiological investigations are a powerful tool in the assessment of patients with intracranial vascular anomalies. 'Visual' assessment of neurovascular lesions is central to their diagnosis, monitoring, prognostication and management. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the two principal non-invasive imaging modalities used in clinical practice for the assessment of the cerebral vasculature, but these techniques continue to evolve, enabling clinicians to gain greater insights into neurovascular pathology and pathophysiology. This review outlines both established and novel imaging modalities used in modern neurovascular practice and their clinical applications.","330":"This editorial explores how technology has helped clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, from patient care to education, the changes that have been made and the numerous exciting possibilities of where technology can amalgamate with health care.","331":"The interface between the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and the Mental Health Act 1983 can be complex, particularly in patients with co-existing mental and physical illnesses. The management of these patients requires the involvement of patients, relatives and multidisciplinary teams. This article presents four illustrative patient cases, all of whom suffered from co-existing mental and physical illnesses. In managing these cases, dilemmas had arisen in the provision of treatment encompassing both legal frameworks. These cases helped to emphasise the decision-specific and time-specific nature of assessment of mental capacity, requiring clinicians to assess on a case-by-case basis over a suitable period. Often, principles from both legal frameworks may be applied by the treatment team. These cases help to highlight the significant overlap between mental and physical health, which often cannot be managed independently. This may call for the need to better integrate the current legal frameworks, and the optimal involvement of specialists across both settings.","332":"Frailty describes a state of health whereby people develop multiple or cumulative deficits in physiological systems over the life course, leading to vulnerability and being less able to respond to acute and\/or physiological stressors, which at times may be relatively minor.

Accurate and reliable characterisation of these is vital for optimal patient care. Owing to the great improvements in medical imaging technology in recent years, particularly magnetic resonance imaging, it is now possible to characterise a significant proportion of these non-invasively. This is of paramount importance in improving patient safety and reducing costs by avoiding unnecessary biopsies. This article gives a synopsis of the different imaging modalities for liver. It depicts the salient imaging features of the common benign and malignant focal liver lesions on different imaging modalities, with emphasis on magnetic resonance imaging. It demonstrates the pseudolesions, variants, mimics and pitfalls that occur in liver imaging. The tailored magnetic resonance imaging protocols including abbreviated ones, the contrast agents and the pathway for managing incidental liver lesions in the author's institution are covered.","337":"","338":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had significant implications for society, with the introduction of restrictive social measures. Antibody tests provide a way of identifying patients who have been previously exposed to the virus and thus may have a degree of immunity.

This article explores the essential statistical concepts used to interpret the findings of diagnostic investigations, with examples illustrated using COVID-19 antibody tests.","339":"The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death review into the quality of care provided to UK patients with a new diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism highlights both clinical and organisational changes that should be made to improve patient care and outcomes.","340":"","341":"This article summarises the findings from a review of publications related to healthcare leadership that were published during the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The review discusses a range of strategies for leaders to adopt in challenging situations and identifies three aspects of leadership which are considered essential when leading teams during a crisis: 1) communication, 2) decision making and 3) mental health and wellbeing. This article identifies key principles for each of these three aspects and provides practical tips for how leaders can use the lessons learned from the pandemic in their own contexts.","342":"Lithium is a mood stabiliser widely used in the treatment and prophylaxis of mania, bipolar disorders and recurrent depression. Treatment with lithium can give rise to various endocrine and metabolic abnormalities, including thyroid dysfunction, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypercalcaemia. Lithium may induce hypercalcaemia through both acute and chronic effects. The initial acute effects are potentially reversible and occur as a result of lithium's action on the calcium-sensing receptor pathway and glycogen synthase kinase 3, giving rise to a biochemical picture similar to that seen in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia. In the long term, chronic lithium therapy leads to permanent changes within the parathyroid glands by either unmasking hyperparathyroidism in patients with a subclinical parathyroid adenoma or possibly by initiating multiglandular hyperparathyroidism. The latter biochemical picture is identical to that of primary hyperparathyroidism. Lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism, especially in patients on chronic lithium therapy, is associated with increased morbidity. Hence, regular monitoring of calcium levels in patients on lithium therapy is of paramount importance as early recognition of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism can improve outcomes. This review focuses on the definition, pathophysiology, presentation, investigations and management of lithium-associated hyperparathyroidism.","343":"Prophylaxis at discharge is important in mitigating venous thromboembolism events from colorectal cancer and major abdominopelvic surgery, both of which are risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Foundation doctors frequently rotate between departments, and so rely on departmental induction and\/or handing down of knowledge to prescribe extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis upon discharge. A retrospective audit of all patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer at The County Hospital, Hereford, between 1 August 2018 and 31 August 2019, was undertaken to assess departmental compliance with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. A total of 181 patients underwent elective surgery and 29 patients had emergency surgery. The initial audit revealed a cyclical 4-monthly decline that coincided with foundation doctors' rotations. Six multidisciplinary interventions were implemented. Reaudit demonstrated 100% compliance with prescribing of extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis at discharge. No venous thromboembolism events 30 days post operation were noted. A multidisciplinary approach involving educating health professionals about the importance of extended venous thromboembolis prophylaxis in patients who have undergone surgery for colorectal cancer can be effective in improving compliance with prescribing practices at discharge. ","344":"The number of people with kidney transplants has increased rapidly over the last 20 years. They are often medically complex and have a significant need for both routine and urgent care. Patients who have received a kidney transplant can be challenging to manage in the medical assessment unit.

This review describes a systematic approach to their assessment and management and highlights specific considerations to be borne in mind.","345":"","346":"This article reports on the career choice of foundation doctors going through a local foundation programme and whether they planned to take an F3 year. The authors also prospectively gathered views relating to their career choice and the need for an F3 year. Data were gathered from 193 foundation doctors training in Nottinghamshire between 2015 and 2020 through an unstructured interview process. Data were anonymised and used to learn about career pathway choices and whether they planned to take an F3 year option. Reasons for this pathway were also explored. Data showed that there was a steady increase in the proportion of trainees opting for F3 over time. The local picture in terms of trainees taking an F3 option reflects the national trend. Some trainees find foundation training a stressful time and so need to be offered support. The authors comment on the factors that make a career appealing to trainees.

The movements can be horizontal, vertical, torsional or a combination of these movements. It starts by a slow movement of the eye away from the visual target. The second movement brings the eye back to the visual target. If this second movement is quick, the nystagmus is called jerk nystagmus. If the second movement is slow, the nystagmus is said to be pendular. Maintaining steady gaze is dependent upon visual fixation, the vestibulo-ocular reflex and the gaze-holding neural integrator system. Pathological nystagmus typically presents with the symptom of oscillopsia, which is the illusory movement of the surrounding environment. Nystagmus that develops outside of early infancy is termed acquired nystagmus. There may be serious underlying pathology that will require further investigation and management. This article reviews the terminology, pathophysiology, causes and treatment of acquired nystagmus.","355":"Current best practice in placement of arterial lines is to attempt to cannulate the radial artery in the first instance.

The last 70 years have seen huge advances in the field of implantable cardiac devices, from diagnostic tools to electrical therapies for bradycardia, ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac resynchronisation. While out-of-hours specialist cardiology cover and regional arrhythmia pathways are increasingly established, they are not universal, and the management of arrhythmia remains an important facet of clinical medicine for the general physician. This article discusses core recommendations from international guidelines with respect to heart rhythm diagnostics, pacing for bradycardia, cardiac resynchronisation and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, along with common complications. Finally, future innovations such as the diagnostic potential of portable technologies, antibiotic envelopes for cardiac devices and the increasing use of leadless pacemakers are described.","362":"Clinical reasoning is an extensive and intricate field, dealing with the process of thinking and decision making in practice. Its study can be quite challenging because it is context and task dependent. Educational frameworks such as the conscious competence model and the dual process reasoning model have been developed to help its understanding. To enhance the learning of clinical reasoning, there are significant areas that can be targeted through learning processes. These include knowledge adequacy; ability to gather appropriate patient data; use of proper reasoning strategies to address specific clinical questions; and the ability to reflect and evaluate on decisions taken, together with the role of the wider practice community and the activity of professional socialisation. This article explores the characteristics of clinical reasoning and delves deeper into the various strategies that prove useful for learning.","363":"Melanoma is the most aggressive skin malignancy with an ever-increasing caseload, especially in the western world. Recently developed immunotherapeutic modalities have substantially improved the prognosis of advanced melanoma. The association between serum levels of vitamin D and prognosis of melanoma has been a focus of ongoing research, with some evidence of vitamin D's potential as an adjunctive modality to immunotherapy. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines clearly recommend that assessment of vitamin D levels and relevant advice should be an inherent aspect of the management of patients with melanoma at the secondary care level. A service improvement project was conducted to ensure full compliance of practice in the authors' skin unit with the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of vitamin D status in patients with melanoma. After two reaudits the unit's practice complied with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines by using a multidisciplinary team approach. The authors propose that the simple and reliable pathway used to achieve and sustain the results could be easily adopted to ensure universal adherence to these guidelines.

These include acute aortic dissection, intramural haematoma and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, grouped together because they are indistinguishable clinically and highly fatal. All three entities involve disruption to the tunica intima and media and may be complicated by rupture, end-organ ischaemia or aneurysmal transformation. Early diagnosis is vital to allow timely and appropriate management. Paired unenhanced and electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography angiography of the chest, extending more distally if required, is recommended for diagnosis. Specific computed tomography features of all three entities are reviewed, with a focus on morphological features associated with complications. Those with type A pathology are usually managed with open surgery because this has a high risk of complication. Patients with uncomplicated type B pathology are usually managed with best medical therapy whereas those with complicated type B pathology are usually offered either surgery or thoracic endovascular aortic repair. The limited evidence regarding the use of thoracic endovascular aortic repair in patients with subacute uncomplicated type B pathology is briefly discussed.","371":"","372":"","373":"","374":"","375":"Remote clinics have shown many benefits including patient safety, but if we look closer, does this move exclude certain groups of patients from accessing healthcare and promote health inequality?","376":"","377":"","378":"Tibial plateau fractures are peri-articular knee fractures of the proximal tibia. The presentation is dependent on the mechanism of injury. The tibial plateau is the bony platform of the distal half of the knee joint, and is made up of a medial and lateral condyle separated by the intercondylar eminence. The presentation of tibial plateau fractures can vary greatly as a result of the bimodal mechanism of injury and patient characteristics. The patient should be assessed for life- and limb-threatening injuries in accordance with British Orthopaedic Association Standards of Trauma guidelines. Imaging is undertaken to understand configuration of the fracture, which is classified by the Schatzker classification. Definitive management of the fracture depends on the severity, ranging from conservative to surgical management. Surgery is required for more severe tibial plateau fractures to restore articular congruity, mechanical alignment, ligamentous stability and to permit early mobilisation. Medium-term functional outcome after tibial plateau fractures is generally excellent when anatomy and stability is restored. At least half of patients return to their original level of physical activity. Surgical management of tibial plateau fractures is not without complication. Risk factors include postoperative arthritis, bicondylar and comminuted fractures, meniscal removal, instability, malalignment and articular incongruity. Tibial plateau fractures account for 1% of all fractures, and typically occur either as a fragility fracture or secondary to a high-energy impact. These latter injuries are associated with extensive soft tissue injury, life- and limb-threatening complications and long-term sequelae. While outcomes are generally good, severe injuries are at higher risk of infection and post-traumatic arthritis requiring knee arthroplasty. This article considers the anatomy, diagnosis and evidence-based management strategies for tibial plateau fracture.","379":"Microscopic colitis encompasses both collagenous and lymphocytic colitis and is a relatively common condition with rising incidence. Diagnosis is by colonoscopy (which is usually normal but may show some mild changes) and biopsies which reveal characteristic histological findings. Symptoms include non-bloody diarrhoea with urgency which may be associated with faecal incontinence and abdominal pain. Microscopic colitis is associated with a reduced health-related quality of life, and treatment is aimed at symptom control. Medications linked with the development of microscopic colitis, including proton pump inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, should be discontinued. If symptoms persist, budesonide is a licensed treatment for microscopic colitis which has been shown to be effective in clinical trials and real-world practice.","380":"","381":"","382":"Despite initial reports, renal involvement, including acute kidney injury, has emerged as a serious complication of COVID-19 disease, particularly in critically ill patients. The reported prevalence varies considerably, which may reflect reporting practices, although differences in pre-existing comorbidities and socioeconomic factors, and differences between ethnic groups, almost certainly contribute. Renal involvement may present as an active urinary sediment or as changes in serum creatinine levels and urine output leading to acute kidney injury. In common with acute kidney injury complicating critical illness, the cause is often multifactorial and often presents as part of a multiorgan dysfunction syndrome. Treatment is, in the main, supportive, with kidney replacement therapy required in nearly 25% of reported cases. Few data currently exist as to the long-term burden of COVID-19-associated acute kidney injury but evidence suggests that only approximately one-third of patients are discharged with recovered renal function.","383":"Actinomycosis is an invasive and suppurative anaerobic infection, which can develop in the pelvis. This occurs most commonly as a result of prolonged use of an intrauterine device. The constellation of signs and symptoms associated with its typical clinical presentation include palpable mass, weight loss and malaise. It can be misdiagnosed as a result and often as a malignant process. Left unrecognised, pelvic actinomycosis can lead to sequelae such as severe abscess, fistula formation and even infertility. Removal of the intrauterine device and a prolonged course (6-12 months) of antibiotic treatment form the cornerstone of management. Surgery can be required in select cases. This article provides an overview of pelvic actinomycosis, including its background, presentation, investigations and management.","384":"","385":"Cardio-oncology is the care of cancer patients with cardiovascular disease. The need for a dedicated subspecialty emerged to address heart failure caused by drugs such as anthracyclines and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapies, but over time has expanded into an exciting subspecialty with widening horizons. While still dealing with a lot of commonly recognised toxicities, such as heart failure, hypertension and coronary disease, new and revolutionary cancer therapies have been associated with challenging cardiovascular complications, requiring specialist input to manage effectively. Echocardiography is a key investigation, with advanced techniques such as three-dimensional and strain assessment allowing more accurate diagnosis and earlier detection of subtle changes. Cardiac magnetic resonance and biomarkers are useful adjuncts to aid diagnosis and management. With increasing cancer incidence and improved cancer survival rates, it is important that general cardiologists and physicians are aware of cardiac complications associated with cancer and how to manage them.","386":"","387":"Predictive analytics refers to technology that uses patterns in large datasets to predict future events and inform decisions.

The risk associated with procedures classed as 'aerosol generating' is under constant debate. Current guidance is largely based on pragmatic and cautious logic, as there is little scientific evidence of aerosolization and transmission of respiratory viruses associated with procedures. The physical properties of aerosol particles which may contain viable virus have implications for the safe use of personal protective equipment and infection control protocols. As elective work in the NHS is reinstated, it is important that the implications of the possibility of airborne transmission of the virus in hospitals are more widely understood. This will facilitate appropriate use of personal protective equipment and help direct further research into the true risks of aerosolization during these procedures to allow safe streamlining of services for staff and patients.","394":"","395":"Malnutrition is the disturbance of normal form or function, arising from the deficiency of one or more nutrients, and is a significant issue in the older adult population. Despite their reduced energy requirements, older patients need the same protein intake and micronutrients as younger patients, but age-related changes may impact the ability to meet these requirements. The cause of malnutrition in individuals is likely to be multifactorial and can therefore be complex to manage. Adequate nutrition is important for both community dwelling patients and inpatients, as malnutrition increases the risk of complications and the likelihood of needing residential or nursing home care on discharge. This article discusses the risk factors for the development of malnutrition in older patients and the different nutritional assessment tools available. Management strategies for optimising nutrition can be divided into systems and supplementation. With an ageing population, most doctors will inevitably become increasingly involved with treating older patients and this article highlights the need to consider a patient's nutritional status. Nutrition should be considered during every ward round and the multidisciplinary team as a whole should maintain an awareness and responsibility for managing malnutrition.","396":"Assessing the quality of care for patients receiving long-term ventilation is complex given the diversity of this population (0-24 years in this case) and their differing requirements for treatment.

This is one of the major complications of percutaneous coronary interventions, which may proceed to acute renal failure. Risk factors, including pre-existing renal dysfunction, older age and use of high osmolar contrast media, predispose patients to the development of contrast-associated nephropathy. Different risk-reduction strategies have been used to prevent contrast-associated nephropathy, including use of low osmolar contrast media, N-acetylcysteine, alkalisation of tubular fluid with intravenous sodium bicarbonate, and oral and intravenous hydration with isotonic solution. Hydration using intravenous saline is one of the main treatments used to prevent the development of nephropathy in patients receiving contrast media during cardiac interventions. Prehydration, before administering contrast media, seems to be crucial. The results of studies of the relative efficacy of sodium bicarbonate and\/or N-acetylcysteine in reducing the development of contrast-associated nephropathy are not consistent and any beneficial effects may depend on the pre-existing state of the kidney. This review discusses hydration of patients who are at risk of developing contrast-associated nephropathy using intravenous fluid.","400":"Ulnar tunnel syndrome is compression of the ulnar nerve at the level of the wrist within Guyon's canal. It is most commonly caused by a ganglion cyst but may also be secondary to fractures, inflammatory conditions, neoplasm, vascular anomalies, aberrant musculature or a combination of these. Assessment should include a detailed history focusing on duration, site and progression of symptoms. The level of compression can be estimated clinically on examination by assessing motor and sensory changes in the hand. Investigations are used to confirm diagnosis or to clarify the underlying cause. X-rays and computed tomography can be used to exclude fractures. Ultrasound is used to diagnose ganglion cysts and vascular anomalies, and can localise the level of compression. Nerve conduction studies can be used to support the diagnosis and look for proximal compression. Mild symptoms can be managed non-operatively. Surgical exploration and decompression is the gold standard treatment for neuro-compressive causes with largely good outcomes.","401":"Sepsis requiring cardiovascular support is a common reason for critical care admission.

Since 2010, surgical 'boot camps' have been run by many UK deaneries to teach core surgical trainees basic entry level skills. Training in advanced skills often requires attendance at national fee-paying courses. In the Wessex Deanery, multiple, free of charge, core surgical 'field camps' were developed to provide more advanced level teaching in the particular specialty preference of each core surgical trainee. After the COVID-19 pandemic, national hands-on courses will be challenging to provide and deanery-based advanced skills training may be the way forward for craft-based specialties. The experiences over 2 years of delivering the Wessex core surgical field camps are shared, giving a guide and advice for other trainers on how to run a field camp.","405":"Acute-on-chronic liver failure is used to describe an acute decline in liver function in a patient with existing liver disease combined with other organ failure. Acute-on-chronic liver failure is associated with high short-term mortality, and the greater the number and severity of organ failures, the higher the mortality. The most commonly identified precipitants of acute-on-chronic liver failure include bacterial infection, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, viral hepatitis and recent excessive alcohol intake. Since some of these aetiologies are treatable, organ failure may return to pre-decompensation levels in up to 55% of patients. As a result, a trial of critical care treatment may be appropriate for many of these patients. Clinical scoring tools may help clinicians recognise futility, allowing timely withdrawal of organ support and shifting the focus of care toward palliation.","406":"","407":"Physiotherapists aim to maximise quality of life and movement potential within the spheres of promotion, prevention, treatment\/intervention and rehabilitation. Haemophilia care is witnessing a significant shift towards a new era of potentially life-changing treatments which offer a future of minimal or no bleeds for people with haemophilia. As such, physiotherapy intervention should be more proactive rather than reactive to treat and rehabilitate recurrent bleeding episodes. The role of the physiotherapist within the multidisciplinary team includes the differential diagnosis of musculoskeletal bleeding, supporting and encouraging higher levels of physical activity, rehabilitation to maximise physical potential and capabilities, assessment and treatment of non-bleed-related musculoskeletal issues, managing comorbidities and falls risk, and improving the longitudinal surveillance of musculoskeletal health. Encouraging and supporting people with haemophilia to become more active will improve wellbeing and improve health and health outcomes, and physical activity is becoming one of the most important outcomes for people with haemophilia. Recommendations on the best way to accurately capture these data are vital to ensure the full health benefits of new treatments for people with haemophilia are clear.","408":"A brain abscess is a focal accumulation of pus in the brain parenchyma arising from direct inoculation, contiguous spread from local anatomical structures or haematogenous seeding from a remote source of infection. It can result in significant morbidity and mortality, making early diagnosis and treatment vital. Only one fifth of patients present with the classic triad of headache, fever and focal neurological symptoms. More commonly patients show signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure alone, such as confusion or reduced conscious level, headache, nausea and vomiting, which can be a presentation of many intracranial pathologies. Distinguishing an abscess from other pathologies such as meningitis and tumours is crucial, as clinically these can present in similar ways, but their management and outcomes are very different. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging brain scans can help localise the lesion and differentiate ring-enhancing lesions caused by a brain abscess from malignant tumours. Cerebral abscesses are considered a neurosurgical emergency; early stabilisation, diagnosis and management in a neurosurgical centre is important in reducing morbidity and mortality.","409":"","410":"Implantable cardiac defibrillators reduce the risk of sudden cardiac death in selected patients. The value of an implantable cardiac defibrillator declines as the patient's disease progresses. Guidelines suggest that the appropriateness of maintaining implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy be regularly reviewed as part of monitoring of the patient's disease trajectory. It is recommended that implantable cardiac defibrillators are deactivated as patients approach the end of life. Patients with a better understanding of their current state of health and the role that the implantable cardiac defibrillator plays within it are more likely to make informed decisions about the timing of deactivation. A quality improvement project was undertaken on appropriate deactivation of implantable cardiac defibrillators within a large tertiary cardiac centre. This was driven by audit data showing inadequate patient communication and documentation around deactivation. Drivers for change included the introduction of electronic data records, clinical review of comorbid patients approaching elective battery change and an ongoing forum for patient and carer education. Measured outcomes included the number of deactivations performed, evidence of patient discussion and consent, and timing of deactivation of the implantable cardiac defibrillator. There were increased numbers of timely device deactivations undertaken following the interventions with improved documented evidence of patient discussion and consent. The educational forum was received favourably. Focused multidisciplinary interventions can impact favourably on appropriate implantable cardiac defibrillator deactivation and improve patient engagement.

Ideal positioning of implants and reduction of the joint is technically demanding during arthroplasty. Lengthening may result in nerve palsies and therefore procedures may have to be undertaken to shorten the femur. Other complications include dislocation and non-union at the shortening osteotomy site. Thorough preoperative planning and templating is required before surgery to assess the need for shortening. Shortening osteotomies can be performed at the proximal femur, diaphysis or distal femoral levels, with subtrochanteric being the most common level. The procedure should be customised for each patient after extensive planning and detailed counselling.","430":"","431":"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to the healthcare system, including increased reliance on virtual services, particularly clinic appointments.

This article discusses the extent of aerosolisation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the virus that causes COVID-19, as a result of oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant publications, using the terms COVID-19 aerosolisation, COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 transmission, COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and endoscopy, Endoscopy for COVID-19 patients. A total of 3745 articles were identified, 26 of which were selected to answer the question of the extent of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation during upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. All studies suggested high infectivity from contact and droplet spread. No clinical study has yet reported the viral load in the aerosol and therefore the infective dose has not been accurately determined. However, aerosol-generating procedures are potentially risky and full personal protective equipment should be used. As it is a highly infectious disease, clinicians treating patients with COVID-19 require effective personal protective equipment. The main routes of infection are direct contact and droplets in the air and on surfaces. Aerosolisation carries a substantial risk of infection, so any aerosol-producing procedure, such as endoscopy, should be performed wearing personal protective equipment and with extra caution to protect the endoscopist, staff and patients from cross-infection via the respiratory system.

This article expands upon the British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma and Orthopaedics guidelines for the management of the older or frail orthopaedic trauma patient. Optimisation of the patient is key to a successful surgical outcome, because these patients often have significant comorbidities involving bone health, nutrition, cognitive function and cardiovascular stability. This article discusses the evidence base for tailoring the management of these patients and the importance of doing so in an ageing population. It considers the requisite preoperative procedures and investigations, guidelines for specific cases such as comatose patients or those with complex fractures, and ceiling of care discussions, and then focuses on the postoperative period, including physiotherapy, rehabilitation goals and medical management.","436":"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the death of James Syme, one of the most distinguished members of the Edinburgh school of surgery in the 19th century.","437":"Learning in the workplace maximises relevance to clinical practice and facilitates the education of the whole multiprofessional team. Provision of structured teaching is becoming increasingly challenging with shift pattern working and staff shortages. This article describes a simulation course designed to facilitate team learning to improve the care of nephrology patients, and presents outcome data over 2 years. A full-day course, using high fidelity manikins, was designed for nephrology specialty trainees and nurse specialists. Nineteen learners (eleven specialty trainees and eight nurse specialists) and nine multidisciplinary team faculty members attended. Evaluation used pre- and post-course assessments, with a 1-year follow-up questionnaire. Following the course, improved knowledge scores, 56% to 72% (P&lt;0.05), and confidence scores, 57% to 71% (P&lt;0.005), were demonstrated. Qualitative analysis found 'intra-disciplinary interaction', 'reflection' and 'practical skills' were the greatest enablers of learning. In the 1-year follow-up questionnaire, specialty trainees reported that the course improved clinical practice and helped preparation for consultant roles. This course improved knowledge and confidence in managing nephrology scenarios across the multidisciplinary learning group, and the model could be used in other hospital specialties. ","438":"The search for autoantibodies in patients with acute and chronic neuropathies has become widespread in neurological practice. These tests are more routinely available and therefore are more commonly requested in larger hospitals with neuroscience centres, although they are now also regularly requested from district general hospital settings, including by non-neurologists. However, the clinical value of these frequently expensive tests is often unclear and their impact on management not always obviously beneficial.

Developmental dysplasia of the hip is a clinically important condition, with a prevalence of 1-2\/1000 in unscreened populations and 5-30\/1000 in clinically screened populations. The pathology is incongruence between the femoral head and the acetabulum, which can be caused by an abnormally shaped femoral head, acetabulum, or both. This results in a spectrum of different hip abnormalities. The precise aetiology behind developmental dysplasia of the hip is unclear, but there are a number of established risk factors. In the UK, universal clinical examination of newborns and 6-8-week-old babies is performed under the national UK newborn screening programme for developmental dysplasia of the hip (part of the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination). The physical examination of the newborn hip involves initial inspection of the infant for any of the clinical features of developmental dysplasia of the hip, followed by hip stability tests (Barlow's and Ortolani's tests). Hip ultrasound is the gold standard diagnostic and monitoring tool for developmental dysplasia of the hip in newborns and infants under 6 months of age, or until ossification of the femoral head. Some mild cases of developmental dysplasia of the hip (and the immature hip) resolve without requiring intervention; however, there are a number of treatments, both non-operative and operative, that may be used at various stages of this condition.","448":"Happiness and wellbeing of NHS staff is critical to the quality of care they can provide for patients and communities.

Photography of open fractures is an essential component of documentation in the treatment of open fractures as per the British Orthopaedic Association Standards of Trauma and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. Smartphones have made photography easily accessible to the clinician, but serious concerns exist regarding data security and the consent process around the use of sensitive clinical images. This project sought to overcome this issue by developing a Caldicott-compliant hospital imaging protocol that allows clinicians to use their smartphone to upload open fracture images into the patient's permanent record. Implementation of the protocol was audited and resulted in the increase of safe and secure open fracture photographic storage to inpatient medical records. This protocol would be transferrable to other hospital trusts and could be adopted across major trauma networks.","457":"Distal radius fractures account for one in five bony injuries in both primary and secondary care. These are commonly the result of a fall on outstretched hands or high-energy trauma. On assessment, clinicians should determine the mechanism of injury, associated bony or soft tissue injuries, and neurovascular symptoms. Investigations should always include radiographs to evaluate for intra-articular involvement and fracture displacement. Owing to the heterogeneous injury patterns and patient profiles, the preferred management should consider the severity of the fracture, desired functional outcome and patient comorbidities. Non-operative management in select patients can give good results, especially in older adults. Immobilisation with or without reduction forms the mainstay of non-operative treatment. Surgical management options include closed reduction and application of a cast, percutaneous K-wires, open reduction and internal fixation with plates, or external fixation. Patients should be encouraged to mobilise as soon as it is safe to do so, to prevent stiffness. Median nerve compression is the most common complication followed by tendon rupture, arthrosis and malunion. This article outlines the British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma and Orthopaedics for the management of distal radius fractures.","458":"","459":"Ocular complications in critical care patients are common. There has been a surge in intensive care admissions following the COVID-19 outbreak. The management of COVID-19 exposes patients to a number of specific risk factors for developing ocular complications, which include non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation and prone positioning. Consequently, it is likely that there will be an increase in the number of ocular complications secondary to the management of COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit setting, and these complications could lead to permanent visual loss and blindness. Increased awareness of eye care in the intensive care unit setting is therefore vital to help prevent visual loss and maintain quality of life for patients recovering from COVID-19.","460":"Trauma to the face and neck is a frequent reason for emergency department attendance. Imaging is invaluable in the characterisation of such injuries, enabling delineation of fracture patterns as well as identification of vascular and other soft tissue injuries. It may also be used to prevent long-term mortality and morbidity and provide a roadmap for surgical intervention so that form and function may be restored. This article gives a pictorial review of the imaging of craniofacial trauma, stratified according to the thirds of the face, followed by a review of blunt and penetrating trauma of the neck. It discusses appropriate imaging modalities for each trauma category, describes major patterns of craniofacial trauma on cross-sectional imaging and identifies clinically relevant imaging features that should trigger subspecialist review or be of relevance to pre-surgical planning. It starts with the upper third comprising frontal sinus fractures before describing the component fractures of the middle third (including nasal, zygomaticomaxillary and orbital fractures) and then focusing on the lower third (specifically mandibular and dentoalveolar fractures). The article concludes with a review of soft tissue injuries of the neck, particularly penetrating, blunt and laryngeal trauma.","461":"Nasogastric tubes are used frequently in surgical patients for bowel decompression, provision of enteral nutritional support and preventing aspiration of gastric contents. There is no conclusive research into the risk of COVID-19 transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, although evidence from the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak appears to suggest that there is no increased risk of transmission. However, close contact with a COVID-19 patient, especially those displaying respiratory symptoms, is likely to increase the risk of transmission. Nasogastric tube insertion requires increased time spent at a patient's bedside and can also cause pharyngeal irritation, resulting in coughing. In addition, the nasogastric tube can expose the healthcare worker to potentially infectious saliva. Therefore, there is a clear need for increased evidence regarding the risk of transmission associated with nasogastric tube insertion, to ensure that such risks can be mitigated.","462":"Amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, adaptation of healthcare systems, with strong medical leadership, has been integral to coping with the ever-changing situation.

The pathophysiology in COVID-19 patients is thought to relate to a thromboinflammatory state within the pulmonary vasculature, triggered by the infection, but other risk factors such as reduced mobility, prolonged immobilisation and dehydration are likely to contribute. Several societies have released comprehensive guidelines emphasising the importance of risk stratification in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. They advocate the use of clinically validated risk scores in conjunction with biochemical and imaging results. Patients with mild disease can now be managed in the outpatient setting and with newly developed therapies, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis, becoming available in more centres, treatment options for those with more severe disease are also expanding. This article presents four theoretical but realistic cases, each diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism, but differing in levels of severity. These demonstrate how the guidelines can be applied in a clinical setting, with particular focus on risk stratification and management.","470":"Reduced glomerular filtration rate and presence of albuminuria are both associated with increased risk of several poor outcomes. People with chronic kidney disease also commonly suffer from lower quality of life than their age-matched peers. The experiences reported by patients with chronic kidney disease include being shocked by the diagnosis, being uncertain about the cause and worrying about progression and future treatment. Issues such as depression, pain and fatigue are common in people with chronic kidney disease. Helping people to live well with a long-term condition like chronic kidney disease should include efforts to reduce the risk of adverse events occurring in the future, and consider what can be done to enhance quality of life now. Clinicians can help by being aware of the patient perspective, communicating clearly and recommending interventions that reduce future risk as well as recognising and treating symptoms. Assessing overall treatment burden is an important component of management and non-pharmacological interventions that may improve mobility, strength and pain should be considered.","471":"Worldwide, the use of sugammadex for the reversal of neuromuscular blocking agents worldwide is restricted.

In practice, root cause analyses done in the NHS may generally fail to identify components where there are organisational failures, as there may be an inherent desire to protect institutional reputation. A human factors approach to root cause analysis looks at system vulnerabilities, considering the entirety of the environment in which an individual works and taking into account factors such as the physical environment and individual mental characteristics. Other human factors include group dynamics, task complexity and concurrent tasks. It is time that the growing evidence of the potential shortcomings of root cause analysis, especially as frequently applied within the NHS, is heeded. At present, rather than assisting learning it may be an impediment to patient safety. The authors propose that root cause analyses should be performed by a group of people who are not managing the service. External organisations such as the General Medical Council, Nursing and Midwifery Council, Care Quality Commission and Practitioner Performance Assessment are heavily reliant on this tool when concerns are raised. If the flaws in root cause analysis can be eliminated, drawing on the available evidence, cases such as those of Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba and Mr David Sellu might be avoided.","497":"Shared decision making is a collaborative process between clinicians and patients, which aims to select the most suitable management option based on both best available evidence and patient preferences.

Survival of patients with common malignancies has improved significantly with the ongoing development of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as improved surgical treatment of resectable primary tumours. This article outlines the clinical approach to presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management.","500":"","501":"","502":"Radial head fractures are a common fracture involving the elbow joint. Patients typically present after a fall onto an outstretched hand with elbow pain and swelling. Without adequate treatment, this can lead to long-term complications, including loss of elbow motion and pain. Radial head fractures may also be associated with other injuries including elbow dislocation, neighbouring bony fractures and associated ligamentous rupture. It is therefore imperative that hospital clinicians understand the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. The plain radiograph is the optimum method to diagnose a radial head fracture. These fractures can be managed using a variety of techniques, from non-surgical conservative methods for the undisplaced fracture through to surgical fixation, radial head replacement and excision for the more complex, displaced fracture.","503":"Interventional radiology is a subspecialty of radiology that provides a range of minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. It continues to expand and evolve, and has had a marked impact on clinical care in many settings, in some cases averting the need for major surgery and hospital admission. While its role in the setting of trauma is relatively well established, with arterial embolisation a valuable option in the management of haemodynamically unstable patients, it is less prominent in the elective setting. This article provides an overview of emerging applications of interventional radiology in the elective treatment of orthopaedic conditions.","504":"","505":"This year is the 150th anniversary of James Young Simpson's death in 1870. As well as being responsible for the introduction of general anaesthesia into obstetric practice, he made other important contributions to obstetrics and also to surgery as well as in the control of hospital infection.","506":"Major trauma in the UK has changed and can now be thought of as two different diseases: the traditional type of high energy transfer major trauma occurring in younger patients, and low energy transfer major trauma (usually an older person falling on one level). The current NHS trauma system is not well set up to treat low energy transfer major trauma - adapting to the changing disease is the next big challenge.","507":"While use of mechanical circulatory support is increasing, knowledge of its fundamental role and limitations remains poorly understood by many medical professionals. This article summarises the main types of mechanical circulatory support and how they work, particularly focusing on the key information medical professionals should know should they encounter them in hospital. Mechanical circulatory support can be an effective treatment modality in selected pathologies, including myocardial ischaemia, pulmonary congestion, massive pulmonary embolic disease, postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock with failure to wean off bypass, right ventricular failure, bridge to heart and lung transplant and, increasingly, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Intra-aortic balloon pumps increase coronary perfusion and reduce myocardial oxygen demand in a variety of cardiac conditions. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can provide both respiratory and circulatory support to patients. Ventricular assist devices can provide support for not only patients with acute cardiogenic shock, but also for ambulant patients in the community setting.","508":"Systemic lupus erythematosus can affect any organ or tissue, but skin manifestations, joint pain and fatigue are the most common symptoms. Two case reports in this issue describe patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who suffered severe internal organ manifestations.","509":"","510":"Muscle wasting in critically ill patients is the most common complication associated with critical care. It has significant effects on physical and psychological health, mortality and quality of life. It is most severe in the first few days of illness and in the most critically unwell patients, with muscle loss estimated to occur at 2-3% per day. This muscle loss is likely a result of a reduction in protein synthesis relative to muscle breakdown, resulting in altered protein homeostasis. The associated weakness is associated with in an increase in both short- and long-term mortality and morbidity, with these detrimental effects demonstrated up to 5 years post discharge. This article highlights the significant impact that muscle wasting has on critically ill patients' outcomes, how this can be reduced, and how this might change in the future.","511":"","512":"","513":"National guidance in the UK continues to recommend urgent referral of selected patients with non-visible haematuria for urological assessment. The positive predictive value of non-visible haematuria for urological cancer is low, so it is uncertain whether this is an effective and equitable use of healthcare resources. This article considers rationales for and against continuing this practice, and outlines alternative investigative strategies for patients presenting with non-visible haematuria based on current knowledge and modern technology.","514":"E-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury is a recently recognised, acute pulmonary syndrome which has been reported (particularly from June to October 2019) throughout the USA, but not in Europe (although one probable case, in the UK, has been reported; Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, 2020). It presents acutely, most often in young men, as severe pulmonary consolidation, usually with respiratory failure. The mortality is around 2%. The cause(s) are unknown, but it is associated with vaping, particularly using unlicensed cannabis-containing products with tetrahydrocannabinol. Vitamin E acetate, often present in tetrahydrocannabinol-containing vape products as a solvent, has been implicated, as it has been identified in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury. This article reviews the recent literature, including clinical features, presentation and investigations, and possible mechanisms, in the context of vaping practices in the USA and the UK.","515":"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a persistent, pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder, characterised by the core features of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. While previously thought to be a condition that only affects children, it is now well recognised that in a significant proportion of cases both symptoms and associated impairment will persist into adulthood. Nevertheless, many cases are missed or misdiagnosed because of the lack of awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a potential diagnosis in adults, the number of symptoms that overlap with other psychiatric conditions, and the high rates of comorbidity. However, once correctly diagnosed, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder responds well to treatment, particularly pharmacological intervention. This article gives an overview of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with special emphasis on the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults.","516":"","517":"","518":"In the field of breast reconstruction, products and techniques are continuing to evolve to ensure good clinical and quality outcomes.

It is both a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis and a marker of increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because of its highly heterogenous clinical picture, a detailed history and physical assessment, a high degree of suspicion for peripheral artery disease and the use of the ankle-brachial pressure index is essential to identify patients with peripheral artery disease. This will allow early administration of basic pharmacotherapy and lifestyle changes to reduce cardiovascular events, minimise claudication symptoms and enable optimal revascularisation to prevent loss of limb function.","520":"Navigating the rapidly evolving field of materials for soft tissue reinforcement is challenging given the volume of clinically available options. Additionally, the current generally accepted classifications of these mesh materials confound the understanding of their utility by grouping disparate materials that have attributes overlapping category boundaries and that do not fully consider their clinically functionality. This review article highlights, from a materials science perspective, the most important attributes of these materials to improve the clinical decision-making process in the selection of the most appropriate features and design for the patient, surgery and clinical need. These characteristics include the physical attributes that directly impact the surgical procedure and immediate postoperative mechanical requirements as well as the post-implantation properties such as an adequate reinforcement time, strength of the resulting tissue and infection risk profile.","521":"The rapid sequence induction has been a cornerstone of anaesthetic teaching since it was first described in 1970. Although the technique is taught as a standard protocol there is considerable variation in its practice. So, can we reach consensus over what to include in 'the safe, textbook version' of a rapid sequence induction in modern anaesthesia?","522":"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed female cancer in the UK, with one in eight women receiving a cancer diagnosis during their lifetime. Forty per cent of women diagnosed with breast cancer undergo mastectomy as their primary therapeutic procedure. While a full range of choices is offered, breast reconstruction using implants is the patient-preferred method of reconstruction following mastectomy. This review discusses the evolution of implant-based reconstruction, focusing on the recent trend towards prepectoral breast reconstruction. Key quality indicators in the current literature are considered, including oncological outcomes, aesthetics and patient-related outcome measures, as are the health-care economics of this emerging surgical technique.","523":"","524":"","525":"","526":"","527":"","528":"","529":"Multimodality perioperative interventions could accelerate patient recovery and improve cost-effectiveness.

The pathognomonic characteristic of multiple circumferential stenosis is noted on gross examination of the bowel. It is a severe form of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy, often presenting as acute small bowel obstruction. A systematic review was performed to identify risk factors and patient outcomes in histologically-proven diaphragm disease of the small intestine in patients undergoing emergency operation for small bowel obstruction. A comprehensive search was performed between January 1975 and March 2019 using relevant MeSH terms. Studies were chosen based on predefined inclusion criteria. Diaphragm disease of the small intestine was defined as macroscopically detected thin diaphragm-like mucosal folding inside the lumen of the bowel. The parameters assessed included patient characteristics, duration of use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, type of emergency surgery performed, complications, recurrence, presentation and diagnosis of diaphragm disease. A total of 21 studies were analysed which included 17 case reports, one case series, and three retrospective comparative studies. Overall 29 patients with diaphragm disease of the small bowel were reported following emergency laparotomy for small bowel obstruction. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was noted in all cases with an average duration of 3-5 years. All patients presented acutely with features of small bowel obstruction and had emergency laparotomy, except one who underwent laparoscopic resection. In the comparative studies patients were more likely to be female and to have been taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for more than 7 years. This is a rare disease, difficult to diagnose and often confirmed by the intra-operative macroscopic appearance of circumferential stenosis of the bowel. Risk factors for developing small bowel diaphragm disease include long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and female gender. Patients with this disease are at increased risk of developing acute small bowel obstruction, so early identification is important. ","531":"Clinical reasoning is an essential part of medical practice and therefore should be an important part of clinical teaching. However, it has been and is still a challenge for clinical teachers to support learners in the development of their clinical reasoning skills. As learners progress in clerkship, so do their learning needs. As a result, teachers need multiple tools to foster the development of clinical reasoning and should know when and why to use them. This article presents tools gathered as part of a clinical teacher's toolbox aimed at coaching learners towards the next step in their clinical reasoning development as well as helping teachers diagnose clinical reasoning difficulties and meet the diverse learning needs of their learners. The article focuses on three tools that were developed by faculty at the University of Sherbrooke Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences: the iSNAPPS-OMP Technique, the Anticipatory Supervision Technique and the Clinical Sudoku or table of discriminating clues. This article uses the term 'tools' as a generic expression to signify 'items in a toolbox'. It includes all kinds of resources (techniques, strategies, models) that were gathered to help clinical teachers with the teaching of clinical reasoning.","532":"For patients with a life-limiting diagnosis, guidance by the General Medical Council recommends exploring patients' beliefs and values about tissue donation with the patient and family towards the end of life. This article gives guidance to healthcare professionals on the process of giving patients the opportunity to donate their corneas, including eligibility, communication and practicalities.","533":"This article summarises the clinical decision tools available to help decide when acute lower limb joint injuries should be referred for plain film radiography. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules are a tool for deciding whether to refer a patient for X-ray or not. The rules are highly sensitive, gaining National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendation in the UK, although they have limited benefit in some patient groups, such as those with peripheral neuropathy. The Ottawa knee rules are highly sensitive but less specific than the Pittsburgh decision rules. Although the Pittsburgh rules are more specific, they have been less extensively investigated and, unlike the Ottawa rules, are not National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended. A major barrier to use of these rules in clinical practice is the concern of litigation, although National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendation should reassure clinicians and thus reduce the amount of unnecessary radiation exposure.","534":"National guidance for cancer multidisciplinary teams recommends streamlining cases according to clinical complexity and guidelines. This article explores how the existing knowledge base and resources, accumulated since the introduction of multidisciplinary teams, can help to improve their effectiveness.","535":"In 1970, 50 years ago, I had headed the newly established Academic Unit of Surgery at the Westminster Medical School for 10 years. Since my appointment there in 1960, and for the next 30 years, one of my main interests as a general surgeon was the management of diseases of the breast - breast cancer in particular.","536":"Pulmonary embolism is a potentially fatal consequence of venous thromboembolism and constitutes a significant proportion of the acute medical take. Standard management has previously required admission of all patients presenting with acute pulmonary embolism for initiation of anticoagulation and initial investigations. However, clinical trial data have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of managing a subset of patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism in the outpatient setting and this has since been reflected in national guidelines. This article provides a practical overview for general physicians with regards to identifying patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism, and when and how to manage these patients on an outpatient basis.","537":"","538":"","539":"Advance care planning is an opportunity for patients to express their priorities for future care. NHS England has outlined a commitment to end-of-life care, advocating a shift towards more patient-centred care. The NHS is encouraging the workforce to engage patients in conversations about what is important to them, shifting the focus from 'what is wrong with you' to 'what matters to you'. Traditionally, this was seen as the doctor's role but this conversation can and should happen with the wider skilled medical workforce. The key to advance care planning is to have these conversations early on when patients have the capacity to discuss their preferences for care. Advance care planning can occur in any setting where the patient is comfortable to have the conversation, be that at home, in the GP surgery, in hospital or another setting. Patients with advance care plans are more likely to have their wishes respected, have fewer unwanted interventions, experience reduced transitions between care settings and are more likely to die in their preferred place of death. Healthcare professionals have a duty to offer advance care planning to patients nearing the last phase of life so that care can be delivered to honour individual needs at the end of life.","540":"","541":"As the population ages, there is a higher prevalence of both dementia and conditions that require major surgery. However, patients with dementia undergoing surgery have poorer outcomes than surgical patients without dementia. This article explores new guidance about delivering perioperative care for patients with dementia presenting for surgery. Management of patients with cognitive changes begins with developing an understanding of the classifications and pathophysiology of these disease processes, and addressing any modifiable risk factors for developing dementia, postoperative cognitive decline and postoperative delirium. Thorough preoperative assessment provides the opportunity to identify patients with and at risk of these cognitive impairments and to involve the appropriate multidisciplinary team in care planning. Once patients are identified, an individualised perioperative management plan addressing any issues surrounding capacity and consent, conduct of anaesthesia, possible polypharmacy and potential drug interactions, and postoperative pain management can improve quality of care and outcomes for these patients.","542":"The world's population is ageing rapidly, with significant increases in the numbers of the oldest old. This places great pressure on societies to adapt to this changing demography. Pertinent issues include provision of education and resource for long-term conditions. The priorities older people hold need to be fully understood and their contributions to society, often diverse and far-reaching, recognised with sincerity. Currently, health systems for older people can often feel reactive, fragmented and disjointed. These systems can harbour inequity and ageism, and leave both patients and health-care providers dissatisfied. Regarding the global context, the most rapidly ageing populations are in low- and middle-income countries. This partly reflects huge successes in the treatment and control of communicable diseases but gives rise to the challenge of the 'double burden', managing both communicable and non-communicable diseases simultaneously. Moreover, multimorbidity (suffering two or more chronic conditions) is commonplace and presents further challenges with regards to providing coordinated care. In order to harmonise effective and sustainable change, collaboration at local, national and international levels is key in order to foster a platform for learning and information sharing. Therein lies huge opportunities for countries to share their individual experiences, both past and present, to improve preparedness for global ageing.","543":"Evidence suggests a significant relationship between healthcare staff wellbeing and patient safety, with burnout directly and indirectly affecting medicolegal risk. Poor wellbeing of doctors has major implications for patient outcomes and the overall performance of healthcare organisations. This editorial looks at the predisposing factors that can lead to burnout and the potential solutions.","544":"The composition of the cardiac arrest team varies widely both throughout the UK and the world. There are no agreed standards regarding the composition of the resuscitation team, and variety in teams is often dictated by availability of staff and financial constraints. This article discusses the evidence for and against the inclusion of critical care doctors on the cardiac arrest call team.","545":"Four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate is the first-line treatment in vitamin K antagonist-related intracerebral haemorrhage. Early administration is associated with improved patient outcomes. A quality improvement project investigated delays in prothrombin complex concentrate administration in vitamin K antagonist-related intracerebral haemorrhage in order to reduce the time from computed tomography scan confirming intracerebral haemorrhage to prothrombin complex concentrate administration (scan-to-needle time). Twenty patients were identified by retrospective audit over a 3-year period. The median scan-to-needle time for prothrombin complex concentrate was 156 minutes. Several points of delay were identified, including contacting both haematology and transfusion departments for prothrombin complex concentrate dosing and dispensing. Following this audit, interventions were brought in which included the introduction of a protocol with a prothrombin complex concentrate dosing algorithm, negating the need to contact haematology before administration. A dedicated supply of prothrombin complex concentrate was given to the stroke unit avoiding the need to contact the transfusion service. A re-audit showed a 68% reduction in median scan-to-needle time from 156 minutes to 49 minutes. Prospective data collection is ongoing. ","546":"Antimicrobial resistance is a global crisis. Prescribing antibacterial combinations may be one way of reducing the development of resistance in target pathogens, as in the treatment of tuberculosis. Combinations may be useful for ascertaining synergy, broadening antimicrobial cover to reduce the risk of non-susceptibility, antimicrobial stewardship reasons, and immune modulation. The current research literature and\/or prevailing global standards of clinical care suggest that combination therapy may be advantageous in: severe community-acquired pneumonia; severe hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia or when there is a high risk of resistance in hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia; multi-drug or extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative infections; and severe group A streptococcal infections. In other situations, combinations may be harmful. Overall, outside of tuberculosis, combination antibacterial therapy is likely to improve outcomes only in specific circumstances and there is little evidence to suggest that this prevents the development of bacterial resistance. Further high-quality research is essential.","547":"","548":"It has been widely reported that increasing numbers of doctors are choosing to work on a less than full time basis, attracting both interest and criticism.

This article discusses the evidence for and against the use of beta blockers perioperatively and gives guidance for best practice.","550":"By 2020, chronic liver disease will have eclipsed ischaemic heart disease as the leading cause of working life years lost in the UK. As mortality from chronic liver disease continues to rise, the landscape of aetiology has shifted from infectious to non-communicable causes. In parallel with the growing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is estimated to affect 25% of the UK adult population. Simultaneously, escalating alcohol consumption has fuelled public health and economic concerns regarding its widespread impact on working-age adults. Given that chronic liver disease remains clinically silent until its advanced stages, there is an urgent unmet need to identify affected individuals earlier in the disease process, enabling targeted intervention strategies which may improve prognosis. Robust epidemiological data have shown that liver fibrosis is the strongest predictor of clinically meaningful outcomes, including decompensation, liver cancer and overall mortality. Detecting fibrosis among at-risk individuals, in a manner that is reproducible, non-invasive, safe and cost effective, has become a major challenge of our time. This article addresses the pitfalls of the standard panel of liver function tests, discusses other non-invasive biomarkers and reviews imaging technologies which may revolutionise community-based diagnosis and stratification of chronic liver disease.","551":"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of Alfred Adler, a psychotherapist who is remembered as probably second only to Sigmund Freud in terms of his reputation and influence in the field of psychotherapy.","552":"","553":"","554":"","555":"Idiopathic cryptoglandular fistula-in-ano is a common pathological condition. Fistula-in-ano has been managed by a number of surgical techniques, and there is still no consensus regarding the management of this condition. Surgical techniques aim to treat and cure the fistula-in-ano with minimal risk of recurrence or complications, and to maintain patient continence. This article discusses the evidence available to inform the management of idiopathic cryptoglandular fistula-in-ano, and problems that surgeons face because of the lack of high-quality evidence.","556":"Hypoxaemia is a common presentation in critically ill patients, with the potential for severe harm if not addressed appropriately. This review provides a framework to guide the management of any hypoxaemic patient, regardless of the clinical setting. Key steps in managing such patients include ascertaining the severity of hypoxaemia, the underlying diagnosis and implementing the most appropriate treatment. Oxygen therapy can be delivered by variable or fixed rate devices, and non-invasive ventilation; if patients deteriorate they may require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Early critical care team involvement is a key part of this pathway. Specialist treatments for severe hypoxaemia can only be undertaken on an intensive care unit and this field is developing rapidly as trial results become available. It is important that each new scenario is approached in a structured manner with an open diagnostic mind and a clear escalation plan.","557":"Hydronephrosis is diagnosed more often with the increased availability of computed tomography and ultrasound scanning. Hydronephrosis is an important consideration in patients with abdominal or pelvic pathology as progressive dilation of the upper urinary tract can lead to acute kidney injury and, if not corrected, permanent nephron loss. This article explores how to approach an adult patient with hydronephrosis, encompassing aetiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management.","558":"Epidural analgesia is a key component in the management of inpatient pain relief, particularly in surgical and trauma patients, and those with comorbidities. When used appropriately epidurals can decrease a patient's opiate consumption, as well as reducing the risk of adverse cardiorespiratory outcomes. To non-anaesthetists, or those not versed in their usage, epidurals can appear complex and intimidating, and the potential complications, although rare, can be catastrophic if not picked up on in a timely fashion. This article demystifies the epidural for hospital clinicians, looking at the anatomy and pharmacology, helping to identify patients who may benefit from epidural analgesia, highlighting some common pitfalls and questions posed by nursing staff, and providing a framework via which junior clinicians can detect, manage and appropriately escalate epidural-related problems and complications. Epidural analgesia is an invasive and high-risk intervention; as such it should always be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including anaesthesia and acute pain services.","559":"Management of anticoagulation has become a hot topic in the last decade. Health-care professionals are encountering increasing number of patients diagnosed with a thromboembolic episode, probably as a result of heightened awareness. In addition, the recognition that hospital-acquired thrombosis causes substantial mortality has led to an emphasis on appropriate thromboprophylaxis in all patients deemed at risk of thrombosis. However, the use of anticoagulants for both treatment and prophylaxis of thrombosis can pose a challenge in individuals who are obese. There are no detailed studies in this area and as such the dosing and monitoring of anticoagulants in these individuals can be problematic.","560":"Polypharmacy and multimorbidity are both currently rising. The number of medicines taken is the single biggest predictor of adverse drug events. Deprescribing is an approach to managing polypharmacy and reducing adverse outcomes. Multiple international evidence-based guidelines are emerging to promote discontinuation of high-risk medications, and use of alternative medical and non-pharmacological management. This review outlines the evidence base behind deprescribing, and suggests some pragmatic approaches to decision making around medication review.","561":"The significance of early diagnosis for melanoma prognosis and survival cannot be understated. The public health benefits of melanoma prevention and detection have driven advances in diagnostics for skin cancer, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence. Evaluating the benefits and limitations of artificial intelligence in dermatology is paramount to its future development and clinical application.","562":"","563":"It is important for physicians to be aware of stroke warning syndromes because, although rare, there is a high associated risk of subsequent ischaemic infarction. Stroke warning syndromes present as stereotypical, recurrent transient episodes of focal neurological deficit, in the absence of cortical signs, occurring within a short period of time. They are broadly divided into two main subtypes, based on vascular territory: capsular warning syndrome and pontine warning syndrome. The exact underlying pathophysiology related to stroke warning syndromes is incompletely established, but proposed pathophysiological hypotheses for cerebral hypoperfusion include micro-atherosclerosis (cerebral small vessel disease) and haemodynamic instability (e.g. hypotension). Atherosclerotic disease involving small perforating arteries in the anterior circulation (e.g. lenticulostriatal arteries) gives rise to capsular warning syndrome and subsequent risk of capsular infarcts. Conversely, involvement of the posterior circulation pontine perforator arteries gives rise to pontine warning syndrome, which can result in paramedian pontine infarcts. Although the evidence is limited, recommended treatment modalities include permissive hypertension, intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, dual antiplatelet therapy and statins.","564":"The impact of hospital-acquired pneumonia and the pressure to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing has lead to the publication of prescribing guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. This editorial gives an overview of the guidelines and emphasises the need for more high-quality evidence to inform decision making in this group of patients.","565":"Restless legs syndrome describes a curious need to stretch and move in response to an unpleasant feeling in the legs. For most people who have this, as they are drifting off to sleep there is a twitch of the toe, foot and ankle followed by another and then another. The limb movements are strikingly periodic and are described as such by frustrated bed partners. The pathophysiology remains debated but is likely to involve dopaminergic dysfunction and ascending arousal systems. Despite a prevalence of 5-10% in the general population, the variable nature of symptoms and difficulty describing the dysaesthesia often leads to delay in treatment. This article outlines the diagnostic criteria, medication and comorbidities that modify symptoms, the impact of restless legs syndrome on health, and symptomatic management. Several licensed therapies are effective but the dopamine agonists in particular can cause challenging side effects and paradoxically worsen symptoms over time. Case histories are reviewed to guide physicians.","566":"George Armstrong was probably the first physician to practice exclusively as a paediatrician in this country.

This review discusses the current genetic mutations conferring risk of developing breast cancer and the management pathway for these women with identifiable mutations as well as those with a strong family history for breast cancer. Management of these individuals is complex and should involve a multidisciplinary team with interest and expertise in breast cancer genetics. There are several treatment options ranging from surveillance to risk-reducing surgery. Risk reduction surgery has been popularised by celebrities who are carriers of breast cancer genes, and raised public awareness of breast cancer genetics and associated risk.","571":"","572":"","573":"Acute angle closure is an emergent ophthalmic condition that develops as a result of an obstructed outflow of aqueous humour between the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye, leading to a sudden rise in intraocular pressure and secondary optic neuropathy if left untreated. The most common primary cause is a pupillary block in patients with pre-existing narrow angles, such as those who are long-sighted. However, awareness should be raised to identify secondary causes of angle closure, including the use of commonly prescribed medications. A detailed interrogation is essential to exclude other possible confounding disorders that present similarly, especially those originating in the CNS. Angle closure should be excluded in all patients presenting with sudden onset of red eye associated with pupillary dilation, dull pain and headache. Basic examination of the eye should include assessment of the anterior segment with a bright light, measurement of intraocular pressure and a full neurological exam. Immediate treatment must be initiated whenever there is high clinical suspicion of acute angle closure, with the administration of systemic ocular hypotensive therapy to prevent damage to the optic nerve and limit visual loss. An urgent referral to the ophthalmologist is mandatory to dictate definitive management.","574":"Chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder is typically seen in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. It is managed primarily by renal physicians, but non-renal physicians are also likely to encounter patients undergoing treatment for this condition in both inpatient and outpatient settings so a basic understanding of the principles may be helpful.

Consequences of chest wall trauma may include significant pain, altered chest wall mechanics, hypoventilation, infection and respiratory failure. In order to best determine the appropriate management, risk stratification tools have been developed to identify patients at highest risk of complications who would most benefit from more invasive management strategies. Early optimization of analgesia is vital both for patient experience and to reduce the risk of pulmonary complications. The analgesic options range from multimodal oral analgesia to invasive regional anaesthetic techniques such as thoracic epidurals, paravertebral catheters, intercostal nerve blocks and fascial plane blocks. Other important considerations include provision of appropriate oxygen therapy, ventilation support and physiotherapy. For a selected group of patients with the most significant injuries, surgical rib fixation may be appropriate if chest wall mechanics are sufficiently impaired.","580":"","581":"","582":"Several specialist teams are involved in the management of patients with urological cancer.

Common symptoms include pain, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and breathlessness. Anticipatory prescribing of the 4 A's (analgesic, anti-emetic, anxiolytic, and anti-secretory) is a proactive approach to ensure medication is available, if required, for common symptoms in the last hours to days of life, such as pain, upper airway secretions, anxiety, and agitation. Prescribing or medication errors in relation to symptom control in palliative care can relate to individual errors, poor communication, poor care coordination, equipment and care planning. There are some important key points relating to prescribing to consider, for example, using recognized conversions when changing between opioids and from the oral to syringe drivers route; that diamorphine and morphine are not equipotent; prescribing liquid opioids in milligrams not millilitres where there are multiple concentrations available; making the indication for steroids clear when used, as they are multiple possible indications (and also their intended duration, to avoid unintended longer term sequelae of steroid use); and avoiding the use of oxygen for symptomatic relief of breathlessness in the absence of hypoxia.","588":"","589":"","590":"","591":"","592":"Neurogenic heterotopic ossification is a condition whereby bone forms in an extra-skeletal site. It may occur in the context of major neurological insult involving the brain or spinal cord. It causes pain and restricts movement, most commonly at the hip joints. Although neurogenic heterotopic ossification is associated with significant morbidity, the diagnosis is not always considered when referring for imaging in susceptible individuals. This article highlights its key features to promote better awareness and recognition, by reviewing clinical findings and imaging of patients across various modalities including plain radiographs, ultrasound and computed tomography. The management of neurogenic heterotopic ossification is limited by late identification and consequently clinicians should always be aware of this potentially significant diagnosis. Recognition in the acute hospital setting before transfer to rehabilitation services may prevent further clinical sequelae including urinary tract infection and pressure ulcers.","593":"The General Medical Council was originally set up to 'protect, promote and maintain the health and safety of the public'. In 2012, the Privy Council instructed the General Medical Council to set up and run a licensing and revalidation system for all practicing doctors in the UK, to protect patients from actions of medical staff. Despite this mandate, the General Medical Council has been a bystander in a series of regulatory failures. Without these episodes having been highlighted by family members, public investigations would not have been carried out. The maintenance of medical performance is delegated to NHS employers, which could cause conflicts of interests when employers have to investigate doctors as part of a team. The other responsibility of the General Medical Council is to monitor teaching standards and curricula of medical schools in the UK, which it does by eliciting feedback from students and trainees. The General Medical Council has not responded to 'new ways of working' (especially in England) involving non-medical staff undertaking tasks previously carried out by doctors. Furthermore, the General Medical Council has not updated its description of the role of the future doctor in light of increasing use of technology, use or non-use of which could both be considered to be evidence of poor practice.","594":"Management of trauma has been tackled at a national level to improve patient care and mortality. Decision making through a multidisciplinary team approach has resulted in improved patient outcomes through a complex combination of changes. While the focus of trauma care delivery has been towards establishing an effective multidisciplinary trauma service, there are still improvements which can be made. This article reviews the history of trauma care in the UK, and the impact that multidisciplinary teams have had on the management of the multiply injured patient.","595":"","596":"","597":"","598":"","599":"","600":"Raynaud's phenomenon is a common vasospastic condition which carries a significant burden of pain and hand-related disability (Hughes and Herrick, 2016). The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in the general population has been reported to be approximately 5% (Garner et al, 2015). Raynaud's phenomenon can occur either as a primary ('idiopathic') phenomenon or secondary to a wide range of underlying medical conditions and drug causes. Therefore, hospital-based specialists are frequently involved in the care of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and need to be aware of associated conditions and prescribed medications for Raynaud's phenomenon. In particular, Raynaud's phenomenon is often the earliest manifestation of an underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease (e.g. systemic sclerosis). A comprehensive clinical assessment is required including performing targeted investigations (e.g. nailfold capillaroscopy and systemic sclerosis-associated autoantibodies). Patient education and lifestyle adaptations is first-line treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon. There is a wide range of pharmacological options including oral and intravenous drug therapies available to treat Raynaud's phenomenon. Surgical intervention is sometimes required for refractory Raynaud's phenomenon and tissue ischaemia. This review describes the clinical manifestations of Raynaud's phenomenon including potential secondary causes and presents an approach to assessment and management.","601":"Meta-analysis has become an integral part of evidence-based decision-making processes and is being increasingly used in medical and non-medical disciplines. Aggregate data or summary statistics continue to be the mainstay of meta-analysis and are used by many professional societies to support clinical practice guidelines. Meta-analyses synthesize the summary statistics from independent trials by pooling them to estimate the underlying common effect size. The results represent the highest level of evidence but only if the chosen studies are of high quality and the selection criteria are fully satisfied. It is important to address the issues of defining an explicit and relevant question, exhaustively searching for the totality of evidence, meticulous and unbiased data transfer or extraction, assessment of between study heterogeneity and the use of appropriate statistical methods for estimating summary effect measures. This article reviews the methodology, benefits and drawbacks of performing a meta-analysis.","602":"Lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow is a common condition estimated to affect between 1 and 3% of adults. As a result of its high prevalence, both primary and secondary care physicians are frequently presented with this problem, so knowledge of its presentation and up-to-date management strategies is essential. This review collates the most recent evidence on lateral epicondylitis to help the clinician perform assessments and make treatment decisions, based on the best current clinical practice.","603":null,"604":"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (dissociative seizures) are encountered commonly in emergency medicine and in acute medical wards. Although diagnosis is usually deferred to an expert in epilepsy, an understanding of the phenomenon is helpful in acute management of the patient and dealing with associated urgent safeguarding issues.

In particular, the CT head scan has become significant in the trauma setting. With short scanning time, an investigation to confirm or exclude intracranial haemorrhage, skull fracture or stroke can now be performed in a matter of seconds. This article provides physicians with a structure for reading a CT head scan, to help identify key findings that may warrant further specialist neurosurgical or stroke team referral.","607":"Survival analysis is a set of methods used to study the time between enrollment in a study and the occurrence of an event of interest. Two methods are commonly used: actuarial life tables and the Kaplan-Meier approach for survival analysis. A good understanding of both these methods is useful when reading and appraising the literature concerning prognostic and interventional studies. Kaplan-Meier curves are widely used as they enable analysis of incomplete sets of data (i.e. after patients withdraw from studies or are lost to follow up). This review explains these two methods and gives practical examples of their use.","608":"","609":"","610":"Following injury, the skin undergoes a wound healing process culminating in the formation of a mature scar. Millions of patients worldwide are left with scars every year as a result of trauma or surgery. Scars can be painful, disfiguring and disabling, yet patients report that clinicians are often dismissive of their concerns, unable to identify pathological scars and unaware of treatment options. The normal wound healing process comprises three overlapping stages: inflammation, proliferation and remodelling. In some patients this process is deranged, resulting in the formation of hypertrophic or keloid scars. Clinicians can minimize the risk of these pathological scars developing with good surgical technique and wound aftercare. If pathological scars do form, they should be identified early and patients referred for treatment, most often topical or intralesional corticosteroids. In resistant cases, pathological scars may be treated with phototherapy, radiotherapy or surgical resection.","611":"The prevalence of diabetes in the inpatient setting is increasing, and suboptimal glucose control in hospital is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Attaining the recommended glucose levels is challenging with standard insulin therapy. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are common and diabetes management in hospital can be a considerable workload burden for health-care professionals. Fully automated insulin delivery (closed-loop) has been shown to be safe, and achieves superior glucose control than standard insulin therapy in the hospital, including in those patients receiving haemodialysis and enteral or parenteral nutrition where glucose control can be particularly challenging. Evidence that the improved glucose control achieved using closed-loop systems can translate into improved clinical outcomes for patients is key to support widespread adoption of this technology. The closed-loop approach has the potential to provide a paradigm shift in the management of inpatient diabetes, particularly in the most challenging inpatient populations, and may reduce staff work burden and the health-care costs associated with inpatient diabetes.","612":"","613":"During medical school, students have numerous opportunities to develop their portfolios for a career in surgery, such as undertaking additional surgical placements and participating in surgical research. However, at present, there is little guidance available for medical students on how to build a strong portfolio for the UK core surgical training application. This article outlines work undertaken to provide concise guidance to support future surgeons, via application of the competency-based CanMEDS framework to the current UK core surgical training specification. A pre-conference meeting was arranged for medical students at the Society of Academic and Research Surgeons annual conference in January 2018. Self-selected research enthusiasts from different university years discussed practical approaches to pair the CanMEDS model with the core surgical training specification, with support from the STARSurg Collaborative committee to facilitate discussion. A nominal group-based method was adopted in order to reach areas of consensus. Practical tips and recommendations for each respective CanMEDS domain (communicator, collaborator, leader, health advocate, scholar, professional) were made in relation to the core surgical training specification. These included key action points and named opportunities that are currently available to UK medical students. A consensus approach was taken to address key areas of competence across each CanMEDS domain. This informed the development of a guidance framework to support students to develop a strong portfolio for a core surgical training application. This framework can be followed by medical students, equipping them with the skills necessary to succeed in their future surgical career.

Symptoms of hypoglycaemia can be subtle in the elderly. Hypoglycaemia accounts for more hospital admissions than hyperglycaemia. Treatment targets are set based on the risk of adverse events resulting from treatment and the benefits expected from tighter glycaemic control. The different medications available are discussed including the different types of insulin, in particular relation to usage in older adults. The choice of therapy is based on the targets, comorbidities and the characteristics of each antidiabetic agent. Deintensification of therapy should be considered in patients who experience adverse effects. Treatment guidelines should be formulated based on the above principles, as many current guidelines do not incorporate deintensification of therapy.","617":"","618":"","619":"","620":"Bleeding can cause significant morbidity in patients with upper gastrointestinal malignancies. Palliative radiotherapy can palliate bleeding effectively across numerous cancer sites such as the lung and rectum. The data available regarding the role in bleeding from upper gastrointestinal cancers are limited to a single meta-analysis, a phase 2 trial, eleven retrospective cohorts and two case reports, with the majority focusing on gastric cancer. From the data available radiotherapy appears to be a well-tolerated, effective haemostatic agent that should be considered in all patients with bleeding from an upper gastrointestinal malignancy. Questions remain regarding the radiobiology of haemostasis and the optimum fractionation schedule. There is no convincing evidence that protracted higher dose regimens provide additional benefit. Commonly used fractionation schedules use 1, 5 or 10 fractions. Short fractionation schedules have been used in patients with deteriorating performance status.","621":"Radiotherapy is a highly effective anti-cancer treatment commonly used alongside systemic therapies and surgery to achieve long-term cancer-free survival. Conventional radiotherapy uses photon beams to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumour volume to eradicate cancer cells. This has to be offset against the irradiation of surrounding normal tissues, as increasing this dose causes more treatment-related toxicity. In August 2018, the NHS's first high energy proton beam therapy centre opened at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester. A second NHS centre is scheduled to open in 2020 at the University College London Hospitals NHS Trust. Proton beam therapy may offer dosimetric advantages compared to conventional radiotherapy as a result of its characteristic dose deposition - proton beams deliver a comparatively higher proportion of their dose to the target volume relative to normal tissues, without significant exit doses when compared to conventional photon therapy. Therefore proton beam therapy may be indicated for certain tumours situated next to critical organs or in the paediatric population where quality of life and the reduction of secondary effects from radiation are particularly significant. The indications for proton beam therapy and patient outcomes after treatment will be carefully monitored and evaluated in order to provide a robust evidence base for its use.","622":"Autoimmune hepatitis is widely assumed by health-care professionals to be a disease that is easily controlled through the use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressants but recent studies in the UK indicate highly variable treatment regimens and often unsatisfactory treatment outcomes, such as dependence on long-term high-dose steroids and ongoing need for liver transplantation in some cases. The therapeutic use of the systemically acting corticosteroid prednisolone results in unacceptable side effects in many patients. Recent evidence suggests that it is not always necessary to use high-dose steroids (&gt;0.5 mg\/kg\/d) to attain remission; and side effects may also be minimised through more targeted therapy with the less systemically-absorbed corticosteroid, budesonide. The authors offer advice on the stratification of treatment for these patients and suggest changes to improve the services available for people with autoimmune hepatitis in the UK.","623":"Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) scans can be complex to interpret but sometimes significant abnormalities are relatively easy to recognize. In emergencies it is beneficial if physicians and surgeons can identify significant pathology that may immediately change patient management. Early image interpretation will allow clinicians to alert radiologists to provide prompt urgent reports, facilitate early referral to other specialities or expedite emergency surgery. This article provides non-radiologists with a systematic approach to identifying emergency pathology on abdominal and pelvic CT scans. It reviews the relevant cross-sectional anatomy and discusses the CT appearances of bowel perforation, bowel obstruction, bowel ischaemia (gangrene), bleeding, appendicitis and hydronephrosis using illustrative examples from the authors' clinical practice. Underlying causes for these conditions and the importance of interpreting the radiological appearances in conjunction with the patient's clinical condition and history are discussed. The authors hope that by using the POGBAH acronym and a systematic approach readers will be able to identify emergency pathology on abdominal and pelvic CT which may improve patient care.","624":"Detailed thought, knowledge, complex analysis, reasoned judgment and professionalism all fundamentally underpin a surgeon's work and training, yet there is a popularly held view that accomplished surgeons are primarily concerned with performing procedures. A review of pedagogical, social and medical literature, together with personal reflections from the authors, shows that a surgeon's work is multi-faceted. This article discusses the technical skills of operating as a reflection of the 'tip of the iceberg' of a surgeon's cognition, the increasingly multidisciplinary strategic approach of surgeons today, the importance of surgical decision making, the influence of robotics, the role of non-medically trained staff, surgeons' role in postoperative care, adaptive expertise and the formation of professional identity. In so doing, a much wider view of a surgeon than simply 'doing' or 'thinking' is presented with implications for surgical training.","625":"","626":"Rib fractures are a common reason for hospital admission and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This article discusses the management of simple rib fractures and provides practical guidance for junior doctors involved in the care of these patients. Careful assessment to identify patients at high risk of complications is essential and calculation of a rib fracture score can aid management decisions. Pain from rib fractures can be severe and requires multimodal analgesia started promptly and proactively on hospital admission. This may include the use of regional anaesthetic techniques such as thoracic epidurals and erector spinae blocks for patients with significant chest trauma or those at high risk of pulmonary complications.","627":"","628":"","629":"Leaders in today's NHS face the unenviable task of reconciling rising demand, frozen resource allocation and increasing accountability. As the NHS itself stands at the nexus of an unstable political and socioeconomic landscape, its future success relies largely on its ability to nurture excellence, to encourage open communication within and across health-care teams, and to inspire its workforce through exemplary leadership and followership. Key to these endeavours are clinicians on the 'shop floor', whose daily interactions with patients and staff help to shape prevailing culture and drive progress through quality improvement and leadership initiatives. This article considers how transactional analysis can be incorporated into professional development to help doctors develop insight into and optimize the use of different communication styles. The authors propose that a working knowledge of the transactional analysis ego state model can enhance effective communication, leadership and followership within and across health-care teams, with a view to optimizing patient outcomes and workforce interactions.","630":"Multiple organ dysfunction and resultant mortality in critically ill patients has been linked with impaired cellular energy supply and oxidative stress. Clinical studies supplementing selenium, on the basis of its role as a key cofactor of antioxidant enzymes, have reported variable outcomes in critically ill patients. However, the synergistic interaction between selenium and coenzyme Q10, which has essential roles in cellular energy supply and as an antioxidant, has not been considered in such studies.

Diagnosis is made by patient history, clinical examination and radiographic findings. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography and magnetic resonance arthrography may be necessary in selected patients. Femoroacetabular impingement can be treated non-operatively with physiotherapist-led conservative care including analgesia and intra-articular steroid injections. Arthroscopic hip surgery aiming to restore pain-free functional range of movement and repair damaged labrum can help in selected patients with no pre-existing osteoarthritis.

It is often challenging to manage affected patients as their symptoms are often viewed through a prism of complex psychosocial issues. Clinicians are often unaware of the lack of evidence regarding opioid prescribing for non-cancer pain, and these trends in prescribing have been significantly escalated by pharmaceutical companies and prescribing culture in recent years. Opioid prescribing in the context of disorders of gut-brain interaction (formerly known as functional gastrointestinal disorders) can worsen conditions such as centrally-mediated abdominal pain syndrome and narcotic bowel syndrome. Opioids should not be prescribed to these patients as the harm is significantly greater than the benefit. However, in certain patients, such as those being investigated for organic abdominal pain, a trial of opioids may be indicated. In these groups, an opioid contract should be used, in addition to risk tools to identify those most vulnerable to the negative effects of these drugs. Prevention and treatment of the long-term effects of opioids requires a multidisciplinary approach and health-care professionals should all become 'opioid aware'.","639":"","640":"","641":"","642":"","643":"","644":"","645":"Regular heavy consumption of alcohol is associated with a wide range of physical, psychological and social problems. All health-care clinicians should be able to screen for and detect problematic levels of alcohol consumption in their patients, and deliver an effective brief intervention. When patients with alcohol dependence are admitted to hospital there must be an assessment of whether medication is required to prevent withdrawal symptoms and potential delirium tremens and withdrawal seizures. Medically assisted alcohol withdrawal using a long-acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide should be carefully monitored and titrated to effect, and the clinician should be aware of the risk of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and other complications. Abstinence from alcohol is usually only the first step in treatment, and effective linkage to community alcohol services is an important step.","646":"Noise-induced hearing loss is sensory deafness caused by long-term exposure of the auditory system to a noisy environment. Auditory fatigue is an early symptom of noise-induced hearing loss, and hearing can gradually recover after people leave a noisy environment. However, if people remain in a noisy environment for a prolonged period of time, their hearing will be permanently impaired. Societal changes mean that people are more likely to be exposed to noise. The hearing loss and tinnitus caused by noise seriously affect people's quality of life and lead to huge economic loss. The pathogenesis of noise-induced hearing loss is complex. Various theories try to explain this, such as the oxidative stress theory, but none perfectly explains the occurrence of noise-induced hearing loss. There is no treatment which can completely reverse the damage. More research is required to explore the pathogenesis and to better guide clinical practice. Preventative strategies, such as educating the public about hearing health, should be adopted to reduce the harm of noise-induced hearing loss.","647":"","648":"","649":"","650":"","651":"Urinary catheterization is an important procedure that is regularly performed in hospital.

Systemic sclerosis can affect all the major organs and therefore, although the disease is uncommon, many hospital-based specialists are involved in patient care. Vascular disease (e.g. Raynaud's phenomenon) is an almost universal symptom in patients with systemic sclerosis and is often the earliest manifestation of the disease. Systemic sclerosis not uncommonly can overlap with other rheumatological conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and myositis). During the past few decades there have been major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis and these are driving advances in treatment. There are now a number of effective treatments to manage many of the different organ-based complications. Autologous haemopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potential treatment option in highly selected patients.

It is indicated when access for administration of drugs or extracorporeal blood circuits and haemodynamic monitoring or interventions is needed. When inserting a central venous catheter, appropriate preparation and asepsis, positioning of the patient, and the use of ultrasound should be considered. Compared to the landmark method of localization, ultrasound can account for anatomical variations, facilitate visualization of venous puncture, and safeguard against inadvertent arterial puncture. In the Seldinger technique, which is the primary mode of central venous catheterization, a needle is passed towards the chosen vessel. Once the needle is in the vein, a guidewire is introduced through the needle into the vessel and the needle is removed. Following a small skin incision at the base of the guidewire, a dilator is advanced over the guidewire and then taken out. Subsequent to this, the central venous catheter is railroaded over the guidewire into the vein and the guidewire is withdrawn. Complications of central venous catheterization can be mechanical, infectious or thrombotic.","669":"","670":"Obesity is a major and growing global health problem.

Trauma to the upper airway as a result of the act of endotracheal intubation is a common event in adults undergoing procedures under general anaesthesia. Sites requiring attention during intubation include the laryngeal apparatus, the pharynx and oral cavity as well as the nasal cavity when nasopharyngeal intubation is performed. Patients can present with a range of symptoms which can make assessment and management challenging. Dysphonia, throat pain and dysphagia are the commonest presenting complaints. Patient-related factors, intubation technique and other anaesthetic-related conditions can be a cause of trauma, if not adequately considered before intubation. All patients should be carefully examined preoperatively and their past medical history obtained. Patient demographics, comorbidities, existing airway pathology and presence of reflux should be noted. Trauma prevention strategies should be in place to eliminate avoidable complications. Potential difficult airway cases should be flagged up and adequately prepared for, in anticipation of intubation difficulties that can lead to trauma. The majority of injuries will resolve spontaneously with conservative management. Persistent symptomatology, usually secondary to laryngeal injuries, requires prompt referral to an ear nose and throat specialist with an interest in laryngology for further assessment and treatment.","678":"","679":"Ulnar-sided wrist pain is a complex entity to diagnose clinically and frequently requires imaging to help confirm or determine the diagnosis.

Instead of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), calculating the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was recommended. The complexity of SOFA also led to the introduction of quick SOFA (qSOFA) as a bedside tool. The simultaneous removal of SIRS and introduction of qSOFA belies their significant differences, with SIRS having a high sensitivity but very low specificity, and qSOFA being very specific for a poor outcome, but having a lower sensitivity than SIRS. In the UK, the variables within qSOFA are collected on a regular and repeated basis, along with additional variables, as part of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS).

Pressures on time conspire against this interchange of information. A patient-centred surgical communication check sheet was devised to enable rapid two-way transfer of information between surgeon and patient. A quality improvement project involved three cycles. Through the use of a patient survey, distributed following the daily ward round, areas for improvement in communication were highlighted in cycle one. The surgical communication check sheet was introduced in cycle two, and modified before cycle three following discussion with the orthopaedic department. The surgical communication check sheet was handed out to patients before the ward round, and its efficacy was measured by evaluating ward round communication using the survey as in cycle one. Initial results showed a variable standard of communication, which improved following the introduction of the surgical communication check sheet in cycle two. In cycle three, 84.7% patients felt that the check sheet aided communication on the ward round. Measures of communication improved between cycles one and three: the percentage of patients with unanswered questions fell from 21.8% to 16.7%, the number of patients unsure why a test was done fell from 25.9% to 12.7%, and average understanding of the management plan rose from 64.7% to 83.3%. The introduction of the surgical communication check sheet improved ward round communication, and was welcomed by almost 85% of patients. Accounts from patients indicate two benefits of the check sheet: the surgeon is immediately aware of a patient with questions or concerns, allowing these to be adequately addressed, and patients can formulate questions before the ward round which bolsters their confidence to ask them.

Genotypes 3 and 4 cause widespread, sporadic infection in high-income countries and are emerging as the most common type of viral hepatitis in much of Europe. These infections carry significant morbidity and mortality in the growing numbers of immunosuppressed patients or in patients with established liver disease. Furthermore the growing extra-hepatic associations of the virus, including neurological and kidney injury, suggest that it may have been misnamed as a 'hepatitis' virus. This review explores current understanding of the epidemiology, virology and clinical presentations of hepatitis E infection and identifies vulnerable patient groups, who are at serious risk from infection. Guidance is offered regarding the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of this growing public health hazard.","696":"Radiologists play a pivotal role in patient management in modern hospital medicine and more so with regard to breast imaging. The diagnosis of breast pathology hinges predominantly on mammography and ultrasound imaging. With reduced clinician confidence in clinical examination alone, virtually all patients with breast symptoms are being referred for imaging. The traditional 'one-stop' clinics are victims of their own success and demand outstrips availability. This article makes a case for imaging-led breast clinics to increase efficiency, reduce duplication of work and cost, and increase throughput of patients.","697":"","698":"Infection is a serious complication of prosthetic joint arthroplasty, associated with high rates of morbidity resulting in further surgical intervention and prolonged inpatient hospital admission. Rates of prosthetic joint infection have been reported as 1.5-2.5% following lower limb arthroplasty. This study compared infection rates in patients receiving primary hip and knee joint replacements before and after implementation of ring-fenced beds. Retrospective study of all patients undergoing primary total hip replacement and total knee replacement from April 2013 to February 2014. Group 1 included pre-ring-fencing patients, group 2 included post-ring-fencing patients. The overall infection rate pre-ring-fencing was 6.3% (n=8). This reduced to 2.7% (n=3) post-ring-fencing. The mean inpatient length of stay for group 1 was 6 days vs 4 days for group 2. Ring-fencing beds for patients undergoing elective lower limb arthroplasty significantly reduced rates of prosthetic joint infection and inpatient length of stay.

This is especially useful when the clinical presentation can be variable and there is diagnostic uncertainty. Usually, there is bilateral symmetrical abnormality within the deep grey matter structures and the cerebral cortex because of the high metabolic activity and raised oxygen requirements in these areas. Magnetic resonance imaging, particularly diffusion weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences, is very important in differentiating between various aetiologies in this group. Magnetic resonance imaging can be useful in demonstrating both acute and chronic damage, in evaluating treatment response and in disease prognostication. This pictorial review discusses the computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging appearances of a spectrum of toxic and metabolic disorders observed in a district general hospital with reference to clinical presentation and imaging features that may allow diagnosis. This includes carbon monoxide poisoning, hypoglycaemia, non-ketotic hyperglycaemia, osmotic demyelination syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, the syndrome of delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy and cocaine toxicity.","702":"Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder caused by deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) and characterized by recurrent episodes of severe swelling that affect the limbs, face, intestinal tract and airway. Since laryngeal oedema can be life-threatening as a result of asphyxiation, correct diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema is vital. Hereditary angioedema attacks are mediated by bradykinin, the production of which is regulated by C1-INH. Hereditary angioedema therapy relies on treatment of acute attacks, and short- and long-term prophylaxis. Acute treatment options include C1-INH concentrate, icatibant and ecallantide. Self-administration of treatment is recommended and is associated with increased quality of life of patients with hereditary angioedema. Advances in diagnosis and management have improved the outcomes and quality of life of patients with hereditary angioedema.","703":"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumours in children and adults, consisting of a heterogeneous group of neoplastic diseases arise from the supporting cells of the CNS (glial cells). Their histopathological and molecular characteristics vary considerably as do their management and prognosis. Conventional gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the primary imaging modality for initial work up and follow up of patients with gliomas, although it has some limitations, especially in differentiating high from low grade tumours and in distinguishing disease recurrence from post-therapy changes. Hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)\/MRI is a relatively novel tool that combines MRI sequences with metabolic information from PET, and therefore different PET radiotracers, in a single scan. This article discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of combined PET\/MRI compared to other conventional or more widely available imaging tools, such as MRI or combined positron emission tomography-computed tomography. The main uses of PET\/MRI and the most commonly used PET radiotracers in providing diagnostic, prognostic and predictive information in patients with glioma are covered.","704":"","705":"","706":"","707":"The costs of litigation are large and increasing, to a level that places a drain on precious health-care resources and affects the way medicine is practised.

The direct superior approach reduces iatrogenic periarticular soft tissue injury compared to the direct anterior approach for total hip arthroplasty. The learning curve for the direct superior approach is 40 operative cases with operative times comparable to those of conventional approaches for total hip arthroplasty after surgical proficiency has been achieved. The direct superior approach provides improvements in pain and short-term functional outcomes after total hip arthroplasty as assessed using the Harris Hip Score.

In the UK, the National Emergency Laparotomy Audit, mandated for all patients undergoing emergency laparotomy, uses pPOSSUM as its risk prediction tool. However, there is no literature reporting the inter-operator variability in calculating the score. Inter-rater variability was assessed based on 10 real general surgical cases that went on to have an emergency laparotomy. Forty clinicians, 10 each of registrars and consultants in anaesthetics and general surgery, were asked to calculate the pPOSSUM based on the clinical information typically available at the time of making the decision to proceed to emergency laparotomy for the same 10 National Emergency Laparotomy Audit cases. All participants were surveyed to assess their understanding and use of the pPOSSUM score. More than 80% of respondents stated that they use pPOSSUM in daily clinical practice. There was variability in the calculated scores between the groups analysed. Two subgroups were evident: one in which the calculated mean pPOSSUM was similar between participants but did not reflect the true value, and the other which was accurate, but demonstrated high inter-rater variability. This is the first study to investigate inter-operator variability in pPOSSUM scores. Previous reports on the validity of the tool fail to account for subjective variation. At a time where pPOSSUM has become a routine part of clinical practice, this variability needs to be accounted for and taken into consideration in the decision-making process. ","738":"Bronchiolitis is an acute respiratory illness that is the leading cause of hospitalization in young children less than 2 years of age in the UK. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common virus associated with bronchiolitis and has the highest disease severity, mortality and cost. Bronchiolitis is generally a self-limiting condition, but can have serious consequences in infants who are very young, premature, or have underlying comorbidities. Management of bronchiolitis in the UK is guided by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (2015) guidance. The mainstays of management are largely supportive, consisting of fluid management and respiratory support. Pharmacological interventions including nebulized bronchodilators, steroids and antibiotics generally have limited or no evidence of efficacy and are not advised by National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. Antiviral therapeutics remain in development. As treatments are limited, there have been extensive efforts to develop vaccines, mainly targeting respiratory syncytial virus. At present, the only licensed product is a monoclonal antibody for passive immunisation. Its cost restricts its use to those at highest risk. Vaccines for active immunisation of pregnant women and young infants are also being developed.","739":"Uncontrolled haemorrhage is the leading cause of preventable death from injury and is a major contributor to the global burden of disease. The majority of deaths resulting from bleeding occur within the first 3 hours of hospital admission, and the window for meaningful intervention is therefore extremely small. Resuscitative efforts during active bleeding should focus on maintaining haemostatic function with blood product transfusion and early administration of tranexamic acid. Achieving control of haemorrhage is the overarching treatment priority and may require temporising measures before definitive surgical or radiological intervention.

Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a multidisciplinary approach used both to assess existing 'known' pathology and to screen for previously undiagnosed issues across medical, functional, social and\/or psychological domains. This diagnostic phase then leads to the development and implementation of an individualized 'optimization' strategy across these domains.

It causes dysphagia and other symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction. Eosinophilic oesophagitis presents either with a chronic feeling of difficulty swallowing, with food moving slowly through the oesophagus, or as an acute food bolus obstruction requiring emergency attention. Patients may also experience chest pain at this time. It is an inflammatory disorder, thought to be driven by food or environmental antigens, where the most distinctive cell type is eosinophils. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is mediated through a local IgG4 mechanism and does not manifest as a systemic disease. It is diagnosed only on endoscopy and biopsy - there are characteristic endoscopic appearances with oedema, rings, furrows and strictures but the golden rule in its diagnosis is to perform multiple biopsies from multiple sites in the oesophagus in all patients with dysphagia or other oesophageal dysfunction. Finding a peak concentration of &gt;15 eosinophils per high power field in this situation is diagnostic of eosinophilic oesophagitis. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is not usually related to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, but the two conditions may co-exist.

Patients with depression, and other mood and anxiety disorders, show distinct compositional changes in their gut bacteria profile, raising the question about a possible aetiological role for the microbiome in these disorders. Evidence is emerging that the gut microbiome may represent a new potential antidepressant target and the term 'psychobiotic' has been coined to describe bacteria which confer mental health benefits. Gut bacteria are easily accessible and can be altered in a variety of ways including through the use of probiotics, prebiotics and dietary change. Psychobiotics containing various Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species have demonstrated the ability to improve mood, reduce anxiety and enhance cognitive function in both healthy populations and patient groups.

Although autoimmune conditions account for only 1% of indications for autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, this is increasingly used to treat high-risk autoimmune diseases. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation can induce long-term remission by resetting the immune system via eradication of autoreactive immune cells and the generation of a de novo self-tolerant immune system.

Hospitalizations as a result of heart failure are projected to increase considerably over the next two decades. A robust restructuring of existing heart failure treatment models in the UK is needed to enable an integrated seamless transition of care across the community, primary care and hospital networks. This has to be achieved with the patient as a partner in health care as a part of a multidisciplinary approach. This uses innovative strategies such as ambulatory treatment (including intravenous diuretics, remote and telemonitoring) as well as shifting heart failure treatment to the community and to patients' homes. This article analyses the existing evidence for ambulatory management of acute decompensated heart failure and looks at future strategies for restructuring care.","848":"","849":"","850":"","851":"","852":"","853":"Work-life balance is directly linked to morale, job satisfaction and staff retention - all of which are linked to high quality patient care. Receiving the duty roster in advance is the first step towards achieving any work-life balance, but anecdotally doctors frequently receive very little notice of this. This audit assessed NHS trusts' compliance with the Code of Practice, with specific reference to advance notification of duty rosters. The duty roster should be made available 6 weeks before commencement of post. The initial audit comprised a survey sent to all London surgical CT1s starting in October 2016. The interventions introduced following this were creation of a shared spreadsheet containing roster coordinator contact details, reminder emails sent to roster coordinators and distribution of results to NHS Improvement. A repeat survey was sent to all London surgical CT1s and CT2s starting in October 2017. In the initial audit 48\/88 (55%) responded, of whom 4\/48 (8%) received their duty roster in accordance with the standard and 9\/48 (19%) did not receive the roster at all before starting. A total of 40\/48 (83%) of trainees had to make specific contact with their future NHS trust in order to obtain their roster. In this initial audit 12\/48 (25%) of trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the amount of notice given. In the reaudit 133\/178 (75%) responded, of whom 23\/133 (17%) had received their roster in accordance with the standard and 25\/133 (19%) did not receive the roster at all before starting. A total of 97\/133 (73%) of trainees had to make specific contact with their future NHS trust in order to obtain their roster. In the reaudit 56\/133 (42%) of trainees were satisfied or very satisfied with the amount of notice given. This closed loop audit led to a doubling in the proportion of trainees receiving their rosters in accordance with the standard, and this was associated with an increase in trainee satisfaction levels. However, adherence to the standard remained low in both phases of the audit, and a significant proportion of trainees continue to commence jobs without any knowledge of their on-call roster. A range of measures is proposed to address this.

Artificial intelligence shows promise in promoting practice efficiency, personalizing patient care, improving institutional research capacity, and expanding high quality orthopaedic care to lower resource settings. Physicians should be involved in the development of artificial intelligence algorithms to ensure that patients derive maximum benefit from new advances while considering the ethical challenges of implementation.","861":"","862":"","863":"The treatment of inflammatory bowel disease has changed dramatically over the last two decades. The arrival of infliximab as the first biological medicine for inflammatory bowel disease revolutionized its management. Since then the armamentarium of biological medicines for inflammatory bowel disease has grown to five drugs in three different classes. This article highlights the different mechanisms of action and describes the key evidence for their use including drug safety profiles. Furthermore it highlights the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommendations for biological therapy in inflammatory bowel disease and discusses pending changes to the classic treatment algorithms in light of emerging evidence.","864":"","865":"","866":"Feedback from patients about the care they have received is an integral part of quality in health care.

The effects of patient feedback on clinicians' performance are mixed. The reviewed studies either reported no effects, small non-statistically significant improvements or few statistically significant changes in clinical practice. More policy-level actions and effective organizational leadership are required for the goal of incorporating patient feedback in quality improvement to promote patient centredness in care delivery to be fully realized.","867":"","868":"Liver disease is a major cause of mortality both globally and in the UK. The earlier liver fibrosis is detected, the sooner interventions can be implemented, including lifestyle changes and medications. Non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis are beginning to augment and replace liver biopsy in assessment of liver fibrosis because of their ease of use, lack of complications and reproducibility. The enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test is a blood test that measures three molecules involved in liver matrix metabolism to give a score reflecting the severity of liver fibrosis. This article reviews the evidence supporting ELF as a diagnostic test, a prognostic marker and its use in disease monitoring. In doing so it highlights the important role ELF plays in the early recognition of liver fibrosis facilitating timely referral to a liver specialist. The ELF test is useful in primary, secondary and tertiary care, not only allowing earlier diagnosis and more accurate prognosis, but also providing the opportunity to personalize treatment based on the patient's response.","869":"Recent advances in smartphone technology have revealed new opportunities for the diagnosis, monitoring and provision of mental health care. Such digital approaches have the potential to enhance our understanding of the course of mental disorder, enable early diagnosis and generate new treatment targets. However, issues relating to mobile phone ownership, misuse of clinical data, commercial devices and the ethics of such approaches need to be overcome if smartphones are to be routinely used in mental health care. This article reviews the potential as well as the challenges posed by the use of such technologies in mental health settings.","870":"This article reviews currently available appropriate technologies which have been used in mental health, in order to reduce confusion and delay. Confusion (for example when and where to refer) can lead to error and waste. Similarly delay impacts quality and accessibility of the whole range of mental health services. As most secondary care mental health services use electronic patient records, it is arguably easier to apply technology in this speciality. However, consideration needs to be given to confidentiality and data security. Doctors of all specialities will be exposed to 'new' technologies over the next decade, and need to be aware of the direction of travel and its implications.","871":"","872":"The delivery of oxygen is a key component of anaesthetic practice. High flow nasal oxygen therapy is a relatively new addition to more traditional means of oxygenation which provides heated and humidified flows of controlled oxygen\/air mixes achieving rates of up to 120 litres\/min. The physiological benefits include nasopharyngeal dead space washout, reduced work of breathing, alveolar recruitment, maintained mucociliary function and the ability to provide apnoeic oxygenation. This article considers the current evidence for high flow nasal oxygen therapy in perioperative anaesthetic care during pre-oxygenation and intubation, management of the difficult airway, oxygenation for shared airway surgery, extubation and postoperative support, obstetric and paediatric anaesthesia.","873":"","874":"","875":"","876":"The new junior doctor contract allows trainees to exception report when they breach safe working hours. After a full year of foundation year 1 rotations, analysis from a large NHS trust in London showed that exception reporting works to highlight rota and working issues. It is unsurprising that trainees are busy but simple things such as competent infrastructure and senior support could go a long way to improving working conditions. In addition, results from a local survey suggest that trainees think the new contract is less safe for both doctors and patients, with inflexibility of rota patterns having a significant impact on the ability to take annual and study leave. A drive to modernise the way health care is delivered in hospitals is needed as a shortage of doctors will only worsen the situation.","877":"","878":"","879":"","880":"Stress-induced hyperglycaemia is an important clinical entity. It is an adaptive immune-neurohormonal response to physiological stress in an attempt to increase metabolic substrates to struggling organs during a time of crisis. However, this acute hyperglycaemia is also responsible for a number of detrimental effects implying that treatment is necessary. Hence, admission hyperglycaemia is not necessarily equivalent to a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus but the blood glucose level needs to be interpreted in context of the patient's presenting complaint and previous glycaemic status. Stress-induced hyperglycaemia is associated with increased morbidity and short-term mortality. Thus prompt recognition of stress-induced hyperglycaemia and high risk hyperglycaemic patients with the stress hyperglycaemia ratio can help improve inpatient management. Patients with stress-induced hyperglycaemia who have recovered from their acute illness should be followed up as they remain at risk for incident diabetes. This review focuses on the definition, pathophysiology, targets, management and significance of stress-induced hyperglycaemia.","881":"The prevalence of obesity in the UK is increasing. Airway management in the obese patient can be challenging. Face mask ventilation is frequently difficult, and while the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy is only marginally raised, the consequences of failed intubation and the rate at which the obese patient desaturates makes this an unforgiving population. Emergence from anaesthesia requires particular care and attention. This article addresses the problems of airway management in the obese patient and looks at measures which can be taken to overcome them.","882":"","883":"Antibiotic prophylaxis is crucial in head and neck surgery to prevent infection from clean contaminated wounds. Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidance, the gold standard of practice, recommends that administration of broad spectrum antibiotics is discontinued after 24 hours post-operation. A three-audit cycle quality improvement project was conducted to assess clinical practice against SIGN guidance at a large London teaching hospital. Three change initiatives were implemented to improve antibiotic stewardship. First, an update of Trust guidelines with an associated poster campaign to educate staff and improve awareness. Second, introduction of a specific 'prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery' bundle on the electronic hospital-wide prescribing system. Third, an update to an antibiotic prescribing guide (Microguide). Over a 3-year study period the number of patients receiving antibiotics beyond 24 hours declined significantly (88% in 2015, 76% in 2016, 25% in 2018), demonstrating improved compliance with SIGN guidelines overall. Despite this, staff documentation of indications for extended antibiotic use remains suboptimal (58% in 2016 and 44% in 2018) as does the number of specimens sent for microbiological analysis (52% in 2016 and 0% in 2018). Appropriate prophylactic antibiotic prescribing can improve morbidity and mortality rates in head and neck cancer patients. Three change initiatives have been demonstrated which can help to improve prescribing compliance in line with SIGN guidance. Ongoing auditing is required to maintain the longevity of improvements made and encourage staff documentation of indications for extended antibiotic use and microbiology specimen analysis.

The National Audit Office estimates that there are at least 20 000 major trauma cases in England every year, resulting in 5400 deaths and leaving many others with serious permanent disability. Because the incidence of trauma is particularly high in younger patients, an average of 36 life years is lost for every trauma death ( Chaira and Cimbanassi, 2003 ). The landscape in major trauma imaging has evolved over the last 30 years, and this review chronicles these changes and the reasons for them, and looks at how the current guidelines have been formulated.","896":"","897":"Evaluation of people returning from trips abroad with fever is an important skill for all general physicians given the increasing trend in foreign travel. This evaluation should comprise a detailed travel history, thorough clinical examination, appropriate initial tests and a knowledge of when to ask for further advice.

They were first introduced by Light and Pillemer in 1984 . In scientific literature, funnel plots are used to identify the probability of bias in meta-analyses and compare institutional performance. The ability to identify variation is better with graphical than tabular display. In addition, the way data are presented can directly influence the interpretation of results. This was demonstrated by Marshall et al (2004) , who presented institutional mortality data in both a league table and control chart format. This study illustrated that when displayed as a league table, a greater number of units were identified for investigation than were actually required. The use of control charts or funnel plots may therefore show benefit in reducing the number of inappropriately labelled outliers. This article explains how clinicians should read and interpret funnel plots, and discusses their considerations and limitations.","905":"This article explains the approach to managing a patient with herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Acute encephalopathy is a common and often intimidating presentation in an acute general medical setting. Application of key principles will enable the generalist to take life-saving action before obtaining any specialist input. Viral infection is the most common cause (48.2%) of encephalitis; another large group is cases of autoimmune aetiology. Early diagnosis of encephalitis is crucial to ensure that the right treatment is given on time. Guidelines on the management of viral encephalitis were published by the British Association of Neurologists and British Infection Association ( Solomon et al, 2012 ), but adherence to these standards by clinicians has been found to be suboptimal ( Han and Coebergh, 2017 ). This puts lives in danger, in the context of a treatable, serious, acute presentation. Although viral infection is the most common cause of encephalitis, an awareness of rarer forms of autoimmune encephalitis is necessary. The differential diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis is important because the disease is potentially treatable with immunosuppressive agents. Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis may present months or years before the detection of a tumour.","906":"","907":"The maternal population in the UK has become an increasingly challenging group of patients to manage. Women with pre-existing and often complex medical conditions are successfully conceiving. Most physicians will have had some involvement in the care of obstetric patients admitted with medical problems, and a lack of experience and fear of causing harm may result in essential investigations and treatment being withheld. The physiological changes in pregnancy can complicate the interpretation of observations and test results. This article discusses the presentation of commonly encountered medical problems in the obstetric population, including breathlessness, chest pain, palpitations, seizure and headache. It covers specific investigations and suggested treatment in this subset of patients. These women should receive the same level of care and attention as those who are not pregnant.

At the James Paget University Hospital point-of-care testing was used as an enabler within an evidence-based lean service redesign to successfully set up a novel unit. A 3-month pilot period, with limited operational times, showed a dramatic improvement in patient flow through the acute medicine pathway, with an equivalent of 59 bed days saved during the pilot period. Further expansion of the unit to a dedicated area with full 7-day opening allowed a continued improvement in performance. This resulted in a mean length of stay of 115 minutes (a 54% reduction from pre-baseline), and just 6.1% of an average of 18.1 daily attendances were converted to full admission. This demonstrated a clinical, operational and financial benefit, allowing improved clinical outcomes.","926":"","927":"","928":"","929":"Developing a consistent and skilled workforce is critical to the sustainability of any clinical service. Nurses and paramedics have formed part of the emergency care workforce for many years and the extended role of these staff groups has supported patient care as the demand has risen and outstripped the capacity of the medical staff. In many hospitals and health-care systems, these extended roles have developed in response to local demand and case mix, resulting in inconsistent role descriptions and lack of transportable qualifications. Even for established roles such as emergency nurse practitioners, there is no UK-wide defined scope of practice or curriculum to support the role. In 2014 a joint working group of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine and Health Education England agreed a programme of work to support a sustainable emergency care workforce. One stream of that work focused on developing non-medical roles within emergency care and in particular the role of the advanced clinical practitioner in emergency medicine. Advanced practice has developed in the UK in many specialties and the new advanced practice framework from Health Education England (2017) allows a cross-discipline understanding of the principles and key aspects of advanced practice. However, this framework is naturally generic and does not focus on what a practitioner is capable of within a specific clinical area, but more on the core capabilities. This article outlines the development of a UK-wide curriculum and credentialing process for emergency care advanced clinical practitioners and reports on progress to date.","930":"Our emergency departments have never been under so much pressure.

Unfortunately, many standards of care are never tested, but instead are often promoted based on pathophysiological explanations or simply being long-established practices. Much of medical practice is based on dogma: a set of principles laid down by authority as incontrovertibly true. This article evaluates four commonly taught dogmatic practices in emergency medicine to determine if they are supported by the medical literature or are instead myths and misconceptions: (1) topical anaesthetics inhibit corneal healing, (2) treatment of myocardial infarction is MONA (morphine, oxygen, nitrates, aspirin), (3) children do not get sprains because their ligaments are stronger than bone, and (4) vagal manoeuvres for supraventricular tachycardia never work in adults. Medicine is changing all the time, and the best way to ensure that one is practicing medicine that is accurate, up to date and not prone to being reversed is to always be sceptical and to learn how to read and interpret the medical literature.","936":"This article reviews the history of clinical audit and appraises its effectiveness.

The aims of treatment and management of primary biliary cholangitis are the amelioration of associated symptoms, particularly pruritis and fatigue, and the prevention of end-stage liver disease. The presentation, natural history and clinical course are variable. Recent published European and UK clinical guidelines have emphasized the need for risk stratification and an individualized approach to patient management in primary biliary cholangitis. The bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, is established as the first-line treatment of primary biliary cholangitis. Assessment of clinical response to treatment is based on specified improvements in serum liver tests including near normalization of the serum alkaline phosphatase level at 1 year. At least two thirds of patients with primary biliary cholangitis should respond to ursodeoxycholic acid after 1 year's treatment. The correct dosage of ursodeoxycholic acid is determined by body weight viz 13-15 mg\/kg\/day. A significant number of patients with primary biliary cholangitis in the UK are being underdosed. Over a third of ursodeoxycholic acid partial responders become responders within 2 years after increasing the ursodeoxycholic acid doses to recommended levels. While transplant rates for primary biliary cholangitis have halved over the last 20 years, it is clear that optimizing the dose of ursodeoxycholic acid in partial responders would further decrease morbidity, mortality and the need for liver transplantation.","939":"","940":"","941":"Chronic kidney disease is a global health problem that affects over 10% of adults worldwide. All doctors should have a basic knowledge of chronic kidney disease because it may complicate the management of many other medical conditions and is associated with numerous adverse outcomes. Chronic kidney disease should be regarded as a clinical syndrome rather than a specific diagnosis and attempts should always be made to identify the cause. Simple risk prediction tools have been developed to inform management decisions. Management is directed at slowing progression of chronic kidney disease and reducing the associated cardiovascular risk by treating hypertension, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers as first-line therapy in high-risk cases, treatment with statins and lifestyle measures. Patients at high risk of rapid progression or requiring specific therapy as well as those with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 should be referred to a nephrology service.","942":"The two main categories of pain, nociceptive and neuropathic, are caused by tissue damage and nerve damage respectively.

It was developed for patients recovering from acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and sometimes other long-term inflammatory lung diseases. Many other conditions have a chronic inflammatory component, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoarthritis and old age. Such background inflammation is linked to a range of adverse outcomes, including all-cause mortality, sarcopenia and other markers of frailty. Exercise, including pulmonary rehabilitation, has an anti-inflammatory effect on innate immune chemistry, and improves outcomes in a variety of conditions, although for most diagnostic groups there is no consistent structured programme similar to pulmonary rehabilitation. The authors contend that the pulmonary rehabilitation model could be used generically to treat other chronic and post-acute inflammatory states and thereby reduce the risk of frailty and other adverse outcomes.","952":null,"953":"This article discusses options for closing the mortality gap between the general population and people with major psychiatric conditions such as psychosis, autism, learning disability and dementia.

In particular, it may not be the case with self-directed learning. The cost of self-directed learning can be divided up into cost categories just like any other form of learning. As such, it will be made up of faculty cost, learner costs, infrastructure and facility costs, content costs and technology costs. However, in postgraduate education, these costs are largely the same as those that account for clinical care, as postgraduate learners learn as they work.

Specific immunotherapies known as checkpoint inhibitors are now routinely used in a range of cancers including melanoma, lung, renal and urological cancers. Immunotherapies are associated with immune-related adverse events which are very different to those seen with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies. This can present a new challenge to oncologists, acute physicians and the wider team of health-care professionals who look after patients receiving immunotherapy. Generally, these side effects are easily managed but some, if untreated, can be subtle and potentially life-threatening. Patients on immunotherapy may present to a wide variety of medical professionals including the emergency department, primary care and general medical admissions units. It is therefore vital that there is increased awareness and education to identify and manage side effects of immunotherapy effectively.","972":"In 2008, recommendations from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death identified large variations in the quality and safety of delivery of systemic anti-cancer therapy.

Every hospital with an emergency department and\/or specialist oncology beds should therefore have a fully functioning acute oncology service to align acute oncology with urgent care. Many patients will still present via the acute take and therefore acute physicians need to be aware of the role of the acute oncology teams and management of oncology emergencies.

Although national health-care budgets have increased (as a percentage of gross domestic product) health care continues to impart significant upward pressure on national expenditure, particularly in the UK ( Licchetta and Stelmach, 2016 ). Additionally a substantial funding gap will continue to grow ( Gainsbury, 2016 ). In response to this challenge a 'value' based strategy has gained momentum over the last two decades. Several pioneers of this approach (Sir Muir Gray at Oxford University, Professor Michael Porter at Harvard University and Professor Elizabeth Teisberg at Dell Medical School) emphasize the importance of organizations focusing on 'value'. Porter and Teisberg (2006) highlight the 'value equation' as obtaining the very best patient outcomes for each unit of currency spent. Gray expands on this model, describing three types of value: allocative, technical and personal ( Gray, 2011 ). Although some global health-care organizations have embraced the value-based agenda to transform acute care facilities, mental health providers have been slow to consider the benefits of this approach.

The English health-care-associated infection quality indicator system was one of the earliest in the world to mandate the collection and public reporting of such data and has been associated with a reduction of MRSA bacteraemias and Clostridium difficile infections but has shown mixed results for other infections. Diagnostic laboratory data vary greatly between hospitals depending not only on the underlying frequency of the infection of interest, but on the case mix, numbers of samples processed and laboratory factors, which limits benchmarking. Further, over-reliance on laboratory reports has led to unintended negative consequences in England. So, while acknowledging the successes of the English system, the authors believe that it should be appraised in light of the goals of quality of care, patient safety, fairness and providing meaningful data, and alternative healthcare-associated infection quality indicator measurements considered.","990":"The Five Year Forward View ( NHS England, 2014 ) endorses outcomes-based approaches and integrated care systems.

Delivering 'value' does not mean any reduction in the quality of care - it means achieving the same or higher quality at the same or lower cost. Avoidable and costly incidents in surgery occur every day: patients do not receive the right care, procedures or tests are performed without real benefit, complications lead to prolonged hospital stays, to readmissions and re-interventions. Put simply: poor quality surgical care is expensive. The concept of value-based health care is well known in the UK, yet its principles are not yet fully embedded in the health-care system, surgical training or practice. The shift towards better value-based care with a focus on delivery system reform (Getting It Right First Time), outcomes-based commissioning and payment reform (accountable care systems and integrated care systems) provides an opportunity to make significant improvements in surgical care.

For bisphosphonates, current guidance suggests an initial treatment course of 3-5 years and more prolonged treatment should be pursued in patients with higher fracture risk. For patients with lower risk, a period off treatment might be considered after this initial course to minimize the risks associated with more prolonged treatment, but this only applies to bisphosphonates and not denosumab or teriparatide.

Consenting in this setting is suboptimal with the Montgomery court ruling changing the perspective of consent. This quality improvement project assessed the adequacy of consenting against British Orthopaedic Association-endorsed guidance and implemented a series of changes to improve the documentation of risks associated with surgery for fractured neck of femur. Methods Seventy consecutive patients who underwent any operative fixation of a neck of femur fracture were included over a 6-month period at a single centre. Patients unable to consent or without electronic notes were excluded. Consent forms were analysed and the documented potential risks or complications associated with surgery were compared to British Orthopaedic Association-endorsed guidance. A series of changes (using the plan, do study, act (PDSA) approach) was implemented to improve the adequacy of consent. Results Documentation of four out of 12 potential risks or complications was recorded in &lt;50% of cases for patients with intracapsular fractures (n=35), and documentation of seven out of 12 potential risks or complications was recorded in &lt;50% of cases for patients with extracapsular fractures (n=35). Re-audit following raising awareness and attaching consent guidance showed 100% documentation of potential risks or complications in patients with intracapsular and extracapsular fractures (n=70). A neck of femur fracture-specific consent form has been implemented which will hopefully lead to sustained improvement. Conclusions Consenting patients with fractured neck of femur for surgery in the authors' unit was suboptimal when compared to British Orthopaedic Association-endorsed consent guidance. This project has shown that ensuring such guidance is readily available has improved the adequacy of consent.

These include a greater risk of falls, fractures and institutionalization, and significant socioeconomic costs. With our ageing population, osteosarcopenia is a public health concern that will become increasingly relevant in the future. Its aetiology is multifactorial, with mechanical, biochemical, genetic and lifestyle factors all contributing to involution of the 'bone-muscle unit'.

A total of 200 records of patients with fractured neck of femur were reviewed with data collected retrospectively and prospectively following the introduction of the daily consultant-led ward round. Readmissions were classed as patients who spent a period of time admitted to hospital. Those who only attended an emergency unit were not included. Reasons for readmission and length of readmission were reviewed as were the initial and total length of stay. The authors also evaluated the length of stay in trauma patients (non-hip fracture emergency admissions) for a period of 6 months before and 4 months after the new working model was introduced. With the new working pattern, there was a reduction in the length of stay in those readmitted (13 vs 8 days), and the total length of stay of readmitted patients was also considerably lower (23 vs 13 days).

It is vital to provide nutrition that will maximally support brain growth and development, but over-feeding with accelerated growth, fat accumulation and long-term metabolic consequences should also be avoided. Because the morbidity associated with prematurity increases nutritional and energetic demands, the basic approach is of providing early intensive nutrition. Protein is the main driving force for growth and brain development. Since deficits in protein occur from the first day of extra-uterine life, sufficient quantities of parenteral amino acids should be provided from the first hours of life. With protein and carbohydrates, enough energy should also be provided, via concomitant early administration of intravenous lipid emulsions.

Jaundice in an otherwise healthy term infant is the most common reason for readmission to hospital. Jaundice is caused by an increase in serum bilirubin levels, largely as a result of breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin is conveyed in the blood as 'unconjugated' bilirubin, largely bound to albumin. The liver converts bilirubin into a conjugated form which is excreted in the bile. Very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin are neurotoxic. Phototherapy is a simple and effective way to reduce the bilirubin level. Most term babies have 'physiological' jaundice which responds to a short period of phototherapy, and requires no other treatment. A few babies have rapidly rising bilirubin levels which place them at risk of kernicterus. Current management of jaundice in the UK is guided by the NICE guideline. Any infant with high serum bilirubin or a rapidly rising bilirubin level needs to be treated urgently to avoid neurotoxicity. High levels of conjugated bilirubin in a term baby can indicate biliary atresia, and babies with persisting jaundice must have their level of conjugated bilirubin measured. Preterm infants on long-term parenteral nutrition may develop conjugated jaundice which generally improves with the introduction of enteral feed and weaning of intravenous nutrition.","1111":"","1112":"Hoarseness or dysphonia are terms used to describe a change in the quality of the voice. The voice quality can be raspy, breathy, strained, fatigued, rough, tremulous or weak. There may be a change in pitch, restriction of range, voice breaks, decreased projection, or abnormal resonance. It is important to remember that a voice disorder is not a disease in itself but rather a presentation of an underlying pathology. Clinicians' knowledge of paediatric hoarseness is limited as it can be difficult to examine children using fibreoptic laryngoscopy and the child may not comprehend the need for detailed examination. However, paediatric flexible naso-laryngoscopy provides a dynamic view of the laryngeal anatomy and function.

A total of 139 applications were reviewed. The median age of applicants was 35 years; 81% were UK based, with the remainder from a worldwide distribution. Seventeen per cent were consultant anaesthetists and 64% anaesthetic trainees, with the remainder including doctors from other specialties (17%) and nurses (2%). Qualitative analysis using grounded theory methodology revealed common motivational themes: the belief that perioperative medicine would lead to better patient care, that it represents the future working practice for anaesthetists, a desire to be able to better lead local developments, and personal fulfilment and benefit. The responses provided insight into the motivation of an international cohort of professionals. Perioperative medicine was perceived as a developing multidisciplinary specialty that will lead to better patient care.

The discovery of the activating mutations affecting thrombopoiesis led to greater understanding of the pathobiology of essential thrombocythaemia and other myeloproliferative neoplasms. The investigation of suspected primary thrombocytosis has evolved to include testing for these disease-associated mutations. Therapy for patients with essential thrombocythaemia aims to reduce their risk of thrombotic complications by addressing cardiovascular risk factors, and using antiplatelet agents and, in selected patients, cytoreductive therapy.

The presence of certain comorbidities (such as congestive cardiac failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, but could mimic the clinical features of pulmonary embolism. In addition, the physiological processes associated with ageing and factors such as immobility and malignancy, which are more common in older people, will further increase the thrombotic risk.

Prolonged suspension, children who are pulseless at first contact by the emergency paramedic responder, and patients with prolonged periods of remaining in asystole before return of spontaneous circulation after starting cardiopulmonary resuscitation are unlikely to have intact neurological survival. Management in the hospital includes early airway protection by intubation, maintenance of normal oxygen saturation, normothermia, active control of clinical and sub-clinical seizures, and strict electrolyte and glucose regulation.

Sustainability and transformation plans represent a shift in the way health care is planned for in England. The aim of each sustainability and transformation plan is to deliver care within existing resource limits by improving quality of care, developing new models of care and improving efficiency of care provision. The tight timescales for production of sustainability and transformation plans mean that in most cases there has been limited clinical engagement; as a result many clinicians have limited sight, understanding or ownership of the proposals within sustainability and transformation plans. As sustainability and transformation plans move into the implementation phase, this article explores the role of the clinician in the ongoing design and delivery of the local sustainability and transformation plans. By finding the common ground between the perspectives of the clinician, the commissioner and system leaders, the motivation of clinicians can be aligned with the ambitions of the sustainability and transformation plan.

Despite the advent of electronic medical record systems such as Connecting Care and EMIS, the telephone remains the mainstay of communication. Methods A prospective cross-sectional quality improvement project was conducted to assess the time taken in telephone communication between primary and secondary care doctors and determine if access to the electronic shared system, Connecting Care, would improve efficiency. As part of normal junior doctor activity, fifty GPs were contacted between September 2015 and February 2016 to obtain medical data on patients admitted to UH Bristol. Time taken to contact each GP and the duration of the conversation was recorded. One hundred patient records were accessed using Connecting Care between October 2015 and February 2016 and the length of time taken to access information documented. Results Out of 50 phone calls 27 resulted in direct transfer to a GP with time to transfer ranging from 12 seconds to 19 minutes 51 seconds (mean 8 minutes 10 seconds, median 7 minutes 16 seconds). A total of 28 messages were left with the receptionist with 16\/28 phone calls being returned and time taken for the call to be returned ranged from 34 minutes to 21 hours 3 minutes (mean 5 hours 50 minutes 4 seconds, median 4 hours). Information was available for 88\/100 patient records accessed using Connecting Care with a mean duration to access information required of 1 minute 47 seconds. This was significantly shorter than the mean duration of conversation with GPs (4 minutes 22 seconds), mean total duration of telephone call and mean total duration of time to achieve aim of call with GP practices of 13 minutes 18 seconds and 2 hours 14 minutes 11 seconds respectively. Conclusions This study identifies areas of potential improvement in current methods of communication between primary and secondary care. Direct telephone contact will always have an important role in sharing information. However, access for secondary care doctors to electronic patient records, with patient consent and consideration for confidentiality, would improve efficiency and alleviate time pressures on both busy primary and secondary care doctors.

Although no current treatment exists to reverse the damage caused, these pathways can be targeted by agents that are being trialled for use in post-exposure treatment and prevention, with conflicting results. Other preventative strategies are important in addressing damaging hearing behaviours, including 'safe listening' promotion with advocacy materials for young adults, and promoting safe listening devices.","1264":"","1265":"","1266":"","1267":"","1268":"With increasing demand for organ transplantation and patients deteriorating or dying on the waiting list, organs are now being increasingly used from donors previously considered too marginal.

This study audited the quality and completeness of documentation in surgical operation notes at a single district general hospital against the Royal College of Surgeons (2014) Good Surgical Practice guidelines, and looked to improve clinical practice through improved compliance with these guidelines. A total of 101 operation notes were audited from a variety of surgical specialities in November 2014 (cycle 1) and 100 notes in May 2015 (cycle 2). Documentation was audited against 19 standards found in the Royal College of Surgeons guidelines. The results were presented at the trust clinical governance meeting. Interventions included clinician education, aide memoires in theatres and the introduction of a new operation note. Six of the 19 standards had &gt;90% compliance in cycle 1 and 12 out of 19 in cycle 2. There were dramatic improvements in documentation in many fields including time (4% to 60%, P&lt;0.0001), elective or emergency procedure (1% to 83%, P&lt;0.0001), problems or complications (67% to 100%, P=0.016), estimated blood loss (2% to 73%, P&lt;0.0001), antibiotic prophylaxis (47% to 96%, P&lt;0.0001), venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (43% to 83%, P&lt;0.0001) and signature (78% to 97%, P&lt;0.0001).

Handover in this setting poses unique challenges, yet few studies have considered or tested approaches to improve the process. A quality improvement project was undertaken to assess and improve the quality of information transfer during the handover of postoperative patients to the general intensive care unit at a tertiary centre. This quality improvement project considered all postoperative patients aged 18 years and over, using the plan-do-study-act (PDSA) approach, over a 3-month period in 2015. Baseline audit encompassing intraoperative details (allergies, grade of intubation, estimated blood loss, difficulties and complications) and the postoperative plan (analgesia, thromboprophylaxis, antibiotics and their proposed duration and nutrition) was undertaken to define the extent of the clinical problem. Changes were implemented over two cycles, centred around a novel checklist, and the transfer of information was re-audited after each cycle. Baseline audit (n=30) revealed a need for improvement across all domains. In PDSA cycle 1, a novel checklist was introduced which led to global improvement across all areas with performance exceeding 70% in all but three out of nine domains (n=33). Engaging key stakeholders (PDSA cycle 2) resulted in overall improvement from baseline but decreased performance in just under half of domains in comparison to PDSA cycle 1 (n=31). Successful implementation of a series of simple interventions resulted in more effective handover of postoperative patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Sustained long-term improvement is a major challenge and can only be achieved with the global engagement of all staff and incorporation of changes into routine clinical practice. ","1340":"In the UK, denosumab is usually started by hospital clinicians and continued by primary care physicians in the community, but in the authors' region denosumab is a 'green light' drug, only prescribed by the primary care team. The authors suspected that a proportion of patients who were recommended to start the drug after a neck of femur fracture were not receiving this on discharge. They aimed to improve the prescribing of denosumab by implementing a quality improvement project. A retrospective review of electronic records and case notes in primary and secondary care was undertaken, focusing on patients who were admitted with a neck of femur fracture and recommended denosumab. Following cycle 1 of the project two interventions were implemented: Denosumab written on the inpatient prescription chart at point of treatment decision, promoting inclusion in the discharge summary A consultant letter recommending denosumab was sent separately to primary care, in addition to inclusion in the discharge summary. Following these interventions this project cycle was repeated. A total of 91 patients with a neck of femur fracture were identified during cycle 1 and 22\/91 (24%) were recommended denosumab. However, only five of these 22 patients (22%) received the drug. Following the interventions 23\/26 eligible patients (88%) were prescribed denosumab (three patients did not have a prescription with no reason given), and 17\/23 (74%) had the injection given. Four patients who did not receive the denosumab injection had no obvious reason for not starting treatment. In the other two patients, one discharge summary misleadingly stated that the injection had been given as an inpatient and one patient had recurrent admissions following discharge after their neck of femur fracture so primary care had not had any opportunity to administer the injection. Prescribing denosumab on the inpatient drug chart and highlighting its use in a consultant-written letter to the primary care team improved prescribing and administering of denosumab in the community.

Advances in information technology have led to an increased use of electronic systems within modern health care. This quality improvement project introduced an electronic patient handover system that was intended to improve the accuracy of patient handover lists and be readily available to all members of the health-care team. A quality improvement project was undertaken to assess the effect of introducing an electronic patient handover system on maintenance workload and list accuracy. List errors were common before the introduction of the electronic patient handover system, commonly patient location or a patient being incorrectly omitted from the list. These errors decreased significantly after the introduction of the electronic system (P&lt;0.005 and 0.04 respectively). The workload associated with its maintenance also decreased (P&lt;0.005) because many data fields were pre-populated by the software. This resulted in fewer instances of patients being missed on ward rounds (P&lt;0.04). Through modifying existing information technology infrastructure, a centrally maintained, widely accessible electronic handover system was introduced. This reduced the workload associated with maintaining handover lists and the rate of errors.

To assess this pathway, the authors conducted a prospective audit of general surgical referrals to a district general hospital in the UK. During the inclusion period 746 emergency referrals were assessed, 281 (37%) of these underwent an operation. Over a 5-month investigation period, the audit found that approximately 27% of all emergency general surgery patients requiring an operation could be managed with day case emergency surgery. This figure was maintained throughout the duration of the study. Operations included incision and drainage of abscesses, incarcerated hernia repairs and appendicectomies. The average length of stay of all surgical admissions decreased from 5 days to less than 3 days and the median time to senior review was 30 minutes. The authors have developed a pathway involving permanent members of the surgical assessment team that is sustainable over a 5-month period. The pathway has allowed rapid assessment of patients and reduced unnecessary inpatient stay in a sustainable and reproducible manner.

This study aimed to determine the accuracy of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for comorbidities and to establish whether better documentation in admission clerking proforma can improve the accuracy of codes for comorbidities in general surgical patients. A clinical audit was conducted to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of HES codes for comorbidities in general surgical patients before and after implementing better documentation in admission clerking proforma. The following comorbidities were included: hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and hypercholesterolaemia. Medical notes were used as reference standard and a target standard of 98% was determined for the above measures. Overall, on the initial audit, HES codes had substandard accuracy (90.5%, kappa = 0.599), sensitivity (47.71%, 95% confidence interval 38.05-57.49%) and negative predictive value (89.60%, 95% confidence interval 86.73-92.03%). HES codes for comorbidities were 100% specific with positive predictive value of 100%. Implementing better documentation in the admission clerking proforma improved the accuracy (99.67%, kappa = 0.985), sensitivity (97.4%, 95% confidence interval 90.93-99.68%) and negative predictive value (99.62%, 95% confidence interval 98.63-99.95%) significantly from the baseline (P&lt;0.0001). Although HES codes can confidently predict the actual presence of the comorbidities, they have substandard accuracy and ability to rule out the presence of the comorbidities.

In the London borough of Waltham Forest in 2010, late HIV diagnoses were resulting in high morbidity with associated lengthy and costly hospital admissions. A retrospective analysis of all new HIV diagnoses was undertaken within a two-phased quality improvement project 2010-13. Newly diagnosed patients in 2010 were characterized, including immunological state, presence of HIV-related illness and department where they presented. After an intervention to set up an opt-out, walk-in rapid HIV testing service in outpatients, an analysis was conducted of numbers of tests, prevalence and immunological state of newly diagnosed patients in 2013. A total of 91 patients were diagnosed with HIV, January-December 2010, 70% of which were a late diagnosis, including 48% defined as 'very immunosuppressed' (CD4 count&lt;100 cells\/ml). Of these, 51 out of 91 patients (56%) had attended hospital services in the 5 years before diagnosis, including 204 outpatient department attendances. After the intervention, rates of late diagnosis in 2013 had reduced to 46%, and rates of those diagnosed 'very immunosuppressed' had reduced from 48% to 8%. HIV testing in outpatients is feasible and acceptable to patients and can be offered alongside routine outpatient care.

The authors' hospital has introduced electronic prescribing in an attempt to reduce these errors. A prospective quality improvement project was performed to assess both the impact of this change on prescribing errors and to see if there was a learning curve associated with prescribers using the new system. A simple prescribing task was created in which study participants were asked to prescribe a set list of medications for a fictional patient. The participants were timed first using paper drug cards, and then using the prescribing function on iSOFT's iClinical Manager. The prescriptions were also assessed for legibility and errors. This was done within 1 week of the participants starting in the department, and then 2 and 4 months later. A total of 25 junior doctors completed the task. No participant had prior experience of electronic prescribing in a clinical setting. During week one, the task took a longer average time to complete using electronic prescribing compared to paper (323 seconds vs 290 seconds, P&lt;0.01). After 2 months the mean time to complete the task was shorter with electronic prescribing compared to paper (261 seconds vs 306 seconds, P&lt;0.01). There was therefore a significant mean reduction in the time taken to complete the task using electronic prescribing of 62 seconds (P=0.01). There were fewer illegible entries or drug errors using electronic prescribing compared to paper prescribing (2.7% vs 5.3%, P=0.68). Electronic prescribing appears to reduce prescribing errors. However, there is a learning curve for new doctors using electronic prescribing. Training and support is vital during this period in order to reduce prescribing errors.

Fifty consecutive sets of handwritten trauma operative notes were reviewed prospectively. A standardized printed proforma was introduced and then another 50 consecutive sets of notes were reviewed. The results were analysed using the Student t-test to obtain two-tailed P values comparing the mean difference between percentages of missing data for both cycles. Out of 24 parameters examined, 19 showed improvement after introducing the standardized proforma in trauma surgical notes. There was an overall significant improvement in the studied parameters (P= 0.0134), with a mean difference of 19.3% of missing data for both cycles. These results suggest that a standardized prestructured operative note proforma in trauma surgery is a useful tool in recording the operative data, thus helping to improve the medical care provided.

This study assessed the impact of introducing a consultant-supported rapid assessment model, known as EDIT, and point of care testing upon the length of time patients spend in the emergency department. A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in an emergency department in a district general hospital in the UK. The study consisted of two phases. Patients who attended the emergency department during phase 1 were assessed using a nurse-led triage model with blood samples being analysed in a centralized hospital laboratory. Phase 2 patients were assessed by a consultant-supported rapid assessment model with blood tests being analysed using point of care testing. The time from patient arrival in the emergency department to the time that care was complete and the patient was ready to move on to the next destination of care was recorded. These times from the two phases were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. A total of 11 213 patients attended the emergency department during the whole study period, of whom 4622 patients were eligible for the study. Phase 1 contained 3835 patients and phase 2 had 787 patients. The median time for patients to be declared ready to leave the emergency department in phase 1 was 129 minutes compared to 76 minutes for phase 2 (P=0.0025). This was a reduction in the median of 53 minutes or 41.1% (95% confidence interval 39.7-42.3%).

The Best Practice Tariff for 2010-11 included six targets: (1) surgery within 36 hours, (2) admission under consultant-led joint orthopaedic-geriatric care, (3) admission using a multidisciplinary assessment protocol, (4) review by a geriatrician within 72 hours, (5) geriatrician-directed multi-professional rehabilitation, and (6) assessment for falls and bone protection. The authors chose to audit their Trust's compliance with these targets. A retrospective audit was conducted in 2011 at the authors' university-affiliated tertiary care hospital, which is a regional major trauma centre. Only patients 65 years or older, with fragility-type neck of femur fractures who were treated surgically at the authors' unit and were eligible for geriatric review and multiprofessional rehabilitation, were included. The results of this audit (2010-11 Best Practice Tariff targets) were analysed and a series of procedural and logistical measures were introduced. A re-audit was performed in April 2012 for 2011-12, and the results for the 2 years were compared using appropriate statistics (Chi square tests and analysis of variance). Thirty-day mortality was compared using the summary hospital-level mortality indicator. A total of 410 patients were eligible for Best Practice Tariff in 2010-11, which increased to 463 in 2011-12. The changes from the first year's audit helped increase the rates for 36-hour surgery from 48.3% to 73.4% and for 72-hour geriatric review from 68.8% to 81.8% (P&lt;0.05). The annual Best Practice Tariff achievement increased from 31.7% to 61.3% (P&lt;0.05). The summary hospital-level mortality indicator declined from 96.5 to 61.3.

Patients managed via the care pathway had significantly more investigations and preoperative interventions, had subsequently had a reduced length of hospital stay (a mean average of 13 compared to 17 days).

This article explains how some of the proposed changes will affect you.","2550":"Even in the modern era documentation of raised jugular venous pressure enhances the evaluation of suspected cardiac failure, as shown by a prospective study of 721 adults of mean age 70.7 years in whom an elevated jugular venous pressure contributed 12 points towards the score of &gt;54 needed to generate a &gt;70% probability of heart failure (Kelder et al, 2011). The combination of three items from the clinical history plus six (including jugular venous pressure elevation) from the physical examination showed independent diagnostic value (c-statistic 0.83), which increased to a c-statistic of 0.86 with the addition of natriuretic peptide measurement to the diagnostic armamentarium.","2551":"This year marks the hundredth anniversary of the death, on 12 February 1912, of the Norwegian leprologist, Gerhard Hansen, who was the first to describe the Mycobacterium leprae (Hansen's bacillus). It was, in fact, only the second specific disease-causing organism to be discovered, the first being the bacillus of anthrax.","2552":"A Vascath dialysis line was inserted under direct ultrasound guidance into the left internal jugular vein for plasmapharesis to treat a 60-year-old woman admitted with a myasthenic crisis secondary to sepsis. A chest X-ray was arranged to check the position of the line and look for any complications, which revealed the presence of a left superior vena cava. Because of the uncertainty of the drainage of this vein a right-sided catheter was then inserted. The repeat chest X-ray (Figure 1) shows both lines, and the two vena cava.","2553":"A 31-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of a spontaneously occurring soft tissue mass on the palmar aspect of his left non dominant thumb. Over 5 months he was having progressive difficulty flexing at the interphalangeal joint. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated an heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass likely to be either a peripheral fibromatosis or giant cell tumour of the flexor tendon (Figure 1). Intraoperatively a large neuroma in continuity with the ulnar digital nerve was found and debulked (Figure 2). The diagnosis was confirmed histologically.","2554":"Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare distinctive soft tissue neoplasm with a predilection for the distal parts of the extremities. While epithelioid sarcoma presenting as median nerve palsy or carpal tunnel syndrome has been described, epithelioid sarcoma presenting as cystic lung metastases has not been reported. This article reports a case of a man who presented with spontaneous recurrent pneumothoraces and was found to have bilateral cystic lung disease, which was ultimately diagnosed as epithelioid sarcoma with cystic lung metastases. He underwent left arm amputation, chemotherapy and radiation, but succumbed to his advanced disease.","2555":"Parathyroid cysts are rare causes of neck swelling accounting for 0.6% of thyroid and parathyroid lesions. They may be functional, resulting in the release of parathyroid hormone, or non-functional. Non-functional cysts may be cosmetically unacceptable or cause dysphagia, dyspnoea or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy as a result of compression. This article presents a young woman who was diagnosed with a thyroid cyst both on examination and imaging. However, the final histology confirmed this to be parathyroid in origin and this should be considered in the differential of such neck swellings.","2556":"Atorvastatin and warfarin are commonly prescribed in combination. Acute rhabdomyolysis is a rare but recognized side effect of atorvastatin occurring within a few weeks of initiation. This article presents a case of a 69-year-old man, on stable atorvastatin therapy, who developed acute rhabdomyolysis following initiation of warfarin. Rising international normalized ratio is a well-recognized feature of interaction between warfarin and various statins (fluvastatin, lovastatin and simva-statin). There has only been one previous similar case of acute rhabdomyolysis following the commencement of warfarin, reported in a patient on stable simvastatin therapy. To the authors' knowledge, no similar case has been reported with atorvastatin.","2557":"The development of the face and the upper lip occurs during the fifth to ninth week of pregnancy. A cleft is a separation or split in either the upper lip or palate and sometimes both. Cleft lip and palate can occur on its own (nonsyndromic) or is sometimes part of a wider series of birth defects (syndromic).","2558":"Prostate cancer is diagnosed in 37 000 new patients a year, and causes 10 000 deaths each year in the UK (Cancer Research UK, 2011). Diagnoses are increasingly the result of screening using measurement of prostate- specific antigen levels. The natural history of early disease is unclear. Autopsy studies before prostate-specific antigen screening showed an actual latent prevalence (not diagnosed during life) of around 30% at the age of 50 years and 75% at the age of 80 years, and many of these demonstrated local invasion (Franks, 1954). One of the main current challenges in urology is distinguishing indolent prostate cancers from potentially lethal ones. The specificity of the prostate-specific antigen test for clinically significant disease remains disappointingly low and population screening is not encouraged (Ilic et al, 2011). However, prostate-specific antigen testing is often done in good faith, but pre-test counselling is essential. Thus, prostate-specific antigen testing should only be undertaken by the patient's GP or on the advice of a urologist.","2559":"In the field of sports injury, musculoskeletal injuries require prompt treatment to allow a quick return to the pre-injury level of function. Ideally, any given treatment should, among other factors, be minimally invasive and highly effective, with minimal side effects. One emerging strategy to accelerate tissue healing is the use of platelet rich plasma. Platelet-rich plasma has been used in clinical practice since the 1980s, in dentistry, maxillofacial surgery and dermatology (Margolis et al, 2001). The treatment developed because platelet-rich plasma is seen as a preparation of growth factors which facilitate rapid healing of damaged tissue. There have been wide variations in agreeing a definition of platelet-rich plasma.","2560":"Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss is a medical emergency that continues to be poorly understood despite being recognized in the literature since 1944 (De Kleyn, 1944). A commonly used criterion to qualify for this diagnosis is a sensorineural hearing loss over three contiguous pure-tone frequencies of 30 dB or more that develops within 72 hours. The vast majority of cases are unilateral and the estimated annual incidence is 20 per 100 000 persons (Nosrati-Zarenoe et al, 2007). A cause for the hearing loss is only identified in up to 10% of cases but 50% of patients will improve spontaneously (Penido et al, 2009).","2561":"Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious and potentially fatal complication of both acute and chronic liver disease, arising as a result of hepatocellular failure, cirrhosis and\/or portal-systemic shunting (Ferenci et al, 2002). It reflects a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, encompassing a range of defects in psychomotor, locomotive, cognitive, emotional and behavioural functions (Prakash and Mullen, 2010). Hepatic encephalopathy is either overt or minimal. While overt hepatic encephalopathy can be diagnosed using bedside clinical tests, minimal hepatic encephalopathy is clinically invisible and requires psychometric testing to diagnose. The rising prevalence of end-stage viral hepatitis-related liver disease, coupled with the growing problem of alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, has significantly increased the burden of disease from cirrhosis (Mooney et al, 2007; Fleming et al, 2008), so recognition and appropriate management of the manifestations of decompensating cirrhosis (including hepatic encephalopathy) is essential. Hepatic encephalopathy has a substantial societal burden because of its impact on survival, quality of life and daily functioning, including an impaired ability to drive, leaving patients especially vulnerable to road traffic accidents (Ferenci et al, 2002; Prakash and Mullen, 2010).","2562":"The increasing popularity of mass participation endurance events necessitates that on-site medical teams be well versed in the management of both common and life-threatening conditions. Exertional heat stroke is one such condition, which if left untreated can be fatal.","2563":"The transparency of surgical outcomes data and the drive for quality has been highlighted since the public inquiry, led by Professor Ian Kennedy, into children's heart surgery at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. This was formalized in Lord Darzi's 2008 report High Quality Care for All, that proposed the NHS should: 'systematically measure and publish information about the quality of care'. Subsequently the NHS White paper, Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS (Department of Health, 2010), set out the ambitions and aims of the NHS and in particular that it should provide: '...a service that offers care that is safe and of the highest quality.'","2564":"Rhabdomyolysis is the destruction of a significant amount of striated muscle, leading to disruptions in fluid balance, electrolytes and renal function. It may have either traumatic (such as crush injury) or non-traumatic causes. Diagnosis is typically made through the timely determination of the serum creatine kinase activity in a patient with a suggestive history or clinical features. Treatment is supportive, with generous intravenous hydration and correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Sometimes haemofiltration or dialysis is required, but the renal prognosis is generally good.","2565":"Kawasaki disease was initially described by a Japanese paediatrician, Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki, in 1967. He reported an acute mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome affecting the skin, mucosa and lymph nodes. This initial description has since been expanded and is now recognized as Kawasaki disease, an acute systemic selflimiting vasculitis complicated by coronary arterial aneurysms, and even myocardial infarction in some patients (Shulman et al, 1995; Kato et al, 1996; Brogan et al, 2002).","2566":"A career as a clinical academic combines the immense rewards of being a clinician with the potential to make groundbreaking discoveries which can deepen our understanding of disease, develop new therapies and impact upon national and international health-care policy through research.

It affects both children and adults, and women more frequently than men. Dermatomyositis is the commonest inflammatory myopathy in all age groups, with an estimated prevalence of 0.6-1.0 per 100 000 (Dalakas and Hohlfeld, 2003).

He had evidence of myeloma on bone marrow biopsy suggesting AL amyloid, the commonest type of systemic amyloidosis, as the underlying cause. He had no other myeloma-related organ damage. However, endocardial biopsy revealed amyloid fibrils composed of transthyretin and genetic typing established heterozygozity for the valine to isoleucine mutation at position 122 (Val122Ile). The diagnosis was therefore hereditary systemic amyloidosis as a result of a genetic transthyretin variant (ATTR) causing cardiac amyloidosis and coexistent asymptomatic myeloma. This requires symptomatic treatment of heart failure only.  This article discusses a rare cause of heart failure and uses this case to illustrate that histological confirmation of the amyloid-causing protein is essential. Mistaken assumption of AL amyloid could have resulted in inappropriate cytotoxic therapy targeting the plasma cell clone.","2643":"Schizophrenia is known to increase morbidity and mortality.

Finally, the prognosis is discussed; vital when counselling newly diagnosed patients.","2649":"In pregnancy the liver can be affected by diseases specific to pregnancy as well as unrelated conditions. The possible effect of the disease and its management on both the fetus and mother must be considered. Several physiological changes occur during pregnancy as liver metabolism is altered. Serum protein concentrations fall, with a decrease in serum albumin in part the result of the dilutional effect of an increase in plasma volume. Alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels decrease (Table 1), complicating the diagnosis of disorders involving subtle changes in liver function. Alkaline phosphatase is also produced by the placenta, making this an unreliable marker of liver dysfunction in pregnancy.","2650":"Splenomegaly is a common finding on clinical examination, and frequently features in postgraduate assessments. The spleen does not normally descend below the left costal margin. The routine abdominal examination will identify whether the spleen is palpable, and if so splenomegaly is almost universally present. This is generally pathological and warrants investigation.","2651":"Acute cutaneous wounds following trauma are commonly encountered in the emergency department.

However, its use for maintenance of anaesthesia in children has been questioned because of the risk of emergence delirium.   Emergence delirium is defined by Sikich and Lerman (2004) as a disturbance in awareness of, and attention to, the environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behaviour in the immediate post-anaesthesia period. Its incidence is between 10 and 80% following general anaesthesia, and it has the potential to cause injury to the child or care provider, may cause intravenous lines or drains to become dislodged, often requires additional nursing support and delays recovery time (Vlajkovic and Sindjelic, 2007).","2674":"You have worked hard to get to where you are today, so it would be foolish to risk it all by not ensuring your income and your assets are protected.

This adopted a new and convenient method of describing pathology according to the organs involved rather than according to symptoms, as Giovanni Morgagni (1682-1771) of Padua had adopted in his De Sedibus et Causis Morborum (On the sites and causes of disease). This, published in 1760, was rightly regarded as the first textbook which correlated symptoms in life with the appearance of the viscera at autopsy.","2676":"Paragangliomas can be confused with adrenal incidentalomas because of their proximity to the adrenal glands.

The falls were not associated with loss of consciousness, and the history suggested gait and balance problems leading to falls. A 12-lead electrocardiogram, as shown in Figure 1, had the appearance of torsades de pointes. However, the patient was cardiologically asymptomatic, and the electrocardiogram appearance was thought to be caused by a Parkinson's disease-associated artefact.","2678":"This article discusses an elderly woman presenting with haematemesis and chest pain who underwent urgent oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy. This revealed a large dissecting intramural oesophageal haematoma, initially mistaken for a varix. This is a rare cause of haematemesis and chest pain but has characteristic endoscopic findings. It is a benign condition that may be managed conservatively and both clinicians and endoscopists should be aware of its classical presentation. Misdiagnosis of the chest pain as cardiac ischaemia may have an adverse outcome if antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy is commenced. Follow up endoscopy a week later showed complete resolution of the lesion leaving a linear mucosal defect.","2679":"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare neurodegenerative disease in which there is an abnormal accumulation of prion protein. It occurs with an incidence of approximately 1 per million per year. Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease occurs in approximately 85% of cases, with familial, variant and iatrogenic forms less common. Typically sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presents with a rapidly progressive dementia, but sub-variants include the Heidenhain and Oppenheimer-Brownell variants.

Interventional radiology allows imaging (fluoroscopy, computed tomography and ultrasound) to guide the manipulation of instruments placed through blood vessels or percutaneously in order to carry out treatment. Because it does not require major incisions it allows the treatment of patients who may not be fit for open surgery. Many exciting innovations and advances are making interventional radiology an increasingly attractive career.","2795":"The first recorded thyroid operation is credited to Albucacis in Spain in around the year 1000. About 170 years later, Frugardi attempted to induce atrophy of a goitre by transfixing it with shoelaces. From this surgical technique evolved slowly via methods including mass ligatures, chemical cautery, morcellation and injection of turpentine, to the more familiar concepts of modern thyroidectomy (Hegner, 1932; Dionigi et al, 2008). Today, surgeons continue to refine the technique via new equipment such as Harmonic scalpels and nerve monitors, and novel techniques such as minimally-invasive and non-cervical approaches (e.g. via the axilla or the mouth).","2796":"Diseases of the upper gastrointestinal system are very common in the modern word with an increasing frequency over recent years. Clinical symptoms are rather non-specific and may be the result of simple gastro-oesophageal reflux or an advanced malignant process. Historically, the investigation of upper gastrointestinal complaints was based on plain radiography and contrast studies. Now, a flexible oesophagogastroduodeno-scopy has become the primary imaging modality in patients with upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Dynamic contrast studies and cross-sectional imaging remain the main diagnostic tests in certain pathological conditions and provide an additional and complementary information to endoscopy results.","2797":"Acute tendon injuries to the hand are common. In the UK, there are approximately 12000 inpatient admissions annually for injuries to the tendons and muscles of the hand and wrist (Dew, 2009).

A prevalence rate as high as 15-30% has been reported among patients admitted to acute and intensive care units (Hoorn et al, 2004; Jaber et al, 2006). Evidence suggests an increase in mortality associated with even a mild degree of hyponatraemia (Waikar et al, 2009). Besides its significance as a potential cause of morbidity and mortality, hyponatraemia could also serve as a useful indicator for undiagnosed underlying pathology such as endocrine disorders or malignancy. A systematic approach towards the clinical assessment and interpretation of biochemical abnormalities is vital to facilitate the diagnosis and management of hyponatraemia. The optimal treatment of hyponatraemia should take into account its severity, duration and mode of clinical presentation. Overzealous correction could result in irreversible neurological complications.","2830":"Junior doctors rotate through different specialities as part of their foundation and early speciality training. One responsibility commonly shared by all specialities at all levels is that of making and receiving referrals. According to the General Medical Council's Good Medical Practice, a referral is defined as: 'transferring some or all of the responsibility for the patient's care, usually temporarily and for a particular purpose, such as additional investigation, care or treatment that is outside your competence' (General Medical Council, 2009). Evolving patient needs may necessitate the handing over of care to a different speciality or hospital which is more suited to deal with the problems at hand.

Breast cancer is increasing in frequency and the incidence has increased approximately 25% over the last decade. This is in part a result of breast screening which is available to all women between the ages of 50 and 70 years in the UK. The lifetime risk of breast cancer in the UK is now approaching one in eight. Although there have been significant advances in the systemic therapy of breast cancer, surgery remains the mainstay of treatment.","3100":"Approximately 25 000 patients die each year in the UK following 1.3 million surgical procedures (Pearse et al, 2006). More than 80% of these perioperative deaths occur in patients who are at significantly high risk for surgery (12.5%) (Pearse et al, 2006). This population tends to be older, have multiple co-morbidities and have undergone major surgery. Notably, 50% were never admitted to a general intensive care unit postoperatively (Campling et al, 1993). Approximately 75% of patients who suffer perioperative death have cardiovascular disease, so it is important to try and identify these patients preoperatively (Mangano, 1990; National Confidential Enquiry into Perioperative Deaths, 2002).","3101":"Cell salvage, the process whereby blood is suctioned from the surgical site then filtered, centrifuged and washed before being transfused, was first developed in 1974. Since then it has become a widely used technique which reduces the need for allogenic blood transfusion. Cell salvage was initially considered to be contraindicated in obstetrics, because of the risk of amniotic fluid emboli, in potentially 'dirty' surgical sites and in oncological surgery because of concerns about re-transfusion of malignant cells. However, cell salvage is now routinely used in obstetrics, particularly in massive haemorrhage, and in elective bowel resection. The potential use of cell salvage in oncological surgery has been highlighted following the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, 2008) guidance sanctioning (although not specifically recommending) cell salvage during radical prostatectomy and cystectomy. This leads to the question of whether cell salvage is safe to use in these and other types of oncological surgery.","3102":"Boerhaave's syndrome, first described in 1724, is a spontaneous transmural perforation of the oesophagus, typically caused by forced emesis.

Most people, even those in the health professions, think of her as 'The Lady with the Lamp'; the heroine of the Crimean War, who tended the sick and wounded soldiers at Scutari. Important though this was, her main contribution, which continued long after Crimea, was in the organization of nursing training, in hospital planning, public and military health, and in effective collection of medical statistics.","3105":"Workplace-based learning has been at the heart of medical education and training for centuries.

However, patients may live for some years with significant symptoms and resultant reduced quality of life. Good supportive care and access to specialist palliative care is important for optimum care for patients living and dying from heart failure.","3114":"This month's journal contains a symposium on palliative medicine without any sections relating directly to cancer. This may be surprising for those who still understand palliative medicine as an oncological offshoot. The need for the adoption of the palliative care approach beyond the confines of oncology has long been recognized. Four years before the opening of the first modern hospice at St Christopher's in Sydenham, John Hinton (1963) demonstrated that the morbidity of patients with non-malignant conditions was as great or greater than those with cancer (National Council for Palliative Care, 2007).","3115":"With an ageing UK population people are living longer and enjoying longer periods of retirement. The number of people over the age of 65 years in the UK is projected rise to 20% by 2051 (Office of National Statistics, 2004). The fastest growing section of the population is those aged over 85 years - this sector is projected to reach 3.2 million in the UK by 2033. These figures also reflect trends seen across European countries. The 2008-based national population projections, EuroPop2008, predicted an increase to 30% of people aged 65 years and over by 2060 (Eurostat, 2008).

Peritoneal dialysis and renal transplantation are two forms of renal replacement therapy that are outside the remit of this article. This review focuses upon the third group which are blood-based and involve direct treatment of a patient's blood in a closed, extracorporeal circuit. They provide renal replacement for end-stage renal failure and during periods of severe acute kidney injury, and also for non-renal indications such as the management of drug overdoses. Blood-based renal replacement therapies are often loosely referred to as 'haemodialysis', although this is only one of a range of treatments. This article outlines the theory and practical applications of these treatments.","3118":"The 'can't intubate, can't ventilate' scenario is a nightmare for all clinicians who manage airways. Cricothyroidotomy is one of several emergency airway management techniques. Cricothyroidotomy is a short-term solution which provides oxygenation, not ventilation, and is not a definitive airway. Although there are tests which can help predict whether an intubation will be difficult, they are not always good predictors. As the can't intubate, can't ventilate scenario is rare, cricothyroidotomy is an unfamiliar procedure to many. In this situation, expert help must be called for early on. In the meantime, it is vital that all other simple airway manoeuvres have been attempted, such as good positioning of the patient with head tilt and chin lift, and use of airway adjuncts like the oral (Guedel) airway or nasopharyngeal airway, and the laryngeal mask airway. However, if attempts to secure the airway are unsuccessful, there may be no other option than to perform a cricothyroidotomy. It is a difficult decision to make, but with increasing hypoxia, it is essential that one oxygenates the patient. Cricothyroidotomy provides an opening in the pace between the anterior inferior border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior superior border of the cricoid cartilage, allowing access to the airway below the glottis. The anatomical considerations are important when performing this procedure (Ellis, 2009), and there are other scenarios when it is used. It is not without consequence, as with any procedure.","3119":"Transabdominal ultrasound is increasingly chosen as the initial imaging technique in the radiological work-up of bowel abnormalities in adults because ultrasound can provide substantial information about gastrointestinal disorders. In the presence of pathological changes in the intestine, sonographic findings, such as thickening of the bowel wall, changes in the perienteric fat and vascularity, have recognizable and reproducible appearances (Kuzmich et al, 2009). Although the diagnostic quality of ultrasound can be compromised by bowel gas and obesity, ultrasound has a number of strengths, including its ability to allow real-time correlation between the sonographic findings and the area of maximum tenderness combined with excellent spatial resolution, wide availability, lack of radiation and its non-invasive nature. This article illustrates the key sonographic features of commonly encountered bowel disorders in adults and highlights ultrasound techniques that may assist in diagnosis.","3120":"The carpal bones are deeply convex anteriorly. This bony gutter is converted by the flexor retinaculum into a tube - the carpal tunnel, which conveys the median nerve, together with the long flexor tendons of the fingers and thumb, into the hand.
